    "title": "The Language of Nature",
    "description": "According to realists, science discovers objective, mind-independent truths. To say that a proposition is true is to say that it corresponds to the world. Propositions are constructed from concepts, so for a proposition to correspond to the world, it seems that the world itself must somehow have a conceptual structure built into it. There must be a \"language of nature\" for the language of our theories to match.

    "description": "One of the primary motivations for moral antirealism is that if there were moral facts, they would have metaphysically and epistemologically puzzling features: in particular, moral facts, if they existed, would be categorically normative. An important objection to moral antirealism is that epistemic norms seem to have the same objectionable features as moral norms. Epistemic norms and moral norms are \"companions in guilt\". Hence, the moral antirealist is committed to an implausible epistemic antirealism.

    "description": "A serious threat to scientific realism arises from the fact that almost all scientific models involve idealizations: ideal gases, point masses, infinite populations, etc. Science is successful partially because scientists routinely appeal to assumptions that they know to be false. This suggests that the realist inference from the success of a theory to its truth is illegitimate. This video presents the idealization problem for scientific realism, and then examines three ways realists might respond: (1) eliminating idealizations; (2) quarantining idealizations; and (3) realism about idealizations. We will see that all of these solutions raise difficulties of their own.",

The commonsense view is that aesthetic judgements are incidental to scientific research: it's nice if a theory is beautiful, but scientists should judge theories only based on the evidence. Beauty should not be a factor in theory choice. Yet this view is rejected by many scientists; for example, the physicist Paul Dirac once claimed that \"it is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\" What could justify this claim? This video explores different views about beauty in science.\n\n4:09 - What makes a theory beautiful?\n10:34 - Two views about beauty: Pythagoreanism and subjectivism\n18:15 - Pseudo-aesthetic vocabulary\n23:40 - Beauty as a tool\n27:55 - Beauty as a tie-breaker\n31:23 - Beauty and the Duhem-Quine thesis\n37:31 - McAllister's aesthetic induction\n48:45 - Beauty and understanding",

Essentially, the regress is that in order to know that an experiment is giving us correct results, we need to know that we are using a reliable detector; but a reliable detector is just a detector that gives correct results, so we only know that our detector is reliable if we know that it's giving the correct results. We have a regress.",

    "description": "It is frequently the case that people who are my epistemic peers - i.e. people who are just as intelligent, well-informed, and unbiased as I am - disagree with my beliefs. A number of philosophers have argued that such peer disagreement should lead me to give up these beliefs, to suspend judgement on the issues in question. This video examines three arguments for this view.",

I also recommend \"Representing and Intervening\" by Ian Hacking. This was written in 1983, so it's somewhat dated now, but it's worth reading because it emphasizes that philosophers of science need to attend to the details experimentation and scientific practice. Most philosophy of science until recently was focused on theory and other more \"abstract\" matters; Hacking provides an interesting alternative approach.",

So, there are probably equally good alternatives to currently accepted theories that modern scientists fail to conceive of. Hence we should not believe that currently accepted theories are true.",

For instance, there is a physical theory that doesn't postulate electrons but that is just as compatible with the evidence as the theory we accept. So, we should not believe in the truth of currently accepted theories.\n\nThis video explains the underdetermination argument in detail and then examines various problems for it, including non-empirical virtues, confirmation holism, and the theory-ladenness of observation.",

However, the primitivist holds that colours are irreducible. They exist \"over and above\" physical properties such as wavelength and spectral reflectance.\n\nThe video outlines colour primitivism and then examines two objections: (1) the \"downward causation\" argument that views such as primitivism cannot account for the causal powers of colours; (2) the argument that primitivism faces a skeptical problem. Further objections will be dealt with in the next video.",

    "description": "I outline the foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, a research programme pioneered by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby that makes five core claims:\n\n(1) Evolutionary theory should be given a central place in psychology, just like it has in biology.\n(2) Massive modularity: the mind is not composed of \"general-purposes\" mechanisms, such as a general-purpose reasoning mechanism or a general-purpose learning mechanism, but instead consists of hundreds or thousands of highly specialized modules that provide us with innate knowledge of and innate abilities in various domains.\n(3) Most of these modules evolved during our time in Pleistocene hunter-gatherer societies.\n(4) These modules are universal to all human populations. They constitute an invariant human nature.\n(5) If we accept the above points, the standard methodology of psychological research will have to be altered.",

    "title": "Philosophy of Mathematics: Platonism",
    "description": "A non-technical introduction to platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nPhilosophy of mathematics is important, especially for philosophers interested in metaphysics. Suppose, for instance, you have nominalist tendencies, and you argue against the existence of abstract objects. Well, probably the most important kind of abstract objects are found in mathematics. Any serious nominalist needs to give an account of them.\n\nYet philosophy of mathematics is also, for obvious reasons, quite technical, and it can be pretty daunting for those who have less mathematical training. Nevertheless, I think the basic arguments can be made accessible to anyone who's interested, and that's what I've tried to do in this video.\n\nFor further reading on phil of mathematics, I recommend: \"Thinking About Mathematics\" by Stewart Shapiro and \"Introducing Philosophy of Mathematics\" by Michele Friend. These are both fairly orthodox introductions. For an introduction that focuses more on contemporary issues (it has just a few pages devoted to formalism, logicism, and intuitionism, yet a whole chapter on paraconsistent mathematics), I recommend \"An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mathematics\" by Mark Colyvan.\n\nThere is some debate about how exactly to formulate the Quine-Putnam Indispensability Argument. In this video, I've followed Colyvan (see his aforementioned \"Introduction\").\n\nRe 43:26: I'm not sure why I said that. Obviously, Von Neumann did not hold the absurd belief that every ordinal *is* the ordinal before it; rather he believed that every ordinal is *the set of* all ordinals before it.\n\nRe 1:01:18: I should have noted at this point that in her book \"Realism in Mathematics\", Maddy spends quite a bit of time answering objection (1).\n\nPlenitudinous platonism is also known by the name \"full-blooded platonism\". Mark Balaguer's exposition of it can be found in \"Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics\". This book is also the source of the third objection to Maddy's views, about the difficulties of avoiding the aggregate theory of sets. The objection is explained in somewhat more detail there.\n\nI said that I consider PP the most interesting form of platonism. This is not quite true. In my opinion, PP is not plenitudinous enough. The problem is that it allows only *consistent* theories. Those of us who are friends of paraconsistency will consider this an unwelcome restriction. Beall presents a more liberal form of PP in this short paper: http://homepages.uconn.edu/~jcb02005/papers/fbplatonism.pdf",

    "description": "This series is a basic introduction to Russell's theory of descriptions. In this video, we examine two important theories that preceded and inspired Russell's: those of Gottlob Frege and Alexius Meinong.\n\nSome notes to the video:\n\nI've briefly noted some of Russell's criticisms of Frege's and Meinong's theories. There are, of course, plenty of other criticisms; you can find more detailed criticisms of Frege in any good introduction to philosophy of language. Meinong doesn't get so much coverage, perhaps largely because his theory has, for most of the last century, been almost universally rejected and regarded as untenable. This attitude is unfair in my opinion, and is arguably based on misunderstanding. Thus Lycan in his \"Philosophy of Language\" writes:\n\n\"Alexius Meinong insist[s] ... that any possible object of thought - even a self-contradictory one - has being of a sort even though only a few such things are so lucky as to exist in reality as well.\"\n\nKenneth Taylor, in \"Truth and Meaning\": \"... there do not exist any non-existent objects, but there do, [Meinong] insists, subsist such objects. ... It is of subsistent objects that we speak when we say truly that the golden mountain does not exist.\"\n\nAlex Miller, in \"Philosophy of Language\": \"The King of France, even though he doesn't exist, nevertheless subsists.\"\n\nThese quotes describe Russell's earlier theory, not Meinong's theory! It is unfortunate that what are otherwise very fine introductions to philosophy of language are marred by blatant misrepresentations of the views of an important figure. On the other hand, I suppose they can be commended for bothering to attempt to explain Meinong's views (even if only in the space of a few lines), which can't be said of all such introductions (e.g. Devitt & Sterelny's).\n\nI don't know of any introductory book to philosophy of language that explores Meinong's theory. See instead: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meinong/#ObjTheOntBeyBeiNonBei or more generally: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/ .",

    "description": "This video introduces three distinctions of great importance in philosophy: necessary/contingent; analytic/synthetic; a priori/a posteriori. My goal here was simply to introduce the distinctions, so I've kept this very brief and nontechnical, and I don't examine in any great detail the arguments I present. You could devote hours to exploring just one of these distinctions, and you'd still have to skip important information.\n\n13:10 - It may be thought that you could give a modern answer along similar lines by using evolution. So: humans are evolved creatures, and our minds have been shaped by evolution to know certain basic truths about the world. The problem here is that evolution is geared to survival and practicality, not truth. Evolution would dispose us to beliefs that help us survive and that help us navigate the world; there is no reason to suppose that these beliefs are true. Indeed, there is much evidence that many of our commonsense beliefs that may be useful to our everyday concerns are simply false; see the literature on folk physics.\n\n16:20 - Note that this belief might be wrong. There are some experiments that suggest that, under certain special conditions, people can perceive a surface as being wholly coloured with two colours at the same time. Google 'impossible colours'. One such experiment is very simple: simply take, e.g., a blue square and a yellow square, then cross your eyes so the two squares overlap each other. I've tried this myself, and unfortunately I didn't see an 'impossible colour'. Rather, the surface seemed simply to flip back and forth between blue and yellow.\n\nAnyway, if it's true that people can perceive impossible colours, then 'if x is blue all over, then x is not red all over' would indeed be synthetic... but also a posteriori, and false.\n\n22:14 - The point here can be seen if we consider the distinction between de dicto and de re statements, which I explain in this video at 9:30 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLWjJVvQjZ8\n\nInterpreted de re, 'the inventor of the zip invented the zip' is contingent - but a posteriori. De dicto, it's necessary, and a priori. Since the name 'Julius' abbreviates 'the inventor of the zip', 'Julius invented the zip' should be interpreted exactly as is 'the inventor of the zip invented the zip'. So we may apply precisely the same analysis here: read de re, it's contingent a posteriori; read de dicto, it's necessary a priori. But of course, all this ignores that troublesome thicket of rigid designation...",

It has been held, for example, that identity statements such as \"Robert Zimmerman = Bob Dylan\" are necessary, not contingent. The very distinction between analytic and synthetic statements has been challenged. Some empiricist philosophers (Mill is the most famous example) have held that even logical truths such as A=A (Robert Zimmerman = Robert Zimmerman) are contingent, a posteriori, synthetic. Etc.\n\nWhat's clear, though, is that there is some prima facie difference in meaning between (3) and (4), and it's difficult for the commonsense view of singular terms to account for this difference.",

I discuss the Hilbert Hotel thought experiment, some very basic set theory, one-to-one correspondence, and Cantor's Diagonal Argument.\n\nI mention a couple times in the video, e.g. at 9:02, that we can take things away from infinity, and still have infinity.  This is true, unless to take infinity from infinity.  Infinity minus infinity is undefined.  It's easy to see why.  Consider the hotel again.  Suppose it's full, and now consider what happens when: (1) everybody in the even-numbered rooms leave, but everybody in the odd-numbered rooms stay; (2) everybody but those in the first million rooms leave; (3) everybody but the person in the first room leaves.  In each of these cases, an infinite number of people have left, but how many remain?  In the first case, infinity -- infinity = infinity.  In the second, infinity -- infinity = one million.  In the third, infinity -- infinity = one.\n\nRe the points around 27:30: the hypothesis that the cardinality of the reals is aleph-one (that is, that there is no infinity in between the naturals or the reals) is known as the \"continuum hypothesis\".  It has been shown that, on the axioms of standard set theory, it's impossible for the continuum hypothesis to be either proved or disproved.  It's completely independent of the standard axioms.",

In this video, I explain what this means and why it lead to skepticism about modal logic.\n\nAt around 4:20, I suggest picking up an intro to phil of language for more info on the extensions of sentences.  A good intro is Morris's \"An Introduction to the Philosophy of Language\"; chapter 2 deals with Frege's account.  Morris's book also provides, in chapter 6, an overview of the issues we'll be discussing in this series.\n\nRegarding my comment at 13:18 that violations of extensionality are okay in the case of beliefs: in fact, Quine wasn't happy with these, either.  Some of Quine's work on propositional attitudes (propositional attitudes are a kind of mental state, which we express using a verb followed by a \"that\": \"Frank believes that...\", \"Frank hopes that...\", \"Frank desires that...\" and so on) is very similar to his work on modality.  See, for example, his paper \"Quantifiers and Propositional Attitudes\".  An accessible introduction to his views on propositional attitudes can be found in the Morris book, chapter 7.\n\n(More generally, Quine's approach to mental entities is often considered an early precursor to the radical eliminativisms of Dennett, Stich, the Churchlands, et al.)\n\nThe point is just that violation of extensionality seems to be more acceptable for beliefs, which we all expect to be messy, than for a completed, naturalistic theory of the world, which we expect to be \"pure\" and well-defined and so on.",

    "description": "It's not worth considering dialetheism unless we can point to a few things that might be considered true contradictions.  The most obvious candidates are the paradoxes.  In this video, I examine the most famous and most tenacious of the paradoxes, the Liar paradox.  I explore different kinds of Liar, and outline the responses given by Kripke, Tarski, and Prior.\n\nFurther reading on the Liar:\n\nHaack's \"Philosophy of Logic\", chapter 8\nKirkham's \"Theories of Truth\", chapter 9\nRead's \"Thinking About Logic\", chapter 6\nSainsbury's \"Paradoxes\", chapter 6 (this book provides, as the title suggests, a good and accessible introduction to a whole bunch of paradoxes)\n\nPriest's work can be found in chapter 1 of \"In Contradiction\" and part 3 of \"Beyond the Limits of Thought\".\n\nThe point of this video is just to demonstrate how obstinate the Liar is: there's unlikely to be a solution that will preserve all our intuitions.",
