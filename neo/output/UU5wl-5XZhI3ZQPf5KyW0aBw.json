Many of the stories have a beautifully illustrated full-color painting that will capture the imaginations of your children. It is a serious examination of biblical faith set against the so-called “faith movement” so popular today, but much of it reads like a storybook the children will love. I read it to my grandchildren, one story at a time, and it provoked even the five-year-old to ask very serious questions. Most of the stories can be read in five to ten minutes. It will be a perfect family devotional reader. Pastors will find material for many sermons.\n\nThis is probably the most important book I have ever written. It reflects a lifetime of study. It is going to shock 99% of my readers. You are going to wonder how you ever got pulled so far astray. But as you read it, your soul will sing with joy and appreciation for God’s eternal purpose in your life.",
