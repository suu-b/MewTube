    "description": "A charmingly awkward coming-of-age story that follows a middle schooler who attempts to get her childhood best friend to like her back.\n\nStarring: Brianna Bras and Simon Val\nWriter/Director: Amanda Gordon\nCinematographer: Mia Navarro\nProducers: Ziyne Abdo and Amanda Gordon\nEditor: Gabriel Guimaraes\nScore: Cole Toto and Leo LaPlaca\nSound Design: Alex Moudgil\n\nI’m so excited to share my first sync-sound short film Crush(ed)! (Yay I can write dialogue now?!) I started this script in a writing class during spring 2020 when the pandemic hit, but couldn’t film it until spring 2021 and was still limited to a crew of 5 people (including myself and the actors), due to my school’s production guidelines. But you know what they say: confinement breeds creativity. Or something like that.\n\nWhen creating this film I set out to capture a uniquely middle school level of awkwardness and anxiety. I want people to watch through their fingers not because it's a horror movie, but because they know this moment all too well. Writing and directing this short film was a practice in making people feel. Feel weird. Feel sticky. Feel second-hand embarrassment. Feel shockwaves of cringe creeping down their spines. Like Maya Angelou said, “people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”\n\nKeep Up With What I'm Making Next:\ninstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/amandapanda767   \nfor business inquiries: amandagordon1010@gmail.com",

I specifically apply this to the sector of young female aesthetic/lifestyle/fashion/relatable vloggers and how privileges such as being skinny, white, able-bodied, having disposable income, coupled with the youtube algorithm that allows vloggers to \"blow up\" (grow very quickly) and makes their success on the platform exponential. Therefore the success of youtubers is more indicative of their luck rather than hard work. This doesn't mean they haven't worked hard at all, but their success does not have a direct correlation to how hard they have worked.\n\n\nAlso sorry for the glare of my (fake) glasses lol.\n\n~socials~\n✭ instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/amandapanda767   \n✭ twitter: https://twitter.com/amanda_gordon12 \n✭ depop: https://www.depop.com/comingofrage/\n✭ tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@amandapanda767?u_code=da09ei410d6l83&preview_pb=0&language=en&timestamp=1577661013&utm_campaign=client_share&app=musically&utm_medium=ios&user_id= 6772018427601257478&tt_from=copy&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m\n✭ for business inquiries: amandagordon1010@gmail.com\n\n\nFTC: This video is sponsored by Skillshare",

Of course I had to bring up Gossip Girl for a pop culture reference too!
