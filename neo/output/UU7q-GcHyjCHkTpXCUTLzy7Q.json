He explains why Wittgenstein rejected the notion of the mind as some mysterious inner thing which is private and hidden from view, and which somehow serves as the cause of outward behavior. On the other hand, he also explains why it cannot be identified with mere external behavior either. He goes on to discuss Wittgenstein’s view that there can be no explanation for why people go on in the same way and apply words in similar ways to new cases. For there can be no image, rule, or essence in the head which would be able to play that role and do the kind of work that one would need it to do. \n\n#philosophy #wittgenstein #philosophyofmind #language #philosophyoflanguage #historyofphilosophy",

He says the idea of \"Western civilization\" or \"Western culture\" is a mistaken one and that we should abandon it. He uncovers the history of the idea from its roots at the time of the Crusades to its modern incarnation in the second half of the 20th century. However, we have very little culturally in common with our forebears in say the England of Chaucer's time. And indeed, much of the knowledge supposedly at the heart of Western civilisation was actually transmitted via Islamic scholarship. No one, he argues, can claim exclusive ownership of culture. \n\nThis lecture was given by Kwame Anthony Appiah at New York University in 2016 as part of his Reith Lectures on Mistaken Identities. \n\n00:00 Talk \n29:45 Q&A \n\n#philosophy #politicaltheory #socialphilosophy #culturalcritique",

    "description": "Audio recording of a 2016 lecture by the philosopher and cultural theorist Kwame Anthony Appiah as part of his Reith Lectures on Mistaken Identities. He argues against a mythical, romantic view of nationhood, saying instead it should rest on a commitment to shared values. He explores the history of the idea, born in the 19th century, that there are peoples who are bound together by an ancient common spirit and that each of these nations is entitled to its own state. He says this idea is a mistaken one, illustrating his argument through the life story of the writer who took the pen name Italo Svevo - meaning literally Italian Swabian. He was born a citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and became a citizen of the new republic of Italy, all without leaving his home city of Trieste. Appiah argues that states exist as a set of shared beliefs rather than membership of some sort of mythical and ancient group. \n\nThis lecture was given by Kwame Anthony Appiah at the University of Glasgow in 2016 as part of his Reith Lectures on Mistaken Identities. \n\n00:00 Talk \n31:19 Q&A \n\n#philosophy #politicalphilosophy #politicaltheory #nationalism",

Indeed, as he explains, the view that all knowledge and science rests on observation leads to induction, which Popper famously rejected due to the so-called problem of induction, first formulated by David Hume. As such, Popper didn't think that induction played any justificatory role in science at all, which is precisely why he ended up with his famous falsificationist view that theories and hypotheses can only be refuted or falsified (i.e. via deduction), but they can never be proven true or positively supported with observational evidence (i.e. via induction). These clips all come from a 1989 interview on falsificationism and some of the main criticisms. It is a re-upload of something that I put together a while ago.

    "description": "Hylomorphism claims that some individuals, paradigmatically living things, are composed of physical materials with a form or structure that is responsible for them being and persisting as the kinds of things they are. One objection to hylomorphism claims that an account of the physical materials composing an individual is sufficient to account for everything it is and everything it does. In this talk, William Jaworski argues that the objection fails insofar as hylomorphic structure is the best (and perhaps only) thing that can explain the persistence of individuals that change their matter over time.\n\nThis talk was given by Professor William Jaworski as part of a 2018 conference at Corpus Christi College, Oxford under the title \"The View from Above: Structure, Emergence, and Causation\". \n\nIt's a common accepted assumption that reality includes the chemical, biological, and psychological, but are they anything over and above the physical? Or can they all be reduced somehow to the physical? Reductionism has been challenged by various forms of emergentism, which many philosophers still see as unsatisfactory. One alternative way to think about this issue, which has recently come to the fore in the metaphysical debates, is along the lines of Aristotle's Hylomorphism, a view that takes structure and organization to play a pivotal metaphysical role. The aim of this conference is to discuss the assumptions of Hylomorphism, and how it bears on reductionism in relation to special sciences (such as chemistry and biology) and in the philosophy of mind.\n\nRead more on Aristotle's Hylomorphism: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/form-matter/\n\n00:00 Talk \n1:01:07 Q&A \n\n#philosophy #aristotle #metaphysics #mind",

    "description": "Hannah Arendt believed that the will of the totalitarian ruler occupied the place left vacant by the absolute authority over the world attributed to God during the Middle Ages. With the collapse of the divinely ordained Kingships and the authority exercised by the Catholic church in the name of God, what would replace the authority of God in the world? How would such authority be constituted, who would act in its name, and what rules would it follow? Arendt believed that these questions missed the point. She welcomed the disappearance of absolute authority from the world in the name of the plurality of citizens whose power could now come forward. Only the power created by the collective decisions of citizens coming together to act on matters of public interest could establish a valid and just authority. Of course, this meant that there could be no return to the stability of the past. But it also meant that, as citizens, we assume responsibility ourselves for what happens in the world.\n\nThese clips come from a 1972 conference on Arendt's work at York University. \n\n#philosophy #hannaharendt #politicaltheory #totalitarianism #authority",

    "description": "Professor Raimond Gaita gives the first talk in a series on 'Prejudice, Reason and Understanding' at the Australian National University as part of the Freilich Foundation's Eminent Lecturer Series back in 2013.\n\nSome years ago, Mirko Bagaric, then Professor and Dean of Law at Deakin University in Melbourne, published in the Age an opinion piece in which he argued that we should torture people in certain circumstances if doing so would save many lives. His article provoked incredulity amongst some people: what had seemed to them to be undiscussable and which they believed had partly defined their political culture just because it was undiscussable, was again “on the agenda”. Bagaric was in his turn incredulous that people could be so lacking in respect for rational discussion as to believe that some matters were undiscussable or unthinkable, and that they could be so morally and politically irresponsible as to deem undiscussable something that could potentially save thousands of lives. In the first two lectures, Raimond Gaita tries to bring out what he takes to be most serious in the incredulity voiced by Bagaric and his critics in order to explore what it shows about political discourse that aspires to be a conversation of citizens. He will explore why the ideal that even in ethics and politics, reliable and sound cognitive achievements is best achieved in a tone-free zone, is widespread amongst philosophers, at least in the analytical tradition. He will suggest that attractive as it may be as an elaboration of how best to rise to the claims of reason, it erodes the kind of judgment and sobriety necessary to critical thought about ethics and politics and thereby impoverishes our understanding of what the distinction between legitimate illegitimate persuasion comes to in those realms. It erodes entirely, he will argue, the conditions necessary for the conversation of citizens. \n\nIn these lectures, Raimond Gaita explores an ideal of a democratic politics as ‘a conversation of citizens’. Reflection germane to the topic goes back at least to the time of Socrates. In Plato’s Gorgias, whose bitter political tone has often been noted, Socrates says to an aspiring young orator that he is good at oratory but bad a conversation. He meant, in part, that oratory betrays a trust intrinsic to real 'conversation’ that one’s partner in conversation will respect ones need to be legitimately persuaded to a belief – that she will not exploit her skills and one’s vulnerability to them, for example. For that reason, Socrates did not look upon oratory as a morally neutral skill that could serve good or bad ends. He regarded it, as many now regard spin, as rotten through and through. More often than not, belief requires trust and so an inquiry into persuasion which honors that trust, will be in part an inquiry into how to discipline trust so that it becomes the expression of good judgment rather than gullibility, for example. Reason, its limits, judgment, trust, sobriety, and realism as these show themselves in ethics and politics is the topic. \n\n00:00 Talk\n40:04 Q&A\n\n#philosophy #ethics #moralphilosophy",

    "description": "A common defense of the various and sometimes cruel ways in which human beings use the other animals is that human beings are just more important than the other animals are: what happens to human beings matters more. In this lecture, Christine Korsgaard begins by arguing that the trouble with this claim is not so much that it is false, as that it makes almost no sense at all. The difficulty rests in the fact that everything that is important must be important to someone. A defense of this claim requires nothing less than a theory of why there is such a thing as “the good” at all. She will sketch such a theory and then raise some objections to it, which will take us into an examination of the relation between having a self and having a good. Although it is not true that some creatures are “more important” than others, it is true that the fact that some creatures have less of a self means that things may be, in a general way, less important to them.\n\nThis talk was given by Christine M. Korsgaard (Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy at Harvard) at the University of Berkeley as part of the 2016 Howison Lectures in Philosophy. \n\n00:00 Talk \n56:02 Q&A \n\n#philosophy #ethics #moralphilosophy #animalethics",

    "description": "Professor Emma Borg gives the second lecture in a series on \"Reasons for Action\" as part of the 2024 Frege Lectures in theoretical philosophy at the University of Tartu. \n\nDo people generally do what they do on the basis of the reasons they have for acting? The standard philosophical answer - common-sense psychology or folk psychology - says yes. But recently the idea that humans are generally rational, reasons-responsive beings has come under considerable pressure, as a number of empirical findings (often in the fields of social, comparative, and developmental psychology) seem to suggest that, on the contrary, people are often blind to reasons, acting on gut feelings and intuitions, and are subject to various biases and other errors of reasoning. Although these empirical findings are now well-known (reaching beyond the ivory tower into the public consciousness), Emma Borg suggests that the precise problem for common-sense psychology remains unclear. There are (at least) three different arguments that could be made based on the empirical data. In her lectures, Emma Borg explains these three arguments and argues that the proponent of the common-sense view has responses to each of them. She concludes that the case against common-sense psychology can be rejected, and that we should hold on to the notion that action (of a typical adult) involves acting based on reasons. \n\nEmma Borg is Professor of Philosophy at the Institute of Philosophy, University of London. Her main research interests are the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and business ethics. Borg is the author of Minimal Semantics (2004) and Pursuing Meaning (2012), as well as two forthcoming books: A Very Short Introduction to Meaning and Acting for Reasons: In Defence of Common-Sense Psychology (all published by Oxford University Press).

    "description": "Adam Toon gives the second lecture in a series of six on the nature of the mind called \"The Story of the Mind: Cartesianism, Behaviourism and Fictionalism\". These lectures were part of the 2023 Gottlob Frege lectures in theoretical philosophy given at the University of Tartu in December of 2023.\n\nWe often talk about the mind as an inner world. Cartesianism takes such talk seriously. Once, our inner world was taken to be a strange, immaterial substance. Today, we are told it will be found in the brain. Over the years, some have tried to do without this inner world, most notably behaviourists. But their efforts have largely been in vain. These lectures propose a new approach to the mind, known as mental fictionalism. According to this approach, our concept of mind is a metaphorical one: we project the “outer world” of human culture, especially language, onto the “inner world” of the mind. This inner world is a useful fiction: it does not exist—and yet we cannot avoid talking about it. The lectures introduce this idea and explore its implications for key questions concerning the origins, boundaries, and history of the mind. The lectures are based on Adam Toon’s recent book \"Mind as Metaphor: A Defence of Mental Fictionalism\" (Oxford University Press, 2023).\n\nAdam Toon is an Associate Professor at the University of Exeter and Deputy Director of Egenis, the Centre for the Study of Life Sciences. He studied at King’s College, Cambridge and the London School of Economics. After his PhD, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Bielefeld and holder of a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship.

    "description": "Imre Lakatos's most succinct public summary of his philosophy of science is presented in this 1973 BBC radio lecture. He outlines his distinctive view of the importance of 'the demarcation problem' in the philosophy and history of science, namely the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudo-science, and of why its solution is not merely an issue of ‘armchair philosophy’, but also one of vital social and political significance, and even of life and death itself. It reviews what he saw as the inadequacies of previous attempted solutions, such as both probative and probabilist inductivism, and how his own methodology of scientific research programmes solves some of the problems posed by the history of science for those of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. He proposes that scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts – such as the return of Halley’s comet or the gravitational bending of light rays – as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by “an ocean of counterexamples”. The talk includes his novel fallibilist analysis of the development of Newton’s celestial dynamics, Lakatos’s favourite historical example of his methodology. \n\n#philosophy #epistemology #philosophyofscience #science #karlpopper",

    "description": "In this program, Hubert Dreyfus and Bryan Magee discuss the thinkers Husserl and Heidegger, as well as the movements of phenomenology and existentialism. This comes from a 1987 series on the Great Philosophers. Edmund Husserl was a 20th-century German philosopher, best known for founding phenomenology, a philosophical movement and methodology of examining the underlying structure of experience. Martin Heidegger was also a 20th-century German philosopher, best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism. Existentialists take human existence and the human condition to be a fundamental issue. They tend to be radical individualists who privilege our lived experience and choice. They focus on themes such as: freedom, authenticity, the individual, meaning, anxiety, alienation, death, dread, the absurd, contingency, and nihilism. They are often also suspicious of any fixed, pre-determined human nature, objective/universal values, and abstract philosophical systems. Some of the most important existentialist thinkers (or at least thinkers associated with existentialism) include Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Albert Camus, Karl Jaspers, and Simone de Beauvoir.

    "description": "Peter Singer discusses the thought of Hegel and Marx in this episode of the 1987 series on the Great Philosophers with Bryan Magee. Hegel was an important and influential 19th century German philosopher, best known for his dialectic, absolute idealism, and historicism, among various other things. The Hegelian dialectic is the process in which everything changes, based on the triad: thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Hegel's idealism rejected the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself and instead embraced a monistic vision of the world in which everything forms an organic, interconnected, rational whole. Nothing is true or real except the whole. Not only a thinker of totality, Hegel was a historicist thinker who rejected the notion that ideas are static and fixed (e.g. the concepts of human nature and morality, as well as the concept of reason itself). Things can only be understood by understanding their historical context, which, for Hegel, is a process which changes and develops, having an underlying meaning or significance. So not only is there history in reason, but there is reason in history. For Hegel, history progresses towards its endpoint of ever greater freedom, driven by constant conflict and struggle for such freedom via the dialectical process. Like Hegel, Marx also was an influential German thinker. As a young or left Hegelian, he adopted much of Hegel's system, but substituted a kind of materialism for Hegel's idealism. This meant that rather than ideas underlying everything and driving historical change, it was the material and economic conditions which determine one's ideas, culture, and historical development.

    "description": "Anthony Quinton discusses the 17th-18th century philosophers Spinoza and Leibniz with Bryan Magee in an episode of this 1987 series on the Great Philosophers. Both were rationalist philosophers who developed elaborate philosophical systems out of only a few basic principles of reason, but ended up with quite different views. Spinoza was a monist and pantheist. He identified everything with one substance, what he called \"God or Nature\", and understood everything as a mere aspect or mode of this great unity of existence. Thus, there is ultimately only one true entity or being for Spinoza. He rejected any personal conception of God, as well as free will and purpose within nature, leading many to think of him as an atheist. Leibniz, on the other hand, embraced plurality in his system. He posited an infinite array of indivisible substances that he called \"monads\" which were immaterial, incorporeal, mind-like points or atoms. These were taken to be fundamental, making Leibniz something of a panpsychist or an idealist. The existence of matter was taken to be derivative, a mere appearance of something ultimately mental or quasi-mental in nature. Like Spinoza, he was also a determinist who thought everything had to have a complete explanation, leaving no genuine room for objective randomness or chance. And he also agreed with Spinoza that there were innate ideas and knowledge which we possessed prior to any sensory experience of the world. Both thinkers went on to have a huge influence on other philosophers, as well as on many important scientists.

    "description": "Frederick Copleston and Bryan Magee discuss the work of the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in this 1987 program on the Great Philosophers. Schopenhauer is perhaps most famous for his extreme pessimism. Seeing the world as something horrific and bleak, he urged that we turn against it. As a follower of Immanuel Kant, he took space, time, and causality to be, not things-in-themselves, but categories of the mind through which we interpret and make sense of things. However, in contrast to Kant, Schopenhauer argued that reality must ultimately be one, a single unified whole which essentially involves \"Will\". There are several remarkable things about him, including the fact that he was the only major Western philosopher to draw serious and interesting parallels between Western and Eastern thought, as well as being the first major philosopher to openly identify as an atheist. He had a significant influence on many great thinkers and artists, including Nietzsche, Freud, Wittgenstein, and Wagner. The arts were particularly important for Schopenhauer as well, not only because he thought they give us a glimpse into the underlying reality, but because they help us to escape our individuality and thus the inherent suffering and meaningless absurdity of existence.

    "description": "Philosophers have pursued truth, and many have placed truth at the centre of their account of meaning. But might this be a mistake? Could error be at the heart of language, and adventure, rather than truth, be the matter in hand? Hilary Lawson argues for a radical reappraisal of the importance of error. This was the first in a series of three talks given in 2013 at LSE. Hilary Lawson is director of the Institute of Art and Ideas, a non-realist philosopher and the author of Closure.\n\n00:00 Talk \n1:00:18 Q&A\n\n#Philosophy #Epistemology #Relativism #Postmodernism",

He considers what response we might reasonably expect from a person who inadvertently does or brings about some event or condition that is manifestly undesirable or bad; and he suggests that we might reasonably expect such a person not to feel guilty but, rather, to feel embarrassed by his or her inability to prevent or avoid that condition or event. \n\nThis lecture was given by Harry G.

Marcus’s retreat into his inner citadel is not a defensive response to unwelcome external circumstances but rather a reflection of his commitment to the central claims of Stoic value theory. \n\n#philosophy #stoicism #ethics #moralphilosophy",

    "description": "This is an introductory discussion of the life and thought of Hegel and Marx from the Great Ideas in Philosophy series. Hegel was an important and influential 19th century German philosopher, best known for his dialectic, absolute idealism, and historicism, among various other things. The Hegelian dialectic is the process in which everything changes, based on the triad: thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Hegel's idealism rejected the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself and instead embraced a monistic vision of the world in which everything forms an organic, interconnected, rational whole. Nothing is true or real except the whole. Not only a thinker of totality, Hegel was a historicist thinker who rejected the notion that ideas are static and fixed (e.g. the concepts of human nature and morality, as well as the concept of reason itself). Things can only be understood by understanding their historical context, which, for Hegel, is a process which changes and develops, having an underlying meaning or significance. So not only is there history in reason, but there is reason in history. For Hegel, history progresses towards its endpoint of ever greater freedom, driven by constant conflict and struggle for such freedom via the dialectical process. Like Hegel, Marx also was an influential German thinker. As a young or left Hegelian, he adopted much of Hegel's system, but substituted a kind of materialism for Hegel's idealism. This meant that rather than ideas underlying everything and driving historical change, it was the material and economic conditions which determine one's ideas, culture, and historical development.

Dworkin on political equality and some of its difficulties at Queen's University as part of the Chancellor Dunning Trust lecture series. \n\nRonald Dworkin was a widely-respected philosopher of law. At the time of his talk, Dworkin was the professor of jurisprudence at Oxford. In his research and teaching, he examined how the law should deal with race, abortion, euthanasia and equality in ways that were accessible to lay readers. He wrote a number of books, including the influential Taking Rights Seriously (1977), which called for a rights-based theory of law. His other books include A Matter of Principle, Law’s Empire, and Justice in Robes. His 2011 essay “Justice for Hedgehogs” expanded on his view that the legal system was a branch of morality, calling for a moral system centered around human dignity. He died in 2013. \n\n#philosophy #politicalphilosophy #ethics #moralphilosophy",

And if I were such a brain, could I ever say or think this? This is just one puzzle raised by the Harvard philosopher Hilary Putnam, who died in 2016. Though its origins are in Augustine and Descartes, Putnam revolutionised its implications for our understanding of knowledge, language, and the mind. A distinguished panel here discusses Putnam's work. Hilary Putnam (1926-2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, and computer scientist who was a central figure in analytic philosophy who made important contributions to many areas.\n\nThis is from a 2016 discussion as part of the Forum for European Philosophy at LSE. The speakers in this panel include Professor Julian Baggini, Professor Chris Norris, and Dr Sarah Sawyer.\n\n00:00 Introduction \n01:30 Putnam as a Philosopher \n10:22 Science & Language \n19:58 Twin Earth & Externalism \n34:53 Scientific Realism \n42:47 Questions \n56:02 Brain in a Vat \n1:08:47 Politics \n1:14:14 Questions \n\n#philosophy #epistemology #philosophyoflanguage #philosophyofmind #philosophyofscience #putnam #metaphysics #skepticism",

    "description": "Audio recording of a 1963 lecture given by Brand Blanshard at the American University as part of the John Hurst Philosophy Lecture series. Blanshard’s talk is an elegy for the approach and tradition of British Idealism, representing a “principle of sanity” perhaps forever destroyed by the great wars. For Blanshard, this sanity was marked by a passion for rational order and intelligibility contingent on a rational system. His wide-ranging discussion addresses the demise of speculative metaphysics, manifestations of rational coherence in ethics and aesthetics, the swift revolution in western philosophy brought about by the rise of analytic and existentialist approaches, and the “new philosophy” of linguistic analysis. While the lecture is complex, Blanshard is a dynamic and engaging speaker who weaves philosophical argument together with historical analysis and broad engagement with contemporary art, literature and poetry. There is also a buried gem toward the end of the talk when Blanchard exhorts the audience to take interest in the work of a “German refugee” – Hannah Arendt, whose series on Eichmann in Jerusalem was published in The New Yorker in the weeks before Blanchard’s talk.\n\n00:00 Lecture \n1:03:29 Questions \n\n#philosophy #epistemology #ethics #moralphilosophy #historyofphilosophy",

    "description": "Professor John Dupré gives a talk called \"Life as Process\" in a series on \"Process-based biology: Philosophical background and Implications\". In this lecture he discusses the ancient divide between conceptions of the world as composed of things— ultimately unchanging atoms—and as process, in which the only constant is change. Focusing on organisms, and looking at metabolism, life cycles and symbiosis, he outlines a range of reasons why the living world, in particular, must be seen as processual, as consisting of a hierarchy of processes at a range of spatial and temporal scales. He points out some of the more noteworthy consequences of this position for biology and philosophy, and briefly mentions some reasons for thinking that the non-living world should also be understood as processual.\n\nThis talk was given in 2022 at the University of Tartu.\n\n00:00 Talk\n55:25 Q&A\n\n#Philosophy #Ontology #Biology",

And how can one know that one knows it? Explaining the principles of epistemology are Rutgers University’s Alvin Goldman and Peter Klein and Princeton University’s Alexander Nehamas and Daniel Garber. Their insights, in combination with incisive excerpts from Aristotle’s De Anima, Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, Locke’s An Essay on Human Understanding, Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature, and Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, illuminate the complexity of  “truth.” This is part of the 2004 series on Great Ideas of Philosophy.\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #plato #skepticism #historyofphilosophy",

    "title": "How Language Enters Perception - John Campbell (2017)",
    "description": "A reupload of John Campbell's 2017 Jean Nicod Prize lectures.\n\n00:00 Space & Language\nOur ordinary visual experience seems to involve frame of reference phenomena. To use an example of Wittgenstein’s, you can imagine two stars circling one another in a pitch-dark sky. The positions of the stars relative to one another stay the same; their absolute locations change. It’s as if there’s an unseen set of axes with respect to which vision is locating the stars. On one view, this frame of reference is supplied by the shared language. Speakers of languages that use different frames of reference will have different visual experiences. Stephen Levinson has argued for this view over many years. For human subjects, it’s also true that the space of visual experience is a geometric space. Again it’s arguable that this aspect of visual experience is grounded in our understanding of a shared language; Elizabeth Spelke has argued for something like this view. But if our visual experience is grounded in the shared language, there’s a basic puzzle about how we have the notion of an objective space at all. In this lecture I lay out the puzzle & look at possible responses.\n\n1:26:03 Time\nPerceptual experience has a certain finality, in this sense: when you see something happen, it’s happened, and it’s now beyond the reach of agency whether it happened or not. In ordinary perceptual experience, the time-order of the world unrolls before us, & things in the past can’t be changed. This seems to be an immediately recognizable and pervasive aspect of human experience. I argue that this is not so for much of animal perceptual experience. Consider for example a hypothetical animal the temporal structure of whose experience is grounded entirely in its possession of a circadian clock. The clock can represent only phases; a honeybee, for example, might be able to represent only, ‘marmalade on the balcony at 10.00am’, without making any distinction between 10am on one day & 10.00am on another. Here the time of day is a repeatable phase, & the animal could in principle act to affect whether there is marmalade at 10am; any limitation on its powers in this regard is not due merely to the temporal location of the marmalade. The ‘finality’ of human perceptual experience is not shared by this animal. I argue that this point is not affected when we consider other timing systems generally found in animals. The finality of ordinary perceptual experience seems to be grounded in our grasp of a shared language in which temporally structured narratives of events can be generated.\n\n3:15:01 Tool Use\nThere is a certain complexity in the ordinary perceptual experience of using a tool, at any rate in the case of what I’ll call ‘intelligent’ tool use. In intelligent tool use, your awareness of the causally relevant physical characteristics of the tool and your target are what guide your use of the tool to perform a given task. If you’re using a chisel to shape a piece of wood, for example, your awareness of the sharpness of the blade of the chisel, & the texture of the wood, inform your use of the tool. They do so in a structured way; a skilled tool-user is using the tool in a way systematically responsive to variation in properties like sharpness & texture. Although the intelligent tool user has to be systematically responsive to those characteristics, though, they enter experience only recessively; the attentional focus of the tool user will typically be on the characteristics of the target they are attempting to modify. One of the contrasts between animal & human tool use is that animal tool use generally does not seem to be intelligent in this sense. In this lecture I elaborate on that point & look at the relation between intelligent tool use and grasp of a structured language.\n\n4:48:25 Joint Attention\nIn a recent book Imogen Dickie has grounded singular reference in what she calls ‘the mind’s need to represent’. I argue that her talk of a ‘need to represent’ should itself be located our need for cooperation & collaboration, needs that Michael Tomasello has argued are the source of all distinctively human aspects of cognition. On this way of thinking, it’s wrong to approach the theory of reference solipsistically; reference to objects is, rather, grounded in our use of a shared language. This lecture looks at the joint attention that is arguably the foundation of referential thought. I discuss (a) how to characterize the ‘openness’ that is characteristic of joint attention – the way it is ‘out in the open’ between you & me which object is in question & what we are about with respect to it, in ordinary cases of joint attention; (b) an argument that joint attention, rather than Gricean intentions, should be regarded as the ground of referential communication, & (c) the sense in which joint attention should be regarded as the epistemic basis for our capacity for imaginative understanding of one another.\n\n#philosophy #perception #language #cognitivescience",

    "description": "To answer the question of whether the mind is a physical thing requires us first to understand what is meant by \"physical\" and \"thing\". The traditional debate over the mind-body problem tends to take it for granted that these terms should be understood in the way they have been since the 17th century: those who these days assert the doctrine of physicalism or materialism take themselves to be disagreeing, for example, with Descartes. Tim Crane argues that unless we accept the metaphysical assumptions behind this 17th century debate, the contemporary debate between dualists and physicalists/materialists loses a lot of its point; and that once we explicitly abandon these assumptions, we can see the way to the conclusion that there is no interesting sense in which the mind a physical thing. \n\nThis talk was given by Tim Crane in 2017 at the University of Cambridge.

    "description": "A short clip of Hilary Putnam giving an introductory explanation of the functionalist conception of the mind in a 1977 interview with Bryan Magee. As one of the early computer scientists, professor Putnam developed one of the first functionalist views of the mind. On this view, the mind cannot be identified with any kind of thing, whether it be physical or non-physical. The mind is instead defined in terms of functional roles, which allows for the mind and mental states to be realized in many different kinds of things and not just in biological or neurophysical terms. In this way, one of the great advantages of the view is that it allows for the possibility that there can be creatures that are made up of completely different stuff than us that can still have minds and mental states. Putnam later abandoned the original version of his view however because it turned out to be in deep conflict with the externalist view of mind and language which he had also been developing at that time.\n\nNote, this is a re-upload.

    "description": "John Rawls' A Theory of Justice is one of the most important works of political philosophy of the 20th century. In this program, Nigel Warburton interviews Jonathan Wolff about John Rawls' main ideas and their limitations. John Rawls' argument takes the form of a thought experiment involving a hypothetical contract in which people are made ignorant about certain facts about themselves which could bias them in their own favor (e.g. their race, gender, class, age, talents, etc.). In this way, ignorance is used as a way to guarantee impartiality in deciding how societies should be set up. After all, one cannot rig things to benefit oneself if one doesn't know what one's interests are or what one's position in society will be. Rawls argued that people behind this so-called \"veil of ignorance\" would agree to two principles of justice: the liberty principle and the difference principle. Jonathan Wolf explains these principles and the main arguments for and against them.\n\nThis is from an episode of the Philosophy Bites podcast back in 2010.

    "description": "These are two talks that were given by Ricky Sebold back in 2013 at La Trobe University as part of an introductory philosophy series on philosophical problems.\n\nLecture 1: Hard Determinism & Libertarianism\nIf the world is causally determined, does this mean people no longer have free will? Or is being free compatible with determinism. In this lecture, Ricky Sebold discusses two opposing positions regarding the existence of free will even though both agree that genuine free will is incompatible with determinism. On the one hand, there are hard determinists who think that because determinism is true, then this means that free will does not exist. On the other hand, there are libertarians who think that the falsity of determinism leads to the actual existence of an agent that chooses freely.\n\nLecture 2: Compatibilism & Incompatibilism\nWhile the question concerning the truth of determinism may be an empirical question, that is, it will be settled by the various sciences, philosophers are particularly interested in whether or not the hypothetical truth of determinism would rule out free will. In this lecture, Ricky Sebold looks at two opposing positions on this issue: those who think that determinism is compatible with having free will (compatibilists) and those think that determinism undermines freedom (incompatibilists).\n\n00:00 Intro to Problem\n11:41 Hard Determinism\n33:49 Libertarianism\n50:37 Compatibilism\n1:22:51 Incompatibilism\n\n#philosophy #freewill #determinism #metaphysics #materialism",

    "description": "A few clips of Peter van Inwagen, John Martin Fischer, and Susan Wolf discussing determinism and its apparent threat to free will. Among other things, van Inwagen's famous consequence argument is discussed. The clips come from a program on free will as part of the 1998 series called the Εxαminϵd Life. \n\n\"Among the grandest of philosophical puzzles is a riddle about moral responsibility. Almost all of us believe that each one of us is, has been, or will be responsible for at least some of our behavior. But how can this be so if determinism is true and all our thoughts, decisions, choices, and actions are simply droplets in a river of deterministic events that began its flow long, long before we were ever born? The specter of determinism, as it were, devours agents, for if determinism is true, then arguably we never initiate or control our actions; there is no driver in the driver's seat; we are simply one transitional link in an extended deterministic chain originating long before our time. The puzzle is tantalizingly gripping and ever so perplexing — because even if determinism is false, responsibility seems impossible: how can we be morally accountable for behavior that issues from an 'actional pathway' in which there is an indeterministic break? Such a break might free us from domination or regulation by the past, but how can it possibly help to ensure that the reins of control are now in our hands?\" Ishtiyaque Haji\n\n#philosophy #freewill #determinism #causality #causation #materialism #metaphysics",

    "description": "Audio recording of a 1981 lecture by Amartya K. Sen at Queen's University as part of the Chancellor Dunning Trust lecture series. In his lecture, he describes the numerous paradoxes of liberty, beginning with the most obvious: that no one is free to be unfree. He outlines three alternate ways of conceiving liberty. First, as the ability to have power over the conduct of one’s personal life. Second, as the ability to control certain personal decisions. And third, as the ability to constrain others from disturbing one's control. He focuses on discussing the differences between the first two. He proposes that the paradoxes created by these views of liberty be resolved by making rights exclusive to one's own desires, rather than outward looking – in other words, a conditional liberty. To see liberty exclusively in terms of who is exercising control could not be complete, as it completely misses the concept of indirect liberty (what someone would have chosen), which may be a very important part of freedom in an interdependent world. He therefore entirely rejects the attempt to parcel out liberties into bits and pieces of individual control. \n\n00:00 Talk \n1:00:21 Questions \n\n#philosophy #politicalphilosophy #ethics #politicaltheory",

This worry is also an anxiety that has been explored by many of the great philosophers and became in the twentieth century a central theme in existentialism, as the worry that our lives are 'inauthentic'. But what is authenticity? What is to be oneself? And if one isn't oneself, what can one do about it?

    "description": "Thomas M. Scanlon gives a talk on some objections to normative truth at a conference on the nature of normativity in 2011 at the Goethe University of Frankfurt. The idea that there are irreducibly normative truths about reasons for action, which we can discover by thinking carefully about reasons in the usual way, has been thought to be subject to three kinds of objections: metaphysical, epistemological, and motivational (practical). Metaphysical objections claim that a belief in irreducibly normative truths would commit us to facts or entities that would be metaphysically odd, incompatible, it is sometimes said, with a scientific view of the world. In this talk, Thomas Scanlon argues that the idea that there are irreducibly normative truths has no problematic metaphysical implications. Explaining why this is so requires an explanation of what \"ontological commitment“ comes to. It also requires an explanation of the relation between normative facts and non-normative facts, and how normative facts can depend on (\"supervene on“) non-normative facts without being reducible to them.\n\n#philosophy #metaethics #rationality #ontology #ethics #metaphysics",

    "description": "Professor Robert Pippin (University of Chicago) gives a talk on Kant as part of a conference on the Nature of Normativity given at Goethe University Frankfurt in 2010. Kant’s theory of moral obligation is at the same time a theory of autonomy. According to Kant, true autonomy requires an agent’s subjection to the “form of pure practical reason”, and this subjection involves an unconditional obligation to obey what such a “form”, also famously called the Categorical Imperative, demands. Critics have long argued that such a subjection bears little relation to our moral experience, and that it leads to a rigoristic and empty, formalist morality. Pippin argues here that everything depends on how we understand what Kant means by the “form” of pure practical reason, and he attempts to explain Kantian formality by attention to how he understands the notion in his theoretical philosophy. The result is a picture of Kantian morality not as subject to these traditional objections.\n\n#Philosophy #Kant",

    "title": "Minds, Brains, & Science - John Searle's Reith Lectures (1984)",
    "description": "Audio recording of a series of lectures by John Searle, former Professor of Philosophy at Berkeley, on the connections between minds, brains, and science. These lectures were given in 1984 as part of the BBC Reith Lectures, but are still just as relevant today. Some of the topics discussed include free will, the mind-body problem, artificial intelligence, social reality, cognitive science, human action, consciousness, and the social sciences.\n\n00:00 A Froth on Reality\nIn his first lecture, John Searle examines the so-called 'mind-body problem'. Searle uses this paradox of the conscious mind verses the scientific brain to explore our understanding of the world. He considers how humans think of themselves as cognisant, free, rational beings, but science tells us that we are a chance occurrence, created in a world that consists entirely of mindless physical particles. From this viewpoint Professor Searle explores the question: how can an essentially meaningless world contain meaning?\n\n29:48 Beer Cans & Meat Machines\nIn his second lecture, John Searle considers artificial intelligence. He debates whether scientists could create a digital computer which has its own thoughts and presents his famous \"Chinese Room\" argument. He compares the relationship of the mind and the brain to that of computer programme software to computer hardware. But can a man-made machine ever think like a human?\n\n59:21 Grandmother Knew Best\nIn his third lecture, John Searle explores the discipline of cognitive science. He investigates how and why scientists are developing this field. Exploring how the human brain processes information in order to do the action of thinking, Searle links back to his previous lectures to debate the differences between human thought and computerized artificial intelligence.\n\n1:29:05 Walk to Patagonia\nIn his fourth lecture, John Searle analyses the structure of human actions. He draws together the mental and physical aspects to show how our mental activities can produce our behavior. Can our ability to choose our movements be what separates us from machines? Professor Searle seeks to show how the structure of an action relates to the explanation of it.\n\n1:58:45 A Changing Reality\nIn his fifth lecture, John Searle considers the discipline of human behavioral science. He explores the limits to the insights that we can expect from a 'science' of human behavior. He questions the success of the natural sciences. Why have they not given us more information about human behavior? What makes the subject so different to sciences like physics and chemistry?\n\n2:28:21 Freedom of the Will\nIn his sixth and final lecture, John Searle examines the evidence for and against the existence of free will. He attempts to explain why human beings stubbornly believe in their own freedom of action and debates the issue of free will. He concludes his Reith Lectures trying to characterize the relationship between the perceptions of self and the world around us.\n\n#philosophy #searle #philosophyofmind #consciousness #artificialintelligence #philosophyofscience #psychology #freewill #mind",

Findlay was Clark Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics at Yale University, who studied under Rudolph Carnap and Martin Heidegger. Through analysis of Brentano, Merleau-Ponty, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, Findlay describes behavioral, phenomenological, and neural aspects of conscious life. He contends that phenomenological and behavioral perspectives both have metaphysical problems. His examination of a cortically mediated conscious life concludes with forms of consciousness that are not cortically mediated.

    "description": "Peter Adamson discusses the thought of the famous 13th century medieval philosopher, Duns Scotus. First he discusses Duns Scotus on Being, particularly his attacks on the proposal of Aquinas and Henry of Ghent that Being is subject to analogy. Next he discusses Scotus' development of a novel theory of free will and his rethinking of the notions of necessity and possibility. Then he discusses Scotus on ethics, particularly his argument that morality is a matter of freely choosing to follow God's freely issued commands. Finally, he discusses Scotus on universals, his explanation of how things can share a nature in common while being unique individuals.\n\n00:00 Scotus on Being\n20:09 Scotus on Freedom\n39:42 Scotus on Ethics\n1:00:40 Scotus on Universals & Individuals\n\nThis comes from Peter Adamson's podcast, the History of Philosophy without any Gaps, back in 2016.

    "description": "A lecture given by someone named Kit Slover called \"Self-Consciousness in Kant's Transcendental Deduction of the Categories: What do we Understand when we Understand?\". The talk was given in 2021 at St John's College as part of the Dean's Lecture & Concert Series.\n\n\"In the Preface to the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant confesses that the 'Transcendental Deduction' of the categories is the section of his work that cost him the most effort to produce. In the centuries since its composition, it has cost his readers just as much—or even more—effort simply to understand. From its style of argumentation to its basic conclusions, this all-important chapter of the Critique remains one of the densest in the entire work. In this lecture, I will present a reading of the Deduction, hoping to make some sense of its fundamental claims and transcendental argument. I’ll focus my exposition around the activity of 'apperception'—roughly synonymous with self-consciousness—contending that, for Kant, our cognition of the objective world around us always runs in important ways through our recognition of ourselves in and through that world. Objects align with the concepts that make them what they are just by enabling us to become conscious of ourselves through our experience of them. After exploring the argument of the Deduction, I’ll attempt to make its claims more concrete by showing self-consciousness to consist in taking rational responsibility for one’s claims, beliefs, and actions—in the way Socrates tries to make us do. I will conclude the talk by using the Deduction to think about some of the most notorious questions surrounding Kant’s critical philosophy. How should we understand the so-called 'thing-in-itself?' How, and in what sense, are human beings both free and constrained by causality? I think the Deduction has some unexpected answers. The target audience for this lecture is the junior class, who will be discussing Kant in seminar for the first time, but I hope it may also be of some interest to more seasoned readers of the Critique and students who have not yet read it. \"\n\n#Philosophy #Kant #Epistemology",

This comes from a 2006 lecture on the nature of truth. Note, this is a re-upload from the previous channel. It should also be noted that this isn't an exhaustive list of all the positions. It’s also a somewhat crude presentation of the views. There are much more sophisticated and complex formulations of all these views and the various arguments. Furthermore, since this is from a talk given in 2006, the reference to \"culture wars\" obviously isn't the same culture wars going on today in 2022 (although they may not be completely unrelated). \n\nThis was from a talk on Truth given by Huw Price as part of a lecture series on Key Concepts at the University of Sydney in 2006.\n\nYou may also be interested in the following discussion of Truth and Pragmatism between Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam, and James Conant: https://youtu.be/MxL0fQcrjzQ\n\n#Philosophy",

Or do we? How does mental causation work?\n\nWe have causal theories of reference, perception, knowledge, content and numerous other things. If it were to turn out that causation doesn’t exist, we would be in serious trouble! Causation is so important in fact that it has been said that: “With regard to our total conceptual apparatus, causation is the centre of the centre”, and it has been called ‘the cement of the universe’. In these lectures you will be introduced to the most influential theories of causation, the motivations for them and arguments behind them, and the problems they face.\n\nThis is from a six-part lecture series on the nature of causation given at Oxford in 2016.\n\n#philosophy #causation #philosophyofmind #mind #causality",

    "description": "We acquire knowledge through methods such as perception and reasoning and, according to an intuitively plausible principle, acquiring knowledge through such a method requires us first to know that this method is reliable. But it has long been recognized that this seems to give rise to a vicious regress, making knowledge impossible. Rejecting the principle, on the other hand, seems to make knowledge too easy: we could come to know that a method is reliable by using that very method! So how might we solve this ancient puzzle? Professor Conor McHugh discusses this fundamental problem of epistemology in a talk given at the University of Southampton in 2015 as part of the Philosophy Café series.\n\nMore about the problem of the criterion: https://iep.utm.edu/problem-of-the-criterion/\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #skepticism",

    "description": "Professor Tim Crane gives a series of talks called \"Thoughts, Thinking, & Thinkers\" as part of the 2017 Frege Lectures in theoretical philosophy at the University of Tartu. \n\nOne of Frege’s most famous principles was ‘always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective’. Given Frege’s influence on analytic philosophy, it is surprising that the philosophy of mind has not followed his advice here. Many discussions of intentionality or mental representation, for example, have concentrated exclusively on the nature of the proposition, whether in the specific version defended by Frege in ’The Thought’ (1918), or the versions defended by Bertrand Russell, David Lewis or Robert Stalnaker. But it is not obvious what the theory of the proposition has got to do with the psychological, as opposed to (say) the semantics of propositional attitude attributions. Frege himself distinguished between thoughts (propositions) and ideas, or mental representations. In these lectures Tim Crane examines the consequences of following Frege’s advice, and approaching the study of thinking or intentionality in terms of ideas rather than propositions.\n\nSource: https://www.flfi.ut.ee/en/department-philosophy/frege-lectures-2017-tim-crane-thoughts-thinking-and-thinkers\n\n00:00 Intentionality \n59:11 Q&A 1\n1:34:27 Thoughts \n2:34:38 Q&A 2\n3:07:16 Thinking \n4:03:34 Q&A 3\n4:36:13 Thinkers \n5:35:07 Q&A 4\n\n#philosophy #philosophyofmind #mind #intentionality #psychology",

    "title": "Acting ‘of One's Own Free Will’: New Perspectives on an Ancient Philosophical Problem",
    "description": "Audio recording of a lecture by Robert Kane on free will in 2013 at the Aristotelian Society. Over the past five decades, Robert Kane has been developing a distinctive view of free will according to which it requires that agents be to some degree ultimately responsible for the formation of their own wills. To act ‘of one's own free will’ in this sense is to act ‘from a will’ that is to some extent ‘of one's own free making’. A free will of this ultimate kind has been under attack in the modern era as obscure and unintelligible. In this talk, Robert Kane discusses the arguments for such a view and compares it to other contemporary views of free will and action. He then addresses criticisms that such a non‐determinist free will cannot be made intelligible or reconciled with modern science, does not allow sufficient agent control, reduces to mere chance or luck or randomness, leads to various regresses, or fails to account for moral responsibility, among other criticisms.\n\nThis talk was given by Robert Kane in 2013 as part of the Aristotelian Society.

    "description": "Professor David Wallace delivers two talks on the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics. In the first lecture, he examines the justification for interpreting the superposition states as multiplicities, and in the second lecture, he asks how we make sense of probability in the Many-Worlds theory. \n\nThe Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics holds that quantum theory - our best current theory of physics - is correctly understood as claiming that there are many worlds that exist in parallel to our own and which branch constantly off our own. The existence of the other worlds makes it possible to make sense of physics without action-at-a-distance, objective randomness, or any strange role for an \"observer\" or \"consciousness\". During this weekend school, this interpretation of quantum mechanics is discussed and it is asked what would follow from its being the correct one.\n\nThese talks were given in 2014 as part of a series at Oxford.\n\n00:00 The Plurality of Worlds\n53:30 The Probability Puzzle\n\n#philosophy #probability #philosophyofscience #quantumphysics #science #quantummechanics #manyworlds",

MacIntyre notes that while he is making what some listeners might consider a “rather arcane point” it is one that “has extremely important social implications.” Of his attempts to clarify a technical argument that he usually must “illustrate on a blackboard” MacIntyre delightfully says to the audience “You must forgive me, I am like a conjurer who has arrived on the stage without not only a hat, but without a rabbit either!” \n\n00:00 Aim of the Talk\n03:13 Natural Particulars\n07:23 Social Particulars\n14:34 Unpredictability of Conceptual Innovation\n20:00 Unpredictability of Open Decisions\n29:23 Unpredictability of Game-Theoretic Conflicts\n32:31 Application to Social Particulars\n36:41 Extrapolation from Trends\n44:06 Regularities in Social Life\n49:09 Judgment & Small Causes with Large Effects\n53:38 Practical Consequences\n\nSource of the audio: https://dra.american.edu/islandora/object/auislandora:83207\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #philosophyofscience #science #determinism #historyofphilosophy",

    "description": "Consequentialists hold that the right action is the one that brings about the best consequences. Some non-consequentialists also hold that, when choosing between actions that do not violate any non-consequentialist constraints, we should do what will bring about the best consequences, and other non-consequentialists hold that good consequences can sometimes outweigh non-consequentialist considerations. So on many ethical theories, it is important to decide what consequences are best. The answers offered to this question fall into three main categories. The classical utilitarians were hedonists, holding that “best consequences” means the greatest possible surplus of pleasure over pain. Preference utilitarians argue that the best consequences are those that do most to satisfy, on balance, the preferences of all those affected by our action. Pluralist consequentialists hold that there are several intrinsic values, not only pleasure or happiness, but also such things as knowledge, truth, beauty, freedom, equality and justice. In this lecture, Peter Singer discusses some of the considerations for and against each of these positions. This was given at Oxford in 2017 as part of a seminar in moral philosophy. \n\nRead more about utilitarianism and consequentialism: https://iep.utm.edu/consequentialism-utilitarianism/ \n\n#philosophy #ethics #utilitarianism #metaethics #moralphilosophy #petersinger",

    "description": "What is consciousness? Why does it even exist? It has long been treated as the byproduct of biological complexity. The more complicated the brain, the more self-aware. Other thinkers have seen consciousness as totally distinct from the body — dualism. But maybe consciousness, like space and time, mass and energy, is just a basic characteristic of the universe. Maybe it's a fundamental property of matter. Welcome to the concept of \"panpsychism\". It's a radical-sounding idea and it could prove vital for us in radically rethinking how we think about reality itself. It's been said that the only thing we know for certain is our own experience. But how do we account for this most subjective phenomenon within the science of consciousness? How can science with its objective metrics even begin to engage with the felt nature of the inner subjective life? \n\nPhilip Goff, professor of philosophy at Durham University, is a proponent of an emerging theory intended to shed light on the problem of consciousness — a theory called \"panpsychism\". In this program, he discusses these issues with Naheed Mustafa in an episode of the cbc podcast \"Ideas\".

A sampling of subsequent topics includes propositional and predicate logic, Bayesian theory, Boolean logic, Frege’s use of variables and quantifiers, Gödel’s work with meta-mathematics, the Vienna Circle’s logical positivism, and the Turing machine. Commentary by Hilary Putnam, of Harvard University; NYU’s Kit Fine; and Colin McGinn, of Rutgers University, is featured.\n\n#philosophy #rationality #epistemology",

    "description": "A few clips of John Searle and Bryan Magee discussing one of Wittgenstein's most important ideas, that of family resemblance, which in many ways runs against the entire philosophical tradition. For although the search for the essence of concepts like Truth, Justice, Knowledge, Goodness, and Beauty is the very paradigm of conceptual or philosophical analysis (as Socrates famously showed us), Wittgenstein suggested that abstract terms do not have (or do not need to have) such underlying essences which all the particular instances share in common. We understand the meaning of such terms enough to be able to use them, even if we cannot spell out their precise conditions. Indeed, things of the same kind need not share any underlying universal or common nature, but only a variety of overlapping similarities, which Wittgenstein called \"family resemblances.\" In this way, Wittgenstein was something of a nominalist, rejecting essentialism.

This is from a 1977 series on Modern Philosophy called Men of Ideas.\n\nMartin Heidegger was a 20th-century German philosopher, best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism. Existentialists take human existence and the human condition to be a fundamental issue. They tend to be radical individualists who privilege our lived experience and choice. They focus on themes such as: freedom, authenticity, the individual, meaning, anxiety, alienation, death, dread, the absurd, contingency, and nihilism. They are often also suspicious of any fixed, pre-determined human nature, objective/universal values, and abstract philosophical systems. Some of the most important existentialist thinkers (or at least thinkers associated with existentialism) include Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Albert Camus, Karl Jaspers, and Simone de Beauvoir.

    "description": "Alexander Douglas and Christoph Schuringa give a talk on Spinoza and Nietzsche on valuing. The talk examines a distinctive approach to the nature of value that, they argue, Spinoza and Nietzsche share. This approach contrasts with that of most moral philosophers in beginning with an analysis of valuing, rather than taking values as its starting point. That is, Nietzsche and Spinoza start from the human activity of valuing in their attempt to get clear on what values are. The talk begins by outlining Spinoza’s theory of valuing as they understand it. This requires an examination of Spinoza’s theory of desire, upon which his theory of valuing depends. They then examine Nietzsche’s theory of valuing, which is seen to depend on his theory of drives. They end by showing that, although their accounts overlap in the significant ways outlined above, they also diverge in an interesting way. Nietzsche, they argue, highlights an important gap in Spinoza’s account. But, they contend, Spinoza also provides the resources to indicate a difficulty in Nietzsche’s account.\n\n“I am utterly amazed, utterly enchanted! I have a precursor, and what a precursor!

    "description": "A clip of Bob Brandom discussing Richard Rorty and his anti-representationalism in a talk at a conference on Rorty and his magnum opus, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. The headlining ambition of the book is to complete a turn Rorty discerned in current analytic philosophy against a constellation of ideas informed by the assumption that Mind serves as the foundation of epistemic authority. By setting this in a broader ‘therapeutic’ context inspired by Heidegger and Wittgenstein, the aim is to ‘liberate’ philosophers from their epistemologically fixated inquiries and, in the spirit of the book’s other hero, Dewey, provide them with a new intellectual task: helping to spread the ‘precious values’ of the Enlightenment by playing their part in “continuing the conversation of the West”. Its attempt to transform the philosopher from epistemologist to hermeneuticist makes Philosophy more existential than programmatic in character. Nevertheless, its synthesis of the pragmatic and behaviourist elements in Sellars, Quine and Davidson with the historicism of Kuhn presents a challenge to those who wish to retain a ‘realist’ or ‘transcendental’ standpoint for inquiry, and thus aim to draw a methodological line in the sand between philosophy and science, or between philosophy and other ‘kinds of writing’.\n\n#Philosophy #Epistemology #Rorty",

He was well known for being something of a provocateur or gadfly. In his most famous work \"Against Method\", he developed a kind of anarchist view of knowledge (epistemological anarchism), which is the view that \"anything goes\" in science, that there is no method or universal rules, nor should there be any. Such fixed rules are detrimental to science itself insofar as they restrict scientific progress and the growth of knowledge, as well as lead to a kind of dogmatism.

Note, Wittgenstein himself does not endorse the radical skeptical paradox that arises, but it was a problem that he discussed and thought many people fall into. The problem starts out as an epistemic one involving knowing, but when fully thought through, it ends up giving rise to a much deeper problem about the very possibility of there being determinate meaning at all. \n\nThis comes from James Conant's course on varieties of philosophical skepticism (what he calls Cartesian skepticism and Kantian skepticism). The clip has been edited.\n\nSome quotes:\n\n\"But how can a rule show me what I have to do at this point? Whatever I do is, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule...Any interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning.\" Wittgenstein\n\n\"This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule.\" Wittgenstein\n\n#philosophy #wittgenstein #skepticism",

Accordingly, if you believe that p is true while your peer disagrees—and if your peer has been exposed to all the same evidence as you—then you ought to give up your belief that p. This position has a wide range of skeptical consequences. After all, we seem to have peer disagreements about all sorts of issues: politics, philosophy, religion, and even conciliationism itself. Sorensen and Christensen discuss whether the case for conciliationism is strong enough to justify its troubling implications.\n\nThis comes from Philosophy TV back in 2010.

What is it that makes you who you are? Physical features of your body? Mental features of the mind? A combination of the two? If scientists could transfer all of your mental contents to another body, would you still be you? Ayer spends a great deal of his talk critiquing P. F. Strawson’s position on the issue: namely that the concept of a person cannot be reduced to more basic features of the mind and body. Ayer rejects Strawson’s view and argues that personal identity is constituted by, or can be reduced to, both the particular bodies that we inhabit and our mental histories and experiences. \n\n00:00 Lecture \n1:02:01 Discussion \n\n#philosophy #ayer #epistemology #philosophyofmind #personalidentity #metaphysics #mind #historyofphilosophy",

The lecture is a masterclass in the meaning of Kant’s relationship of perception and imagination. Strawson begins with a discussion of the similarities of Hume and Kant’s accounts, an understanding requisite for analytic and continental philosophers alike interested in questions of sense and phenomena (and the relationship between figures like Frege, Wittgenstein, Husserl, and Heidegger). There's then a discussion of Wittgenstein’s famous “duck/rabbit” example. This talk is highly technical and may only be of interest to advanced scholars interested in the history of philosophy. \n\nThis talk was given in 1968 as part of the Annual Bishop John F.

Although David Hilbert is a mathematician and not a philosopher, he will be familiar to those in the analytic tradition, especially those who have an interest in philosophy of mathematics, logic, and the foundations of mathematics.\n\nIt should be noted that when Hilbert talks here about science, it is always natural science, the science of nature that he is referencing. \n\nThe \"ignorabimus\" that he mentions is the Latin maxim \"Ignoramus et ignorabimus\", which means \"we don't know and won't know\". So when Hilbert says that our slogan should instead be \"we must know, we will know\" he is obviously turning this maxim on its head.\n\n#Mathematics",

    "title": "Matter, Mind, and Meaning",
    "description": "Quantum mechanics and relativity have shown us that the nature of matter is vastly different than materialists and mechanists ever imagined. Even so, trying to accommodate conscious minds into the natural order has led to the hard problem of consciousness and other seemingly insoluble problems. Indeed, even in the field of consciousness studies more and more researchers in both philosophy and the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness are becoming skeptical that any form of materialism or reductionism can resolve the hard problem of consciousness. The two emerging contenders seem to be strong emergence versus some form of panpsychism. Unfortunately, the terms of the ancient debate between strong emergence and some form of inherence such as panpsychism have not changed very much in the last few hundred years. So we allegedly have conscious agents either inexplicably popping out of brains as in strong emergence or we have something intrinsically experience-like hiding at the metaphysical 'center' of fundamental physical entities inexplicably combining to form mature minds. To see the way out, we must begin by noting that with the exception of conscious experience itself, both views share a physicalist or ontologically reductive framework. On both views, with the exception of consciousness itself, the world is just as physicalism or ontological reductionism says it is. Can we do better? Yes, neutral monism of the sort defended by William James and others is the key. The latter holds that the very idea of mind and matter as essentially distinct in the first place, is the root of the hard problem. Neutral monism deflates the hard problem and allows us to reconceive both matter and mind in a harmonious and naturalistic way, all of which puts meaning back into the heart of nature.\n\nThis talk was given by Michael Silberstein in 2015 at Wesleyan University. \n\n00:00 Strong Emergence & Panpsychism\n30:09 The Alternative Conception\n\n#philosophy #philosophyofmind #consciousness #metaphysics #mind",

    "title": "Being, Univocity, & Logical Syntax",
    "description": "In this talk, professor Adrian Moore focuses on the idea of the univocity of being, championed by Duns Scotus and given prominence more recently by Deleuze. Although he is interested in how this idea can be established, his primary concern is with something more basic: how the idea can even be properly thought. In the course of exploring this issue, which he does partly by borrowing some ideas about logical syntax from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, he tries to show how there can be dialogue between analytic philosophers and those of other traditions.\n\nThis talk was the Presidential Address by A.W. Moore (Oxford) in 2014 as part of the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. For more information: www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk\n\n#Philosophy #Deleuze #Metaphysics",

But this answer is threatened by the fact that our best scientific theories support the view that factors beyond our control produce all of our actions. Derk Pereboom sets out an argument that free will of the sort required for deserved blame and praise is indeed ruled out, but that this does not undermine the core elements of morality, value and meaning in life. \n\nThis talk was given by Derk Pereboom in 2010 at the University of Alabama as part of the philosophy today lecture series.

Do laws of nature merely describe regularities in the world or do they involve necessities that lie behind our empirical observations of regularities, in some sense \"governing\" events in the universe and thus explaining such regularities? These are just some of the kinds of philosophical questions that arise regarding laws of nature. Both the regularity theory and necessitarian theory are discussed and contrasted here. This wonderful speaker is Professor Jeffrey Kasser and comes from a course given on the philosophy of science quite a few years back.\n\nFor a good supplementary reading of these philosophical issues about laws of nature and the two main approaches, as well as some of the philosophical implications for other issues, check out the following article from The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy by Norman Swartz: https://iep.utm.edu/lawofnat/\n\n00:00 Introduction \n06:18 Regularity Theory \n29:39 Necessitarian Theory \n\n#philosophy #philosophyofscience #epistemology #causation #science #causality #empiricism",

    "description": "John Searle discusses the standard conception of rationality and some of the problems and paradoxes that it gives rise to, including the impossibility of Akrasia (i.e. weakness of will), the impossibility of self-deception, the irrationality of voting, that there must be some odds at which you would bet your life against 25 cents, as well as the conception of explanation which requires that all explanations to be deterministic. Note, his alternative conception isn't given here, but only problems for the standard account. This comes from lectures on the philosophy of society given at Berkeley in 2010. \n\n#philosophy #rationality #epistemology #searle",

    "title": "Wagner's Philosophers: German Idealism, Revolution, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche & Adorno",
    "description": "A wonderful series from the BBC's The Essay on the philosophical influences on Richard Wagner.\n\n00:00 Professor Roger Scruton explores the philosophical background that influenced the young Richard Wagner. The German universities of his youth were in a state of intellectual ferment in the aftermath of the greatest philosopher of modern times, Immanuel Kant. Out of this came a school of philosophy known as German Idealism. Wagner was particular influenced by the most famous of these philosophers, Hegel. And, even though Wagner was later to radically revise his philosophical views, the ideas of Hegel can still be traced in his great cycle of music dramas, The Ring: the notion that nothing human is permanent, and all must perish in the spirit's ongoing search for self-knowledge. And the essence of this spirit, Hegel argued, is freedom. Wagner took this idea one step further. Freedom, for Wagner, was not only a political phenomenon, it was also a profound spiritual reality, revealed in the moment of sacrifice.\n\n14:11 Professor Anthony Grayling looks at the crucial years before and after the Dresden uprising of 1849 when Wagner was manning the barricades with revolutionaries such as Mikhail Bakunin. After the death of the philosopher, Hegel, in 1831, a group of his followers, the Young Hegelians argued that the forces of freedom and reason would continue to conquer everything in their way. Into this heady mix came the attacks on religious orthodoxy of Ludwig Feuerbach and the political and economic theories of Proudhon. Wagner drank this all in greedily. And during his years of exile in Switzerland these ideas bubbled away and were reborn in his own philosophical essays concerning the artwork of the future aimed at remaking society along utopian socialist lines.\n\n26:35 Professor Christopher Janaway on Wagner's life-changing encounter with the pessimistic philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. In 1854 he read Schopenhauer's masterwork, The World as Will and Representation; and it hit him like a thunderbolt. Wagner discovered a thinker who endorsed his own developing views on the role of music and gave him a new way to think about his perpetual struggles with desire and erotic love. It also convinced him of the futility of political agitation. It can be argued that Wagner bent these ideas to his own purposes; and that Tristan and Isolde, written in the aftermath of this great encounter, is really a Schopenhauerian experiment gone wrong: instead of losing desire and attachment, the two lovers intensify both to the extreme. It was only in his last opera, Parsifal, that Wagner finally produced a music drama that seems in many respects at peace with the ascetic ideal of his philosophical hero, Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\n41:12 Michael Tanner looks at the relationship between two titans of German culture, the 55-year old composer Richard Wagner and the precocious 24-year old philologist, who was destined to become the great philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche. Out of their heady late-night chats about Schopenhauer, Euripedes and Socrates came Nietzsche's first book, The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music. The relationship was to darken and turn sour in later years when Nietzsche accused Wagner of \"slobbering at the foot of the cross\" in his final opera, Parsifal. But to the end Nietzsche was to regard his encounter with Wagner as one of the most important events of his life.\n\n54:56 Professor John Deathridge explores the posthumous reputation of Wagner in the 20th Century as seen through the lens of the philosopher Theodor Adorno who had pertinent things to say about Wagner's appropriation by the fascists, his infamous anti-semitism, and the related issues of German culture post-World War 2, the culture industry and mass culture in general.\n\n00:00 Wagner & German Idealism\n14:11 Wagner & Revolution\n26:35 Wagner & Schopenhauer\n41:12 Wagner & Nietzsche \n54:57 Wagner & Adorno\n\nMore from The Essay: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x3hl/episodes/player\n\n#Philosophy",

But they set these topics within a much broader context, encompassing humanity’s history of discovery about the natural world (both in physics and biology), and our place within it (linked to issues of both evolution and morality). Main themes of the lectures are: (1) Introduction and views of the cosmos from Genesis to Descartes; (2) Humanity’s place in the scientific picture of the world; (3) Scepticism and the problem of induction; (4) More on induction and facing up to scepticism; (5) The mind and personal identity; (6) Identity, self-interest, morality, and free will; (7) Free will, causality, explanation, and moral responsibility; (8) God and morality.\n\nMore lectures on General Philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE_xo2wvkm6qPZrUlAiRNHXb\n\nSource: https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/general-philosophy-2018\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #davidhume #skepticism #causality #causation #philosophyofscience",

    "description": "Professor Raymond Tallis gives the 2012 Francis Bacon Lecture at the University of Hertfordshire called \"Aping Mankind: Neuromania, Darwinitis and the Misrepresentation of Mankind\". Neuromania is based on the incorrect notion that human consciousness is identical with activity in the brain, that people are their brains, and that societies are best understood as collections of brains. While the brain is a necessary condition of every aspect of human consciousness, it is not a sufficient condition - which is why neuroscience, and the materialist philosophy upon which it is based, fails to capture the human person. Since the brain is an evolved organism, Neuromania leads to Darwinitis, the assumption that, since Darwin demonstrated the biological origins of the organism Homo sapiens, we should look to evolutionary theory to understand what we are now, that our biological roots explain our cultural leaves. In fact, we belong to a community of minds that has developed over the hundreds of thousands of years since we parted company with other primates.\n\n#philosophy #philosophyofmind #consciousness #metaphysics #mind",

    "description": "A short clip of Karl Popper discussing his famous falsifiability criterion of the demarcation between science and non-science, and how he partly came to it, as well as his fallibilism. This is from a 1971 discussion with John Eccles and the Dutch philosopher Fons Elders as the moderator. This is a re-upload from the previous channel. For more Popper: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE_VarWCx1d_Uogn_GxsVf-o\n\n\"The traditional systems of epistemology may be said to result from yes-answers or no-answers to questions about the sources of knowledge. They never challenge these questions, or dispute their legitimacy; the questions are taken as perfectly natural, and nobody seems to see any harm in them. This is quite interesting, for these questions are clearly authoritarian in spirit. They can be compared with that traditional question of political theory, 'Who should rule?', which begs for an authoritarian answer such as 'the best', or 'the wisest', or 'the people', or 'the majority'. (It suggests, incidentally, such silly alternatives as 'Whom do you want as rulers: the capitalists or the workers?', analogous to 'What is the ultimate source of knowledge: the intellect or the senses?') This political question is wrongly put and the answers which it elicits are paradoxical. It should be replaced by a completely different question such as 'How can we organize our political institutions so that bad or incompetent rulers (whom we should try not to get, but whom we so easily might get all the same) cannot do too much damage?' I believe that only by changing our question in this way can we hope to proceed towards a reasonable theory of political institutions. The question about the sources of our knowledge can be replaced in a similar way. It has always been asked in the spirit of: 'What are the best sources of our knowledge--the most reliable ones, those which will not lead us into error, and those to which we can and must turn, in case of doubt, as the last court of appeal?' I propose to assume, instead, that no such ideal sources exist--no more than ideal rulers--and that all 'sources' are liable to lead us into error at times. And I propose to replace, therefore, the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?\" (from Popper's 'Conjectures and Refutations')\n\n#philosophy #karlpopper #epistemology #science #philosophyofscience",

More Nietzsche: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE_ySvPE8kzFUkA5aO_cdKmb\n\nIt is widely known that Nietzsche takes himself to present a tremendous challenge to conventional morality. Many of his interpreters have been exorcised in trying to make precise the nature of that challenge. Here the attention has focused largely on the question of how his genealogical accounts of morality amount to a genuine challenge, rather than an instance of the genetic fallacy. Less attention has been paid to Nietzsche’s claim that morality involves a kind of pathology. This talk aims to expose some of the bases of Nietzsche’s idea about health and how they relate to his attacks upon morality and how they connect with his own positive values. Beyond Nietzsche scholarship this project aims to show us perspectives from which we might question are own accounts of health and values, both individual and social.\n\nThis talk was given in 2015 by Ken Gemes in France at the University of Bordeaux.\n\n00:00 Talk\n37:09 Q&A \n\n#philosophy #nietzsche #psychology",

    "title": "Language & Social Ontology (John Searle)",
    "description": "A wonderful talk given by John Searle at the University of Oslo back in 2011 on language and social ontology. He attempts to explain the distinctive features of human civilization. Animals have forms of social organization and communication, but they do not have money, property, government, and marriage. Why not? Human institutional facts are created and maintained by a specific type of linguistic representation that he calls a \"status function declaration.\" This operation can be performed over and over again on a wide range of subjects. It creates and maintains systems of deontic power: rights, duties, obligations and empowerments of various kinds. These provide the glue that hold human society together. They do that by providing humans with desire independent reasons for action, that is, reasons for doing things that are independent of their immediate inclinations.\n\nThis talk was given in 2011 by John Searle in Oslo. \n\n#Philosophy #Language #Searle",

    "description": "Another re-upload from the previous channel. This short clip comes from the 1987 interview of Peter Singer with Bryan Magee on the life and philosophical work of Hegel and Marx. I put it together quite a long time ago, but I still think it provides a relatively decent summary of some of the main similarities and differences between Hegel and Marx. I apologize for the rather cheap visuals. I originally did that only because the interview was of rather poor quality. Note, Marx did not actually say that he stood Hegel on his head, but instead that he turned him around and put him back onto his feet. I think this is actually important for the original metaphor because it implies that he is taking Hegel out of the realm of Geist and abstraction \"up high\" and putting him back on his feet, the right way around, on the ground of the material world. Also, I'm not sure about whether that point about a conflict-free society was originally intended to be the Hegelian or Marxist goal, or even how accurate that is as a characterization of either view. I'd be curious to hear anyone's thoughts on that though.\n\nAs a young Hegelian, Marx had very much been influenced by Hegel and even took up much of Hegel's system. But one crucial difference is that Marx substituted a kind materialism for Hegel's idealism. Among other things, this meant that rather than it being ideas which underlie everything and drive historical change, it was the material and economic conditions which determine one's ideas, culture, and historical development.\n\nMore Short Clips: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE8v8UVlc7JuuNHwvhkaOvzc\n\n#philosophy #hegel #marx",

He goes on to discuss Descartes' rationalism, as well as the famous Cogito, which is taken to be the first truth, the primary truth, but which comes at the price of alienation from the entire external world vis-à-vis his skeptical method of universal doubt and the resulting gulf between mind and world.\n\nThis comes a 1987 interview with the Multimedia Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences.

    "description": "What is mathematics about and how do we acquire mathematical knowledge? Mathematics seems to be about numbers, but what exactly are numbers? Are numbers and other mathematical objects something discovered or invented? Daniel Sutherland discusses some of these issues in the philosophy of mathematics, explaining some of the basic difficulties involved in trying to say what numbers are and how we come to know them. Are numbers mere mental constructs, something invented by us? If so, then why does mathematics work so well and seem to describe the world? On the other hand, if numbers are \"out there\" in some sense waiting to be discovered, then what is their status and how do we get knowledge of them? After all, you can't see or touch numbers and other mathematical objects. And unlike ordinary empirical truths, mathematical truths seem to have a quite different and special status: they are a priori, necessary, eternal, universal, and absolutely certain.

This comes from an episode of the In Our Time podcast from a few years back. For more information and other episodes, go to: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl\n\n\"Among the grandest of philosophical puzzles is a riddle about moral responsibility. Almost all of us believe that each one of us is, has been, or will be responsible for at least some of our behavior. But how can this be so if determinism is true and all our thoughts, decisions, choices, and actions are simply droplets in a river of deterministic events that began its flow long, long before we were ever born? The specter of determinism, as it were, devours agents, for if determinism is true, then arguably we never initiate or control our actions; there is no driver in the driver's seat; we are simply one transitional link in an extended deterministic chain originating long before our time. The puzzle is tantalizingly gripping and ever so perplexing — because even if determinism is false, responsibility seems impossible: how can we be morally accountable for behavior that issues from an 'actional pathway' in which there is an indeterministic break? Such a break might free us from domination or regulation by the past, but how can it possibly help to ensure that the reins of control are now in our hands?\" Ishtiyaque Haji\n\n#philosophy #freewill #determinism #causality #causation #metaphysics",

The conflict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty.—We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk.

    "description": "Dr. Walter Kaufmann gives the first talk in a 1960 series on existentialism. He begins by discussing what he takes existentialism to be and then goes on to discuss the life and thought of Søren Kierkegaard, particularly in relation to the modern crisis of religion. In the next talk, he discusses Nietzsche and the crisis in philosophy, and then Sartre and the crisis in morality. This comes from a 1960 series on existentialism which is now in the public domain. Note, the audio has been edited and improved.\n\nExistentialists take human existence and the human condition to be a fundamental issue. They tend to be radical individualists who privilege our lived experience and choice. They focus on themes such as: freedom, authenticity, the individual, meaning, anxiety, alienation, death, dread, the absurd, contingency, and nihilism. They are often also suspicious of any fixed, pre-determined human nature, objective/universal values, and abstract philosophical systems. Some of the most important existentialist thinkers (or at least thinkers associated with existentialism) include Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Karl Jaspers, Albert Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir.

I think it succinctly illustrates some of the underlying problems with Popper's philosophy of science and why it doesn't seem to work. Many people also seem to misunderstand Popper's view on this point, perhaps based on a misunderstanding of inductive logic or the problem of induction itself. To be fair, Popper himself often seems to downplay such aspects of his view. But Popper isn't just a fallibilist who stresses falsifiability in science, he's an anti-inductivist who wants to get rid of induction from science altogether. In any case, the audio comes from a course on the philosophy of science given by Jeffrey Kasser a while back. The clips come from various interviews and documentaries on Popper. I will list them all at a later date. \n\n#philosophy #karlpopper #epistemology #skepticism #causality #science",

This is obviously connected with Marx's materialism and rejection of idealism.

    "title": "On Genealogy (Genealogical Debunking/Skepticism)",
    "description": "We suffer from genealogical anxiety when we worry that the contingent origins of our representations, once revealed, will somehow undermine or cast doubt on those representations. Is such anxiety ever rational? Many have apparently thought so, from pre-Socratic critics of Greek theology to contemporary evolutionary debunkers of morality. One strategy for vindicating critical genealogies is to see them as undermining the epistemic standing of our representations—the justification of our beliefs, the aptness of our concepts, and so on. In this talk, Amia Srinivasan argues that this strategy is not as promising as it might first seem. Instead, she suggests that critical genealogies can wield a sort of meta-epistemic power; in so far as we wish to resist the genealogical critic, we are under pressure to see ourselves as the beneficiaries of a certain kind of good luck: what she calls genealogical luck. But there is also a resolutely non-epistemic way of understanding the power of critical genealogies, one that is essential, she argues, for understanding the genealogical projects of various theorists, including Nietzsche and Catharine MacKinnon. For critical genealogies can reveal what it is that our representations do—and what we, in turn, might do with them.\n\nThis talk was given by Amia Srinivasan in 2019 as part of The Aristotelian Society.

    "title": "True Enough",
    "description": "A talk given by Catherine Elgin on her book \"True Enough\", the development of an epistemology that explains how science and art embody and convey understanding. Philosophy valorizes truth, holding that there can never be epistemically good reasons to accept a known falsehood, or to accept modes of justification that are not truth conducive. How can this stance account for the epistemic standing of science, which unabashedly relies on models, idealizations, and thought experiments that are known not to be true? In True Enough, Catherine Elgin argues that we should not assume that the inaccuracy of models and idealizations constitutes an inadequacy. To the contrary, their divergence from truth or representational accuracy fosters their epistemic functioning. When effective, models and idealizations are, Elgin contends, felicitous falsehoods that exemplify features of the phenomena they bear on. Because works of art deploy the same sorts of felicitous falsehoods, she argues, they also advance understanding.\n\nElgin develops a holistic epistemology that focuses on the understanding of broad ranges of phenomena rather than knowledge of individual facts. Epistemic acceptability, she maintains, is a matter not of truth-conduciveness, but of what would be reflectively endorsed by the members of an idealized epistemic community—a quasi-Kantian realm of epistemic ends.\n\nCatherine's book: https://books.google.com/books/about/True_Enough.html?id=SWc6DwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #science #philosophyofscience",

    "description": "In this lecture on General Philosophy, Professor Peter Millican discusses identity, self-interest, hedonism, morality and free will. The focus is mainly on self-interest, particularly in showing that psychological egoism is false and based on a fundamental confusion. This comes from a 2018 series on General Philosophy.\n\nThis series of 8 lectures on General Philosophy was delivered to first year Oxford University undergraduates in Michaelmas term 2018. The lectures cover six main topics: Knowledge and Scepticism, Induction, Mind and Body, Personal Identity, Free Will, God and Evil. But they set these topics within a much broader context, encompassing humanity’s history of discovery about the natural world (both in physics and biology), and our place within it (linked to issues of both evolution and morality). Main themes of the lectures are: (1) Introduction and views of the cosmos from Genesis to Descartes; (2) Humanity’s place in the scientific picture of the world; (3) Scepticism and the problem of induction; (4) More on induction and facing up to scepticism; (5) The mind and personal identity; (6) Identity, self-interest, morality, and free will; (7) Free will, causality, explanation, and moral responsibility; (8) God and morality.\n\nMore lectures on General Philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE_xo2wvkm6qPZrUlAiRNHXb\n\nSource: https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/general-philosophy-2018\n\n#philosophy #ethics #egoism #moralphilosophy #historyofphilosophy",

He discusses their general structure and shows how they're related. This sheds light on issues in various different areas, including within the philosophy of perception, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language. Some of the philosophers discussed throughout this course include Wittgenstein, Sellars, Hilary Putnam, Kripke, C.I.

    "title": "Does Time Really Pass? (Simon Prosser on the Illusion of Passage)",
    "description": "We are all familiar with the notion that time passes, but what does this mean? In this talk, Dr Simon Prosser argues that time does not pass. He begins by outlining some philosophical theories of temporal passage (A-theories of time, including presentism and the growing block view), along with a class of theories according to which time does not objectively pass (the B-theory of time, what's called eternalism or the block universe). He then goes over traditional problems for the notion of passage, including McTaggart's argument, the issue of the rate of passage, and the argument that passage is incompatible with modern physics (particularly with Einstein's special theory of relativity). He then goes on to argue that, despite appearances to the contrary, it is not actually possible to experience time passing. But because the best reason for thinking that time passes is our experience of it, we no longer have any good reason for thinking that time actually passes. If this is right, then it is an important project for philosophers and psychologists to explain why it seems to us that time passes when it doesn't really do so.\n\nThis was given at Durham University in 2012.\n\nRead more about the nature of time and some of the philosophical issues which arise: https://iep.utm.edu/time/\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:39 A-Series & B-Series\n04:35 The A-Theory of Time\n05:34 The B-Theory of Time\n08:05 The Ontology of the A & B Theories\n11:13 Four Arguments Against Passage\n11:44 McTaggart's Paradox\n15:23 The Rate of Passage\n17:27 Einstein's Theory of Relativity\n20:07 Final Argument\n20:58 Could we Build a Device that detects Passage?\n23:07 Why No Physical Device can detect Passage\n25:25 Eddington on Experiencing Passage\n29:42 The Impossibility of Experiencing Passage\n39:56 Time does not Pass\n43:55 Summary\n\n#philosophy #time #philosophyoftime #metaphysics #epistemology #historyofphilosophy",

    "description": "In this sixth lecture, James Conant continues to discuss the Kantian problematic, and does so by discussing the work of John McDowell. He particularly focuses on the case of perception and then of action and intentions. In the case of perception, the problem involves avoiding the myth of the Given without thereby falling into an empty kind of coherentism or idealism.\n\nIn this series of lectures on varieties of philosophical skepticism, James Conant distinguishes between two forms of philosophical skepticism: Cartesian skepticism and Kantian skepticism. He discusses their general structure and shows how they're related. This sheds light on issues in various different areas, including within the philosophy of perception, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language.

Note, the audio has been slightly edited and improved.\n\n\"When Kant describes the understanding as a faculty of spontaneity, that reflects his view of the relation between reason and freedom: rational necessitation is not just compatible with freedom but constitutive of it. In a slogan, the space of reasons is the realm of freedom. But if our freedom in empirical thinking is total, in particular if it is not constrained from outside the conceptual sphere, that can seem to threaten the very possibility that judgements of experience might be grounded in a way that relates them to a reality external to thought. And surely there must be such grounding if experience is to be a source of knowledge, and more generally, if the bearing of empirical judgements on reality is to be intelligibly in place in our picture at all. The more we play up the connection between reason and freedom, the more we risk losing our grip on how exercises of concepts can constitute warranted judgements about the world. What we wanted to conceive as exercises of concepts threaten to degenerate into moves in a self-contained game.\" McDowell\n\n\"The idea of the Given is the idea that the space of reasons, the space of justifications or warrants, extends more widely than the conceptual sphere.\" McDowell\n\n00:00 Introduction \n07:33 Perception \n49:05 Action \n\nAll lectures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE8muoMpX8qQ-14zKnYPc5VI\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #skepticism #philosophyofmind #kant #historyofphilosophy",

    "description": "Robert Harrison and Adrian Daub discuss Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and his heirs a few years back in an episode of Entitled Opinions, a KZSU Stanford University program. http://french-italian.stanford.edu/op...\n\nHegel was one of the most important and influential 19th century German philosophers, best known for his dialectic, absolute idealism, and historicism, among various other things. The Hegelian dialectic is the process in which everything changes, based on the triad: thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Hegel's idealism rejected the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself and instead embraced a monistic vision of the world in which everything forms an organic, interconnected, rational whole. Nothing is true or real except the whole. Not only a thinker of totality, Hegel was a historicist thinker who rejected the notion that ideas are static and fixed (e.g. the concepts of human nature and morality, as well as the concept of reason itself). Things can only be understood by understanding their historical context, which, for Hegel, is a process which changes and develops, and which has an underlying meaning or significance. So not only is there history in reason, but there is reason in history. For Hegel, history progresses towards its endpoint of ever greater freedom, driven by alienation, that of constant conflict and struggle by way of this dialectical process.

    "description": "One of America’s most prominent philosophers says his field has been tilting at windmills for nearly 400 years. Representationalism (or indirect realism)---the idea that we don’t directly perceive external objects in the world, but only our own inner mental images or representations of objects---has bedeviled philosophy ever since Descartes, and now is mucking up neuroscience as well, John Searle alleges. He has long defended the “naive” alternative that our senses do actually give us direct access to external reality, and he fires his latest salvo in his new book “Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception”. John is well-known for his no nonsense approach to philosophical problems, and there was plenty of straight talk here as he discussed his theory of perception, the subjective-objective divide, the scientific study of consciousness, and his dog Tarski. \n\nThis interview was given a few years back by Robert Pollie which I quite like from a podcast called the 7th Avenue Project: www.7thavenueproject.com.\n\n#philosophy #epistemology #philosophyofmind #perception #consciousness #skepticism #mind",

He argues that ethical norms are not transcendent, but are already there, embodied within our social practice. Critique, he thinks, is the holding to account of practice to its professed ideals.\n\nJoshi Gottlieb discusses Marx and Morality with David Marjoribanks. Note, this is a re-upload.

    "description": "Professor Dan Robinson gives the final lecture in a series of 8 lectures on Thomas Reid's critique of David Hume at Oxford in 2014. “Like all other sciences, morals must have first principles, and all moral reasoning is based on them... In all rational belief, the thing believed is either a first principle or something inferred by valid reasoning from first principles”. As for utility, “Suppose that mice rescue the distressed person by chewing through the cords that bound him. Is there moral goodness in this act of the mice?” Beyond the armchair and other precincts of untrammeled speculation, one finds that, there is little purchase on a morality of pleasure and utility. Indded, “If what we call ‘moral judgment’ isn’t really a judgment but merely a feeling, it follows that the moral principles that we have been taught to consider as an immutable law to all intelligent beings have no basis except an arbitrary structure and fabric in the constitution of the human mind…Thus, by a change in our structure immoral things could become moral…There are beings who can’t perceive mathematical truths; but no defect, no error of understanding, can make what is true to be false”.\n\nUnder “David Hume”, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy begins with, “The most important philosopher ever to write in English”.

    "description": "Professor Dan Robinson gives the seventh in a series of 8 lectures on Thomas Reid's critique of David Hume at Oxford in 2014. In his Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals [1751], Hume states: “The final sentence, it is probable, which pronounces characters and actions amiable or odious, praise-worthy or blameable; that which stamps on them the mark of honour or infamy, approbation or censure; that which renders morality an active principle and constitutes virtue our happiness, and vice our misery; it is probable, I say, that this final sentence depends on some internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole species”. The ruling motives are shaped by considerations of utility. “The rage and violence of public war; what is it but a suspension of justice among the warring parties, who perceive, that this virtue is now no longer of any USE or advantage to them? The laws of war, which then succeed to those of equity and justice, are rules calculated for the ADVANTAGE and UTILITY…”\n\nUnder “David Hume”, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy begins with, “The most important philosopher ever to write in English”.

    "description": "Professor Dan Robinson gives the sixth in a series of 8 lectures on Thomas Reid's critique of David Hume at Oxford in 2014. In the third of his Essays on The Intellectual Powers of Man, Reid devotes the fourth chapter to the concept of 'identity', and the sixth chapter to Locke's theory of 'personal identity'. This latter chapter is widely regarded as a definitive refutation of the thesis that personal identity is no more than memories of a certain sort, less a “bundle of perceptions”. As he says, “This conviction of one’s own identity is utterly necessary for all exercise of reason. The operations of reason—whether practical reasoning about what to do or speculative reasoning in the building up of a theory—are made up of successive parts. In any reasoning that I perform, the early parts are the foundation of the later ones, and if I didn’t have the conviction that the early parts are propositions that I have approved or written down, I would have no reason to proceed to the later parts in any theoretical or practical project whatever”.\n\nUnder “David Hume”, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy begins with, “The most important philosopher ever to write in English”.

I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep, so long am I insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist.

    "description": "Audio recording of a 1973 lecture by Hilary Putnam as part of a symposium on \"Computers and the Mind\" at the University of California (Berkeley). \n\nThe question which troubles laymen, and which has long troubled philosophers, even if it is somewhat disguised by today's analytic style of writing philosophy, is this: Are we made of matter or soul-stuff? To put it as bluntly as possible, are we just material beings, or are we \"something more\"? In this talk, Hilary Putnam argues that this whole question rests on false assumptions. His purpose is not to dismiss the question, however, so much as to speak to the real concern which is behind the question. The real concern is, he thinks, with the autonomy of our mental life. People are worried that we may be debunked, that our behavior may be exposed as really explained by something mechanical. In this talk, part of what Hilary Putnam wants to do is to argue that this can't happen. Mentality is a real and autonomous feature of our world. But even more important is the fact that this whole question has nothing to do with our substance. Strange as it may seem to common sense and to sophisticated intuition alike, the question of the autonomy of our mental life does not hinge on and has nothing to do with that all too popular, all too old question about matter or soul-stuff. We could be made of Swiss cheese and it wouldn't matter. \n\n00:00 Searle Intro \n01:47 Lecture \n\n#philosophy #philosophyofmind #consciousness #philosophyofscience #mind",

    "description": "Ronald Dworkin gives a very brief, introductory overview of John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\" and Robert Nozick's \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" in an interview with Bryan Magee from 1977. Although both wrote very influential works of political philosophy, they came to quite different conclusions. Rawls famously put forward a novel argument for his position which made use of a thought experiment involving a hypothetical contract. Unlike other social contract theories though, Rawls added the further twist that the bargainers must be ignorant about certain facts about themselves which could bias them in their own favor (e.g. their race, gender, class, age, talents, etc.). In this way, ignorance is used as a device to guarantee impartiality in deciding how societies should be structured. After all, one cannot rig things to benefit oneself at the expense of others if one doesn't know what one's personal interests are or what one's position in society will be. Rawls argued that behind this so-called \"veil of ignorance\" people would agree to two principles, the most interesting being the difference principle, which states that economic inequalities can only be justified if they are to the benefit of the worst off in society. However, such a view was rejected by Nozick, who argued from a starting point of absolute rights of property which cannot be violated without one's consent. Despite such a strong principle, Nozick argued that there can still be a kind of minimal state, what he called a \"night-watchman state\", which protects property and person. One way to think of the difference in views between Rawls and Nozick (albeit this may be overly simplistic and even misleading in certain respects) is that while Nozick privileges liberty and rights over equality and fairness, Rawls instead privileges that of equality and fairness. (My Summary)\n\nThis clip is of Ronald Dworkin discussing the political thought of John Rawls and Robert Nozick in a 1977 interview with Bryan Magee.

Whatever I do is, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule...Any interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning.\" Wittgenstein\n\n\"This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule.\" Wittgenstein\n\n\"To think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately': otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it.\" Wittgenstein\n\n#philosophy #wittgenstein #bryanmagee #language #searle",

More Short Clips: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhP9EhPApKE8v8UVlc7JuuNHwvhkaOvzc\n\nExistentialists take human existence and the human condition to be a fundamental issue. They tend to be radical individualists who privilege our lived experience and choice. They focus on themes such as: freedom, authenticity, the individual, meaning, anxiety, alienation, death, dread, the absurd, contingency, and nihilism. They often are also suspicious of any fixed, pre-determined human nature, objective/universal values, and abstract philosophical systems. Some of the most important existentialist thinkers (or at least thinkers associated with existentialism) include Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Søren Kierkegaard, Simone de Beauvoir, Friedrich Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Albert Camus, and Karl Jaspers.

    "description": "Wittgenstein described some of his views as being the opposite of Socrates'. Socrates famously sought essential definitions for concepts such as Truth, Justice, Knowledge, Goodness, Beauty, etc. This search for the definition or essential nature of things (i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given concept) is the very paradigm of philosophical or conceptual analysis. But according to Wittgenstein, such abstract terms do not have or do not need to have an underlying essence which all the particular instances have in common. We understand the meaning of such terms enough to be able to use them, even if we cannot spell out their precise conditions. Indeed, things of the same kind need not share any underlying universal or common nature, but only a variety of overlapping similarities, which Wittgenstein famously called \"family resemblances\". In this way, Wittgenstein was something of a nominalist, rejecting essentialism. So too, while Socrates was always looking for deeper explanations, Wittgenstein was quite skeptical of this sort of intellectualism. For although the unexamined life is not worth living, the endlessly examined life is something that isn't even livable. \n\nThis talk was given by James Klagge at the Wittgenstein Archive at Bergen, University of Bergen, Norway, March 6, 2012. It is a re-upload. \n\n#philosophy #wittgenstein #socrates #plato #historyofphilosophy #epistemology",

    "description": "Audio recording of the second lecture by Ken Gemes on Nietzsche. Nietzsche claims that with the rejection of religious underpinning of the value of truth (e.g. truth as God’s word and as something absolute), we can now raise the question of why and to what extent we should value truth. He argues that our need for meaning conflicts with our will to truth because such a will tends to destroy all mythologies including the mythology of value – our will to truth reveals that values are not objectively 'out there' in the world, but are merely our own projections onto the world. This knowledge eviscerates the world of meaning. This does not mean that Nietzsche rejects the value of truth. He instead rejects the notion, inherited from the Judeo-Christian worldview, that truth is an unconditional value. Such a notion of truth, destructive of all myth and meaning, is unliveable. The very claim that the truth is valuable, even if not unconditionally valuable, is itself one of those myths that help give life meaning.\n\nYou can find the previous talk here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHShypzrqGw\n\nNote, this is a re-upload. \n\n00:00 Talk \n46:53 Q&A \n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #ethics #historyofphilosophy",

    "description": "Audio recording of the first of two lectures by Ken Gemes on Nietzsche. In this first talk, Ken Gemes introduces Nietzsche as the philosopher of the death of God. Nietzsche claims that we have not yet fully understood the ramifications of the modern rejection of belief in God. Giving up the belief in God undermines all our values, though many cling to those values in the absence of God or of any other justificatory basis for those values. When we truly appreciate the meaning of the death of God, we will, says Nietzsche, lapse into nihilism; the inability to find any foundation for values and meaning in the world. This Nietzsche presciently predicts as the future of Europe for the next two hundred years. Nietzsche does not endorse nihilism but seeks to move beyond it to a new affirmation of this world, the one and only world. But what does Nietzsche mean exactly by nihilism? This is discussed in the talk. \n\nThe next lecture by Ken Gemes on Nietzsche: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ejV1cHZL58\n\nNote, this is a re-upload. \n\n00:00 Talk \n31:42 Q&A \n\n#philosophy #nietzsche #nihilism #atheism #historyofphilosophy",

    "description": "Audio recording of a lecture by Jonathan Wolff on John Rawls' political philosophy. After discussing the detrimental influence of logical positivism on ethical and political discourse, Jonathan Wolff goes on to explain John Rawls' famous contractarian conception of justice. Rawls' argument takes the form of a thought experiment involving a hypothetical contract in which people are made ignorant about certain facts about themselves which could bias them in their own favor (e.g. their race, gender, class, age, talents, etc.). In this way, ignorance is used as a way to guarantee impartiality in deciding how societies should be set up. After all, one cannot rig things up to benefit oneself if one doesn't know what one's interests are or what one's position in society will be. Rawls argued that people behind this so-called \"veil of ignorance\" would agree to two principles of justice: the liberty principle and the difference principle. Jonathan Wolf explains these principles and the main arguments for and against them. (My Summary) \n\nNote, this is re-upload.

    "description": "A good introduction to the philosophy of mathematics by Ray Monk. He considers the issue of the nature of mathematical truth - what mathematics is actually about - and discusses the views of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Frege and Russell. What is mathematics about? Is mathematics something discovered or is it something invented or constructed by us? If numbers and mathematical objects are mere mental constructs, something invented by us, then why does mathematics work so well and seem to describe the world? On the other hand, if mathematical entities are \"out there\" in some sense waiting to be discovered, then what is their status and how do we get knowledge of them? After all, you can't see or touch numbers and other mathematical objects. And unlike ordinary empirical truths, mathematical truths seem to have a quite different and special status: they are a priori, necessary, eternal, universal, and absolutely certain. And this is why from the time of Plato onward, people have regarded mathematical truths as an ideal. In this talk, some of the ways in which philosophers have tried to account for the special nature of mathematical truth.

They destroyed the traditional notions of objective truth and validity in ethics with incalculable, all-pervasive results.

    "description": "Dan Robinson gives the final lecture in a series of 8 on Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Reason, properly disciplined, draws permissible inferences from the resulting concepts of the understanding. The outcome is knowledge. When rightly employed, the perceptual and cognitive powers match up the right way with the real world and ground the knowledge-claims of the developed sciences. However, there is a strong tendency to stretch these processes beyond the permissible boundaries and seek what Kant refers to as \"transcendental ideas\" that go beyond the realm of actual or possible experience.\n\nThis series looks at German Philosopher Immanuel Kant's seminal philosophical work 'The Critique of Pure Reason'. The lectures aim to outline and discuss some of the key philosophical issues raised in the book and to offer students and individuals thought provoking Kantian ideas surrounding metaphysics. Each lecture looks at particular questions raised in the work such as how do we know what we know and how do we find out about the world, dissects these questions with reference to Kant's work and discusses the broader philosophical implications. Anyone with an interest in Kant and philosophy will find these lectures thought provoking but accessible.\n\nThis is series of lectures was given in 2011 at Oxford.

    "title": "The Truth is Terrible - Nietzsche's Idea of an Aesthetic Justification for Existence",
    "description": "Brian Leiter discusses the thought of Nietzsche at Davidson College a few years back. The truth is terrible, Nietzsche tells us. There is no God, the universe lacks any ultimate meaning or purpose, and is filled with gratuitous pointless suffering. Our only relief comes with nonexistence upon death. Even the existence of the self, free will, objective value, and absolute truth and knowledge are wholly illusory. All forms & qualities are but mere human conventions, subjective expressions of our competing drives. The unquenchable desire for objectivity is the drive to transcend our finite bodily existence and grab hold of something universal, absolute, unchanging, and God-like. But there simply is none. So it is all too easy to become disillusioned and fall into an abyss of anguish and despair, turning away from existence and the drives, as suggested by the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer. But Nietzsche urges against this turning away from life. For Nietzsche, existence is justified, but only as an aesthetic phenomenon. But what does this mean exactly? Brian Leiter explains.

    "description": "A clip of Hannah Arendt from her 1964 interview with Günter Gaus. Among other things, she discusses the dethroning of the community spirit by the modern age and with it the prime importance of the political and the shrinkage of the public realm, which is associated with the uprooting of the masses and the resulting isolation and atomism in the modern world (something which, by the way, she thought made possible totalitarianism in the 20th century, both from the right and the left). She also touches on the labor-consumption process, the public sphere, and the increasing inability to act publicly in the modern world. \n\nFull Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVSRJC4KAiE\n\n#philosophy #hannaharendt #politicaltheory #politicalphilosophy",

    "title": "The Problem of Free Will",
    "description": "A talk given by professor Pamela Hieronymi on the problem of free will and moral responsibility a few years back at the University of Alabama.\n\n\"Among the grandest of philosophical puzzles is a riddle about moral responsibility. Almost all of us believe that each one of us is, has been, or will be responsible for at least some of our behavior. But how can this be so if determinism is true and all our thoughts, decisions, choices, and actions are simply droplets in a river of deterministic events that began its flow long, long before we were ever born? The specter of determinism, as it were, devours agents, for if determinism is true, then arguably we never initiate or control our actions; there is no driver in the driver's seat; we are simply one transitional link in an extended deterministic chain originating long before our time. The puzzle is tantalizingly gripping and ever so perplexing — because even if determinism is false, responsibility seems impossible: how can we be morally accountable for behavior that issues from an 'actional pathway' in which there is an indeterministic break? Such a break might free us from domination or regulation by the past, but how can it possibly help to ensure that the reins of control are now in our hands?\" Ishtiyaque Haji \n\n#philosophy #freewill #determinism #materialism #metaphysics #causality #philosophyofmind #causation #psychology #mind",
