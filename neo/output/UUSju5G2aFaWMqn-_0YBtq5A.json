We'll give it a try next year! ---\n\nFor people P1 to Pn.\n\nGoals of the system:\n- no central authority needed\n- can be done remotely with no hidden information\n- does not give anyone their own name\n- no one malicious actor can do anything to exploit the system without risk of breaking everything\n\nBe as random as possible. No new random number can match any already on the list.\n\nSTAGE 0: POPULATE THE LIST\n\nEveryone adds a pair of random numbers, shuffles the list, and passes it on.\n\nSTAGE 1: DO THE SHUNT\n\nP1 shuffles the list and then shunts the pairs along one space to form new pairs (last number wraps to first number).\n\nEveryone from P2 to Pn-1 uses a 50% probability of also shunting an extra space in the same direction. Pn definitely does not shunt.\n\nNo one shuffles. Everyone replaces their random numbers.\n\nSTAGE 2: THE CHECK\n\nEveryone looks to see where their numbers are and remembers their exact location. If they move at any point from now on, a player should raise the alarm that the system has been compromised.\n\nNo one shuffles. Everyone replaces their random numbers.\n\nSTAGE 3: THE BIG REVEAL\n\nEveryone replaces their 'left numbers' (aka 'receiver IDs') with their name of any other agreed system for identifying people. The other number is replaced with a new random number, no one shuffles.\n\nSTAGE 4: THE READ OUT\n\nGoes around the loop again with everyone looking to see whose name their random number is paired with. This is who they buy a gift for. They then cover their tracks by swapping out the random number for a new one.\n\n\n--- And for completeness, here is the protocol exactly as we tried it in this video. ---\n\nSTAGE 0: POPULATE THE LIST\n\nEveryone adds a pair of random numbers, shuffles the list, and passes it on.\n\nSTAGE 1: DO THE SHUNT\n\nP1 shuffles the list and then shunts the pairs along one space to form new pairs (last number wraps to first number).\n\nSTAGE 2: SWAP THE LIST\n\nEveryone replaces their first random number with their name and their second random number with a new random number.\n\nSTAGE 3: THE BIG REVEAL\n\nGoes around the loop again with everyone looking to see whose name their random number is paired with.

Things like \"=B4/B2\" should have been \"=B4/$B$2\" so I could drag the formula down. We took that out in the interest of clarity.\n- Yes, at 13:20 I say \"the divisor ceases to lose some of its strict meaning\" which is the opposite of what I meant! the sentence needs but the one negative. Either of these would work: \"the divisor loses some of its strict meaning\" OR \"the divisor ceases to have some of its strict meaning\".\n- Sorry, at 16:47 column D is wrong. These are different numbers using 880 but the values over in E use the correct 930. It's just a display issue and does not change the results (despite being a bit confusing!). Spotted by a few people including Thomas Klemm  and AverageJon.\n- People have mentioned that Theorem 2 (and the conclusion) from this 1974 paper by Balinski & Young has an Alabama-paradox-beating method. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.71.11.4602\n- Let me know if you spot anything else.\n\nFilming and editing by Alex Genn-Bash\nAnimations by William Marler http://wmad.co.uk/\nVoice work by Ben Moor and Destin Sandlin.

In the moment I was just talking about the sphere and the torus but loads of other shapes have an Euler Characteristic of zero. Like the cylinder.\n- I'm undecided if the string method of thinking about holes at 17:04 was helpful. I could have talked about the dimension of the boundary manifold, but that felt like I was repeating the previous bit too much and wanted a different way to think about it.

The on-screen number is correct. I noticed too late to fix it!\n- At 21:09 I say Diaz and O’Rourke found an unfolding of the Dali cross which tiles the plane.

Sorry! It broke when the video was render and because it was only in the middle I didn't spot it once it had uploaded.\n- At 07:45 I imply that you might start dealing from the bottom of the deck (obviously I would never dream of such a thing). But the structure is the same as dealing from the top. It was just easier to see from the 'bottom' of the face-up cards.\n- 14:01I am inconsistent with \"second card in\" and \"first card in\". In both cases I mean the second card along. Which is the first card 'in'.\n- Let me know if you spot any mistakes in this version!\n\nThanks to my Patreon supporters who I used to justify spending several weeks learning how to do a faro shuffle.

If you are reading this you most likely regularly watch my videos and know that I put corrections here. But the comment section on this video has been, to put it lightly, \"wild\". I don't think anyone is checking the corrections here! So I'm going to break with tradition and put the corrections in a pinned comment. But in short:\n- I should have said I used the Chicago data (instead of a swing state, let's say) because that is what people claiming election fraud were using. I didn't pick it myself to make a point.\n- Foolishly I cut a bit of the video where I talk about how Trump's data is also a bad Benford fit but that massive spike of 1s makes it look like a good match. Check out how low 3, 4 and 5 are.\n- There has been specific criticism of aspects of that paper I read from, but only the usual back-and-forth of academics. Everyone agrees with the idea that Benford is not a magic tool to detect election fraud (nor is any statistical tool really; they all require careful interpretation).\n- As always, let me know if you spot any other mistakes.\n\nThanks to my Patreon supporters who mean I can spend TWO DAYS trawling through election stats and making plots.

    "description": "Jane Street are still offering amazing internships: https://jane-st.co/SUM-internships \n\nA Podcast of Unnecessary Detail is out now: https://festivalofthespokennerd.com/podcast/ Come for the Unnecessary Detail, stay for the A Podcast Of. \n\nThese are my approximation equations:\nperimeter ≈ π[53a/3 + 717b/35 - √(269a^2 + 667ab + 371b^2)] \nperimeter ≈ π(6a/5 + 3b/4) \n\nIf you can do better, submit it to Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJSHdJX6gB0\nhttps://www.think-maths.co.uk/ellipsepuzzle\n\nThis was my pervious video featuring ellipsoids:\nhttps://youtu.be/l51LcwHOW7s\n\nYou can buy the ellipse from this video on eBay.

These are the people in the video:\n\nHelen Arney\nSteve Hardwick\nVictoria Saigle\nAndrew McLaren\nFractal\nMacey\nSören Kowalick\n\nIt all started because of a request I put out on twitter.\nhttps://twitter.com/standupmaths/status/1301252952930299904\n\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- So far the only times (I've noticed that) I say \"eclipse\" instead of \"ellipse\" are 5:01 and 05:26 which was just after talking about my wife who is a solar physicist. So I think we split the blame 50/50.\n- It seems everyone but me recognised the Root Mean Square. I think I only associate that with current for some reason! Thanks all.\n- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes!\n\n\nThanks to my Patreons who meant I could spend about a week trying to find approximations for the length of ellipses. \"Are you still working on that?\" Lucie would - rightfully - ask over the weekend. \"I'm going the extra mile for my patreon people!\" I would reply.

But then at the end you are again substituting on the equation. The resulting equation is correct but that minus sign is there not because of v_e. It is there because your dm is negative that your rocket is losing mass. So should be placed in derivation.\"\n- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes!\n\nThanks to my Patreons whose generous funding I used for a vacation to Cocoa Beech Florida NO REFUNDS.\n\n(Or maybe everyone involved donated their time, covered their own expenses and my Patreons only had to pay for that flip-chart. True story: I bought that flip-chart in the USA as it seemed silly to fly one over from the UK and afterwards the NASA outreach team kept it, which I think means it officially 'works at NASA'.

Yes indeed: I should have made it clearer in the video we were ignoring elliptical orbits as near-Earth is pretty much perfectly circular.\n- And people are very upset I said I was in Orlando. Which was my fault: I meant to say “near Orlando” to help non-USA people orient themselves. I figured more people know where Orlando is (roughly) than Cape Canaveral.

It wasn't a dungeon, it was a wine bar all along! (An amazing wine bar at that; definitely visit it next time you're in London (and things are open again)). https://www.gordonswinebar.com/\n\nAlso: this was filmed back in February 2020 pre-coronavirus (at least before we knew about it). Which is why we're sat so close together and not wearing masks. And people are phoning a wine bar.\n\nFor those of you want it all, and you want it now, we've put the complete, unedited footage of Matt and Grant completing the puzzle scenario on Matt's second channel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEDZyK8UL6M\n\nWe'll put the deleted footage on the Stand-up Maths patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/posts/39003911\n\nSorry the audio is a bit hit and miss. Matt's microphone dropped out for a bit so we tried to rescue the audio from Grant's lapel mic. With some success.\n\nPuzzle as emailed by Grant to Matt:\nPrisoner 1 walks in, sees a chessboard where each square has a coin on top, flipped either to heads or tails.  The warden places the key under one of the squares, which prisoner 1 sees.  Before he leaves, he must turn over one and only one coin.  Prisoner 2 then walks in and is supposed to be able to figure out which squares the key is in just by looking at the arrangement of coins.\n\nThis is the website Matt mentioned with a full breakdown of the solution and interactive boards you can play with.\nhttp://datagenetics.com/blog/december12014/index.html\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- At 20:42 when I (Matt) said \"You're now assigning a 64-dimension...\" he meant to say \"You're now assigning a 6-dimension...\".

Here they all are:\n- I misspoke around 01:13 when I said \"negative one, zero\" as it is clearly \"negative one, one, zero\".\n- At 07:53 I mean the negative values -5 to 0. I said it a weird way.\n- My language at about the 1D input to 2D plot from 09:17 is a bit sloppy. The real values going into the Binet function are not the horizontal axis shown; the plot onscreen is solely the output.\n- I say \"axis\" when I mean \"plane\" or even \"complex plane\". The big flat thing.\nLet me know if you spot anything else!\n\nThanks again, as always, for Jane Street being my principal sponsor.\nhttps://www.janestreet.com/\n\nThanks to my Patreon supports who do support these videos and make them possible.

Katherine Fleck was our expert shooter with infinite patience.\nhttp://cura.soc.srcf.net/\n\nIf you have other suggestions for calculating the speed of a bullet: let me know!\n\nCORRECTIONS\n- At 3:17 the close-up shows the sliding box already taped to a piece of paper. I only noticed when uploading that we had used this shot from later in the day by accident. It should have been the shot of the box sliding off the pendulum platform. Our solution to fix this problem was to tape it to a piece of paper.\n- A few people have asked why we didn’t use a “chronograph”. We did actually use one which detects the movement of the bullet using infrared sensors. But the .22 bullet was too small to trip them.\n - People have commented that we didn’t need to use the equation for the period as we know the length of the pendulum and the value of g. But the period is really easy to measure accurately by letting the pendulum swing for ages. Length could be measured fairly accurately (guessing the centre of mass) but g would require an extra assumption.\n- Let me know if you spot anything else!\n\n\nThanks to my Patreon supports who do support these videos and make them possible.

    "description": "BUY IT! https://shop.festivalofthespokennerd.com/\n\nIf you think you know how we filmed this: comment below. I bet you're wrong.\n\nFilming a stand-up show (even without a stupid extra feature) takes untold effort and money, which foolishly we supplied all ourselves. So we'd love it if you could exchange money for a copy.\n\nGet the show from £π direct from https://shop.fotsn.com on download, DVD or floppy disk.\n\nFloppy disk is a genuine unique-numbered disk from the full set of 227 it takes to store the show. Comes with a free HD download if you're a quitter!\n\nOr search on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Video, Xbox and YouTube Movies if you just want the show and you want it now. Sadly this is without the unboxing video as there was no easy way to add it to the main show. Which is partly why I put it up on my channel separately so no one misses out.\n\nActually, the big feature of having it as a traditional DVD extra is that we could split it into two chapters and set the second chapter to loop. So while this version on youtube stops around 11 minutes, the DVD version will keep looping until the laser burns through the disc. It's just that versatile.\n\nHey, and thanks for reading all of this description! I didn't get to add any chat to the main video so I'm putting it all down here. I appreciate you letting me vent.\n\n\nCORRECTIONS\n- The two seconds of black at the beginning is deliberate because it is the file directly from the DVD. I decided to not edit and recompress it but rather leave it exactly the same as what is on the disc.\n- Let me know if you spot anything else!\n\n\n\nSupport my channel and I can make more maths videos and fewer unboxing videos.\nhttps://www.patreon.com/standupmaths\n\n\nConcept and writing by Matt Parker\nDevelopment and production by Helen Arney\nAssistance from Lucie Green\nFilming and editing by Pete Callow\nProgramming and tech support from Seb Lee-Delisle\nMoral support from Steve Mould\n\n\nMATT PARKER: Stand-up Mathematician\nWebsite: http://standupmaths.com/\nMaths book: http://makeanddo4D.com/\nNerdy maths toys: http://mathsgear.co.uk/",

    "description": "Jen Rogers is a statistics researcher and lecturer at the University of Oxford.\nhttps://www.jenniferrogers.co.uk/\n\nWe chat about how the scoring system works on Strictly Come Dancing (“Dancing With the Stars” in the USA and other countries). The UK system for dealing with ties is unfair!\n\nJen and I do Maths Inspiration shows together.\nhttp://www.mathsinspiration.com/\n\nWe’re out doing The Curious Coincidence of Maths in the Daytime in Melbourne next February.\nhttps://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2018/education/curious-maths-in-the-day-time\n\n\nResults from Judges votes Saturday 2 December 2017\n\nJoint first: Alexandra & Gorka\nJoint first: Debbie & Giovanni\nSecond place: Joe & Katya\nThird place: Mollie & AJ\nJoint last: Gemma & Aljaž\nJoint last: Davood & Nadiya\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/strictlycomedancing/entries/34fb3f42-2210-4080-a01f-962719269386\n\nAfter being combined with the audience rankings the bottom two were Alexandra & Gorka and Davood & Nadiya. But if the ties were done properly that could have been Gemma & Aljaž instead of Alexandra & Gorka.\n\nIf you have a way to get us the data from the BBC, send me an anonymous email! matt@standupmaths.com\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- Shimassi and others have made very important points about how this system favours the public vote. Because a tie means the judges accidentally give extra points to the contestants they’re trying to rank at the bottom.\n\nThis is my fault for not being clear enough. When we said things like “skewing it towards the judges” and “inflating the judges’s score” we are talking about there being more points being given. Not that the judges were getting their way. Sorry I did a bad job of talking about that and my language was not precise enough.\n\nJen’s main example was that the contestant ranked top by the judges was unfairly moved to the bottom two (and into the dance-off) because the public got their way.\n\nIn short: the audience can always penalise someone by given them one vote, the judges can’t always do that.\n\nAnother interesting fairness metric is that someone top-ranked by the judges and bottom-ranked by the audience should be exactly equal to someone bottom-ranked by the judges and top-ranked by the public. But if there is a tie for the judges the audience choice gets an unfair advantage.\n\n- Others have pointed out (and David Heath sent a great email to me) that Strictly once had a system like what we describe but they got into trouble because people were paying to phone in and vote for a contestant when it was mathematically impossible for them to be voted out of the dance-off. And the BBC can’t have a phone-in competition if some votes cannot make a difference.\n\nThis makes for an interesting set of criteria. The voting system needs to be fair, easy to explain to a TV audience and the audience vote is always able to move any given contestant out of the bottom two.\n\n\nThanks to my Patreon supporters who made this possible.

Sorry, that was me combining two bits of research without thinking! I should have spotted the jarring mismatch of odd and even intervals and realised I was not bring consistent. Pointed out by loads of people, the first of which was TheActualNuttmegger.\n- The 22 year prime gap ended in the 1970s, not started then (1951 to 1973). Spotted by Scottish Chemist.\n- For fact 17, it is actually the permutations for n=7, not 8; caught by trigonzobob. The permutation conditions are also more complicated that I managed to explain as well (\"without double falls\"). Check out http://oeis.org/A049774\n- Let me know if you spot anything else.\n\nThanks to my patreon supporters!

    "description": "I look at the historical quirks which gave us TV at 29.97 frames per second. In North America at least. It's a comfortable 25 fps in Europe.\n\nMore on that thing I mentioned at the end of the video here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/standupmaths\n\nHere is the spherical video I was making with Henry Segerman which made me research NTSC frame rates in the first place:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp12c3-IL-I\n\nYes, technically, if you divide 4,500,000 by 286 you get a horizontal frequency of 15,734.26573 lines per second. That matches a frame rate of 29.97002997002997… and so old TVs used 30/1.001 = 29.97002997002997…\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- A lot of people pointing out that increasing the number of horizontal lines without increasing the bandwidth would be a loss of resolution. Which is a good point.\n\n\nMusic by Howard Carter\nDesign by Simon Wright\n\nMATT PARKER: Stand-up Mathematician\nWebsite: http://standupmaths.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/standupmaths\nNerdy maths toys: http://mathsgear.co.uk/",

    "description": "Watch the full integration! Worth it even just for the Simple Harmonic Motion which drops out at the end. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUkCI1M6h_8\n\nTry the ISS challenge! Will you get there before the after the International Space Station orbits half-way around the planet? Even if you don’t try to work it out, you can have a guess at the outcome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y64IHy1MGRQ\n\nPython code that I used is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbwymdxjz47bsrs/Earth_fall.py?dl=0\n\nMy values:\n\nR = 6,371,000 m (radius of the Earth)\nG = 6.674 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 (gravitational constant)\nM = 5.972 × 10^24 kg (mass of Earth)\n\nYes, people have since pointed out a similar topic was covered in a Minute Physics video. They skip over the \"constant stuff\" and how the mathematics is derived, but it’s a great look at how the density changes within the Earth and how that impacts the travel time. Well worth checking out as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urQCmMiHKQk\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- I accidentally wrote \"v\" instead \"s\" on the board in \"s = ut + ½at^2\". First spotted by Joel Low.\n- Around 9:30 I used a dot for both 1,000's and decimal point. The first should be a comma. Spotted by Mezgrman.\n- I normally play pretty fast and loose with centripetal force vs centrifugal effect; I think arguing about the difference is not useful so I often use them as synonyms. In this case, as Wayne Ernst politely pointed out, I should have said \"centripetal force\" not \"centrifugal force\".

If anyone can email me an Atomic Mosquito proof ( matt@standupmaths.com ) which does not contain any circular logic, I'll do a follow-up video.\n\nThis is PrimeGrid: http://www.primegrid.com/\n\nIf you missed them, here are the 26 primes which are all 5,283,234,035,979,900 apart:\n\n43142746595714191\n48425980631694091\n53709214667673991\n58992448703653891\n64275682739633791\n69558916775613691\n74842150811593591\n80125384847573491\n85408618883553391\n90691852919533291\n95975086955513191\n101258320991493091\n106541555027472991\n111824789063452891\n117108023099432791\n122391257135412691\n127674491171392591\n132957725207372491\n138240959243352391\n143524193279332291\n148807427315312191\n154090661351292091\n159373895387271991\n164657129423251891\n169940363459231791\n175223597495211691",

It occurs in eight-year pairs, but then with gaps of over 100 years between those pairs.\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n\nOk, so I mistaked a few words. There's an early \"2017\" that should have been \"2117\" and at least one \"day\"/\"year\" swap. I really was recording that right before the transit and only had time for one take.\n\nMore importantly, I said that 105.5 years before the next transit meant it would be mid-way through 2117. Actually, 105.5 years from now is the end (December) of 2117.\n\nFinally, I made a lot of simplifications, including setting my spreadsheet to use this 2012 transit as the zero-point for the sweet-spots. All improvements welcome!",
