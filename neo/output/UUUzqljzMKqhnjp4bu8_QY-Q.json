    "description": "Nehemiah and Noami took two different approaches to the Bible's teaching on Moabites.  Which one brought blessing?  Katherine Johnson joins me to discuss the dialogical way of interpreting scripture, and how it might help us understand how we should treat the Moabites.  Could this also have application to LGBTQ inclusion in the church?  \n\nKatherine Johnson earned her B.A. in Christian Ministries from Spring Arbor University and has over 20 years of ministry experience in a wide variety of fields, both in churches and parachurch organizations. She has also earned an M.A. in Biblical and Theological Studies from Western Seminary and a Th.M. from Columbia Theological Seminary with a focus on Hebrew and Old Testament exegesis. \n\nAre you an LGBTQ Christian looking for help to see yourself in light of God's love?

Finally, the truth about what the Bible says is hitting the mainstream through Kirk Cameron.  I'll discuss the significance of this and clear up any remaining doubts about hell.  God is not sending anyone to a place of eternal conscious torment in hell.  \n\nNot sure?

    "description": "Dr. Sy Garte discusses how Darwinian evolution has been a major point of contention, leading both scientists and Christians to mistakenly believe that science and the Bible are at odds. However, Dr. Garte asserts that evolution is irrelevant to the true harmony between faith and science. In fact, groundbreaking new discoveries in biology are offering stronger evidence than ever for a purposeful creator God.\n\nGet Dr. Garte's book, Beyond Evolution at this link:\nhttps://a.co/d/6ZKeBIr\n\nIn his book, \"Beyond Evolution,\" Dr. Garte integrates the latest scientific research with a biblical perspective to explore several key ideas:\n\nEvolution by natural selection isn't as central to biological science as commonly perceived, and the disagreements it has caused are detrimental to the Church.\n\nMisinterpretations of both the Bible and science have led many to needlessly abandon their Christian faith.\n\nEmerging evidence of purpose, agency, and decision-making at the cellular level strongly suggests a creator God.\n\nThe origins of life and human consciousness demonstrate that a purely materialistic and reductionist view of life is unsustainable and ignores recent scientific breakthroughs.\n\n\"Beyond Evolution\" challenges both scientific and faith communities to pursue truth wherever it may lead, powerfully arguing that the evidence points towards a belief in a Creator.\n\nSy (Seymour) Garte, PhD in biochemistry, has been a tenured professor at New York University, Rutgers University, and the University of Pittsburgh, division director at the Center for Scientific Review of the National Institutes of Health, and interim vice president for research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

    "description": "Let's talk about the one thing that seems to be hindering many Christians from becoming gay-affirming:  They are afraid to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit who is guiding them to fully embrace gay people as they are.  I often hear Christians say, \"But the Holy Spirit would never contradict what is written in Scripture.\"  Where did that idea come from?  The Holy Spirit has contradicted Scripture- we've got a record of it in Scripture!  Let's not be afraid to follow what the Bible tells us about the Holy Spirit:  He will guide us in all truth.  In this video, I'll discuss the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Scripture that supports it.  Then we'll talk about how you can hear from the Holy Spirit about what the Lord's will is regarding gay marriage.\n\nOther videos that might be helpful:\nBiblical Support for Gay Marriage: https://youtube.com/live/qRvvC0htAg8\nHomosexuality: https://youtu.be/QLn1xUENbWc\nTrans: https://youtu.be/tkkWPDz2TfI\nLonger explanation: https://youtu.be/dUPJdGInxuI\nChristians, Slavery, and LGBTQ: https://youtube.com/live/nwCZv8znJdY\nGay Deliverance Minister: https://youtu.be/pXZhN5J6bhY\nGay couple who love Jesus: https://youtube.com/live/tQSmwx-1SBg\nResources: https://reformationproject.org/\n https://karenkeen.com/resources-on-sexuality/ https://canyonwalkerconnections.com/library/resources/\n https://geekyjustin.com/videos/\nhttps://www.centerpeace.net\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

Some Christians teach that we have authority to heal, and others believe that God alone is responsible for healing miracles if they occur.  Some Christians don't expect miraculous healing because it hasn't been part of their experience as a Christian.

    "description": "I'm a charismatic Christian who loves the Holy Spirit.  In Charismatic and Pentecostal churches there is a phenomenon where people fall down when someone prays for them.   This phenomenon is often referred to as being \"slain in the Spirit\".  Many Christians are skeptical about this phenomenon and wonder:  Is this really the Holy Spirit causing people to fall down?  What is this all about?  What is the benefit?  In this video, I'll share my experience with the phenomenon of being slain in the Spirit.

    "description": "How did Christians become anti-slavery?  The Bible does not specifically say that slavery is wrong.  So how is it that Christians today universally forbid slavery?  From the beginning of Christianity, there were church fathers who wrote that slavery was against God's will.  Abolitionists believed slavery was against God's will.  How did they know?  The same way they knew slavery was wrong, is the same way Christians today can know that God wants us to affirm the LGBTQ+ community and gay marriage.  Christians who oppose homosexuality on the basis of what the Bible says should also be pro-slavery. Let's talk about it!\n@InspiringPhilosophy I'd love to hear your response.

    "title": "A Miracle That Will Make You Angry- but Might Change Your Life",
    "description": "I will be sharing a miracle that I personally experienced.  When I've shared this experience with people, even Christian friends and family (who believe in miracles) usually have a negative reaction or just don't believe it.  I expect that many people will be angry when I share this experience.  Since I know that it will upset people, why should I share it?  The reason I'm sharing it is because I want people to know the truth about the way God works in the world.  And if my story is true, it could profoundly change the way you live.  I'm still in the process of letting this experience change the way I live and behave.  \r\n\r\nI expect that most people who watch this will not believe the miracle I share.  That's okay!  I understand that it is really hard to believe and it is totally natural to prefer alternative explanations.  Even my own husband didn't believe when I first told him- he had to experience it for himself.  So if my own husband who trusts my honesty didn't believe, I don't expect you to believe either!  But I'm sharing my true experience to the best of my ability, exactly as it happened.  Thanks!\n\n*A correction to something I said later in the video:  I talked about Jenny getting healed, but actually, I think it might have been Gina who experienced the miracle I mentioned about the mouth surgery.  \r\n\r\nHere are some other videos I've made on a similar topic:\r\nWhere is the God of miracles today?  https://youtu.be/9XC7ugQE9dw\r\nGod is inviting you to be a superhero:  https://youtu.be/LC7tP17a51I\r\n\r\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "description": "Would you be surprised to discover that there are gender non-binary heroes in the Bible?  Of course, the term gender non-binary is not used, but the word that indicated that someone did not fit neatly into the category of male or female was \"eunuch.\"  The Bible has a lot to say about eunuchs, including a beautiful promise from God.  \nOther videos discussing God's love for lgbtq people:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUPJdGInxuI&t=2324s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NFOVwvcVqc\nhttps://youtu.be/tkkWPDz2TfI\n\n*Several people have challenged my use of the term non-binary with my references to eunuchs in this video.  Many eunuchs identified as male, but the term eunuch seems to also apply to others that did not fit a category of male or female.  While not all non-binary people are eunuchs and not all eunuchs are non-binary, there is no word in ancient language that captures the same concept as non-binary today, and eunuch is the best term in the ancient cultures to describe people who differed from the gender binary in some way.  I realize that some people may still disagree with my characterization.

God killed the firstborn of the Egyptians, he killed children (presumably) in the flood during Noah's time, and God ordered the Israelites to kill the Canaanites- including children.  Would a good God do such a thing?  I'm going to tell you why I believe these things are true of God and why I still trust that he is good.  \r\n\r\nAndrew Young and Nata are the inspiration for this video.

    "description": "Romans chapter 10 says, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?\"  \n\nDoes this mean people cannot be saved if they don't hear about Jesus Christ?

    "title": "What ChatGPT Told Me About Hell",
    "description": "Can AI make an argument against hell using the Bible?  When I asked ChatGPT to make a Biblical argument against hell, here's what it said:\n\n\"There are several biblical arguments that have been put forth against the concept of eternal punishment in hell. One argument is based on the idea of God's love and mercy. Many Christians believe that God is a loving and merciful God who would not condemn anyone to eternal punishment. This belief is supported by passages such as John 3:16, which states \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" This passage suggests that God's ultimate desire is for people to have eternal life, rather than eternal punishment.\n\nAnother argument is based on the idea of repentance and forgiveness. Christians believe that God is a forgiving God who is willing to forgive anyone who repents of their sins. This belief is supported by passages such as Luke 15:7, which states \"there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.\" This passage suggests that God is eager to forgive those who repent, rather than punishing them eternally.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of hell as eternal punishment is not clearly stated in the bible, it's more of a concept that has been developed through the centuries based on different interpretations of scriptural passages. Some biblical scholars argue that the passages that are often used to support the concept of eternal punishment in hell can be interpreted differently, and that they may not necessarily imply eternal punishment.\n\nIt's important to point out that those are arguments based on religious belief and scriptural interpretation, and different individuals may have different interpretations of the bible.\"\n\nMore videos on the Biblical argument against hell:\nhttps://youtu.be/16vSvJjRE9c \nhttps://youtu.be/-0whZoLj50A\nhttps://youtu.be/_Gqw-hOAZkk\n\nhttps://www.truthaccordingtoscripture.com/documents/death/wicked.php#.YZp1LdDMJPY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/rethinkinghell/videos\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "title": "Are Christians Unable to Stop Sinning?",
    "description": "Sea Wolf writes:  Hey, Rebekah --- do you feel like Christians are in a state of being whereby they are simply unable to not sin? \r\nI question the value of the belief proposition when I hear Christians expound on the benefits of the system, while simultaneously seemingly unable to avoid sinning, to whatever degree. \r\nI don't consider these actions they are referring to as \"sin\" (whatever those actions may be). \r\nThey consider themselves sinful --- not me. \r\nSo, I question the sincerity of any Christian seemingly unable to stop doing whatever it is they feel so bad about. \r\nHow can a Christian \"spit at the feet\" of Jesus knowing how much it pains their loving creator? \r\nDoes this imply that a sinful Christian would also cheat on their perfectly loving partner? \r\nI'm not understanding what value all of these beliefs hold, if devoted Christians in direct relationship with Jesus and an all-mighty creator, KNOWING what they are commanded to do... would still ever choose to sin. \r\nSounds like Christians are saying that they are simply programmed like robots to sin... by their designer.\r\nDo Christians lack the Free Will to not sin?  Can't they control themselves. Can you not avoid choosing the \"wrong\" thing? \r\nAm I missing something? \r\nIf so, please let me know the contradiction in my depiction and questions. \r\nThanks --\r\n\r\nThis was a great comment and I feel it deserves a video response.

    "description": "Natalie Latzka will be sharing her research findings on the topic of the Kingdom of God.  Growing up Christian, Natalie was confused by the church’s direction on Salvation Theology which teaches that the purpose of Jesus’ life on Earth was to die for our sins, to absorb God’s wrath and satisfy his requirement for justice which was given to us in grace.  As Natalie sought answers to difficult theological questions, she rediscovered Jesus’ good news message, written all over the pages of the gospels, proclaiming the Kingdom of God.  Join us in exploring the Kingdom message, understanding how it completes the story the Bible, how it complements the gift of salvation and provides us the opportunity to live a life filled with purpose and adventure in that Kingdom now and for eternity to come.\r\n\r\nNatalie Latzka is the author of a book called Navigating True North which documents her journey from a place she refers to as blind magnetic-north faith to a place of bold evidence-based faith.  She leverages her 24 years as a professional research attorney to find evidence to support what she believes about God and why she believes it and her many years of experience trekking in the mountains to keep her navigating in the direction of true north.  Natalie and her husband Scott live just south of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Together they have a blended family, including six children and three grandsons.\r\n\r\nVisit Natalie's website here:\r\nhttps://www.natalielatzka.com\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Natalie's YouTube channel:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNyiCfDyKaGzRHDKCY8JCcw\r\n\r\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "description": "Lance S. Bush is a philosopher with a focus on metaethics.

Have Lance's efforts to convert me finally succeeded?  Join us to hash out my final questions and potential objections to moral antirealism, and find out if I'm ready to convert.  \n@lanceindependent \nFind Lance on Youtube here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@lanceindependent\n\r\nCheck out Lance S.

    "title": "Were the Gospels Anonymous?",
    "description": "How do we know that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote the gospels?  Matthew never says, \"I am an eyewitness and I wrote this gospel.\"  Does that mean the gospels were written anonymously?  No.  There is a great deal of evidence that the gospel authors were always known, and that the titles, \"The gospel according to Matthew (Mark, Luke, and John)\" were always there.  The gospels were copied and distributed widely.  If they had been written anonymously and titled later, we should find some manuscripts that have titles attributed to different authors.  There is not a single manuscript that ever attributes one of the gospels to a different writer.  In an age of no telephone, and no quick way to communicate, how would the churches in so many different regions all collaborate to add the same titles?  We have very good reason to believe that the gospels were not anonymous and that the authors were known from the beginning.  \n\nCheck out a great paper on this topic:\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jts/article-abstract/69/2/447/5101372\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "title": "Eternal Torment in Hell?  Looking at What the Bible Says with Chris Date (Rethinking Hell)",
    "description": "What does the Bible say about people being tormented forever in hell?  Would you be surprised to discover that the answer is NOTHING?  Join me for a discussion with hell expert, Chris Date, who will hopefully put the final nail in the coffin so you can be comforted with the knowledge that God is not putting anyone in a place to be tortured in flames forever.  \r\n\r\nChris Date is Adjunct Professor of Bible and Theology at Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary and co-editor of Rethinking Hell: Readings in Evangelical Conditionalism (Cascade, 2014) and A Consuming Passion (Pickwick, 2015). A full-time software engineer, Chris believes theology and apologetics are for every average joe in the pews, and not just for pastors, philosophers, PhD’s and the erudite in ivory towers. Formerly a traditionalist, he became convinced of the biblical view of final punishment over the course of a process which began when he interviewed Edward Fudge, and he has since defended the view in several debates and on Justin Brierley's Unbelievable? radio program on Premier Christian Radio UK. Chris is also a steward of the Rethinking Hell project.\r\n\r\nVisit Chris Date’s channel and website at these links:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/rethinkinghell\r\nhttps://rethinkinghell.com/\r\n\r\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "title": "A Faint Heart Never Won a Fair Maiden",
    "description": "To honor his parents and to share the gospel of Jesus Christ, Salvador Cordova retells the love story of his parents Angelo and Esther Cordova.  They met as children in the Philippines, but World War 2 separated them while Angelo fought to liberate their homeland from the Imperial Japanese invaders.  After the war, Angelo rescued Esther from an armed attacker.  The attacker was armed with a gun, and Angelo was armed only with his willingness to die to protect Esther.  In the face of Angelo's bravery, the attacker relented.  Angelo's courage won the heart of Esther and led to a 56-year marriage that was part of Esther's larger love story that lasted 85 years which included the 2-decades that her loving children cared for her when Angelo grew ill and went home to be with the Lord.\n\nSal is working on essays that share the gospel through commentary on historical and archetypal love stories.  He describes real men of courage like Major Jeff Strueker and Angelo Cordova and the men who gave their lives for their wives on the Titanic.   Christ defines how a man should live his life, in that a man should bear his cross for what is right and offer his life for the woman he loves as Christ did for the church.\n\nSal will talk briefly about 2 Cor 4:17 and the historical romance of CS Lewis, \"the honeymoon that could have lasted forever\".\n\nHe'll read sections from the diary of his father and reviews historical documents and photos during the Imperial Japanese occupation and the Battle of Luzon, especially the landing of the 11th Airborne on Tagaytay Ridge.\n\nSal will argue that not only does the physical evidence support the Christian faith and the Hidden God, but also offers satisfying answers to the agonies and ecstasies of romantic love, the problem of evil, and the meaning of life, the origin and specialization of male and female.  The answers of Christianity surpass the viewpoints of atheism, naturalistic evolutionism, and modern feminism.\n\nBIO:  Sal has been rated as the #1 YouTube Creationist, he has 5 science degrees including an MS in Applied Physics from Johns Hopkins University and an unaccredited MS in Biology.  He's published in secular scientific journals, and his life story is told in the April 27/28, 2005 cover story of the prestigious scientific journal Nature.\n\nVisit Sal's channel, Evidence and Reasons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/EvidenceAndReasons\n@EvidenceandReasons \nSal's website is:\nwww.EvidenceAndReasons.org\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

I was engaged in personal discipleship relationships, teaching small bible studies, hundreds of hours worth of elective spiritual classes and several meetings per-week. I personally worked to convert people to Jesus. I was very comfortable talking about Jesus in public with close friends and strangers. Now, I am going through a very difficult transition as I explore the world outside the church and engage in the broader conversations of belief. I am open to new evidence.

    "title": "Is the Husband the Boss in Marriage?  Understand Ephesians 5",
    "description": "Mike Winger and some other popular Christian teachers push the idea that women are subordinate to men in marriage.  They are wrong.\n\nEphesians chapter 5:21-33 is a beautiful passage of scripture that begins with, \"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.\"  This passage gives us a wonderful description of what it means to honor one another above ourselves, and the imagery of Christ's death being our source of life.  Unfortunately, the metaphorical use of the word head in English (to mean boss or authority) has confused and caused misinterpretations of this passage in Ephesians.  Instead of being a passage about the mutual honor and submission Christians carry out for one another, these verses have been widely used as a call for Christian women to understand marriage as a hierarchy, where the husband is in charge.  There is a better interpretation for this passage.\n\nArticles that discuss this topic:\nhttps://www.pbpayne.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/what-about-headship-ch7.pdf\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/mutuality-blog-magazine/what-say-when-someone-says-wives-should-submit-husbands\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/mutuality-blog-magazine/misinterpreting-head-can-perpetuate-abuse\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/priscilla-papers-academic-journal/significance-kephale-head-study-abuse-one-greek\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/mutuality-blog-magazine/unavoidable-link-between-patriarchal-theology-and\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/priscilla-papers-academic-journal/biblical-model-marriage\n\nFor more videos that deal with tough questions about Christian faith, visit my website:\nbreadoflifechannel.net",

This interaction may seem out of character for Jesus, but you will understand Jesus's reaction after you watch this video.  In this video I explain why Jesus reacted to the woman this way.  \n\nFor more answers to difficult Bible questions, visit my website:\nbreadoflifechannel.net\n\nThis story is found in Matthew 15 and in Mark 7.\n\nMatthew 15:21-28\nLeaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.  A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.”\n Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”\n He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”\nThe woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.\nHe replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” “Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”\n\n Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.",

God brought judgment against the descendants of Esau when they unjustly fought against Israel.  Malachi chapter 1 is describing God's judgment.

When we read these verses in context, we see that this is not a contradiction.  James explains that Abraham \"believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.\"  Romans says that we are justified by faith.  James explains that faith produces action.  For some people, this passage in James brings fearful thoughts:  \"What if my faith isn't real?  What if my faith doesn't produce enough?\"  I hope that this video will give peace and confidence to sincere believers in Jesus.

I frequently hear this criticism of Christianity, so I thought it was important to address it.  Jesus is not a random innocent person dying for the crimes of the guilty.  He is God.  Who can tell God not to die for the guilty?  This is not immoral.  It isn't cosmic child abuse.  This is our God and his love for us.  \n\nThe video clip expressing this criticism is taken from Alex O'Conner (Cosmic Skeptic).

    "description": "When people read the Bible for the first time, they are often surprised by the harsh penalties for breaking the laws of Moses.  The Old Testament laws have been the subject of much ridicule of the Bible by the atheist community.  And Christians wonder, why was God so strict?  Why the death penalty for working on the Sabbath?  In this video I discuss why I believe God imposed strict penalties at that time, and how God's nature isn't to impose strict rules.  The laws of Moses are an exception to the way God normally deals with humanity.  \n\nFor a free resource that will explain the difference between God's covenant with Israel and God's covenant with you, visit my website:\nbreadoflifechannel.net\n\"God's Covenant with You\" is a free downloadable PDF that will help you understand the Bible.\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "title": "Couldn't God Create a World with No Possibility of Suffering?",
    "description": "Some people wonder why God couldn't create a world with no possibility of suffering.  God could still give humans free will, but just make it so that whatever they choose does not result in pain and suffering.  In this video I discuss the reason I believe God did not create such a world: He gave humans real responsibility.  God did not just give humans free will, he actually trusted us with governing the world.  Real responsibility comes with a risk.  \n\nFor more answers to questions about faith, God, and the Bible, visit my website:\nbreadoflifechannel.net\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "title": "Shocking Truth about Slavery in the Bible",
    "description": "Slavery is a prominent theme in the Bible.  The word slave appears more than two hundred times in the Bible, and the Bible describes physical slavery and spiritual slavery.  Some people wonder why God did not abolish slavery when he gave the laws through Moses.  Indeed, some of the most difficult passages of scripture are the ones that discuss slaves in the laws of Moses.  In this video, I will discuss those difficult passages, as well as the bigger redemption story of Jesus Christ coming to set us free from slavery to sin, death, and fear.  And the most startling imagery of all:  That our God became a slave, and calls us to do the same.  Jesus said, \"Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.\"  \n\nIf my discussion on slavery in the laws of Moses is unsatisfying, here are some videos by someone with much more expertise in the Biblical language and culture:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBz1D8qJNyI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc9NGeT8z04\n\nFor more answers to difficult passages in the Bible, visit my website:\nbreadoflifechannel.net\n\nFind my book on Amazon at this link:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ibjphg",

    "description": "Some English Bible translations have done a terrible job at translating Deuteronomy 22:28, which causes people to believe that God's law forced women to marry their rapist.  This video gives three proofs that Deut 22:28 should not say \"rape,\" discussing the Hebrew words in the passage as well as other evidence from within the text.  I also show which English translations do a good job at translating this passage, and which ones do an awful job.

The Bible you hold in your hand is probably not error free, but it is a reliable witness of who God is and his plan for humanity.  This video discusses the reliability of the Bible, while recognizing the various factors that may have caused your Bible to have errors:  Differences between manuscripts, copy errors, translation errors, translation bias due to culture, and printing errors.  While all of these errors have happened, the Bible is still the most attested writing of antiquity that exists.\n\nFind my book \"Bridges of Love and Understanding\" at: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Ibjphg \n\nFind free Christian resources at my website:\nhttp://www.breadoflifechannel.net",

    "description": "Don't want to watch Mike Winger's 7 hour video on head covering?  Christian women, watch this instead!  This video discusses how to understand 1 Corinthians 11 when it discusses women wearing head coverings when they pray and prophesy.  Some instructions in the Bible are meant to be universally applied, and others are applied within a cultural context.  For most modern Christian women, head covering is not a norm within society.  Like we do with many other Biblical instructions, we apply the Biblical principle within our society's cultural norms.  \n\nI disagree with Mke Winger's conclusion about women in ministry, but he does a good job discussing head coverings:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keXayp7JXf4\n\nHere is a great video about the cultural context of Corinth:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoegVdstfn4&list=PLrxX6_-tnaWVVDB4BiOt9_aZMOJWk0PHn&index=38\n\nPassage discussed:  \n1 Corinthians 11: 5-6\n\"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.\"\nHere are some interesting articles related to this topic:\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/article/mutuality-blog-magazine/translation-trouble-1-corinthians-11\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/322078662_The_Application_of_Women_Wearing_Head_Covering_and_Their_Role_in_Ministry_-_Based_on_1_Corinthians_113-6_and_1434_35\n\nFind my book \"Bridges of Love and Understanding\" at: \nhttps://amzn.to/2Ibjphg \n\nFind free Christian resources at my website:\nhttp://www.breadoflifechannel.net",

Whether you've sinned 10 times or 1,000, the sacrifice of Christ has made it so there will never be condemnation for you.\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "description": "How much correct information does someone need to have in order to be worshiping the true God?  The Bible says that creation speaks about the glory of God and that we can clearly see who God is from what he has made.   There are many people who recognize the Creator and worship him, though they may have some incorrect information about Jesus.  In this video I discuss the Biblical basis for understanding how Muslims and Christians can be worshiping the same God, even though we might have some incorrect information about him.  God doesn't wait until we have all the right information before he communicates with us.  God cares about the heart, and he responds to those who seek him in faith.\n\nGet my book available on Amazon now:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Ibjphg\n\nTo find out more about my book go to:\nbridgesofloveandunderstanding.com",

    "description": "Islam teaches that Jesus Christ is a prophet, but not the Son of God.  Many Muslims have never had the opportunity to hear the truth about Jesus Christ. Should we call people anti-Christ when they have never heard the truth about Jesus? In my experience, Muslims love and honor Jesus Christ, even if they don't have all the correct information about him. We should not assume that Muslims are anti-Christ until they have truly experienced and rejected the truth about Jesus Christ.

The purpose of Jesus's suffering was that many new sons and daughters of God could be born.  The Bible says that all who believe in Jesus become children of God.  Now, God does not have only one son, but a multitude of sons and daughters.  You can be one of them through faith in Christ Jesus.",

    "description": "Forgiving someone who has harmed you can be one of the hardest things in the world to do, and it will cost you—but it is always worth the cost.  When we don’t forgive people who have harmed us, we continue to endure mental and physical pain.  Forgiveness is hard to do, but it will set you free.  This video discusses the cost of forgiveness, how to forgive, and why it is worth the price you pay.",

God is love.  And he created us in his image, to be beings full of love.  Jesus said all the law and prophets hang on these two commands:  love God, and love your neighbor.  The essence of sin is action that is not founded in love.",

Are Christians required to follow all the 612 laws of Moses?  This teaching of Jesus must be interpreted in light of his death and resurrection.  Romans 7 says that we died to the law through the body of Christ.  This video explains how Romans 7 helps us interpret Matthew 5:17-19.",

Wasn't that cruel for God to allow Satan to do that?  Some readers will walk away judging God, but some readers will learn the lesson that Job and his friends learned:  human judgment is full of error because we never have all the information.  At the end of the story, Job and his friends decided to leave judgment to the one Being who has all the information.

    "description": "Has the theory of evolution been scientifically proven?  What about the origin of life?  Despite the widespread belief in evolution within the scientific community, scientists who research the topic make honest admissions of how much we really don’t know.  We do not know how life originated and we do not know how it developed.  The theory of evolution has not been scientifically proven.  In fact, there are some major and probably insurmountable problems with the idea that life could originate spontaneously and develop through evolutionary processes.  This video discusses what the scientists who are experts in these fields have to say about the origin and development of life.  \nBooks quoted from in this video:\nFrom Matter to Life:  Information and Causality, edited by Sara Imari Walker, Paul C.W. Davies, and George F.R.

    "description": "People sometimes wonder, \"Why God doesn't always give us specific guidance about what to do?\" When God told Noah to build the ark, he told him what size to make it, which materials to use, and what to bring on board.  But many of us don't receive that type of specific guidance from God.  Why?  God has given us basic guidance for life, telling us what is right and wrong.  With the guidance and boundaries he has given us, there are a variety of ways that we can bring goodness and beauty into the world.  I think half the fun for God is seeing our creativity.  What will we do with what he has given us?  What unique decisions and expressions will you make that delight the heart of God?",

Evolution requires millions of years for developments in organisms, but no organism has millions of years to develop a functioning reproductive system.  There is no scientific answer to the classic problem of the chicken and the egg.  There are only stories.  I reject evolutionary tall tales.

The Parable of the Bags of Gold (or the Parable of the Talents) is a frightening parable, but the frightening part is not directed toward Christians, it is directed to those who are making excuses to avoid responsibility to their Creator.  If Jesus were here today, I think this might be a parable he would tell an atheist.\n    Some Christians are misinterpreting this parable and wondering if the frightening part might apply to them.  In this video I will talk about why, if you are a believer in Jesus, the frightening part of the parable cannot apply to you.

    "description": "John the Baptist said, \"I baptize you with water, but he [Jesus] will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.\"  What does it mean that Jesus will baptize us in the Holy Spirit?  This topic causes a lot of confusion and controversy.  In this video I hope to give you an understanding of the baptism in the Holy Spirit by answering these questions:\n#1 What is the baptism in the Holy Spirit?\n#2 Is the baptism in the Holy Spirit a one-time experience? \n#3 Is this an event you need to wait for like the disciples waited in Jerusalem?  When does it happen? \n#4- What does it look like when someone is filled with the Spirit?  \n#5- How do I know if I have the Holy Spirit?\n#6 Is there a difference between having the Holy Spirit and being filled with the Holy Spirit?\n#7 How do I know if I’ve been baptized the Holy Spirit?\n Much of the misunderstanding comes from our modern understanding of word \"baptism\" as a formal religious event.  To baptize just means to dunk.  There isn't just one type of baptism mentioned in the Bible.  There are many baptisms.  In addition to the Holy Spirit baptism, this video also explains the many types of baptisms mentioned in the Bible.  Thanks for watching!\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

But there are a few difficult and perplexing passages of the New Testament that seem to contradict the rest of the Bible’s treatment of women.  In this video, I will discuss one of those difficult passages:  1 Corinthians 14:34-35, and offer some possible explanations for these aberrant verses.  \n\nScripture quotations taken from The Holy Bible, New International Version® NIV®\nCopyright © 1973 1978 1984 2011 by Biblica, Inc.

There is no textual support for the idea that women were silent participants in church gatherings.

Jesus temporarily left his high position and took the lowest place as a servant.  He did that for you and me.  This video explains Philippians chapter 2:3-11 using the modern day analogy of an undercover boss.  \nPhilippians 2:3-11 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:\nWho, being in very nature God,\n    did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing\n    by taking the very nature of a servant,\n    being made in human likeness.\nAnd being found in appearance as a man,\n    he humbled himself\n    by becoming obedient to death—\n        even death on a cross!\nTherefore God exalted him to the highest place\n    and gave him the name that is above every name,\nthat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,\n    in heaven and on earth and under the earth,\nand every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,\n    to the glory of God the Father.\n\nScripture quotations taken from The Holy Bible, New International Version® NIV®\nCopyright © 1973 1978 1984 2011 by Biblica, Inc.

This video talks about why you need to acknowledge God and make the decision to be part of his family.  If you aren't part of the family, you don't get to stay.

    "description": "Many people ask God to speak to them and are disappointed when God doesn’t speak.  But the problem isn’t God’s lack of communication, it is often our expectations about how God communicates.  God has spoken to all of us.  This video discusses some various ways that God speaks, including the most important way:  Through his Son, Jesus.  Hebrews 1:1-3 says, “In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.  The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being.”  What does the Son of God express to us?  The Son of God dying on the cross is God’s communication to you about the depth of his love.  Even if God never said anything else to you, he has already spoken to you in the most powerful way possible in his sacrifice.",

    "description": "Many people have noticed what seems to be an inconsistency in the character of God in the Bible.  Sometimes God seems kind and loving, and at other times mean and vengeful.  People are right to point out the differences in God's actions.  But what people fail to realize is that God speaks differently depending on who he is talking to.  God is kind to the poor and oppressed, and vengeful toward the oppressors.  God's character is consistent throughout the Bible.  God's character is the same in the Old Testament and the New Testament. If you are oppressing the poor and vulnerable, carrying out violence, and denying people justice, you will see the vengeful side of God.  If you are among those who have experienced oppression and injustice, God is full of compassion for you and promises you hope for the future.  God will be vengeful when necessary, but he desires to be loving to all.\n\nScripture quotations taken from The Holy Bible, New International Version® NIV®\nCopyright © 1973 1978 1984 2011 by Biblica, Inc.

The word translated as \"hell\" here actually means \"The Valley of Hinnom,\" which was a cursed place, but not a fiery underworld where people are tortured forever.  I reject the traditional view of hell, but I did not alter the translation of Matthew 23:15 which uses the term hell.  Those watching this video should understand that just because I left the translation intact does not mean that I endorse the idea of hell as a place of unending torment.

    "title": "Hell Is NOT Unending Torment",
    "description": "Is the idea of hell as unending torment really as Biblical as we've been conditioned to believe?  If you have ever doubted the justice of the concept of hell, this video will give you Biblical reasons to ditch the idea of unending torment, preserve the image of our loving God, and rescue the gospel message from the violence of the torturous flames.  \nIn order to make this video I read the entire New Testament and created a document that cites every reference to death, hell, judgment, varying degrees of judgment, and also every reference to eternal life, the concept of death verses life, and the kingdom of God.  For many of the passages I made a chart with the phrase in Greek so that the words used in the original language can be easily compared between various texts.  My research also included word studies on several words related to this debate, but for the sake of time and to keep the attention of the audience, I didn’t bring the usage of these words into the video.  \nTo complete this study I read books and information from various perspectives.   Edward Fudge was the most scholarly, Biblical, fair, and persuasive writer and presenter on this topic.  His book is a major source of information in my video.  Here is the information for his book, as well as the links to a lecture by him, and a debate between him and a representative of the perspective of hell as unending torment.  \n\nMy other videos on hell:\nhttps://youtu.be/_Gqw-hOAZkk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0whZoLj50A\nFudge, Edward.

    "title": "How to Stop Judging People",
    "description": "The reason it is so easy to judge people is because people are frequently doing things that are worthy of judgment.  But you can stop judging if you take God's perspective.  God respects, honors, and enjoys people without regarding their bad actions.  God didn't excuse bad behavior, he put it to death on the cross.  God considered Christ's death on the cross the death of corrupt humanity.  2 Corinthians 5:16 says, \"So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view.\"  You don't need to judge anyone by what you see from a worldly point of view.  Why?  Because \"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.  The old has passed away.  All things have been made new\"  (verse 17).  We can give people perfect respect and honor because what remains of that old corrupted creation will be gone soon, and the new creation- perfect in beauty and glory- will be here for eternity.",

    "title": "Where Is the God of Miracles Today?",
    "description": "The Bible is full of miracles.  Some people wonder why they aren't seeing God do miracles today.  Just because you haven't seen a miracle doesn't mean God isn't doing miracles today.  God is doing miracles today.  This video discusses some possible reasons you may not have seen a miracle, and what our attitude toward miracles should be.\n\nNot included in the video, but relevant to the subject, is a calculation I did regarding miracles.  I'm not good at math, so if any mathematician or statistician has a better way to calculate this, please feel free.  In the video I mention that I believe God will do more miracles in the next 24 hours than all the miracles mentioned in the Bible.  Starting with an approximate number of miracles mentioned in the Bible at 160, I calculated how many miracles that would be during the span of an average lifetime of 80 years.  160 miracles per day for 80 years = 4,672,000 miracles during a human lifetime of 80 years.  Dividing the approximate number of people on earth (7.5 billion) by this number gives us one miracle for every 1,605 people.  So if God is doing 160 miracles per day, only one person out of 1,605 is going to experience a miracle in their lifetime.  This may help a skeptic understand why they have personally not seen a miracle even though God is doing many miracles all the time.\n\nThanks for watching the Bread of Life Channel!

    "title": "Does the Bible Teach that Women Cannot Have Authority Over Men?",
    "description": "Does 1 Timothy 2:11-15 teach that women should not teach men or have positions of authority over men?  No, it does not.  Here is an explanation of this difficult passage that puts it in its cultural context.  Understanding the cultural context helps make sense of these seemingly nonsensical verses.  These were pushy women pushing Artemis, and Paul put a stop to it.  This passage should not be used to prevent women from teaching or leading men in the church.  \n\nMike Winger and some other popular Christian teachers push the idea that women cannot have leadership roles in the church.  Despite their assurances about the \"clear teaching of scripture,\" these passages about women are not clearly teaching the ideas they promote about women having different roles.\n\nA considerable amount of research went into making this video.  And there were many more points that I would have liked to include but couldn’t do so because it would have made the video too lengthy.  If you would like to study this topic more deeply, my sources for this video are included here, as well as some additional notes that might be helpful:\n       Paul affirms women in leadership:\nRom. 16:1–2 Pheobe church leader\nRomans 16:3-5 Priscilla leader and teacher of men (Acts 18:24–26), \nRomans 16:7 Junia an apostle\nPhilippians 4:2-3 Euodia, Syntyche, shared in Paul’s work\nCol. 4:15- Nympha church leader\nPhilemon 2 Appia a house church leader\n\nMy interpretive translation of 1Timothy 2:11-15:\n“A woman should take time to quietly learn about the Christian faith in submission to sound doctrine.  I don’t permit a woman to dominate men, teaching these false ideas about feminine virtue that are part of the cult of Artemis, because female life is not independent from man.  Actually, a man, Adam, was formed first; then the female, Eve. You shouldn’t regard women as superior, because the first woman got deceived and became a sinner just like Adam did.  And tell the women not to worry about letting go of Artemis’s help for childbirth.  If they continue in faith, God will save them during childbirth.” \n\nEphesus/Artemis/Authentein/ video sources:\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~yvonr/pagan/classics/callhymn.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjZqdbklZbgAhWYAWMBHYZjDroQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw3C1Z76iGliUjhXntksaPDf\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/harvard-theological-review/article/images-of-artemis-ephesia-and-grecoroman-worship-a-reconsideration/CFB8B0C0A379CCA98DDAFE\nhttps://margmowczko.com/1-timothy-212-in-context-2/\nhttps://margmowczko.com/authentein-1-timothy2_12/\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/scholarship-patriarchy-1-timothy-28-15\nhttps://www.crowbarmassage.com/2017/03/14/ephesian-women-the-worship-of-artemis-why-it-matters-today/\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/what-say-when-someone-says-women-are-not-permitted-teach#at_pco=tst-1.0&at_si=5dbb07cd2aa3c0b7&at_ab=per-2&at_pos=0&at_tot=2\n\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/exegetical-fallacies-interpreting-1-timothy-211%E2%80%9315\n\nhttp://www.academia.edu/24894058/Revisiting_%CE%B1%E1%BD%90%CE%B8%CE%B5%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%89_in_1_Timothy_2_12_What_Do_the_Extant_Data_Really_Show\n\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/revisiting-clarity-scripture-1-timothy-212\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/interpreting-1-timothy-28-15\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/mutuality/presidents-message-women-leaders-good-and-bad\n\nWomen in leadership:\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/bible-teaches-equal-standing-man-and-woman\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/women-church-and-bible-translation-key-passages-issues-and\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/article/priscilla-papers/interpreting-1-timothy-28-15\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os8M9ln2cM0\nScripture quotations taken from The Holy Bible, New International Version® NIV®\nCopyright © 1973 1978 1984 2011 by Biblica, Inc.
