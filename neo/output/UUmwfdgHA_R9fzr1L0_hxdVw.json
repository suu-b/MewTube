    "description": "In this episode of The Poetry of Reality, Richard joins a live audience in Edinburgh to discuss his latest book, The Genetic Book of the Dead. In this wide-ranging conversation, he reflects on how DNA preserves the story of evolution, describing organisms as “living books” that record the environments of their ancestors. He explores camouflage, whale ancestry, convergent evolution, and the hidden logic of genes, while breaking down ideas like genomes as cooperatives of viruses. He also reflects on memes, the extended phenotype, and the surprising ways evolution shapes both biology and culture.\n\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to The Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nSocials: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/richard_dawkins/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality",

    "description": "In this episode of The Poetry of Reality, Richard Dawkins revisits a 2012 conversation with South Korea’s Great Minds program. He challenges the idea of DNA as a blueprint, instead showing how it functions as a recipe or computer program. Through examples ranging from termite mounds to starling flocks, Dawkins illustrates how simple rules followed locally can create breathtaking patterns and structures. He then connects this principle to embryology, explaining how proteins, cells, and genes interact to shape a living body, all without the need for a designer.\n\n\n.........\n\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel:  @poetryofreality  \n\nFollow: \nInstagram: the.poetry.of.reality\n  \nTwitter: richarddawkins\n  \nFacebook: richarddawkinsbooks  \n\nReddit:  thepoetryofreality",

    "description": "In this clip, Richard Dawkins questions @JordanBPeterson  about his belief in the truth claims of the Bible, specifically asking whether Jesus died for our sins. The conversation then shifts, with Jordan Peterson comparing the truth of Christianity to Richard’s insights on the human understanding of non intuitive quantum physics, referencing a recent Piers Morgan interview. Peterson also touches on Dawkins’ viral proclamation of being a ‘cultural Christian’ and what it means. The discussion then delves into the role of Christianity in human progress and the nature of truth that it might (or might not) represent. The discussion was moderated by Alex J. O’Connor (@CosmicSkeptic).\n\nThe full discussion is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wBtFNj_o5k\n\n--------------------------------------------\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/richard_dawkins/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality",

    "title": "Lawrence Krauss and Richard Dawkins Discuss Evolution, Religion, and More",
    "description": "I first encountered Lawrence Krauss sometime in the early 2000s at a conference. I had just given my lecture and was answering questions when a rather small man with a loud voice and a highly articulate manner stood up and began berating me in what I initially thought was an aggressive manner. It turned out he wasn’t being aggressive; rather, his clear and direct way of speaking seemed forceful compared to the usual, more roundabout way people talk. Intrigued, I sought him out in the bar afterward, and we had a good discussion. This man was, of course, the distinguished physicist and public intellectual Lawrence Krauss. Shortly afterward, we continued our friendly disagreement in the pages of Scientific American, back when the publication still focused on science. Since then, I’ve interacted with Lawrence on stage more often than with anyone else. The following recording was made at Stanford University around 2007 and exemplifies how two people can have a fruitful public discussion without a chairman and outside of a debate format. The nature of our initial disagreement forms a good part of the discussion itself, so I won’t spoil it here. I hope you enjoy it.\n--------------\nI will be on tour of North America, UK & EU talking about my latest book, religion, life on earth and beyond. I will be joined on stage by a range of friends and foes on stage. The events will include a Q&A and a limited meet-and-greet.

    "title": "Richard Dawkins Confronts a Christian Extremist!",
    "description": "The Reverend Michael Bray is a leading advocate of murdering abortion doctors. He also takes biblical literalism to the extreme of advocating the death penalty for adultery and homosexuality. His friend and coconspirator, the Reverend Paul Hill, was executed for murdering an abortion doctor and his bodyguard. Bray strongly defends Hill’s action and thinks he’s now being rewarded in heaven. Bray himself served 46 months of a 10-year jail sentence for conspiracy and possession of illicit explosives. What follows is an audio recording of a long conversation I had with him in a public park in Colorado. He struck me as a deeply confused individual but at the same time sincere, a mind addled and perverted by religious faith, walking evidence of Steven Weinberg’s well-known aphorism, which I quote at the end of this recording: for good people to do evil things, it takes religion.\n\n--------------\nI will be on tour of North America, UK & EU talking about my latest book, religion, life on earth and beyond.

I have this rather eccentric idea that before becoming a public intellectual, you need to earn your credentials by having something important and interesting to be intellectual about, and John McWhorter qualifies in a big way. He is a world authority on linguistics, the study of the extraordinary phenomenon of human language, which I think is one of the most important and interesting subjects out there.\n\nWe both spoke at the Dissident Dialogues conference in New York this year, and I seized the opportunity to invite him onto The Poetry of Reality. I was delighted and honored when he accepted. I began by asking him about linguistics, including the vexed question of the origin of language.\n\nOnly later did we move on to his more controversial book, a book that I strongly recommend, “Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America.\n--------------\nI will be on tour of North America, UK & EU talking about my latest book, religion, life on earth and beyond.

She is also a personal friend of whom I am very fond. When she recently announced her conversion to Christianity, I assumed that she must be no more than a political Christian, regarding Christianity as a bulwark against Islam. I have some sympathy with the view that if you must have a religion at all, Christianity is hugely better than the leading alternative. In Hilaire Belloc’s words, “Always keep a-hold of Nurse for fear of finding something worse.”\n\nI agreed to have a public conversation with her in New York, in which I was all prepared to emphasize the distinction between a political Christian and a true believing Christian, who actually thinks Jesus was born of a virgin and rose from the dead. I think the distinction is a really important one. I don’t think a political Christian is a real Christian, any more than the kind of cultural Christian I am myself.\n\nWhen we met on the stage at the Dissident Dialogues meeting in New York, I was wrongfooted when Ayaan began with a personal statement which seemed to suggest that she really is a believing Christian, not just a political Christian. Well, her form of words was “I choose to believe.” I’m not sure what to make of that. Anyways, see what you think; here is the recording of our New York meeting.\n--------------\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.of.reality/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality",

The riddle is one that baffled Chales Darwin. He explicitly left it for later generations. It was eventually solved, with typical brilliance, by the great Ronald Fisher. \n\nThe fundamental sexual inequality is an economic one. Eggs are hugely larger than sperm. From this much follows. Why do peacocks have such a ridiculously large, ornamental “tail”, when it obviouly must put them in danger? Do females go for male beauty for beauty’s sake (as Darwin thought, and Fisher explained)? Or are males advertising some useful quality (as AlfredWallace, Darwin's co-discoverer of natural selection, insisted). Is the peacock’s tail favoured in spite of being a handicap? Or could it be favoured precisely becuse it is a costly handicap? Does it have to be costly as a certificate of honesty? Do females only go for honest males?\n\nThis is a talk I gave on a ship crusing the Galapagos archipelago.\n------------------\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.of.reality/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality\n\nI will be on tour of North America, UK & EU talking about my latest book, religion, life on earth and beyond.

They go on to discuss the double standards that govern criticism, challenging the breakdown of civil conversation in America.\n\nAs they navigate the terrifying yet exhilarating immensity of the universe, they contemplate and debate life's meaning, Jesus, and the role of religion as solace in the face of nothingness. But does moral philosophy really require the supernatural? Does scientific truth make a person desolate?

Richard fearlessly confronts psychic Craig Hamilton Parker in a quest to unravel the mysteries of spiritualist practices. He rigorously channels his dedication to exposing scams and dismantling delusions as he challenges Parker's claims about communicating with the spirit world, with razor-sharp logic and unyielding skepticism. Watch as this back-and-forth sheds light on the truth behind the veil of mysticism and explores science's long battle with mediums.

We dive deep into the challenges posed by a scientifically illiterate House of Commons and the prevailing misconception that science is too daunting for the average person to comprehend. We confront the disturbing trend of individuals taking pride in their ignorance, a mindset that perpetuates the acceptance of unproven remedies in the fight against cancer.\n\nFrom herbal remedies to homeopathy and other alternative medicines, Michael Baum and I unravel the allure of these treatments, examining the placebo effect and the reliance on anecdotal evidence that often accompanies them. We emphasize the vital importance of the scientific method, which demands unwavering honesty and has the potential to challenge our deeply entrenched belief systems.\n______________________\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.of.reality/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality",

The symbolic gesture is also reflective of growing rebellion in the nation that battles extremist Islamism’s disdain for basic human rights and freedoms. \n\nWe spoke about others like Salman Rushdie and Narges Mohammedi who continue to fight censorship through their work despite the risks, and about Masih’s continued efforts to meet hatred with courage.\n................\n\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.of.reality/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality",

How real are string theory and the multiverse? If there is a god, what explains why he is the way he is? Does anyone really understand quantum mechanics?

It argues for the importance, for society, of scientific ways of thinking. In it, I interviewed David Attenborough, Alec Jeffreys, who discovered DNA fingerprinting, and Douglas Adams, who gave a wonderful impromptu eulogy for science. I also interviewed a man who was wrongly convicted of murder because none of the lawyers, on either side, knew anything about science. The program ends on a more positive note – what I later came to call Science in the Soul.\n________________________\n\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.of.reality/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality\n\n#science #documentary #ThePoetryOfReality #truth #belief #scientific #richarddawkins #darwinism #dawkins #goddelusion #selfishgene",

Tune in to listen to two great thinkers explore rich questions, around the survival of genes and human altruism, the suffering native to nature, reason and its application to morality, the role of design in the universe, and the meaning behind pain and consciousness. \n________________________\nJoin Substack:\nhttps://richarddawkins.substack.com/\n\nSubscribe to Poetry of Reality Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwfdgHA_R9fzr1L0_hxdVw\n\nFollow: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.poetry.of.reality/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RichardDawkinsBooks\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePoetryofReality\n\n#ThePoetryOfReality #PeterSinger #MoralPhilosophy #Religion #Science #TheSelfishGene",
