Isaac brings up one of the best objections to Alex's Metaethical position. Isaac's review is already pedantic and technical in the first place, which it ought to be as it's a critique of Alex, and he does a fantastic job. ​⁠@lanceindependent and I breakdown the critique and try to make it easy to understand, and we try to have fun in the process, so it doesn't get overwhelming for the viewers. \n\nLance has a PhD in social psychology from Cornell University and an MA in philosophy from Tufts University.

    "description": "Uploading this video again with a better audio. Enjoy!\nOne of the most perplexing conundrums of all - Free Will. Do we have it or do we not? Let's explore!\n\nThis is part four in which I discuss Quantum Physics and its implications on free will. Does Quantum Mechanics save us free will? Watch and find out.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a subfield of physics that describes the behavior of particles — atoms, electrons, photons and almost everything in the molecular and submolecular realm. Is Quantum Indeterminacy, what gives us free will?
