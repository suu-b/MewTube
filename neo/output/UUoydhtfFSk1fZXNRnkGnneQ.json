    "description": "Magical and medicine have long shared a contested border. However, with the introduction of learned medicine into Europe, magical incantations were increasingly sidelined for Galenic principles and practice.  However, Urso of Salerno (d. c. 1220) rejected both Church skepticism and Galenic orthodoxy by incorporating Incantations into his medical practice.  In his Aphorisms Urso provides one of the most sophisticated theories for the function and application of magical Incantations.

But her origin, first in ancient Mesopotamia and then in the early medieval Jewish literature are marked by curious historical accidents.  Curiously enough, Lilith may have emerged as a linguistic mistake and a text meant to parody rabbinic legends.

    "description": "The concept of the Demiurge is often associated with the demonic cosmos creator of the Gnostics.  But, what do we know about the ancient Hermetic Demiurge? Emerging from the world of Greco-Egyptian religion and philosophy, Hermeticism was a powerfully optimistic means of reuniting one's high consciousness (Nous) with the Divine Parental Light after exorcising one's body of fatalistic daimonic infestation. But, the Hermetic Spiritual Philosophy is ambivalent about the place of any Demiurge in it's cosmology and means of salvation.  Yet, some texts do speak of a magnificent Solar Demiurge as the conduit and cosmic  artisan.

    "description": "Join Andy Rakich (Atun-Shei Films) & Dr. Justin Sledge (Esoterica) for an October tour of Esoteric New England, October 9-16 2026:\n\nPurchase Tickets here - https://www.esotericaoccultbooks.com/shop/p/esoteric-new-england-with-andy-justin-october-2026\nDonate to the budget of \"The Alchemist\" ► https://www.paypal.me/atunsheifilms\n\nThe tour will start in rural Rhode Island visiting forgotten King Philip's War battlefields, then pass through Providence to see H.P. Lovecraft's old neighborhood. Entering Massachusetts, we'll visit New Bedford, historic center of the whaling industry, and get to see living history sites at Plimoth Patuxet Museums. We'll enjoy fireside drinks in an early 18th century haunted house, explore Walden Pond and the sites where the Revolutionary War began, and check out the headquarters of a Puritan alchemist. Finally, we'll wrap things up (where else) in Salem, center of the 1692 witchcraft delusion and the Halloween capital of America. Full itinerary will be sent upon ticket purchase.\n\nExact times will be provided closer to the start of the tour.\n\nThis tour will be primarily a fundraiser for Andy and Justin’s short “The Alchemist” with the hopes of eventually producing a feature length version.  You’ll get to see scripts, our look-book, and help shape our vision for the project: an attempt to center historically accurate alchemy in film.\n\nWhat’s Included:  A week of on-location tours, education, meals, drinks and hang-outs with Andy and Justin. \n\nWhat’s NOT included: Airfare, hotels, transportation, meals, drinks, site tickets.  This will be a bit of gonzo tourism. Participants will have access to a private discord server to coordinate shared hotels, overland transportation to sites, etc.",

    "description": "How did Dracula become...Dracula? The grim tales of Vlad III the Impaler, Voivode of Wallachia,  are infamous.  Touted as a bloodthirsty tyrant and a pious defender of Christendom, much of our knowledge of Dracula's stems from a now lost 1463 anonymous German Pamphlet.  Reprinted many times, including woodcuts of Vlad dining among his impaled and mutilated victims, these early texts detail the \"frightful and strange\" deeds of Vlad Dracula.  But, what can we reconstruct of the lost original 1463 \"Geschichte Drakole Waide - The History of Voievode Dracula\"? And, can we trust such accounts as historically reliable?  Was Vlad the Impaler as horrible as recounted?  Did he drink the blood of his victims like the Vampire that now bears his name? Let's explore the earliest narratives of Vlad Dracula!\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "title": "The Women Behind Enochian Magic w/@drangelapuca",
    "description": "John Dee began to communicate with angels in the 1580s to discover the most fundamental truths of reality.  Those angels would reveal novel magical systems, the language God spoke creation into being, techniques for metaphysical espionage, at least a couple detours for treasure hunting, before reaching a scandalous climax in the wife-swapping incident which effectively marks the end of the Angelic conversations.  While most of the emphasis in these events are focused on Dee and Kelley, it’s often ignored that their wives - Jane Dee and Joan or Joanna Kelley - were important participants (and victims) of perhaps one of the most intriguing events in the history of western esotericism.  Let’s explore the role of the women of the Enochian world, including both earthly wives and daughters but also at least one spiritual creature, Madimi. \n\nCheck out Angela's companion video: https://youtu.be/Tx4MjNnWD94\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "title": "Is the Hermetic Philosophy a Forgery?",
    "description": "The publication of the Hermetic Philosophy in 1471 heralded the possibility to returning to truly primordial wisdom.  Indeed, mystical wisdom thought to have the power to restore Human Dignity through the unity of the microcosm with the macrocosm, the occult arts and reuniting the human soul with the divine.  Along with Cabala, the Hermetic philosophers sought to reform all domains of philosophy and spirituality. But what if the Hermetica was just an ancient forgery? In 1614 Isaac Casaubon launched an attack on the Corpus Hermeticum on linguistic, philosophical and doctrinal grounds to argue that the texts could not be nearly as old as Moses. Indeed, they were plagiarized frauds.  This attack would fundamental alter our understanding of these ancient mystical texts.  But, would it hold over time?\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "How did Jewish Kabbalah become Hermetic Qabalah?  To understand that process we have to go back to the late 17th century.  There, we find one of the most important translations of Kabbalah in von Rosenroth's mammoth Kabbalah Denudata.  Attached in the second volume is an introduction to Kabbalah which inverts centuries of Christian appropriation.  Rather than conforming Kabbalah to Christianity, Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont argues that the Lurianic Kabbalah is the true Christianity.  This dramatic - and heretical - shift, signals the origins of Qabalah that is neither Jewish nor Christian, but a Hermetic Qabalah.  Thus, the origins of the Qabalah as most contemporary occultists know it.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "Centuries following his death, Peter of Abano was known as the greatest sorcerer of his day.  Born in the 1250s, he would compose a huge variety of works attempting to reconcile the philosophy of Aristotle, medical theory and practice, Astrology and Natural Magic. He would also delve into the world of Astral Necromancy, the nature of Incantations and the power of Poison and be tried by the Inquisition twice. Eventually manuals of demonic conjuration and the production of magical rings would be attributed Peter.  But, what was the historical Peter of Abano's position on these questions, especially that of Sorcery?

    "description": "Can Mystical Experiences and Speculative Metaphysics be trusted? By the mid-18th century, Rationalism and Empiricism were tearing Philosophy, Religion and Occult Spirituality apart. Some grand synthesis was required if a unified worldview were to be possible.  And that synthesis was produced by Immanuel Kant starting with his Critique of Pure Reason.  Often thought to doom mystical experiences as nonsense, Kant's critical philosophy actually goes to lengths to preserve and reform the centrality of mysticism.  Why?  Because Kant himself was deeply influenced by the mystic scientist Emmanuel Swedenborg.  Let's explore the radical criticism of Kant, why this 'Esoteric Kant' isn't better known and how he paved the way for a truly Critical Mysticism.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "On June 1 1310, the Inquisition incinerated the flesh of Marguerite Porete, making her the first person executed for mystical heresy in the Latin West. Her book, The Mirror of the Simple Souls Who Are Annihilated and Remain Only in Will and Desire of Love,  laid claim to a mystical itinerary by which the soul could go beyond mere Salvation to Unity with the Divine through the free surrender of one's will into the Divine Abyss.  The Inquisition held that her teachings led to antinomianism, no need for an external Church or even the Consolations of God.  But what does the Mirror actually teach?  What did her execution have to do with the suppression of the Templars? And, was she really a heretic at all?

    "description": "Spiritual and Chemical Alchemy were forged in the land of ancient Egypt.  And, there's no better representative of this Hermetic, Gnostic, Enochian and Indigenous Egyptian Occult Science than the Priest-Alchemist Zosimos of Panopolis.  Flourishing around the 4th century CE, Zosimos would pioneer much of the fundamental of alchemical theory and practice.  From profound and disturbing symbolism, practical chemical knowledge and hermetic wisdom, the surviving texts of Zosimos represent the very foundations of western alchemy.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

What it revealed as amazing: an ancient Hebrew book of angelic magic which combined elements from the Greek Magical Papyri with Jewish Merkavah mysticism.  In the Sefer HaRazim we are hold how the text was given by the angel Raziel to Noah who then inscribed it on a sapphire.  The text describes an array of heavens and their angelic guardians who can be induced to perform a range of magical feats from driving your enemies mad, winning chariot races, summoning the sun to appear at night, cure the effects of a stroke, and much more.  Even among the numerous angels listed there are surprise appearances by Helios, Christos, Bar Koziba and even Asmodeus!

What might it mean to have discovered the earliest text of what would become \"The Bible\" in apparently magical amulets, the very kind of magic \"the Bible\" is generally thought to condemn? Further, what do we learn about Israelite ritual practices, afterlife and magic by comparing these amulets to similar amulets recovered around the same time?

    "title": "What is the Demiurge - Pt 3 - Simon Magus & the Gnostic Revolution",
    "description": "The demonic cosmos-creating Demiurge is at the core of the Sethian Gnostic mythology, but how did this idea develop?  From Samaria would emerge a theologian and mystic who would become, for Christians, the most fundamental of all heretics:  Simon Magus.  But how did Simon of Samaria's theology actual influence early Christian thought? Further, how did Menander of Samaria and Saturninus of Antioch all contribute to the Christian doctrines that would give rise to Sethian Gnosticism and the myth of the demonic Demiurge known as Ialdabaoth.  Here we dive deep into ancient theologies now long lost and condemned as heresy but were actually at the heart of the development of Christianity itself.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "John Winthrop the Younger was a pioneering early Governor of the Connecticut Colony but also deeply learned in the occult philosophy, alchemy and Paracelsian Spagyric Medicine.  So much so that he may well be regarded as the first true occultist in the American colonies.  Cotton Mather even dubbed Winthrop \"Hermes Christianus - the Christian Hermes.\" Taking with him books that once belonged to Dr. John Dee, a vast alchemical lab and deep knowledge of European Esotericism, Winthrop would attempt to create a Pansophist research institution in colonial America.  He would also become famous for his medical practice before using his knowledge of the occult philosophy to greatly stall colonial Witch Hunts.  And, as part of the \"Alchemical Republic\" - the first colonial member of the Royal Society - he would direct import Western Esotericism into America.  \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "Metaphysical pessimism - that existence itself is ultimately for the worse - is powerfully represented in the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. But he wasn't satisfied with mere philosophical proofs for his contention that Reality itself was fundamentally Will, a ceaseless ontological becoming. Schopenhauer sought to find the Will in nature itself, especially in the occult dimensions of Nature.  In several important essays, Schopenhauer argues for how the manifestation of Spirits, Divination, Animal Magnetism and Magic were all proofs for the existence for the Metaphysical Will.  \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

It is a massive tome, often over 1000 pages,  and meticulously details the nature of magic, divination and witchcraft along with detailed instructions for the prosecution of Witchcraft.  Indeed, it would supplant the horrid Malleus Maleficarum as the single most important source for Demonologists during the Witch Hunts.

    "description": "How does Kabbalah explain the origins of Evil?  Famous for the Sefirot, Kabbalah also introduced the notion of the Shattering of the Vessels, the demonic Klippot (husks/shells) and the nightmare reality of the Sitra Achra (the Other Side) to explain the origins, nature and destiny of Evil.  But how did these ideas develop?  In this weeks' episode - a special collaboration with ‪@drangelapuca  I'll be tracing the development of how early Kabbalah understood evil: as part of the Divine Perfection, Evil thoughts of the Divine that become demons, Primordial worlds created and destroyed in the process of Creation, or a Divine Catharsis by which the coming-to-be of both God, the Sefirot and the Cosmos require a shedding of Primaeval Evil.  Join me Friday as Dr. Puca explores contemporary Qliphothic Magic and I turn to the mysterious origins of Evil in the early Kabbalah.\n\nCheck out Angela's video - https://youtu.be/sG4YadCObLc\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nOne Time Donation Support - Paypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "Agrippa is famous for his Three Books of Occult Philosophy but we also know he was a lifelong student of the Hermetic Art of Alchemy.  For centuries his alchemical theory and practice were only understood from a few, brief passages in other works and letters - most still untranslated.  However, in the past decade an otherwise anonymous text published in 1572 known as De Arte Chimica (On the Art of Alchemy) has been shown to have very probably been composed by Agrippa!  Why do we think Agrippa wrote it?  What do we learn about his practice of Alchemy?  How does his Alchemy interact with his famous Three Books of Occult Philosophy?

Usually thought of as an ancient god who demanded worship through the sacrifice of children through burning, Moloch has become a truly horrifying entity in the Western Imagination  From Milton's Paradise Lost to contemporary Game Theory, Moloch conjures to mind demonic sacrifice, infants placed into its burning hands.  But what do we know about Moloch?  Was it a god, a demon or the ritual of fiery child sacrifice itself?

Here we find a list of nearly 100 books of demonic conjuration, astral magic, the hermetic art of talisman creation.  How many of these works still exist?  How many have been published?

But, what if it were possible harness the very forces of destiny and weld them as a means of empowering human beings?  The Talisman is just such a magical object: one with the power to harness astral forces by forging it at just the correct moment in time, capturing the forces of destiny. The Hermetic art of the Talisman was first described by the 9th century polymath Thabit ibn Qurra, among the final pagan sages of Harran.  In his textbook, known in Latin as De Imaginibus, he provides a systematic guide for the creation of Talismans of various kinds employing a range of astrological virtuosity. While now obscure, his textbook of Talismans was one of the most important magical manuals of the medieval world.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "title": "What is the Demiurge - Pt 2 - The Evil Creator of the Law and Father of Satan",
    "description": "While ancient philosophy disagreed on many things, there was broad agreement that the gods were good and the universe a beautiful, divinely made home.  However, by the 2nd century CE a scandalous, renegade position emerged that argued that physical reality was created as a cosmic prison by a demonic Crafter - The Demiurge.  Variously known as Ialdabaoth, Samael and Saklas, the malevolent Demiurge was one of the core components of what we know call \"Gnosticism.\"  But how did this shift happen, how did the Demiurge become evil? In this second episode we'll explore how polemics between early Christians and Jews seem to have posited that opponents of the Gospel had \"the Father of Satan\" as their Father.\"  Who is this primordially evil \"Father of Satan\"? Further, we will dive into the theology of Marcion who developed early Christian scriptures and theology that concluded that the Creator of the Cosmos and the 'God' of the Old Testament was, in fact, a wicked, demonic being contrasted to the loving, divine Christ.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "Kabbalah teaches that nothing can be known about the primordial, hidden realm of the Infinite (Ein Sof).  A oneness beyond all comprehension, an eternality beyond all contemplation.  Yet, out of that blindingly dark void stirs a vast contraction of light (tzimtzum) into which pours the cascading emanations of the divines essences (sefirot). Yet, one daring Kabbalist attempted to peer into the Shining Void of Ein Sof to discover what catalyzed Some-things from No-thing-ness.  R. Israel Sarug's mystical speculations set upon the eternal, infinite Divine Delight (שעשוע - sha’ashua) as he attempted to combine the Kabbalistic systems of Moses Cordovero with Isaac Luria.  Let's dive into some of the most profound mystical speculations of the 16th century Kabbalistic revolution.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "In 1396 the Inquisitor General Nicholas Eymerich lashed out against Alchemy.  He argued that alchemy was a fool's errand because the transmutation of metals was impossible given how God had created nature.  Thus, alchemists were at best frauds but at worst something profoundly sinful: heretics who would eventually forge pacts with Satan. In this episode I explore the most forceful attempt by the Inquisition to outlaw alchemy and condemn the alchemists to torture and being burned alive.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

In it we find Jesus 11 years after his resurrection, gathered around him select disciples to reveal the true mysteries of salvation:  a truly vast cosmology populated by a staggering range of regions and entities; the secret 4-fold baptisms reminiscent of Greco-Egyptian magical practice without which one was doomed to reincarnation; techniques of mystical ascent back to the ineffable, primordial light through heavenly citadels; all of which was most clearly comprehended not by the male apostles Peter or Paul but by Mary the Mother of Jesus, Martha and most especially Mary Magdalene.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

Despite this, the DOP goes tremendously understudied, making it much more celebrated than understood.  By extension, the totality of Agrippa’s occult philosophy - represented by his other theological, philosophical and hermetic writings - suffers all the more from lack of modern editions and translations. Finally, understanding Agrippa’s thought overall is greatly complicated by his infamous turn toward radical skepticism and fideism, seemingly his mature philosophical and theological position.  This series of lectures aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the occult philosophy of Cornelius Agrippa.",

    "description": "Following centuries where Platonic Forms and Ideas were taken to be eternally real, the middle ages saw a dramatic shift. And, by the mid-14th century, metaphysical categories were taken to be mere words, names - hence, Nominalism.  However, this philosophical triumph of Nominalism would be short lived.  In the mid-15th century, discoveries and translations of ancient texts would give rise to a Realist Revolution led by Platonism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah.

But rarely do we get insight into the entire mystical life of a person in the way that we do for the 13th century German Mechthild of Magdeburg.  Her \"Flowing Light of the Godhead\" is an amazing - if not at times shocking - record of the experiencing being taken into the luminous relationship of the Trinity, the courtship and blissful consummation of love with the Divine and yet finally falling into the very hellish pits of alienation from, and yet, with the Divine.

But, what are the origins of modern runic occultism? Johannes Bureus (d. 1652) was both among the founders of the academic study of Runes but also the founder of Esoteric Runology.  Following the philosophy of Gothicism, Bureus would argue that the Runes held ancient mystical secrets preserved from the confusion at the Tower of Babel and encoded in \"Runic Kabbalah.\"  He detailed this Esoteric Runology in his Adulruna Rediviva or The Rebirth of the Noble Runes, a work still unpublished to this day.  \n\nCheck out @NordicAnimism 's episode - https://youtu.be/H4Qa8JqDLv4?si=IvQowDT8-jNFdIAp\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

    "description": "Through the 1520s Paracelsus led a revolution in Alchemy and Medicine.  Rejecting the Galenic theory of the Humors in Medicine and the mechanistic sulfur-mercury theory in Alchemy, here we find his famed theory of the Tria Prima of Sulfur, Salt and Mercury, his Alchemical theory of the human body, and a medicine founded on the Hermetic principle that the microcosm is truly bound up with the cosmic macrocosm.  His medical philosophy foresaw organic chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and even psychiatry - the Paracelsian revolution in alchemical medicine. In this episode we explore his revolutionary textbook the Opus Paramirum (Beyond Wonders) as part II of our exploration of the foundations of the Paracelsian Revolution.\n\nEpisode I - The Paragranum - https://youtu.be/DqkuvWpH7AQ?si=8vvopsj9NAS21gVM\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\nNew to Studying Esotericism?

And, after this beatific vision, to employ that Divine Sigil to command the Celestial, Aerial and Terrestrial Spirits giving the majus nearly limitless magical power.  This book even argued that the Church's attempt to destroy magical practice was proof that the Church itself was demonic control!

By consulting several original volumes of alchemy, herbalism and distillation wisdom and using an exact reproduction of a 17th century alembic, I've re-created an alchemical treatment for melancholy!

From the Book of Enoch, the Gospel of Thomas or the Apocryphon of John, these mysterious books profoundly intrigue us.  But, of the books of the Hebrew Bible / Old Testament we actually know of several, perhaps dozens of ancient lost works of Israelite Scripture.  This episode explores those texts.  From the Book of the Wars of Yahweh, the Sefer Yashar, Royal Annals, lost books of Prophecy, obscure poetry and even the plan for the first Temple revealed to King David.  What do we know about these books? Have any of them been recovered?  What can we reveal about the religion of ancient Israel by exploring these lost books? And, are there also lost books referenced in the New Testament as well?\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store  \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nBauckham (Editor), Davila (Editor), Panayotov - Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: More Noncanonical Scriptures - 978-0802827395",

    "description": "The origins of the Kabbalistic Sefirot remain mysterious even after more than a century of historical research.  However, recent studies have shown how an otherwise purely monotheistic theology began to generate a system of multiple divine emanations. Attempting to bridge the gap between divine transcendence and immanence, early medieval Jewish scholars began to transform the Divine Glory (כבוד) into a quasi-angelic being.  More esoteric circles would eventual speculate that this \"Unique Cherub (הכרוב המיוחד)\" was actually an emanated, manifest aspect of the Divine visible to prophets and mystics but not the target of prayer which was reserved for the Hidden Glory (כבוד נסתר) known as Akhatriel. This Divine Angelic Emanation circle would greatly contribute to the Proto-Kabbalistic speculation that would eventually give rise to the system of the Sefirot.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store  \n\nRecommending Readings:\n\nDan - History of Jewish Mysticism vol II - 978-0765760081\nDan - The 'Unique Cherub Circle' - 978-3161467981\n\nThumbnail based on Nicholas Roerich - Mother of the World",

John of Rupescissa (d. c. 1365) spent most of his life in prisons composing prophetic predictions of the Apocalypse and curious alchemical works used to both cure the soldiers of Christ, greatly extend their lives and produce the riches needed to build the world of the Millennium.  One of these works, the Liber Lucis (Book of Light), is soon to be published in a new critical edition by Prof. Lawrence M. Principe.

    "description": "The Knights Templar remain as fascinating and they are misrepresented in media, pseudo-history and conspiracy theories. Despite these distortions, the Templars do actually have at their foundations a kind of mystical constitution created by the Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux.  The Liber ad Milites Templi de Laude Novae Militiae (Book to the Knights of the Temple, in praise of the new knighthood) outlines the justification for Christian violence, why such a 'new knighthood' is needed and how that knighthood could attain mystical union with the divine despite spilling blood.  The text also contains a mystical series of geographic meditation on sites within the Holy Land by which the Templar Knight could attain to holiness and the Divine Kiss.  Bernard of Clairvaux's own contemplative mysticism of love is bound up with both the spiritual and physical warfare of these warrior monks.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store  \n\nRecommended readings:\n\nBernard of Clairvaux: Selected Works - 978-0809129171\nMcGinn - The Growth of Mysticism: Gregory the Great Through the 12 Century - 978-0824516284\nIn Praise of the New Knighthood - 978-0879071202\n\nBarber - The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple  - 978-1107604735 & The Trial of the Templars 978-1107645769\nThe Templars: Selected Sources - 978-0719051104\nJones - The Templars: The Rise and Spectacular Fall of God's Holy Warriors -  978-0143108962\n\nEsoterica Theme - Chopin's Nocturnes Op. 9 No. 1.

    "title": "What is the Demiurge - Pt 1 - How the God Yahweh Became a Demon",
    "description": "While ancient philosophy disagreed on many things, there was broad agreement that the gods were good and the universe a beautiful, divinely made home.  However, by the 2nd century CE a scandalous, renegade position emerged that argued that physical reality was created as a cosmic prison by a demonic Crafter - The Demiurge.  Variously known as Ialdabaoth, Samael and Saklas, the malevolent Demiurge was one of the core components of what we know call \"Gnosticism.\"  But how did this shift happen, how did the Demiurge become evil.  In this first episode in a series on the Demiurge, we explore the earliest movement in this direction: (1) the origins of the Demiurge in Plato and (2) How the Israelite god Yahweh came to be demonized and associated with the Egyptian demonic deity Seth in the anti-Judaic polemics of the ancient world.  Future episodes will cover the rise of Marcion and this Theology and finally a comparison of the various manifestations of the Demiurge in Sethian and Valentinian literature. This episode is collaboration with scholar and friend @m.davidlitwa  - check out his companion video and subscribe to his channel for deep dives on Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Ancient Mystery Religions and early Christianity .\n\nDr. Litwa's Episode - https://youtu.be/OlXP0V6CACU\n\nWhere is the music for the opening?

The Inquisition of the 14th century saw the burning of Joan of Arc, the Templars and Marguerite Porete along with the foundations of the Witch Trials to come.

In addition to her mystical visions, she also divined a mystical language she referred to as the \"lingua ignota\" or unknown language along with a mystical alphabet.

    "title": "How Aristotle Accidentally Helped to Invent Alchemy (and got nearly everything wrong)",
    "description": "Reading historical texts of alchemy is puzzling because the underlying theory of transmutation is utterly foreign to modern physics and chemistry.  Interestingly enough, the theory of alchemical change originated in the Meteorological speculations of none less than Aristotle.  In his text the Meteorlogica he attempts to deploy his physics to explain phenomena between the Earth and the Heavens such as shooting stars, comets, sundogs, rainbows, etc. But in the same text, however, he will also provide his theory of \"exhalations\" which will also serves to explain how metals and minerals form deep within the earth.  Thus, Aristotle's Meteorologica will not only explain how metals and minerals form but will also ultimately provide the physics by which substantial transmutation was thought to be achieved by the alchemists - a theory which endured for over 2000 years.  \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nWilson - Structure and Method in Aristotle's Meteorologica: A More Disorderly Nature - 978-1107042575\nReeve - Aristotle's Chemistry - 978-1647920890\nLettinck - Aristotle's Meteorology and its Reception in the Arab World - 978-90-04-10933-9\nG.Vuillemin-Diem - Aristoteles Latinus: Meteorologica.

    "description": "Enochian magic has fueled the imagination since the first spirit sessions in the 1580s.  But, prior to the language of the angels and the apocalyptic rituals of the Liber Loagaeth, Dee and Kelley received complex revelations for the construction of a sacred temple with furniture, vestments and the very ring of Solomon.  Included in this revelations were an otherwise unknown retinue of angelic and spiritual beings.  All taken together these early Enochian workings are known as the Heptarchia Mystica, the Mystical Rulership of the Seven.  \n\n#angel #magic #occultism \n\nSupport Aaron - Books and Ritual Items:\n\nhttps://aaronleitch.wordpress.com/\nhttps://www.patreon.com/aaronleitch\nhttps://docsolomons.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DocSolomons\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nLeitch - The Essential Enochian Grimoire - 978-0738737003\nPeterson (ed) - John Dee's Five Books of Mystery - 978-1108051651\nJames - The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee - 978-1578634538\nDuQuette - Enochian Vision Magick - 978-1578636846\n\nPeterson's position on the Holy Table - http://www.esotericarchives.com/dee/holytab.htm\nLeitch on restoring the Heptarchia Mystica - https://www.llewellyn.com/journal/article/2423",

    "description": "The Library of Alexandria has become more the stuff of legend than reliable history.  What do we know about the origins of the Library?  What were the scope and size of it's holdings - did it really contain hundreds of thousands of book rolls and did it hold ancient, arcane wisdom?  And, finally, what was responsible for the destruction that allegedly plunged the west into the Dark Ages.  Let's separate the myths from historical evidence by situating the founding of the library in Hellenistic empire building, the size of the library  using what we know about ancient books and libraries and learn that the library probably died as much from neglect as conflagration.  \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommended Readings \n\nBagnall - Alexandria: Library of Dreams - https://archive.org/details/bagnall-2002-alexandria\nDid Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab Burn the Library of Alexandria? - https://youtu.be/ZxwaSMfD8ho?si=chhs6FtkcmmLQ29b",

    "description": "Plato is perhaps the greatest philosopher of all time.  He is renowned for his wide-ranging philosophical dialogues which laid the groundwork for all subsequent western philosophers.  Despite his keen use of logic and argumentation, Plato also praises a form of ecstatic knowledge brought on by four forms of divine madness of mania.  Indeed, he views this form of knowledge as superior to even philosophy itself in allowing the soul to grasp the eternal truth itself.  What is this madness which leads to true genius?  In this episode of Esoterica we explore Plato's conception of the 'mania' and the inheritance of this concept in Renaissance Hermetic philosophers such as Marsilio Ficino, Cornelius Agrippa in his famous Three Books of Occult Philosophy and Giordano Bruno.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommended Readings\n\nPlato: Complete Works - 978-0872203495\nDodds - The Greeks and the Irrational - 978-0520242302\nUstinova - Divine Mania: Alteration of Consciousness in Ancient Greece - 978-0367594268\nHanegraaf - The Platonic Frenzies in Ficino - https://www.academia.edu/1170518/The_Platonic_Frenzies_in_Ficino_2010_\nKrallice - Diotima - https://krallice.bandcamp.com/album/diotima\n\n#philosophy #plato #mania",

However, a recent trip to Salem inspired me with two questions - (1). How did those at the ground zero of the diabolism outbreak - Abigail Williams, Betty Parris & Tituba - survive the panic and prosecutions? (2). What was the judicial theory and demonology behind the panic.

    "description": "Reboot, along with Detroit Public Theatre and Detroit Public Television, invites you for a pre-Halloween event, Erev Halloween if you will, to celebrate the most famous Jewish monster, the Golem, its history and contemporary lessons, at a festival of music, film, conversation and art. This interactive experience will be hosted in Detroit – a premier event for Reboot’s local art and culture programming. \n\nThe event will feature author Adam Mansbach, who skyrocketed to fame after the publication of the #1 New York Times bestselling pseudo-children’s book Go the F*ck to Sleep, and Dr. Justin Sledge, Detroit-based professor of Ethics, Religion, and Social-Political Philosophy with an emphasis on Jewish esotericism and the occult.\n\nThis fall, Mansbach published his fifth novel, The Golem of Brooklyn (One World, an imprint of Penguin Random House, September 2023) – a ferociously funny reimagining of the golem of Jewish folklore, who is accidentally brought to life in a basement apartment in Brooklyn and embarks on an absurd road trip to face off against the rising threat of antisemitism in America. In a conversation moderated by Angelique Power, president & CEO of The Skillman Foundation, Mansbach and Dr. Sledge will discuss the historical and contemporary connection between the legend of the golem and Jewish links between the supernatural, creativity and tikkun olam (repairing the world). \n\nThe evening will feature a variety of creative mediums. This includes Detroit artists Olivia Guterson and Faina Lerman manifesting Jewish monsters with a live painting installation, along with a digital art collection by Lynne Avadenka displayed for viewers. Excerpts of the newly remastered 1921 classic film The Golem: How He Came into This World will also be premiered along with Reboot’s new vinyl release of an original film score. The score was created in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the commercial release of Paul Wegener’s silent horror classic and features world class (and local Detroit) artists such as Alan Licht, Gretchen Gonzales, Rebecca Odes, John Olson, Nate Young, Sharon Gal, ∈Y∋, Scott Amendola, Steve Berlin (Los Lobos), and Steven Drozd (Flaming Lips).\n\nThis conversation on “The Golem of Brooklyn” was produced by Reboot in cooperation with PBS Books, which recorded and made it available for viewing on YouTube and other digital channels.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store",

    "description": "Gnosticism is infamous for its conception of the cosmos as the creation of the satanic Demiurge.  But along with this entity is a retinue of demonic cosmic powers or Archons that act as co-creators and wardens of this prison universe.  Join me as I explore the origins, nature and function of the Archons.

    "description": "The Witchcraft trials began to mutate in the early 17th century.  Most strikingly they came to be accompanied by widespread, mass demonic possession.  This was especially prevalent in France with the possessions at Loudon from 1634-1637.  As a convent of nuns became afflicted with a host of demons, they also implicated the dashing priest Urbain Grandier of sorcery.  His sensational trial would produce one of the very few historical Satanic Pacts all resulting in his being burned alive in 1634.  The possession and public exorcisms would go on until 1637 when the final Nun to be freed of demonic influence received a miraculous imprint on her hand.  But, was this all just a stunt to have Grandier murdered?  Did demons and sorcerers stalk 17th Loudon, France?  \n\n#witchcraft #occultism #satan #demons #magic \n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nDe Certeau - The Possession at Loudun - 978-0226100357\nFerber - Demonic Possession and Exorcism In Early Modern France - 978-0415212656\nHuxley - The Devils of Loudun - 978-0061724916\nThe Devils (film) - https://archive.org/details/1971-the-devils/%5B1971%5D+The+Devils.mkv",

    "description": "Paracelsus was a true visionary, single-handedly leading a revolution in medicine, alchemy, philosophy and magical practice.  Yet, despite his decisive importance and celebrated status in Scientific and Occult history his mountain of literary works go virtually unread outside a small cadre of specialists.  In the first of a multi-part series we are going to dive into the authentic works of Paracelsus to uncover what led to his break with past theory and practice, his theoretical and practical philosophy of alchemy, medicine and magic and the power of his influence through the centuries. In this first episode we provide some important background and explore his decisive early text the Paragranum.  In that text Paracelsus will reject previous theory and practice to re-establish medicine on four new pillars: Philosophy as Nature, Astronomy as Arcane Power, Alchemy as Perfecting Reality and Virtue as Christ-like Redemption of the human being.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\n#alchemy #magic #paracelsus #occultism #medicine \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nAureoli Philippi Theophrasti Bombasts von Hohenheim Paracelsi ...

Specifically how Theosophy would see the history of salvation is a history of the alchemical process of de-transmutation (the fall of human kind), the individual transmutation of Jesus of Nazareth as Christ-Sophia, the spiritual transmutation of humanity and nature (redemption), before a final physical transmutation of all of reality as the reconciliation of the divine with itself - all of which as on vast Alchemical symphony.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nZuber - Spiritual Alchemy: From Jacob Boehme to Mary Anne Atwood - 978-0190073046\n\nOther Readings:\n\nLinden, Stanton J.

Yukio Mishima, among the most important post-war Japanese writers, would argue near the end of his life that the desire for out-of-body ecstatic experience is profoundly misguided.  For him, the Absolute could only truly be experienced in radical embodiment, developing muscle into a classically beautiful physique only to plunge it, at its aesthetic height, into complete destruction through Heroic Death.  Mishima would lay out his mysticism of muscle and annihilation, in his 1968 essay Sun and Steel, a work that would explain and pre-figure his own public, ritual death by Seppuku only two years later.  A mystical text like virtually no other, Mishima's Sun and Steel remains as controversial as it does challenging now over 50 years since it first appeared.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nMishima - Sun and Steel - 978-6159424645\n\nIntroduction to the Life and Works of Mishima - https://youtu.be/xztvS8eks4U\n\n#mishima #samurai #lifting #mysticism",

Perhaps the most radical answer ever given to to this question was to reject the very concept of change itself.  Parmenides would argue that Being alone exists and that Truth was to think the One and only the One. In his a poem revealed to him by a Goddess in the House of Night, he would effectively would effectively invent Western Metaphysics and Logic.  In that now fragmentary text his revelation would detail how Being alone is real with change, time and the world of sensation being mere illusions.  Indeed, Parmenides may have been the first and last philosopher of pure being with all hitherto western metaphysics being a betrayal of Thinking Being, a willing amnesia of Truth itself.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\n#metaphysics #philosophy #parmenides \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nAustin, Scott.

    "title": "How Exorcism Became Medieval Necromancy & Demonic Conjuration - History of Magic",
    "description": "Medieval necromancy is strangely uniform in its rituals, language and symbols despite being an underground movement at the heterodox periphery of the minor clergy. What explains this uniformity?  An important cause goes to the origins of medieval necromancy itself - that European Necromancy originates in the ancient rituals of Exorcism. In this episode I explore the relationship between exorcism and demonic conjuration from an exorcism ritual divinely revealed to Hildegard of Bingen, a mirror that summons Lilith to reveal mysteries, a bizarre exorcism in the horrid witch-hunting manual Malleus Maleficarum to Exorcism Manuals so close to magic that they were eventually banned by the Catholic Church.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nThesaurus Exorcismorum - https://www.google.com/books/edition/Thesaurus_Exorcismorum_Atque_Conjuration/jgDaPgAACAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1",

    "description": "\"Hermeticism\" and \"Hermetic\" are exceedingly elastic concepts capturing a wide and disparate range of ideas  - what explains the conceptual elasticity of the concept of something being \"hermetic.\"  This episode offers a suggestion that the some of the valances of the term are literally bound up with the texts that were often printed alongside the Corpus Hermeticum.  Thus by exploring the printing history of the Corpus Hermeticum we may come to better understand how we conceive of what is and is not 'hermetic.'\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\n@TheModernHermeticist  - Is the Kybalion Really Hermetic? - https://youtu.be/7rCF6vSeZ3k\nSam Block on the Kybalion - https://www.reddit.com/r/Hermeticism/comments/13v6ilx/psa_the_kybalion_is_not_a_hermetic_text/\n\n1497 - https://archive.org/details/A335081/page/n5/mode/1up\n1516 - https://www.google.com/books/edition/Index_eorum_quae_hoc_in_libro_habentur_I/HFe2gJI5SmsC?hl=en&gbpv=1\n1532 - https://www.google.com/books/edition/Pymander_de_potestate_et_sapientia_Dei_E/k79QAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1\n1549 - https://www.google.com/books/edition/De_mysteriis_Aegyptiorum_liber/f8U7AAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1\n\n1497 Reading List:\n\n1) 'On the mysteries of the Aegyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians' by Iamblichus (250-325 CE) (Iamblichus de mysteriis Aegyptiorum.

In later editions, Weyer would also include a demonological text he entitled the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (\"False Kingdom of the Demons\") to mock the pretensions of would-be necromancers.

    "description": "Breaking with centuries of philosophical and spiritual tradition, the Syrian philosopher Iamblichus put forward a theory of salvation in which religious devotion and reverence, rather than an intellectual inward turn to 'know thyself,' was the sole means by which to achieve \"henosis,\" or union with the divine. Break with Plato and Plotinus, Iamblichus argued that the soul could ascend to the One, the Good and the Beautiful by becoming co-creators with the demiurgic Gods of the Cosmos through the ancient rituals of the Egyptians, Chaldeans and Greeks and their sacred scriptures.  By contrasting intellectual 'theory' and 'theology' for theurgy - 'God-Doing,' Iamblichus paves a radical new path in ancient pagan spirituality, ironically bringing it closer to early Christian Sacramentalism.\n\n#occult #magic #theurgy #paganism #philosophy \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommending Readings:\n\nTaylor - On the Egyptian Mysteries (many reprints)\nClarke - Iamblichus: On the Mysteries - 978-1589830585\n\nShaw - Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus - 978-1621380634\nClarke - Iamblichus' De Mysteriis: A Manifesto of the Miraculous - 978-0754604082\n\nWallis - Neoplatonism - 978-0872202870\nDillon - Neoplatonic Philosophy: Introductory Readings - 978-0872207073",

    "description": "What is Spiritual alchemy? Emerging from the early 20th century quasi-vitalist, mystical interpretation of Mircea Eliade and the psychologizing interpretation of Carl Jung - both marked by a profoundly ahistorical approach - a position now known as the “new historiography” has attempted to re-locate alchemical theory and practice precisely as a historically developing theory of nature and the transformation of nature.  However, many on the channel ask the same resounding question: “But what about the spiritual aspect of alchemy?  Isn’t alchemy really about inner or spiritual transformation and not changing lead into gold?”  In this episode, the first of several in a series, I’m going to explore just that question - the origins and development of spiritual alchemy in the European alchemical tradition. From radical mysticism of salvation, the alchemy of Paracelsus and heretical Protestants will emerge a theory of alchemical salvation with Christ as the philosophers' stone and will lay the groundwork for Theosophy and Occult spirituality for centuries to come.\n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\n#occult #theosophy #alchemy #philosopherstone #mysticism \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nZuber - Spiritual Alchemy: From Jacob Boehme to Mary Anne Atwood - 978-0190073046\n\nOther Readings:\n\nLinden, Stanton J.

    "description": "Ancient Jewish Merkavah Mysticism sought to ascend into the palaces of the divine realm, bypass fearsome angels of destruction to gain a vision of the very Chariot-Throne of God.  By beholding the divine glory (kavod) one could gain magical powers and even be transformed into an eternal Angel.  And it was this form of esoteric mysticism that it appears profoundly transformed none-less than St Paul.  From his ascent into the Third Heaven to even his 'mission to the gentiles,' historical evidence now strongly indicates that Paul was a secret practitioner of this form of mystical ascent.  And, recent studies are now revealing that his very Theology, Christology and Theory of Salvation likely drew upon this ancient esoteric Jewish ascent mysticism.  \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nSynopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur - Schafer - 978-3161445125\nJames Davila - Hekhalot Literature in Translation: Major Texts of Merkavah Mysticism - 978-9004252158\n\nJames Davila - Descenders to the Chariot: The People Behind the Hekhalot Literature - 978-9004115415\nVita Daphna Arbel - Beholders of Divine Secrets: Mysticism and Myth in the Hekhalot and Merkavah Literature - 978-0791457245\nMichael D.

    "description": "Thoth was among the most complex and mysterious gods of the ancient Egyptian world.  His origins lost to time, he would become the deity of writing, heka (magic), the moon and fate.  He would aid in the resurrection of Osiris, intercede on the part of justice (ma'at) in the dispute between Horus and Set and go on to become worshiped at Hermopolis as Lord of the Ogdoad.

    "description": "King Solomon is legendary for his wisdom and knowledge, which, according to legend extended to the Occult.  Though the \"Key of Solomon\" magical literature is famous in western ritual magic, what do we know about the origins of this school of sorcery - What are the origins of Solomonic Magic?  In this episode I turn to the earliest text of Solomonic Magic, the Greek Hygromancy or \"Talismanic Treatise of Solomon to his Son Rehoboam.\"  In this complex Greek text, Solomon describes the evocation of Planetary Spirits, Angels and Demons, Elective Astrology, and the Occult virtues of \"Words, Herbs & Stones.\"  In addition, this text attracted a vast array of ritual and magical microforms which go on to form the structural core of western magic - from the knife of art, various forms of divination, the magical circle and, most famously, the powerful Ring and Seal of Solomon.  This magical treatise is truly foundational for the history of Western Magic and Occultism.\n\n#occult #magic #solomon #goetia \n\nConsider Supporting Esoterica!\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nPaypal Donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nMerch - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoydhtfFSk1fZXNRnkGnneQ/store\n\nHarley MS 5596 - https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Harley_MS_5596\n\nOld Testament Pseudepigrapha: More Noncanonical Scriptures - 978-0802827395\nMarathakis - The Magical Treatise of Solomon or Hygromanteia - 978-0993204272",

    "description": "Interest in Gnosticism and Gnostic texts has exploded since the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library.  However, Gnostic Scriptures began to be discovered as early the 18th century.  In 1769, a Gnostic codex came to light that combined ancient mystical ascent literature, gnostic cosmological speculation of the lower Aeons and celestial \"Treasuries of Light,\" along with the quasi-magical rituals, baptisms, ciphers and seals to ascend into the realm of Light.  These two incredibly complex volumes are now known to scholars as the Books of Jeu, after the Demiurge of the text, and are not only the most complete and complex manuals of ritual ascent but also the only illustrated Gnostic texts from antiquity.

    "description": "Stoicism is very much in vogue from tech to the military but it may also lay at the very origins of Western Esotericism.  Much of the theory of western occultism - that is to say that one can harness hidden powers in the cosmos - actually has important origins in Stoic Philosophy.  Overwhelmingly known for their rationalism, materialism and famous for the notion of apatheia or the extinction of the pathe or passions or emotions, Stoicism contributed three quintessential elements to the development of western occultism: (1) ancient, sagely proximity to divine wisdom (perennialism and prisca theologia), (2) the concealment of that wisdom in religious texts and myths along with the method by which just those secrets are revealed or allegoresis and (3) the cosmic system of connections or sumpatheia by which which all of reality is united into one vast cosmobiology thus setting the stage for the metaphysical correspondences underwriting everything from magic to alchemy.

    "description": "There is perhaps nothing that evokes the grim, tortured terror of the middle ages more than the institution of the Inquisition.  Long conceived as the worst imaginable combination of legal impunity and religious fanaticism, the inquisition remains more the object of horror than deeply understood. Originating in the 13th century attempt to suppress the dualist form of Christianity known as Catharism, the medieval Inquisition would grow to become one of the enduring institutions of European Christianity, surviving even to this day as the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. In the first episode of a series, let’s explore the origins and eventual procedures of the medieval Inquisition.  Follow up episodes will trace the development of the Inquisition, the various medieval heresies it combatted, the lives and works of the Inquisitors, and it's infamous Spanish and Roman versions.\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#heresy #inqusitition #cathars #occult",

    "description": "Critical Theory or the Frankfurt School has been accused by modern spiritual seekers as mercilessly continuing Marx's materialist criticism of religion as alienated delusion, by itself being inspired by messianic ideas found in the Kabbalah yet simultaneously by the far right as purposely injecting occultism into popular culture as a means to destroy 'traditional Western Judeo-Christian values.'  But what did members of the Frankfurt school actually write about occultism?  In this series with @drangelapuca we will be carefully reading and unpacking Adorno's difficult 1947 polemic \"Theses Against Occultism\" especially with an idea to recent thinking on the enchantment/disenchantment of modernity, the relationship of occultism to the 'political spectrum,' the historical context of this text (e.g., it was written the same year Aleister Crowley died) and to what degree does Adorno simply misunderstand or misrepresent the occult and occult spirituality.\n\nYou can read the text here: https://cominsitu.wordpress.com/2021/07/13/theses-against-occultism-adorno-1947/\n\nSUPPORT Dr Puca’s work on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/angelapuca or Paypal https://paypal.me/angelasymposium\nFOLLOW Dr Puca: YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@drangelapuca), Facebook (Angela's Symposium), Instagram (angela_symposium), Twitter (@angelapuca11), TikTok (Angela's Symposium).\n\nSupport Esoterica - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel",

    "description": "The medieval Gnostic Cathars have become the stuff of legend - but what exactly was their philosophy and theology?  Surviving in a single manuscript, the Book of the Two Principles (Liber de Duobus Principiis) is the most sustained work of Cathar theology to have survived all attempts to exterminate this dualist form of Christianity.  This volume argues in support of radical metaphysical dualism and against the freedom of the will for the truly righteous, even polemizing against other Cathar factions.  Surviving the fires of the Inquisition, the text is a fascinating glimpse into Catharism!\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#cathars #inquisition #heresy #gnosticism \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nCathar Texts online - http://gnosis.org/library/cathtx.htm\nSumma Catharis - https://archive.org/details/ThesaurusNovusAnecdotorum5/page/n893/mode/1up\nDavid  Zbíral - Heretical Hands at Work: Reconsidering the Genesis of a Cathar Manuscript (Ms. Firenze, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Conv. soppr.

Both looking back to the Olympic Planetary Spirits of the ancient Hellenistic Pagan World but also very modern for the time, embracing both Calvinism and the alchemic and magical ideas of Paracelsus.  This grimoire, or magical handbook, also provides one of the most clear and beneficent forms of magic ever developed, marked by simple piety, streamlined ritual and one's ethical duty to God, Self & Neighbors.  Indeed, virtually every magical handbook published after would, in some way, be influenced by it's magic: from Dr. John Dee's Enochian sessions, the early Rosicrucians & the African magical traditions of the Caribbean and North America.

We’ll be studying one of the more famous sections of the Zohar where a wonder-child (“Yanuka,” hence the name of this section) outwits and even chides the mystical companions with his profound knowledge of the secrets of the Torah.  We’ll be studying the text weekly until we finish it - likely to take several sessions.\r\n\r\nIf you want to study along you can find the English translation we’ll be using in vol. IX of the Matt-Pritzker edition, pgs 245-296 or Parsha Balak 3:186a–192a in the standard Aramaic edition.  You can find the Aramaic with partial translation at Sefaria - https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.186a?lang=bi\r\n\r\nNo previous knowledge of Zohar or Aramaic-Hebrew needed, study will be in English.

    "description": "The Death Drive is the most controversial theory to arise out of Freudian Psychoanalysis.  That all life has an inner drive towards self-destruction and aggression which emerges most clearly in our own compulsion to repeat our traumas brought the Freudian theory of the psyche to the brink of collapse by 1920.  In \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\" Freud would introduce the Death Drive as a solution to this riddle but it also opened the door to a unique and powerfully frightening theory of mysticism.  It would be Georges Bataille that would center the Death Drive in his own theory of the Erotic, Sacrifice and Religious Mysticism. \n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n@SeekersofUnity 's episode - https://youtu.be/NSNVB-iYNyY\n\n#freud #psychoanalysis #bataille #deathdrive #lacan #mysticism \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nSpielrein -  \"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\" - https://web.archive.org/web/20160306065337/http://arizonapsychoanalyticsociety.com/downloads/sabrina.pdf\n\nFreud - Beyond the Pleasure Principle - 978-0393007695\nFreud - Civilization and Its Discontents - 978-0393617092\nFreud - The Freud Reader - 978-0393314038\n\nBataille - Erotism: Death and Sensuality - 978-0872861909\nBataille - The Accursed Share - 978-0942299113\nBataille - Theory of Religion - 978-0942299090\n\nBarker - The Hellbound Heart - 978-0061452888",

    "description": "Possession by demonic forces is probably older than civilization.  Yet, a curious shift happened in Jewish history.  After nearly 1000 years pass with no virtually no demonic possession narratives in Judaism, a new form of possession emerges in the 16th century - the Dybbuk.  In this episode I trace the history and development of the Dybbuk in the Kabbalah.  From the transformation of the souls of sinners into demonic powers, the process of reincarnation (gilgul) and impregnation (ibbur), and polypsychism the development of the Dybbuk is truly extraordinary and frighting.

    "description": "One could argue that the Witch truly entered the late medieval popular imagination with the print publication of Molitor's 1489  De Lamiis et Pythonicis Mulieribus (\"On Witches and Diviners\"). Written as a response and implicit criticism of the fanatical Malleus Maleficarum published only a few years prior, Molitor's work would go on to over 40 editions in the ensuing period of the witch trials making it the most popular demonological textbook of the period.  Indeed, its six woodcut images of witches and witchcraft would form the basis for nearly all future such depictions in the western world and still influences us today. \n\n#witch #witchcraft #occult #demonology \n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nMolitor - De Lamiis et Pythonicis Mulieribus - https://archive.org/details/delamiisetphiton00moli/mode/1up\n\nKieckhefer - Hazards of the Dark Arts - 978-0271078403",

One where inner, spiritual knowledge is the key to salvation, where women and men have equal standing based on their understanding of the message of the Savior and one where the soul must rise above the demonic gatekeepers of the physical cosmos rather than to believe in credal formulas or even the salvific power of the death and resurrection of Jesus. In this Gospel, Mary Magdalene is the true inheritor of the spiritual Gospel of Christ rather than Peter who attacks her solely based on her gender, despite her profound relationship with the Savior and her understanding of his secret teachings.\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nMeyer - The Nag Hammadi Scriptures - 978-0061626005\nKing - The Gospel of Mary of Magdala: Jesus and the First Woman Apostle - 978-0944344583\nTuckett - The Gospel of Mary -978-0199212132\nDe Boer - The Gospel of Mary: Listening to the Beloved Disciple - 978-0567082640\nBrock - Mary Magdalene, The First Apostle - 978-0674009660",

    "description": "The Voynich Manuscript is the most mysterious manuscript in the world.  This apparent cipher text appears to be a guide to otherworldly herbal, cosmological and even gynecology lore.  And, despite centuries of expert analysis it remains undeciphered.  What explains the strange language and script the Voynich is composed in?  Is it language foreign to the world of the manuscript's 15th century composition, an artificial language to hide its secrets, obscured in an elaborate form of encryption or a shocking late-medieval hoax.  In this episode I argue that recent statistical, informational and cryptological analysis is increasingly pointing in the direction of the hoax hypothesis.\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#voynichmanuscript #cryptology #codes #enochian\n\nRecommended readings:\n\nClemens & Harkness - The Voynich Manuscript (Yale Facsimile) - 9780300217230\nM.

    "description": "Redemption Through Sin? Sabbatai Zevi's claim to be the King Messiah was convincing to perhaps more than half of the world's Jews before his apostacy in September 1666.  Then the movement went underground, with small communities still holding the faith for nearly 400 years now.  What were the actual Kabbalistic doctrines developed by this heretic messiah's prophet, Nathan of Gaza, that actually supported the claims that Shabbatai Zevi was the long awaited Messiah?  In this episode, I'll be exploring, in depth, the early writings of the messianic movement - like The infamous and untranslated Treatise on the Dragons -  from the struggle of the messiah's soul plunged into the depths of the demonic klippot, his escape via the 'holy ruse,' and the justification of his openly transgressive deeds and eventual apostasy. \n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#kabbalah #messiah #heresy \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nScholem - Sabbatai Ṣevi: The Mystical Messiah, 1626–1676 - 978-0691172095\nFreely - The Lost Messiah: In Search of the Mystical Rabbi Sabbatai Sevi - 978-1585673186 (basically a precis of Scholem)\nSisman  - The Burden of Silence: Sabbatai Sevi and the Evolution of the Ottoman-Turkish Dönmes - 978-0190698560\nBaer - The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks - 978-0804768689\nMaciejko - The Mixed Multitude: Jacob Frank and the Frankist Movement, 1755-1816 - 978-0812223439\nMaciejko - Sabbatian Heresy: Writings on Mysticism, Messianism, and the Origins of Jewish Modernity - 978-1512600520\nHalperin - Sabbatai Zevi: Testimonies to a Fallen Messiah - 978-1906764241\nRapoport-Albert - Women and the Messianic Heresy of Sabbatai Zevi - 978-1906764807\nElior - Jacob Frank's 'Book of the Words of the Lord' - 978-9042936508\nבעקבות משיח - blimabooks.com\nספר הבריאה - holzerbooks.com (caveat lector)",

    "description": "Like many fields, the theory and practice of Magic underwent radical renovation and transformation during the 15th century Renaissance.  Ficino's translations of Hermetic and Platonic texts along with  Pico's infusion of Kabbalah into magic would create new vistas in the European world of magic.  Reuchlin would not only transmit these ideas across the Alps to inform Agrippa and Dee, but his own works would further push this Kabbalistic-Magical reformation.  In this episode - as part of a collaboration with @TheModernHermeticist - I'll be covering his important, but still untranslated, 1492 De Verbo Mirifico (The Wonder-Working Word) where Reuchlin argues that all of magic can be reformed by returning to primaeval words of power.  Further, that a new power, miracle-making word יה(ש)וה has the power to transform all of magic, philosophy and magic!\n\n#occult #magic #kabbalah \n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\nDr. Attrell's Episode: https://youtu.be/G1eRYosKys4\n\nRecommended Readings:\nReuchlin - De Verbo Mirifico (Latin) - https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_lS_ozB8_LlQC/page/n1/mode/2up\nPico - 900 Conclusions (Latin) - https://archive.org/details/pico-1486-900-conclusiones/mode/2up\nZika - Reuchlin's De Verbo Mirifico and the Magic Debate of the Late Fifteenth Century - https://www.jstor.org/stable/751134",

    "description": "The Revelation of the Enochian Language to John Dee and Edward Kelley is one of the most celebrated and mysterious moments in the history of Western Esotericism.  Here the angels reveal the \"calls' or 'keys' by which the powerful Liber Loagaeth is to be unlocked, perhaps even heralding the Apocalypse itself.  In these Calls we find what appears to be a functioning language with non-random words, syntax, morphology, numerals, even hints of verb conjugation and noun declensions.  In this episode - the third in our series on the Enochian Language - I'll be exploring the language of the calls, their mode of revelation and their meaning within the scope of Enochian Magic as it was taught to Dee and Kelly.  \n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#occult #enoch #kabbalah \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nLeitch - The Angelical Language, Volume I - 978-0738714905 \nVolume II - 978-0738714912\n\nBuy signed copies here to support the author, tell him I sent ya!  - http://docsolomons.com/wp/product/autographed-books/\n\nKlein - The Complete Mystical Records of Dr. John Dee - 978-0738763002\n\nTwilight Grotto - http://www.esotericarchives.com/dee/index.html\nLaycock - Complete Enochian Dictionary - 978-1578632541",

    "description": "HP Lovecraft and the mythos he developed - from the insanity-inducing elder ones, Cthulhu and his legion of great deep ones poised to erase humanity when the stars are right, to the most horrid volume imaginable, the dread Necronomicon - have emerged from pulp obscurity and dismissal to become pillars of pop-culture, literature, music and beyond. His works are known for brooding antiquarian interest, architectural and ancestral decay, profound, indeed deeply racist fear of the Other, beings whose cosmic-scale indifference threatens sanity and civilization, and occult knowledge that threatens to unlock the vault of eldritch nightmares from the gulfs beyond the stars.  While Lovecraft and his often contradictory mythos have been explored at length, this episode explores just what occult influences operated and inspired Lovecraft.  Was his mythos consciously or even unconsciously infused with ancient, occult lore?  What exactly were the esoteric literary resources Lovecraft relied upon to build out his mythos? To what degree does authentic, historical occult knowledge actually make its way into his tales?  Just what are the occult origins of Chtulhu, the Necromonicon, Yog Sothoth, the Pnakoptic Fragments and Nyarlathotep?\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#lovecraft #cthulhu #necronomicon \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nNinth edition - Encyclopaedia Britannica - https://digital.nls.uk/encyclopaedia-britannica/archive/190218840",

    "description": "Starting in the early 1980’s the Satanic Panic ignited in the United States before spreading through the world.  Here law enforcement, psychiatrists, social workers and occult ‘experts’ uncovered a vast satanic conspiracy which predated upon children at daycares, infiltrated heavy metal music, lured in teenagers through Dungeons and Dragons all organized by a grand network of satanic covens.  These claims resulted in constant bullying for social non-conformists, hundreds of arrests, prosecutions, compromised guilty verdicts along with accusations which ruined lives and livelihoods for many more.  The Satanic Panic is even more shocking when considering that no evidence has come to light in over 40 years to substantiate these claims.  Feeding on centuries of demonological lore set into the social and economic degradation of the last quarter of the 20th century, the Satanic Panic continues to have a decisive social impact.

What followed was a series of witchcraft prosecutions stretching from Copenhagen to Edinburgh in which James VI of Scotland personally sought to root out and destroy witchcraft and necromancy in his realm.  These dreadful trials inspired his 1597 Daemonologie, detailing the reality, nature, activity and means to detect and punish witches and sorcerers along with a protestant analysis of the array of diabolical forces, the spirits and devils who take the forms of ghosts and fairies with whom witches and necromancers commune.

    "description": "Metatron is probably the most powerful and mysterious Angel in Jewish lore.  But what are the origins of this being known as the \"Lesser Yahweh (יהוה הקתן)\" ? In the 5/6th century ce Sefer Hekhalot (Book of Palaces or 3 Enoch), we go on a heavenly journey to the Throne (merkavah) of God with Rabbi Ishmael to learn that the angel Metatron was once Enoch, transformed into a being of fire, witness a host of angelic systems, a tour of the Paradise and She'ol, the Underworld, a glimpse of the Right Hand of the Divine and even a glimpse of all of cosmic history as embroidered on the veil (pargod) covering the very face of God.  While the first Book of Enoch is more famous, the Third Book of Enoch is a true tour de force of apocalyptic visions and the ancient occult mysticism of those that allegedly descended to the Chariot-Throne of the Divine. \n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks  - Your support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#metatron #enoch #kabbalah \n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nOdeberg - 3 Enoch - https://archive.org/details/ksigaxiienochorthehebrewbookofenoch_202012/page/n1/mode/2up\n\nספר חנוך לר׳ ישמעאל כ׳׳ג - https://hebrewbooks.org/33533\n\nCharlesworth - Old Testament Pseudepigrapha - 978-1598564891\n\nSegal - Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and Gnosticism - 978-1602585492\n\nSchäfer - Two Gods in Heaven: Jewish Concepts of God in Antiquity - 978-0691181325",

    "title": "Jewish Galilean Miracle Workers in the Life & Times of Jesus - The Mages of the Rabbinical World",
    "description": "Jesus of Nazareth is without any doubt the most famous of the miracle workers, Jewish or otherwise, of the Second Temple Period.  However, because of the glare cast by Jesus and early Christianity, it’s easy to forget that such miracle-workers abounded in the ancient world generally and in the Jewish context more specifically. Several other specifically Galilean miracle-workers are known to us from both Jewish history and lore. In fact, they seem to have constituted a unique class of men capable of such miraculous feats, known as 'anshe ma’aseh' or “men of deeds.”  In fact, Jesus’ Jewish contemporaries very likely would have understood him in something like this category. In collaboration with  @ReligionForBreakfast   in this explore I explore a few of these Galilean miracle-workers or anshe ma’aseh who lived just before and after the lifetime of Jesus of Nazareth.  From Honi the circle-maker who could compel G-d to make it rain, to Hanina ben Dosa’s extreme piety accidentally inducing miracles and who forestalled the power of the Queen of Demons to Shimon bar Yochai, so pious that even the key commandments of the Torah didn’t apply to him and whose very gaze could incinerate those before him and from whom the secrets of the Kabbalah are said to flow, even an errant resurrection of the dead following fisticuffs at a Purim party.\n\n#Jesus #Talmud #Mishnah\n\nWatch Andrew's Episode here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYOO-xSPa5Q\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\na one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nor the Super Thanks !\nYour support is profoundly appreciated!",

But, other Gnostic texts have actually survived in the very polemical works meant to suppress them.

These texts are fascinating gnostic survivals, living on in the very works that sought the destruction of the movement as heresy.\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nor a one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nYour support is profoundly appreciated!\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nSmith - Valentinian Christianity - 978-0520297463\nWakefield & Evans - Heresies of the High Middle Ages - 978-0231096324\nUne somme anti-cathare - https://www.google.com/books/edition/Une_somme_anti_cathare/bf0gugEACAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA87&printsec=frontcover",

    "title": "Maimonides at the Crossroads of Jewish Occultism, Magic and the Kabbalah",
    "description": "Rabbi Moses Maimonides is arguably the greatest Jewish philosopher in history.  His commitment to Aristotelian rationalism is famous, but his writings are also known for esoteric dimension whereby Maimonides is thought to have hidden his true positions and motivations.  In this way, he is truly an esoteric philosopher. In this episode, as part of a collaboration with @LetsTalkReligion and @SeekersofUnity , I want to explore what may to have been one of the esoteric motivations for his writings - to combat the proto-Kabbalah world of Merkavah Mysticism, Jewish Magic, and the Sefer Yetzirah's radical Metaphysical realism - all the while maintaining his own theory of prophecy as communion with the Divine Intellect.  Further, I'll also explore how the explosive reaction to his writings may have helped to give birth to the Kabbalah as we know it.\n\nCheck out Zevi's Video - https://youtu.be/AV2cIQvDpBk\nCheck out Filip's Video - https://youtu.be/8fpQPAMqATk\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nor a one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nYour support is profoundly appreciated!\n\nSources and Further Reading:\n\nCheck out @TheModernHermeticist 's recent audio readings of Maimonides as well!\nhttps://youtu.be/RasBMwGOAHY\nhttps://youtu.be/gvEaFbnFttg\n\nThe Guide of the Perplexed (Pines trans.) - 978-0226502304 & 978-0226502311\nKellner - Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism  - 978-1906764159\n\n- Alexander Altmann, “Maimonides’ Attitude Toward Jewish Mysticism,” in Studies in Jewish Thought: An Anthology of German Jewish Scholarship, ed.

    "description": "Paracelsus is renowned as one of the most important innovators in alchemical and medical theory in European history. But, he also earned a reputation as a sorcerer.  This reputation as not only a healer but also a magus, rests squarely on a curious volume of talismanic magic known as the Archidoxis Magica first printed in 1591 and rendered into English by Robert Turner as Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature in 1656.  While spurious, this textbook of Paracelsian alchemy, astrology and talismanic magic covers a wide range of topics including cures, counter-magic and alchemical tincture preparations which track the astrological heavens.\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nor a one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nYour support is profoundly appreciated!\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nArchidoxis Magica - https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_qSlAAAAAcAAJ/page/318/mode/2up?q=occulta&view=theater\n\nOf the Supreme Mysteries of Nature - https://archive.org/details/paracelsvsofsupr00para/page/n5/mode/2up?view=theater\n\nParacelsus: Essential Readings -  978-1556433160\n\nWebster - Paracelsus: Medicine, Magic and Mission at the End of Time - 978-0300139112",

With Irenaeus becoming a \"Doctor of the Church\" just this year (2022) and Gnosticism a more popular religious movement than ever let's explore this most ancient polemic against Gnosticism.  Does Valentinus represent Gnosticism fairly?  What are his exact religious and philosophical critiques?  What can we learn about ancient Gnosticism and the proto-orthodoxy from his attack?

    "description": "God is an Abyss of Love only ultimately discovered through Insanity, Abjection and Radical Un-Faith - This is the startling mystical theology of the 13th century Beguine Mystic Hadewijch.  While her life remains mysterious, her complete works seem to come down to us virtually intact despite going virtually unstudied for nearly 800 years.  In her Visons, Letters and Poetry we are witness to one of the most innovative and shocking mystical insights into esoteric Christianity to emerge from the middle ages - that reality is fundamentally Divine Love approached through a desire more intense and torturing than Hell itself.  Hadewijch's writings remain some of the most daring, even alarming but also systematic and curated in the history of Christian mysticism.  I hope you can join me as we divine into the mystical thought of this amazing medieval woman.  \n\nMake sure to check out Zevi's series on mysticism over @SeekersofUnity and his episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBHsLOgXZNc\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nor a one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nYour support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#mysticism #hadewijch #beguines\n\nAy, minne, ware ic minne\nEnde met minnen minne u minne!\nAy, minne, om minne ghevet dat minne\nDie minne al minne volkinne.\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nHadewijch: The Complete Works - 978-0809122974\nSwan - The Wisdom of the Beguines - 978-1629190082\nMcGinn - The Flowering of Mysticism - 978-0824517434\nMommaers - Hadewijch.

    "description": "The Kabbalah is one of the most daunting systems of esoteric spirituality given it's complexity, vast literary collection in Hebrew and Aramaic, and the highly technical distinctions between schools among other factors.  So, where should one begin between the mysteriously terse Sefer Yetzirah and the monumental Sefer Zohar?  Perhaps one of the best introductory texts is also one of the lesser known:  Sefer Or Ne'erav (ספר אור נערב - \"The Pleasant Light,\" 1587) by the Safedian master Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, זי\"ע.  It systematically defends the study of Kabbalah, describes what, how and when to study, how to pick a good teacher, general study tips, a sustained summary of Kabbalistic theosophy, especially the procession and relations of the sefirot, along with a helpful glossary for decoding Kabbalistic texts, especially the Zohar.  All in all, it’s a compact, clear and genuinely helpful guide for anyone wanting a historically authentic starting point for the study of Kabbalah.\n\nMake Sure to Subscribe & Consider supporting Esoterica by\nbecoming a monthly Patron - https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\nor a one time donation - https://www.paypal.me/esotericachannel\nYour support is profoundly appreciated!\n\n#kabbalah #sefirot #klippot\n\nRead the Sefer Or Ne'erav for free at Sefaria (Hebrew and English!) - https://www.sefaria.org/Or_Neerav\n\nRobinson - Moses Cordovero's Introduction to Kabbalah: An Annotated Translation of His or Ne'Erav - 978-0881254396",

These beings included righteous angels, malevolent demons and planetary or celestial intelligences responsible for the forces of nature and there was, perhaps, nor more ambitious text for their invocation than the Heptameron or the Elucidation of Necromancy attributed to Peter of Abano.

    "description": "Agrippa's 1533 Three Books of Occult Philosophy is the most classic work on the philosophy of magic in the western world.   In a previous episode, we explored his occult philosophy of language, this week I turn to his occult philosophy of mathematics: the very bridge between the physical and celestial worlds.  For Agrippa, turning to the purely formal world of mathematics and numbers, we discover the very inner logic of the divine on our journey towards spiritual reunification with just that primordial unity of divinity.  Let's deep dive into the magic of harmony, proportion, numerals, sacred geometry and music -  the systems of correspondence at the heart of modern magic and esotericism !\n\n#occult #agrippa #magic",

Though, just how do we escape such a cosmic prison?  The classic answer is gnosis or knowledge of the origins of that suffering but we forget that Gnosticism also consisted in ritual practice and liturgy as well.  In this episode I explore the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit (formerly called The Egyptian Gospel) to better understand gnostic cosmology, theodicy and the rituals that accompany and ensure salvation.\n\n#gnosticism #naghammadi #gnosis\n\nMeyer - The Nag Hammadi Scriptures - 9780061626005\nLayton - The Gnostic Scriptures - 978-0300208542",

    "description": "The Cathars represent a Gnostic survival into the Christian Middle Ages.  They were dualists who argued for an egalitarian church founded on angelic purity, apostolic poverty, and through a single sacrament sought to release the soul from it's physical prison.  The Catholic Church saw them a utterly heretical and sought to systematically destroy their popular strongholds in southern France through 20 years of Crusader Violence and Inquisition.  There's only one problem with this story:  recent, maverick scholarship has forcefully argued that the Cathars and Catharism, quite simply, never existed at all.  Join me, in collaboration with @LetsTalkReligion  , as we discuss the Cathars, Catharism and the arguments for and against their historical existence.\n\nCheck out Filip's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9dRb4fbJQIbQ3KHJZF_z0g\n\n#cathars #catharism #albigensians\n\nComments which reject or mock the skeptical position without showing evidence of serious engagement with it (i.e., citations, counter-points, evidence from historical records or traditionalist scholarship) will be deleted.

In this episode I explore a handwritten necromancer's manual from Tudor England - MS Add.3544 (c. 1536-9) - to discover just what kinds of magical practices it contains.  From erotic binding magic (love magic), to divination, to conjuring spirits and plants to summoning various spirits, this manual gives us a wonderful insight into the religious and magical world of the late Medieval period. \n\n#magic #necromancy #divination\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nYoung - The Cambridge Book of Magic - 978-0992640422\nOther volumes in the Penn State History of Magic Series",

But, who was the first truly hermetic philosopher in Europe?  You may be surprised that it wasn't Ficino, Pico, Bruno or Dee but the Italian poet Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447-1500) whose work the Crater Hermetis (The Mixing Bowl of Hermes) is also the first true work of Hermetic Philosophy in Europe.\n\nRecommended Reading:\nHanegraaff & Bouthoorn - Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447 1500): The Hermetic Writings and Related Documents - 978-0866983242\nOriginal 1505 Latin Edition - https://archive.org/details/ita-bnc-mag-00000928-001/page/n132/mode/2up\nAlso check out my reading lists on my episode on the Hermetica\n\n#Hermeticphilosophy #hermeticism #occult",

    "description": "Valentinian Gnosticism was the first truly systematic attempt at Christian Theology, Philosophy and Mythology.  Despite this, the system and church of Valentinian Christianity was derided as 'heresy' by later members of the proto-orthodoxy.  Since the discovery of the Nag Hammadi texts we now have scriptures from this early Christian movement.  What did the Valentinians believe?  What made them \"Gnostic?\"  What are some of the differences between Western and Eastern Valentinian Gnosticism?\n\n#gnosticism #valentinian #christianity\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nvan den Broek - Gnostic Religion in Antiquity - 978-1107514799\nSmith - Valentinian Christianity - 978-0520297463\nThomassen - The Spiritual Seed - 978-9004148024\nMeyer, etc. - The Nag Hammadi Scriptures - 9780061626005\nAnte-Nicene Fathers - (especially Irenaeus) - https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103.htm",

My channel explores just those topics:  Magic, alchemy, kabbalah, the occult, gnosticism, hermetic philosophy and more.  I hold a doctorate in philosophy and graduated with honors from the Center for History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents, one of the few places in the world to grant advanced, academic degrees in the study of Esotericism.  Here we explore these subjects with an evidence-based, scholarly approach free from hidden agendas, conspiracy theories and baseless personal speculation.  These topics don’t often get the careful investigation they deserve and here at Esoterica we approach them with both a sympathetic read and a critical eye.  Further, I work hard to make sure that all of my content is accessible to a range of ages, educational levels and personal spiritual practice and hope my videos are engaging for everyone, from curious skeptics to experienced occult practitioners.  As you might imagine, creating this content has taken years of education, research and travel and this channel cannot exist without your support.  Indeed, access to reliable, university-level education on topics in esotericism and the occult remains extremely rare both online and in the academy.   If you want to support my work of providing accessible, scholarly and free content on topics in Esotericism here on Youtube consider supporting my work on Patreon or with a one time donation.  You can find those links below and I deeply appreciate your consideration of supporting this project.  So, make sure to check out dozens of episodes on a wide range of topics in esotericism, curated playlists on specific topics and I hope you can join me for fun livestream Q&A sessions.

    "description": "The origin, nature and final destiny of Evil is one of the central concerns for theologians, philosophers and mystics.  Developments in early Kabbalah (c. 13th. century) made for a dramatic and daring re-conception of Evil as beginning within the dynamism of the divinity itself.  This episode explores one of the earliest texts about this new Kabbalistic theory of Evil, the Treatise on the Emanations of the Left or Ma'amar Ha-Atzilut Ha-Sma'lit.  This difficult and obscure texts details the origins of Evil, Demons and their final destiny as understood in one of the earliest strata of Kabbalah and serves as the foundation for the later development of the Klippot in later Lurianic Kabbalah.\n\n#kabbalah #klippot #jewishdemonology\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nTreatise on the Emanations of the Left ( Ma'amar Ha-Atzilut Ha-Sma'lit) in Dan - Early Kabbalah - 978-0809127696\nTishby - The Wisdom of the Zohar (esp. volume II) - 978-1874774280\nScholem - On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead - 978-0805210811\nWolfson - Light through Darkness: The Ideal of Human Perfection in the Zohar - https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509586?seq=1\nIdel - Primeval Evil in Kabbalah - 978-1602804036",

    "description": "Among the first questions Dr. John Dee poses to the angel Uriel are those about the mysterious \"Book of Soyga.\"  Specifically, Dee was concerned with a series of 36 tables filled with seemingly random letters.  Perhaps, they were filled with the language of Adam but the book came with a dire warning:  Dee would die only a few years after decoding it.  Following Dee's death the text went missing only to be rediscovered in the 1990s and the tables were successfully decoded.  What are the secrets behind the code and how do they relate to the Enochian Liber Loagaeth?  How did modern cryptanalysis solve at least part of the mystery?\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nReeds - John Dee and the Magic Tables in the Book of Soyga - https://archive.org/details/jimreedssoyga\nFun Tables of Soyga Generator - http://www.marianotomatis.it/bookofsoyga.php?table=1\n\n#dee #enochian #occultism",

    "description": "Alchemy is one of the more obscure aspect of western esotericism and the history of science.  In this episode of Esoterica, we explore the first known European alchemical text The Book of the Composition of Alchemy (Liber de compositione alchemiae) translated from the Kitab al-Kimya (from the circle of Jabbir ibn Hayyan c. 8th CE) by Robert of Chester on February 11th 1144.  The book features in microcosm much that will become commonplace in the alchemical tradition:  romantic tales of holy masters, the stone of the philosophers, the transmutation of substances, the famous Green Lion, and more.  By studying this foundational alchemical text we may better understand the history of alchemy and chemistry.\n\nRecommended Reading and Links:\n\nStavenhagen - A Testament Of Alchemy - 978-0874510959\nAl-Hassan - THE ARABIC ORIGINAL OF LIBER DE COMPOSITIONE ALCHEMIAE The Epistle of Maryānus, the Hermit and Philosopher, to Prince Khālid ibn Yazīd - https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/arabic-sciences-and-philosophy/article/abs/arabic-original-of-liber-de-compositione-alchemiae-the-epistle-of-maryanus-the-hermit-and-philosopher-to-prince-khalid-ibn-yazid/BD9E8994AF1B205A13B1498DE548DCA5\nAuriferae artis (Latin text) - https://www.google.com/books/edition/Auriferae_artis_quam_chemiam_vocant_anti/A2FWAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0\nAlchemy website - https://www.alchemywebsite.com/\nPurchase some of Adam McLean's art - https://www.ebay.com/str/Esoteric-paintings\n\nLinden, Stanton J.

    "description": "Alchemy is one of the most difficult fields of study in Western Esotericism for a host of reasons: texts are often in ancient languages, practically encoded, full of arcane symbolism and obscure instructions.  One of the most daunting tasks is even where to begin.  There are thousands of alchemical texts spread over 1500 years - which is the best starting point if you want to study alchemy?  In this episode of Esoterica, we argue that the Summa Perfectionis (c. 1310) is the best answer.

In it, he describes the process by which the magus may return to their prelapsarian, semi-divine state through the process of a reformed natural, celestial and ceremonial magic.  Neither a textbook nor a summa, this work is often more celebrated or maligned than actually understood.  What does Agrippa actually teach?  How do we square his Hermetic idealism with his otherwise radically skeptical attitudes in his other major work of this period?  This episode of Esoterica examines this (in)famous text of magic, astrology and cabala.\n\n#agrippa #occult #philosophy #magic",

    "description": "In this episode of Esoterica we explore Sylvia Federici's thesis that the witch trials, rather than being a peripheral event in European history, were pivotal in the transition to capitalism and modernity.  She argues that the social instability of the middle ages was tipped into social chaos with the advent of the Black Death.  In the aftermath, ruling powers sought to suppress workers' uprisings, women's autonomy, and peasant rebellions.  The witch hunts served this task and beta-tested, so to speak, the social and legal procedures which would later be unleashed upon the indigenous people of the new world and African slaves.\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nFederici - Caliban and the Witch - 978-1570270598\nFederici - Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women - 978-1629635682\nLevack - The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe - 978-1138808102\nLevack, ed. - The Witchcraft Sourcebook - 978-1138774971\nLevack, ed. - The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America - 978-0198723639\nPeters and Kors, ed. - Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700 - 978-0812217513\n\n#federici #witches #trials",

    "description": "The typical view of the middle ages is one of cultural, intellectual and religious stagnation.  This is hardly the truth.  The European Middle ages were marked by innovations at almost every cultural register including spirituality.  This episode explores the radical and probing mystical spirituality of the Beguines, a lay culture of women who worked in the skilled trades, publicly preached, aided the poor and destitute, all as part of their own autonomous spiritual vocation.  These women were also extraordinary mystics and theologians.  We briefly explore three of these amazing women here: Hadewijch of Antwerp, Mechthild of Magdeburg & Marguerite Porete to reveal how their mysticism abounds in love, light, madness, and annihilation.\n\nThis episode is also a collaboration with my colleague Filip Holm over at Let's Talk Religion where he will be exploring the role of women in Sufism / Islamic Mysticism.

    "description": "Alchemy is, perhaps, best known for it's elaborate symbolism but just how far back into history can we trace these allegories, secret codes, and hidden meanings? In this episode of Esoterica we investigate what is likely one of the earliest encoded alchemical texts:  \"the Formula of the Crab\" or \"the Formula of the Scorpion.\"  Found in a 10th century Greek manuscript, this formula contain a Greco-Egyptian  alchemical process for producing a gold-like alloy of copper, silver, and lead.  As we explore the formula we will also discuss how Greco-Egyptian alchemy differed from later theories under the influence of the mercury-sulfur theory of the metals.  What will discover is an emphasis on the ability to control the color of metals as opposed to metallic transmutation reflecting the religious vocation of the earliest Egyptian metallurgists.\n\nRecommended Reading: \n\nM.

In the text we find descriptions of the seven heavens, angelic military formations, and magical spells corresponding to the various heavens and angels.

    "description": "While psychoactive substances are a core component in many religious traditions, with the exception of alcohol, they are conspicuously missing from much of the western European context.  Did and how did such substances play a role in religious, philosophy, mysticism, and magic? This episode explores what appears to be an early selection of mind-altering compounds found in the enormously popular 1558 Magiae Naturalis (On Natural Magic). of Giambattista della Porta.  Here della Porta describes four such 'potions,' to use his language, which allegedly cause \"pleasant madness for a day\" and provide for a range of  phenomenological effects from 'being silly' to 'thinking one an animal or fish.\"  What role did \"potions\" like these play beyond recreation - such as the ubiquitous flying ointments of the middle ages?  What does it mean for such \"potions\" to appear in a book on \"natural magic\"?\n\nDisclaimer and Plea:  I've blurred out sections which contain specific ingredients, amounts, and processes for creating the 'potions' described by della Porta for reasons of safety. It is highly unadvised to attempt to recreate or ingest anything described in this text.  I also know that early modern translations of this text exist and they are very easy to find.  Please respect my wishes to not reproduce the description (in Latin, English, etc.) for how to make these 'potions' in the comments.

Early in his career Descartes, like many intellectuals of his day, was searching for new intellectual and scientific foundations as the worldview provided by Aristotle had become moribund.  In this search, Descartes explores many avenues for the truth from strict logic to mystical Rosicrucianism.  In this context, he experiences a profound fit of 'enthusiasm' and has a series of three dreams which ground and propel his own foundationalist project.

    "description": "This is the second episode exploring Dr. John Dee's famous 1564 Monas Hieroglyphica.  In this episode we continue our discussion of Dee's Semiotic-Ontology (his link of Representation with Being) by exploring his early theories of alchemy and Cabala.  Dee was a maverick in both fields.  In alchemy, Dee sought to pursue the \"Mercury Alone\" theory while maintaining a relationship with traditional alchemy and introducing novel Paracelsian elements.  In the field of Cabala, Dee employs traditional Jewish techniques for the manipulation of the Hebrew language to transform the Monad itself.  When Dee combines the talismanic, alchemical, and cabalistic he will seek a \"Cabala of Being\" which will reform reality itself - the topic of the third episode.\n\nThese episodes represent a more introductory version of my thesis on the Monas Hieroglyphica prepared at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nYou can read the entire thesis here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9iShqG1gJavUXVKVnk2d1UzQVE/view?usp=sharing\n\nStandard text and translation of the Monas Hieroglyphica -  C.

    "description": "This episode is the first in a series focusing on theories of magic.  We begin with one of the most popular medieval theories:  the stellar rays of Al-Kindi.  Al-Kindi, a 9th century Islamicate philosopher, who argued that the stars emits rays which trickle down to the sub-lunar world where they qualify matter.  Further, all entities emit rays.  Certain occult or hidden rays can be manipulated by the sage to induce apparently supernatural or magical effects though speech, powerful symbols and animal sacrifice.  This idea provided a route to natural, as opposed to ritual/demonic, magic in the middle ages and underwrote much of astrological theory.  The stellar ray theory would also be built into the famous book of the magic the Picatrix which would be one of the earliest books learned magic to enter Western Europe.  Indeed, the argument in defense of occult forces in the universe is essential for modern physics.\n\nRecommended readings:\n\nPormann and Peterson - The Philosophical Works of al-Kindi - 978-0199062805\n Liana Saif - The Arabic Influences on Early Modern Occult Philosophy - 978-1137399465\nAl-Kindi - De Radiis (pp. 139-260) - Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny and Françoise HudryArchives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Age, Vol. 41, 1974 - https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40184716\nAl-Kindi: On the Stellar Rays - trans.

    "title": "John Dee - The Monas Hieroglyphica - Part I - History and Context",
    "description": "This is part one of a series discussing Dr. John Dee's revolutionary, though obscure, 1564 text the Monas Hieroglyphica (The Hieroglyphic Monad).  In part one we will discuss the philosophical and historical context of the text and present the main thesis of our analysis:  Dee is seeking to reform human knowledge through using a powerful symbol to purify specifically alchemy and cabala.  Part two will explore Dee's theory of alchemy and cabala and part three will show how the Hieroglyphic Monad has its power through combining the semiotic (representational) and the ontological (being itself).\n\nThese episodes represent a more introductory version of my thesis on the Monas Hieroglyphica prepared at the University of Amsterdam.\n\nYou can read the entire thesis here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z3_C6qUjjeL58EciAl00iXOUWMoKAQtG/view?usp=sharing\n\nStandard text and translation of the Monas Hieroglyphica -  C. H. Josten, Ambix, 12:2-3 (1964): 82-221\n\nI'll provide more recommended readings on the Monas Hieroglyphica in the third episode.\n\n#dee #enochian #monas",

These characters likely began as debased hieroglyphics and would eventually develop into unique symbols of power, the seals and sigils in angelic and demonic mage, and form the basis for angelic script / alphabets.

    "description": "We explore the earliest collection of magical texts in the ancient world - The Greek Magical Papyri (PGM) and the Egyptian Demotic spells.  The PGM is the greatest collection of ancient magic.  Written on papyrus these collections of spells, incantations, evocations, represent the rich cross-pollination between various cultures, religious systems, and forms of magic and divination.  From Egyptian, Roman, Jewish, Greek cultures and religions emerges an amazing religious and magical syncretism.  This video introduces the PGM and discusses a collection of spells including: an invisibility lotion, the invocation of Helios, a rare example of lesbian love magic, a curse for your boss, magical athletic ability,  protection from demons, an anger management spell and more.

    "description": "Jewish mysticism is one of the foundations for Western Esotericism and this video explores some of the earliest strata of those mystical texts.  In the Merkaba (chariot) / Hekhalot (palaces) texts mystics describe the terrifying and awe-inspiring descent - not ascent - into the divine palaces, meet with fearsome angels, gain control over angelic power, become transformed into beings of fire, and mount the very throne of G-d to carefully measure the vasts dimensions of the divine body.  This video also explores the Sar Torah (Torah Prince) literature where mystics engage in Jewish theurgy in order to gain immediate knowledge of legal, magical, and religious lore.  We also setup a future discussion of early Jewish magical texts such as the Sefer haRazim (The Book of Secrets) and the most obscure, taciturn, and amazing Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Formation).  \n\nSupport Esoterica on Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/esotericachannel\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nJames Davila - Hekhalot Literature in Translation: Major Texts of Merkavah Mysticism - 978-9004252158\nJames Davila - Descenders to the Chariot: The People Behind the Hekhalot Literature - 978-9004115415\nVita Daphna Arbel - Beholders of Divine Secrets: Mysticism and Myth in the Hekhalot and Merkavah Literature - 978-0791457245\nGershom Scholem - Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism - 978-0805210422\nMenachem Kellner  - Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism - 978-1904113294\nMichael D.
