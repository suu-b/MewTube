This event, while not unique in the least, is a striking example of how corporate negligence causes environmental an humanitarian disasters. In the weeks since the crash, several other trains have derailed, including at least one more of Norfolk Southern's. Why is this such a common problem? What has led to the US having over 1,000 derailments per year, and why isn't anything being done about it?

    "description": "This week we're talking about everyone's favorite grillpilled neighbor - the American \"centrist\" or \"moderate\". As much as they like to see themselves as enlightened arbiters of progress, centrists are little more than spoilers for actual democratic progress at best, and complete lackeys for the Right in most cases.

Visit https://audible.com/secondthought\n\nIn America, more than in any other country in the world, three numbers can change just about everything. From your job, to your home, to your insurance, three digits can command where you can live, what you can buy, and what it’ll cost you. To most Americans today, this is just “the way it is,” but that idea, and the idea behind credit scores in general, is deeply complicated, discriminatory, and rooted in a long history of our financial system driving an ever bigger wedge between the rich and the poor. \n\nIn this episode, we’re looking at credit scores. We’re going over everything wrong with our modern credit reporting system, how you might hear people defending this broken metric, and the why and the how that landed us here. \n\nWhy The American Credit System Is So Terrible – Second Thought\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: http://bit.ly/2nFsvTS\n\nNew video every Friday!\n\nCitations And Further Reading:\nCredit Scores, Neoliberalism, and Class Systems\nhttps://spire.sciencespo.fr/hdl:/2441/6cbt691h0h8o9q5rf0apko0pda/resources/2013-fourcade-classification-situations.pdf \nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=zOreDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false \nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=1SKWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false \nhttps://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/sectionchs/documents/prasad.pdf \n\nCredit Racism\nhttps://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-technology-business-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-b920d945a6a13db1e1aee44d91475205 \nhttps://medium.com/commonfuture/why-credit-scores-are-racist-da109fcfb300 \nhttps://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/from-inherent-racial-bias-to-incorrect-data-the-problems-with-current-credit-scoring-models/ \n\nRedlining and Market Logic \nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7208/9780226262772/html \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5FBJyqfoLM \n\nA Third of Americans Have Errors on Their Credit Report \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/how-to-fix-those-mistakes-on-your-credit-report.html \n\n52% Credit Medical Debt Stat\nhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/heres-how-medical-debt-hurts-your-credit-report/ \nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/survey-79-million-americans-have-problems-medical-bills-or-debt \n\nPaying Off Loans Early Hurts Your Credit Score\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/paying-car-loan-help-credit-score \n\nAugust 2001 Excerpt from “The Banker”\nhttps://dro.dur.ac.uk/11323/1/11323.pdf \n\nShort Description of Credit Unions\nhttps://www.creditunion.ie/about-credit-unions/what-is-a-credit-union/ \n\nChina Social Credit System\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/16/chinas-orwellian-social-credit-score-isnt-real/ \nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/15/china-social-credit-system-authoritarian/ \n\n\nFollow and Support Second Thought!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SecondThought\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/secondthought\nBuyMeACoffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/secondthought \nCashApp: $JTChapman\n\nWatch More Second Thought:\nLatest Uploads: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJR_Fq2hhYVEFS11cf1YzG27\nSpaaaaaace!: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJQRpqT-hMTTFx8A6VVH3m6v\nWhat If...: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJRI7VrWf_-mT0z6lrN--Cvi\nPopular Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SJktA-ecJRx7ZaO9J04Kbob_u5baHxN\n\nAbout Second Thought:\nSecond Thought is a channel devoted to education and analysis of current events from a Leftist perspective.

When corporations and the ultra-wealthy are the primary concern of those in power, the majority will suffer.
