This mini-documentary summarizes the main ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and the history of how these ideas would later (after their deaths) turn into the ideology we know as \"Marxism.\" This documentary provides a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts of Marxist theory. We explore historical materialism, dialectical materialism, the labor theory of value, and Karl Marx's powerful critique of capitalism. If you want to understand the foundational ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, this beginner's guide is the perfect starting point.

My own work (seen in the 1Dime videos and my upcoming book \"Freedom To Change Nothing: The Spectrum of Managed Democracy and What Makes the US Different\") builds on Wolin’s book \"Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism\" and adds a lot to his theories while also going beyond them, covering certain things Wolin missed. \n\nThe decline of Democracy in America and the rise of authoritarianism did not start with Donald Trump. The democratic deficit goes much deeper, and the situation we are currently in is the product of many historical precedents set over a long period of history. The fate of democracy depends on our ability to confront this history.

Marcuse is often thought of as a “Guru of the New Left” and is often misunderstood by those who only read his book “Eros and Civilization” but not his later works such as One-Dimensional Man and Counter-Revolution and Revolt.

In order to change the world, we need to first understand how our current Society of Control ( “The Matrix” of our existing system) works. \n\nMost importantly, this video addresses the problems such as the cycle of activist burnout, depoliticization, and the trap of protest demonstrations.

Does having a Two-Party System make America more democratic than a one-party state? Could the election of Donald Trump lead to the end of democracy? As we will see, \"The Real Threat to American Democracy\" involves a lot more than Trump. The argument being made in this video essay is NOT merely that the US is not a democracy or that America's Two-Party Corporate Duopoly is undemocratic. This video is about a LOT more than that. This video is also about the \"Simulation of Democracy\" and how different types of regimes legitimize their authority. In this video, we consider whether the USA is also a \"phantom democracy\" and how the American regime maintains greater democratic \"legitimacy\" compared to other countries with nominally \"democratic\" systems that lack real democratic substance. \n\nIn the second half, I draw on the theories of Jean Baudrillard on Simulation and Hyperreality to understand why most Americans, even those on the left, still buy into the spectacle of American Politics and the facade of US electoralism despite the obvious democratic deficit in American society and its elections. I consider the role of Donald Trump's election and whether Trumpism and \"populism\" represent a threat to the legitimacy of American Democracy OR if this actually reinforces the myth of democracy.  Lastly, I consider how democratic revolutions differed in America compared to Europe and how the unique legacy of the American Revolution fosters national mythology that obstructs democratization.\n\nTimestamps: \n\n0:00 What counts as a \"Real Democracy\"?\n2:38 The Two-Party Duopoly \n4:16 “Power Sharing”\n8:08 “Party Competition” \n9:53 Perceived Legitimacy \n11:37 Phantom Democracy \n13:43 Simulation and Hyperreal Politics\n16:13 Donald Trump and the Future of U.S. Democracy\n19:25 The Democratic Revolution\n\nThanks to ​⁠​⁠​⁠@SecondThought ​⁠​⁠​⁠@researchpurposes and ​⁠​⁠​⁠@Gokanaru for reading quotes.\n\nSources I mentioned and books for further reading: \nG William Domhoff, Who Rules America?

In this video, we explore how the Cultural Revolution began, what happened, how it ended, and what Chairman Mao’s goal was with it. \n\nThe Cultural Revolution is easily the most misunderstood era of Mao's China and the history of the People's Republic of China as a whole. The Cultural Revolution has had a significant impact on modern China and to this day, the CPC likes to tightly regulate the discourse surrounding it. As we will see, this is because the Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard rebellions that it unleashed represented the biggest threat to the Communist Party of China in its history. \n\nTimestamp\n\n0:00 A Complicated History\n3:04 The CPC's Official Narrative\n4:32 The Popular Western Narrative\n8:03 The PRC Before the GPCR\n9:48 How it All Started and Unravelled\n17:15 The Red Guards \n23:19 Anti-Authoritarian Authoritarianism?\n29:19 The Four Olds and Mob Justice\n32:33 Class Identity Politics \n36:55 Mao's Hypothesis\n39:00 Attacking the Party\n43:20 Depoliticization and Factional Warfare \n46:30 Military Crackdown and Mao's Retreat\n50:14 Were Mao's Intentions Genuine?\n55:45 Education Reforms\n58:32 Self-Managed Organizations \n1:03:48 Reassessment vs Deng Xiaoping  \n1:05:21 Conclusion\n\nCredits: \nWritten, Narrated, and Directed by 1Dime (@1Dimeofficial on Twitter) \nEdited by Biodegradable (@BiodeEditable on Twitter)\n\nBig thanks to ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@SecondThought ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@YUGOPNIK   ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@FDSignifire ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@JohntheDuncan  Paul from ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@Marxism_Today  ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@RadicalReviewer , ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@Prolekult , ​⁠​⁠@BlackRedGuard, ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@ChillGoblin, ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠Gokanaru, and ​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠@JREG for reading quotes in the video!\n\nSources/Books where I got my research from:\n\n-The Cultural Revolution: A Very Short Introduction by Richard Kraus \n-Mao’s China and After by Maurice Meisner\n-Mao's Last Revolution by Michael Schoenhals and Roderick Lemonde MacFarquhar \n-Cultural Revolution and Revolutionary Culture by Alessandro Russo \n-The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution by Mobo Gao \n-The Unknown Cultural Revolution: Life and Change in the Chinese Village by Dongping Han \n-Agents of Disorder by Andrew Walder \n-The Cultural Revolution at the Margins by Yiching Wu \n\nCheck out my original essay in the book Underground Theory with Slavoj Zizek https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Theory-David-McKerracher/dp/B0CH2CXSGN\n\nCheck out more 1Dime content: \nMore 1Dime videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyytc2-LIrN6K4jLRKY8r0Xt44YW6l1jn\n\nThe high-quality production of these videos is made possible by my Patrons.

    "description": "Support 1Dime on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OneDime\n\nThe 3rd and final episode of the 1Dime docuseries on Post-Soviet Russia.\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/o8d6Vzi7zYg\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/zODWTfMwFGw\n\nTimestamp: \n0:00 The Conservative Turn and Need For Legitimacy\n3:14 Culture Wars and Anti-Liberalism\n7:37 Eurasianism and Alexander Dugin\n10:48 Anti-imperialist?\n14:35 Cynicism and Confusion \n16:40 Putin's Relationship with the Soviet Union\n\nVideos I Mentioned: \n1: https://youtu.be/PTmnVJxrsAQ\n2: https://youtu.be/SY9NjD_5WWo\n\nThis video is about how Ideology has changed in Post-Soviet Russia and the various tactics of social control that enable the Putin regime to rule. Some of these include culture war tactics that have now become quite prevalent in North America today.  Many liberals have tried to pin down the actions of the Kremlin to a particular \"ideology\" of the Putin Regime. However, such approaches that overstate the role of ideology in driving Putin's actions miss the bigger picture: which is that the ideology of the Putin regime is actually quite vacuous and is merely a flexible rhetorical device for rationalizing the Kremlin's foreign policy and legitimizing The United Russia Party's rule. As we have seen since the first episode of this series  Ideology of the Putin regime has changed greatly over time, from pro-western aspirations and an open commitment to Neoliberalism to a conservative collectivist shift that transpired in accordance with the souring of Russia-US Ties. \n\nCredits: \nWritten, Narrated, and Directed by 1Dime\nEdited by Jeff Skyward \nAnimations by Biodegradable \n\nSources/Books that inspired this video:\n-Dissidents among Dissidents: Ideology, Politics and the Left in Post-Soviet Russia by Ilya Budraitskis\n-Change in Putin's Russia: Power, Money and People by Simon Pirani\n-Nothing Is True, and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia by Peter Pomerantsev. \n-Russia Without Putin by Tony Wood\n\nCheck out more 1Dime content: \nMore 1Dime videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyytc2-LIrN6K4jLRKY8r0Xt44YW6l1jn\n1Dime Podcasts: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyytc2-LIrN76QbCkj4Y6w65OAgpyIuRg\n\nThe high-quality production of these videos is made possible by our Patrons.

How did it become commercialized? What is \"Mumble Rap\"?  Find out in this video about The Culture Industry.\n\nThis video explores how Capitalism impacted Hip Hop music using Theodor Adorno’s theory of “The Culture Industry” and “Standardization” in Popular Music. We go over how corporate incentives and consumer ideology impact the production of rap music and how one dimensional standardized music formulas condition how people listen to music. We also discuss how various aspects of the music industry such as the media spectacle, marketing, corporate interests, streaming platforms, and record labels impact rap music both in terms of sound and its materialistic subject matter. \n\nCredits: \nIntro by Artin Salimi: https://www.youtube.com/c/ArtinSalimi\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n0:00 Intro\n1:28 What Happened to Hip Hop?\n6:14 A Brief History of Hip Hop: Record Labels, The Internet\n and Streaming Platforms.\n13:07 The Culture Industry and Theodor Adorno\n15:30 Standardization In Popular Music \n18:40 Aesthetic Branding and Pseudo Individualism\n20:28 Conditioned Tastes \n22:23 Addiction Formulas\n25:43 Fast Food Music \n29:04 Cultivated Demand \n30:38 Imitation Over Innovation \n32:20 Escapism, Conditioning and Social Control\n33:56 Ideology, Cultural Hegemony and the Spectacle\n37:09 Art Beyond Capitalism\n\nVideo clips Referenced: \nPolitikZ - \"REAL HIP HOP\": https://youtu.be/QHYwprmWMfY\n\nSources:\n-The Culture Industry: Selected essays on mass culture by Theodor Adorno\n-Essays on Popular Music by Adorno\n-The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory by John Seabrook\n-The Addiction Formula\n-Many Years of listening to Hip Hop music\n\nCheck out more 1Dime content: \nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQlxdYqyXXuxBkuodA7gfQ\nBest 1Dime videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeEIBPuAxs&list=PLyytc2-LIrN6K4jLRKY8r0Xt44YW6l1jn\n\nAbout 1Dime (not One Dime): \n1Dime is an educational channel dedicated to countering one dimensional thought by analyzing socio-political issues through the lens of theory, history,  pop culture, and political economy",

In this video, we discuss the relationship between the 1960's Counterculture, hippies, psychedelia, and past & present socialist movements. We will analyze the problems and lost potentials of these movements through the lens of the late Mark Fisher's concepts of \"Acid Communism\" , Capitalist Realism, Lost Futures, Hauntology, and Post-Work. We will interpret the potential uses of psychedelic culture and its implications on consciousness.  We also critique problems with rational and strictly material appeals in the contemporary left and discuss how the left should regard spirituality and higher desires for things like meaning, freedom, and free time.\n\nChapters:\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:49 Rational vs Psychological Appeals\n7:35 May 1968\n9:20 1960s Counterculture\n15:52 Lost Futures\n18:43 Socialism Freedom and Mental Health\n21:50 Ego and Political Identity\n23:51 Machiavellian Spirituality\n24:35 Outro\n\nTo be clear: We do not endorse or condone the use of any illegal substances\n\nOutro music by Artin Salimi: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpxTegQA3NUq9scE-XQJzww\n\nCheck out more 1Dime content: \nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQlxdYqyXXuxBkuodA7gfQ\nBest 1Dime videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeEIBPuAxs&list=PLyytc2-LIrN6K4jLRKY8r0Xt44YW6l1jn\n\nAbout 1Dime (not One Dime): \n1Dime is an educational channel dedicated to countering one dimensional ideology by analyzing socio-political issues through the lens of theory, history, pop culture, and political economy",
