    "description": "Are “aliens” real? Or something else entirely? What if the growing obsession with little green men is something far more deceptive? \n\nJoin Eric Hovind and John Harris for a mind-opening conversation that exposes how Satan uses the alien narrative to rewrite the story of Creation itself. If the Enemy can convince the world that life exists on other planets, he can make this one seem ordinary and humanity just another accident in a meaningless cosmos. If Earth isn’t special, then neither are we.\n\nEven atheists who deny the Creator often turn to the same lie—believing that “advanced aliens” must have created life on Earth. It’s the same old rebellion wrapped in new packaging: replacing God with something else to avoid accountability to Him. Whether it’s evolution or extraterrestrials, the goal is the same—to erase the truth that “In the beginning, God created.”\n\nBut Genesis tells the real story. God created the heavens, the earth, and mankind in His image, not in the image of E.T. The Alien Deception is part of a much larger spiritual strategy—to replace the Creator with creation and blind the world to the truth that we were made with purpose, meaning, and divine design.\n\nBecause after all, if he can make you doubt the Creator, he’s already won.\n\nGET INVOLVED\nBecome part of a community reaching the world with the Gospel!

    "description": "Join us as we dig into one of the biggest deceptions in modern science — the myth of uniformitarianism! Eric Hovind, and our guest, Dr. Terry Mortensen, will expose how this idea, first popularized by Charles Lyell in the 1800’s, completely rewrote how people view Earth’s history — and not for the better.\n\nBefore Lyell, many great scientists studied the world through the lens of Scripture, recognizing the Bible as the true record of Earth’s past. But when Lyell began assuming that “the present is the key to the past,” he planted the seeds of doubt that grew into today’s evolutionary thinking. His assumptions about ancient rocks didn’t just change geology — they helped lead generations away from believing God’s Word.\n\nWe’ll trace how this intellectual rebellion against the Bible took root and how it continues to shape modern science, culture, and education. With help from the late Milt Marcy’s eye-opening book “Exposing the Hidden Roots of the Evolutionary Agenda: The Emperors Who Had No Clothes,” we’ll pull back the curtain on one of history’s greatest scientific smokescreens.\n\nDon’t miss this powerful episode as we uncover how a few flawed ideas about the past set the stage for a full-blown war on biblical truth — and why it’s time to return to the real foundation: God’s Word.\n\nGET INVOLVED\nBecome part of a community reaching the world with the Gospel!

From Atum sounding strikingly like Adam, to depictions of a serpent crushed beneath a sacred tree, echoes of Eden still whisper from the walls of Egypt’s oldest temples.\n\nCould it be that the people of Egypt carried the true history of Creation, the Fall, and the Flood — passed down from Noah’s sons — long before pagan mythologies distorted the record?\n\nJoin Eric Hovind and scholar Gavin Cox for a fascinating journey from Babel to the banks of the Nile as they uncover how the earliest civilizations preserved fragments of Genesis in their language, art, and worship.\n\nThis isn’t just archaeology — it’s a revelation buried in plain sight.\nHistory, it turns out, has been testifying to the truth of the Bible all along.\n\nGET INVOLVED\nBecome part of a community reaching the world with the Gospel!

    "description": "What do you say when a man who gave his life to truth and courage is taken from us too soon? In this heartfelt video, historian and author William Federer remembers his friend Charlie Kirk — not just as a leader and culture warrior, but as a man who lived with eternity in mind.\n\nTogether, we reflect on the urgency that marked Charlie’s life: to boldly speak truth, to call a nation back to God, and to point every heart to Jesus Christ. Charlie’s legacy is not simply about politics or public speaking — it’s about living so others might know the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\n\nMay this tribute stir you to live with that same eternal focus. Because the best way to honor Charlie Kirk is to follow the Savior he loved and proclaimed.",

    "description": "In 1912, the Alaskan wilderness was rocked by the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century—30 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens. It was called Novarupta.\n\nA few years later, explorer Dr. Robert Griggs ventured into the blast zone and documented a land transformed by fire. His reports made the front page of National Geographic and ignited imaginations for generations.\n\nNow, over a century later, Creation Scientist Pat Roy picks up where Griggs left off—retracing his steps into the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes with one goal: to uncover the forgotten evidence that points to the truth of biblical history.\n\nJoin Eric Hovind and Pat Roy for a high-stakes, multimedia-rich retelling of an adventure that blends exploration, geology, and faith. What Pat discovers isn’t just ash and lava—it’s undeniable proof of the global Flood and the biblical Ice Age.\n\nYou’ll never look at volcanoes—or the Bible—the same way again.\n\nGET INVOLVED\nBecome part of a community reaching the world with the Gospel!

    "description": "In 1925, a courtroom in Dayton, Tennessee became the stage for a cultural turning point—the Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial. But this wasn't just a debate about evolution vs. creation. It was the moment America began its bold experiment of removing God from the classroom—and eventually, from the culture.\n\nNow, 100 years later, what has that experiment produced?\n\nJoin Eric Hovind LIVE Wednesday, July 23rd at 12 Noon CT to revisit the trial that put God and His Word on trial, exposing the strategy of the trial, the damage caused, and why so many Christians today are still unprepared to defend their faith under pressure. You’ll discover how Clarence Darrow's attack, William Jennings Bryan’s unpreparedness, and the ACLU's agenda launched a century of secularism—and why it’s time for a generation to rise up, reclaim truth, and end the experiment. This isn’t just a history lesson. It’s a wake-up call.\n\nGET INVOLVED\nBecome part of a community reaching the world with the Gospel!

Could this tiny creature, hidden in the pages of Scripture, be one of the most powerful symbols of Christ’s sacrifice?\n\nFor centuries, the Crimson Worm (coccus ilicis) has been used to produce a deep red dye, coloring ancient fabrics—including those in the biblical Tabernacle. But what’s more astonishing is how it lives… and how it dies. When the mother worm is ready to bring new life into the world, she attaches herself to a tree, gives her body as food for her young, and leaves behind a scarlet stain that fades to white. Sound familiar?\n\nJoin Eric Hovind and Dr. Jobe Martin as they uncover the mind-blowing parallels between this tiny worm and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

What if the global Flood described in Genesis created the fossils we see today not because of TIME, but because the global Flood created the right conditions?\n\nOn this episode of the Creation Today Show, Eric Hovind sits down with Gordon Craig, who has developed an experimental fossilization process that simulates the extreme pressure and heat found deep beneath the Earth. By replicating these catastrophic conditions, he has been able to rapidly create fossils in the lab—no millions of years needed!\nCould this be the nail in the coffin for evolutionary timelines? Does this groundbreaking experiment confirm the biblical Flood model?\n\nJoin us for a mind-blowing look at the truth behind fossilization and why it matters for the origins debate!\n\nGET INVOLVED\nBecome part of a community reaching the world with the Gospel!

    "description": "In this powerful and thought-provoking episode, Eric sits down with a man who lived as a woman for 30 years before finding truth, redemption, and purpose in Christ. After transitioning to female in 1993, his life seemed stable—passing as a woman, building a career, and integrating into society. But behind the outward success was deep emotional turmoil, a broken marriage, family estrangement, and lingering emptiness.\n\nIn the early 2020s, everything changed when he encountered the true biblical Gospel. Realizing he had never fully known Christ, he repented, placed his faith in Jesus, and began the difficult journey of detransitioning—physically, legally, and spiritually. Now, fully restored to living as a man, his story offers a profound message of hope, forgiveness, and identity in Christ.\n\nJoin Eric Hovind and William Allen as they discuss the obstacles he faced during his detransition, his new mission to spread the Gospel, and his efforts to warn parents about the dangers of the trans agenda. This episode will inspire anyone struggling with identity, offering clarity that true fulfillment comes only through knowing Christ.",

How does it influence our faith and daily living? \n\nLet’s look at how sacred music has been used throughout history to worship and glorify God, how secular music reflects the culture and times in which we live, and the criteria that distinguish good music from bad. Through scriptural insights and thoughtful discussion, we'll uncover the divine purpose behind music and its role in our spiritual journey. Whether you are a musician, a music lover, or simply curious about the spiritual dimensions of melody and harmony, you will gain a valuable perspective on why music truly matters to God. \n\nJoin Eric Hovind and Ben Everson as they examine the four quadrants of music: Sacred, Secular, Good, and Bad.",

His status as a drug dealer, his family connections, and his reportedly murderous nature lead to his fame. Drug cartels feared him, not because he was physically intimidating, but because his brothers were protective and connected. \n\nPelon’s story describes what the Bible claims might be the single most important attitude we can adopt if we want to thrive and flourish as Christians. It's an attribute that Pelon simply did not possess. You'll be surprised when you understand what secular studies demonstrate and what New Testament authors have always claimed.\n\nJoin Eric Hovind and Cold-Case Homicide Detective, J. Warner Wallace to crack this case and discover how homicide stories confirm biblical truths!",

Organisms randomly change and make up new forms of life over time. We are going to put that theory to the test! With modern computer computation, we can simulate random keystrokes and find out exactly how long it would take to get a single line from Shakespeare’s play! \n\nLet the games begin!

The destruction literally left a mountain of evidence to dig through. The observable, recorded facts revealed formations that, although once thought to take years to form, happened in just minutes, hours, and days. These discoveries re-shaped our understanding of geological processes, substantiating the Catastrophic Model of the Worldwide Flood. \n\nJoin Eric Hovind and Geologist Bill Hoesch as they sift through this mountain of evidence and analyze how it helped rescue Creation Science!",

    "description": "People of all ages are fascinated by dinosaurs. But they have a lot of questions about them. Are they mentioned in the Bible? When and where did they live? There are some people who say dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, long before humans. But if the Bible is correct when it talks about God's creation of the world and universe, then dinosaurs and people both lived on the earth at the same time.\n\nDuring the Dinosaurs of the Bible webinar we will explore the historical, scriptural, and fossil evidence about dinosaurs living with man and share what we can know after many years of thoughtful, careful research.\n\nWANT MORE\nGet access to the complete conversation!

    "description": "There is a dangerous agenda causing families to question everything they thought they knew about sexuality, gender, marriage, and how the church should respond. Exactly what does God think about the homosexual and transgender movement? In today's divided culture, chances are you know someone personally who is struggling with these issues themselves. These are individuals created in God's image and loved by the Father. These are people for whom Jesus died.\nBecause the church hasn't known how to handle this situation with love, others have sadly declared, “I have felt more rejection, more pain, and more hypocrisy from Christians than any other group.” As followers of Jesus, we hold the key that can set these individuals free—the truth wrapped in a package of love. Join Eric Hovind and Garry Ingraham, President of Truth & Love Network for an honest conversation of what you can do to reach people trapped in these lifestyles.\n\nWANT MORE\nGet access to the complete conversation!

    "description": "How old is planet earth? Does it even matter? Do we trust or doubt the Bible based on the answer? \nIn 1795, James Hutton claimed the earth was much older than people thought. His book “Theory of the Earth”, was used by Charles Lyell in 1830 to justify the layers of the earth representing eons of time instead of a global flood. It was the influence of Lyell’s book that resulted in Charles Darwin publishing “On the Origin of Species” in 1859 which formally introduced the theory of evolution to the scientific community. \nAll along the way, the church has been pushed to compromise Scripture with interpretations of science. So, who’s right? Is the earth young or old? \nJoin Dr. Terry Mortenson and Eric Hovind to discover the true journey of this fascinating debate that has now spanned more than 2 centuries. The implications are ASTOUNDING!",

The One born in the stable of a small village; who traveled less than two hundred miles from home. The One who never won an election, never went to college, never had a lot of money, and never owned a home. The One who was unjustly sentenced to death on a hill overlooking the town dump. Yes, Him. Christ. The One who changed the world. Did you leave out His Glory? Did you leave out His Majesty? What about His Justice? \n\nHow would you introduce Him? Who is Jesus Christ?

Do Creationists have scientific evidence for believing in a Young Earth? \n\nMany times Creationism will be labeled as “anti-evolutionism” because we often present arguments that poke holes in the evolution worldview without making a positive case for Creationism. However, Creation Scientists from many disciplines have come together to conclude that observable, repeatable, testable, scientific evidence actually confirms the Biblical position of a young earth.

It is creating confusion about the Bible without acknowledging ANY of the arguments presented by mainstream Biblical Creationists.  In fact, his new book argues Adam and Eve were “Mytho History”... like folklore… and could have evolved! This new idea is attempting to combine a little bit of Evolution, all of the Old Earth interpretations of science, and some other stuff he has made up on the way! \nThankfully, because his views don’t line up with science and they don’t line up with Scripture, they are easy to Debunk!

    "description": "What is biblical Womanhood? \n\nAmazingly, this question creates LOTS of confusion both inside and outside the church. On one side, we have the ultra-feminist movement that wants to reject any tie to the biblical understanding of a woman; on the other side, we have chauvinists who see women as subservient to men. And in the middle, our culture seems to have lost or rejected expressive terms for women like Gentle, Meek, and Helpmate. \n\nSo where does the balance lie? What is the true answer for biblical Womanhood? \n\nJoin Eric Hovind as he welcomes Jeremy and Tiana Wiles to the Creation Today Show LIVE Wednesday, May 10th at 12 Noon CT. As the pioneering couple behind Soul Refiner (an online portal that offers help and hope teaching men and women about their unique design and purpose), Jeremy and Tiana offer a biblical perspective on gender that is rooted in the truth of God's Word.\n\nWANT MORE\nGet access to the complete conversation!

    "description": "No longer a mystery! Journey to Mt Sinai is being released for such a time as THIS! \n\nMay 15th and 17th - Find Tickets at PatternsOfEvidence.com\n\nPowerful interview with Tim Mahoney! He's been searching for the true location of Mount Sinai for over 20 years. The Bible records that at Sinai God made a covenant with Moses and the Israelites, and gave them the ten commandments. While the majority of scholars continue to favor locating Mount Sinai at the traditional site of Jebel Musa (the mountain of Moses) in the southern Sinai Peninsula, many believe the lack of evidence there is good reason to question that thinking. Other scholars question whether these events happened at all.\n\nIn recent decades, more than a dozen Mount Sinai candidates have been proposed as the correct site. Modern-day Exodus Explorers believe compelling evidence for the Israelites’ time at Mount Sinai can be found in Saudi Arabia at a mountain known as Jabal al Lawz.\n\nMahoney uses the trusted Patterns-of-Evidence approach and the new Mount Sinai Scorecard to investigate six of the most popular locations proposed for Mount Sinai. Examining details for five major criteria in the biblical account compared to geographical and archaeological information, he sets out to pin-point the mountain’s true location. Journey to Mount Sinai is a 2-part film series that picks up the exploration of the Exodus where the Red Sea Miracle films left off. Each film will examine three of the primary candidates. Can Mahoney find the mountain where Moses encountered the burning bush and where multitudes of Israelites camped for nearly a year?",

The passage begins, “He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.” To their proponents, this means that since “white people” took “black people” as slaves, the “white people” will become slaves of the “black man.” They link the second part of the Revelation passage, “he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the sword,” to Isaiah 14:21 which says: “Prepare slaughter for his children.” What do you think that means in terms of this movement?\n\nJoin Eric Hovind and Vocab Malone for an in depth look at the rising, threatening movement known as “The Black Hebrew Israelites.” \n\nWANT MORE\nGet access to the complete conversation!

She doesn't know I am doing this and will probably ask me to take this post down, but this is what I feel God is asking me to post. Enjoy celebrating Josh with this video. You need to watch till the end and share this on your page and message all those who knew him! \n\nTo be one of the 364 more, just message Jenny Anderson Schwartz and ask her for her Venmo or send a note with an old fashioned check! Here is her address. \n\n6441 Prickly Pear Lane \nCollege Grove, TN 37047\n🙂 \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jenny.a.schwartz\n\nJenny Anderson Schwartz, our hearts are with you and your family.

For Skeptics, the church has been guilty of not giving them the answers—that are clearly available—to answer their skepticism. That's why Pastor Rick McGough, a man that was committed to a lifetime of pastoring a church, stepped away from pastoral Ministry and devoted the rest of his life to apologetics. \n\nYou don’t want to miss the wisdom Pastor Rick imparts to help you understand why Christians should be a little more skeptical, and Skeptics should become Christians! \n\nWANT MORE\nGet access to the complete conversation!

When do you submit and when do you resist? If you resist, how do you resist? Are we called to be active or passive in our approach? What should a Christian do?",

    "description": "I had the pleasure of backpacking and camping with my family and some friends at the \"Little Grand Canyon of Georgia\". Here, in the deep south, massive gullies up to 150 feet deep offer visitors a stunning variety of color through its foliage and rock layer formations. Viewing the erosion features of this miniature canyon throws an interesting perspective on the widely accepted belief that it takes millions of years for canyons and rock layers to form. Once a flourishing farmland, the poor farming practices of the 19th century rapidly turned furrows into gullies and gullies into canyons. Naturally soft soil contributed to the demise of the Georgia farmland as it quickly turned into permanent ravines and a canyon emerged.",
