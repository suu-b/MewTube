Growing up in rural Romania with a nominal faith, Vlad slowly fell into pornography, hookup culture, and deep isolation. His life spiraled in Germany where depression and addiction took over, even while he still called himself a “Christian.”\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. A testimony on this very channel interrupted everything. That video led to real Bible study, real confession, real community, and ultimately—a real encounter with Jesus Christ.\n\nVlad moved to London, walked into a global Christian gathering, and there, surrounded by believers, he finally understood the cross. He chose repentance, baptism, and a new life in Christ. Since that moment, everything is different. Temptations still exist, but he is no longer alone, no longer hopeless, and no longer defined by his past.\n\nThis is a story about identity, deception, love, spiritual warfare, and the power of God to rescue anyone.

Jason reveals how years of confusion and pain—rooted in sexual abuse and a fractured relationship with his father—ultimately inspired him to create his transformative “Four S Framework”: Separation, Sensation, Sin, and Story. This life-changing approach helps men better understand the roots of same-sex attraction and find restoration through truth, identity, and God’s grace.\n\nAs Jason recounts his father’s tragic struggle, his own path through recovery, and how he ultimately found freedom, purpose, and love through Christ, viewers are offered an authentic look at redemption in action.

Growing up as a pastor’s kid in Missouri, Lare struggled with feelings of rejection and same-sex attraction from an early age. Though he loved Jesus deeply, he wrestled for years to reconcile his faith with his desires — until he discovered his true identity in Christ.

Dr. Harold Ristau—parish pastor, former military chaplain, missionary, and seminary professor, now at Luther Classical College—joins Becket Cook to unpack his new book, \"Spiritual Warfare and Deliverance: How to Minister to the Demonically Oppressed and Possessed.\" They tackle why modern skepticism about demons persists, how rationalism distorts a biblical worldview, and why deliverance belongs to the pastoral office. Dr. Ristau explains the difference between oppression and possession, the role of Scripture, fasting, and humility, and why deliverance is more “art + science” than a mechanical formula.\n\nYou’ll hear practical counsel for house cleansing, using sacred Scripture aloud, and building a post-deliverance life (church, Word, prayer). Dr. Ristau walks through the “RAT principle” (trap, kill, remove the crumbs), cautions against turning psychology into a catch-all, and even weighs in on the “aliens” question through a spiritual lens.

Hodges decision (2015), which legalized gay marriage across the U.S. \n\nReflecting on an article by Bryan Dumont in The Dispatch, Becket Cook, a former member of the gay community turned Christian, explores why marriage equality has seemingly faded from LGBTQ activism. Citing cultural shifts toward intersectional issues like trans liberation and racial justice, the discussion critiques the prevalence of non-monogamy in gay male relationships and questions the impact of same-sex marriage on traditional values. \n\nWith personal anecdotes, references to influential figures like Andrew Sullivan, and a conservative Christian lens, the video challenges viewers to consider whether the \"experiment\" of gay marriage has succeeded or failed, while speculating on its future.

Raised in a non-denominational Christian home in Western Washington, Kyle grew up with a strong faith foundation but faced challenges when he realized his same-sex attraction during his teenage years. Struggling with secrecy, guilt, and an addiction to pornography, Kyle’s journey took him through a failed relationship with a woman and years of openly dating men, all while feeling distant from his faith.\n\nIn this heartfelt conversation, Kyle opens up about a life-changing moment in November 2024, when overwhelming guilt from infidelity led him to a non-affirming church in Los Angeles. There, a sincere prayer for God to take control and an unexpected encounter with a compassionate church friend sparked a profound spiritual awakening. Through uncontrollable sobbing, worship, and repentance, Kyle experienced God’s transformative power, leading him to leave his relationship and return to his faith.\n\nNow living with his supportive parents in Idaho, Kyle reflects on his ongoing spiritual journey, the challenges of overcoming old habits, and the freedom he’s found in his renewed relationship with Jesus Christ. This powerful testimony highlights the love and grace of Christian parents, the importance of community, and the life-changing impact of surrendering to God.\n\n💬 Join the Conversation:\nComment below your thoughts on today’s discussion!\n\n👍 Like, Subscribe & Share!\nIf you found this conversation insightful, help spread the message by liking this video, subscribing to the channel, and sharing it with others.\n\n🔔 Turn on notifications to never miss an episode!\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:46 - Kyle’s Background\n2:36 - Realizing Same-Sex Attraction\n5:00 - First Relationship and Struggles\n13:00 - Turning Point at Church\n19:00 - Transformative Spiritual Experience \n\n#ChristianTestimony, #RedemptionStory, #FaithJourney, #GodsGrace, #SpiritualTransformation, #OvercomingAddiction, #SameSexAttraction, #Repentance, #Worship #ChristianParenting\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/wt1U6RIMfOM\nhttps://youtu.be/RVKfiE4-2Bs\nhttps://youtu.be/ghaboIhUwuM\nhttps://youtu.be/4mwDfE6JSXQ\nhttps://youtu.be/wsY2ko8rOhU\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nX: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nTBCS theme song by Seth Kaye",

He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ.

Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance.

This hunger for historical rootedness is a welcome phenomenon--but unfortunately, many assume that this need can only be met outside of Protestant contexts.\n\nIn What it Means to Be Protestant, Gavin Ortlund draws from both his scholarly work in church history and his personal experience in ecumenical engagement to offer a powerful defense of the Protestant tradition. Retrieving classical Protestant texts and arguments, he exposes how many of the contemporary objections leveled against Protestants are rooted in caricature. Ultimately, he shows that historic Protestantism offers the best pathway to catholicity and historical rootedness for Christians today.\n\nDr. Ortlund's Book: https://amzn.to/3N2ZqiU\n\nTruth Unites: https://www.youtube.com/@TruthUnites\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 175\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/ugP3hmay5sc\nhttps://youtu.be/UuG6tbuDsIk\nhttps://youtu.be/eoNFh3hSwcg\nhttps://youtu.be/m5U6ZblvSkU\nhttps://youtu.be/BSv-JYYmieI\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Is that true? Or has “empathy,” like so many other words of our day— “tolerance,” “justice,” “acceptance”—been hijacked by bad actors who exploit compassion for their own political ends?\n\nIn Toxic Empathy, Allie Beth Stuckey argues that empathy has become a tool of manipulation by left-wing activists who bully people into believing that they must adopt progressive positions to be loving. She explores the five most heated issues through which toxic empathy is deployed: abortion, gender, sexuality, immigration, and social justice. Progressives use catchy mantras to present their perspective as empathetic, like “abortion is healthcare,” “love is love,” or “no human being is illegal,” but in each case, they ignore the other side of the moral equation. For example, abortion is presented as compassionate for the woman, but what about the human life the procedure kills?\n\n\"Toxic Empathy\" Book: https://amzn.to/4e5Vcmt\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 174\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/UuG6tbuDsIk\nhttps://youtu.be/eoNFh3hSwcg\nhttps://youtu.be/m5U6ZblvSkU\nhttps://youtu.be/BSv-JYYmieI\nhttps://youtu.be/tA-Oux0rTls\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from college, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both.

He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, Becket chats with Megan Basham, a culture reporter for the Daily Wire, about her new book, “Shepherds For Sale: How Evangelical Leaders Traded the Truth for a Leftist Agenda.” \n\nLiberal theology isn’t new. Pastors and theologians have drifted, slipped, or even plunged into doctrinal error for centuries. But in recent decades, Daily Wire reporter Megan Basham reveals, well-funded forces from outside the church have been sowing seeds of discord from behind the scenes.\n\nIn Shepherds for Sale, Basham documents how progressive powerbrokers —from George Soros, to the founder of eBay, to former members of the Obama administration— set out to change the American church. Secular foundations and think tanks have deliberately targeted Christian media, universities, megachurches, nonprofits, and even entire denominations, not to mention many high-profile pastors and influencers, with infiltration and astroturf campaigns. Their goal: to co-opt the church for political purposes. In exchange for toeing a left-wing line, many of those church leaders and institutions have received cash, career jumps, prestige, and praise. \n\nNow, many evangelical leaders are pushing their members to “whisper” about sexual sins, reconsider the importance of abortion, lament the effects of climate change, and repent of “perpetuating systemic racism.” Meanwhile, America’s largest evangelical denominations are fraught with division over issues like critical race theory, and many ministries once known for publishing sound doctrine are now promoting social justice.\n\nA rigorously reported exposé, Shepherds for Sale serves as a warning of what can happen when a church forgets that true power lies not in the world’s wisdom, but in Scripture.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 169\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/tA-Oux0rTls\nhttps://youtu.be/TY_PJw6WL7o\nhttps://youtu.be/dUT4RJBLWfQ\nhttps://youtu.be/VyXveT8j2sA\nhttps://youtu.be/CoQVb9EEMio\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Ross Johnston is a revivalist who is a leader and co-founder of California Will Be Saved. He is also one who is on the frontlines in leading revival in California as well as on a mission to unite the body of Christ. California Will Be Saved is a movement that hosts mass corporate gathering outdoors in major cities of influence across California with live worship, the proclamation of the gospel and baptisms. \n\nRoss was born by artificial insemination and grew up in a lesbian household with two moms. At 15 years old he was invited to church where he encountered the Holy Spirit and presence of God for the first time in his life.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, I chat with Alisa Childers and Tim Barnett about their new book, “The Deconstruction of Christianity: What It Is, Why It’s Destructive, and How to Respond.” \n\nA movement called ‘deconstruction’ is sweeping through our churches and it is affecting our loved ones. It has disrupted, dismantled, and destroyed the faith of so many, and this book can help you not only understand what’s happening but also stand your ground and respond with clarity and confidence.\n\nMaybe you have a loved one who is deconstructing their faith, and you are struggling to know how to respond;\n\nMaybe you are trying to understand the radical spiritual makeover your friend or family member is going through;\n\nMaybe your relationship with a loved one has been strained or even cut off because of your “toxic” Christian beliefs and you don’t know what to do;\n\nMaybe you’re experiencing doubt yourself and facing hard questions about truth, God, the Bible, theology and the gospel.\n\nSome who leave the faith feel wounded by the church. Others feel repressed by some of the moral imperatives found in Scripture. For some, it leads to a custom-made spirituality. For others, deconstructing their faith leads them away from the truth into agnosticism, atheism, the occult, or humanism.\n\nIn this seminal book, Alisa Childers, author of Another Gospel?, and Tim Barnett, creator of Red Pen Logic, will help you understand what deconstruction is, where it comes from, why it is compelling to some, and how it disorients the lives of so many. You will be able to think through the main issues around faith deconstruction and explore wise and loving ways to respond from a biblical worldview.\n\nBuy the book here: https://amzn.to/47T68kh\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 147\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/Wi76qgDeKxo\nhttps://youtu.be/Uqwxh-9HPtc\nhttps://youtu.be/WMaHKOGF9tY\nhttps://youtu.be/RqQHfSriaEY\nhttps://youtu.be/VeeXT6luh24\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

We do this in three ways.\n \nArm Students With Reasons to Follow Christ\nWe bring faith and logic together to give students thought-out reasons for following Jesus Christ. Our goal is to help Christians work through their doubts, and ultimately share Christ with their peers.\n\nEquip Professors with Tools to Share Their Faith\nWith the right encouragement, resources, and platform, professors can share their own faith with the students around them and be a light within their spheres of influence. We help provide these tools.\n\nPlant University Clubs Nationwide and Around the World\nUniversity students are questioning purpose, faith, and identity. Our nationwide clubs provide a safe place to ask apologetics questions (and give leaders resources to tackle them with confidence).\n\nhttps://ratiochristi.org/\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 146\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/Uqwxh-9HPtc\nhttps://youtu.be/WMaHKOGF9tY\nhttps://youtu.be/RqQHfSriaEY\nhttps://youtu.be/VeeXT6luh24\nhttps://youtu.be/HPFAqr_TvbM\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Many Christians assume that doubt is faith's opposite and that wandering among the hard questions of faith will lead us further and further away from God. True believers, the assumption goes, never waver in their confidence in the fundamental truths of the Christian faith.\n\nProfessor and philosopher Travis Dickinson disagrees. Instead, he says, our doubts and hard questions about the faith are actually an important way we can express our commitment and love to God. Doubt isn't our destination but it's an important step on the way. It's possible to wander toward God as we ask our questions honestly, in faith and trust. As we do, we'll discover the truth, goodness, and beauty of God waiting for us.\n\nhttps://www.travisdickinson.com/\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 144\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/RqQHfSriaEY\nhttps://youtu.be/VeeXT6luh24\nhttps://youtu.be/HPFAqr_TvbM\nhttps://youtu.be/n_TgpOoHWBs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmQj9g9uEOo\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

The cultural elites cheering the decline of men are trying to erase God’s design for half of the human race—the half that historically provides, protects, and leads for the good of others. The disappearance of the masculine ideal is bad news for men, and it’s terrible news for women.\n\nWhat will happen without men of courage and conviction? Who will do the hard jobs that no one else can do? Who will be left to face down evil, strengthen families, build churches, and bolster communities? Owen Strachan addresses those questions in this compelling new book, an inspiring blend of cultural analysis, biblical teaching, and passionate exhortation. Cutting through the ideological fog, he explains what’s at stake. If men are told they’re not needed, they disappear, becoming lost men. They get frustrated and lash out, becoming angry men. They go alpha and chase their lusts, becoming exaggerated men. Or they lose their masculinity and embrace effeminacy, becoming soft men.\n\nAnd yet there is hope, rooted in the wisdom and grace of God. In His kindness, He transforms lost, angry, exaggerated, and soft men into a force for good in this world.\n\nMale or female, if you want to understand manhood better, if you are tired of feminized men, this book is for you. It’s for struggling sons, disillusioned friends, discouraged coworkers, confused college students, disheartened grandfathers, concerned mothers, and everyone in between.\n\nOwen on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@graceandtruthOS\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 142\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/HPFAqr_TvbM\nhttps://youtu.be/n_TgpOoHWBs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmQj9g9uEOo\nhttps://youtu.be/NOQxIzukcmU\nhttps://youtu.be/D-W6NYrWdHo\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

You’ll be surprised and edified by this one. \n\nThe atonement is central to Christian theology and essential for following Jesus. In this addition to the Short Studies in Systematic Theology series, pastor Jeremy Treat explains what Scripture teaches about the atonement and how it impacts one’s daily life. \n\nTreat demonstrates that the death of Christ is a multi-dimensional work within the story of the kingdom of God. While the accomplishments of the cross are unending (including forgiveness, victory, and renewal), the heart of the cross is substitution―Jesus dying on behalf of sinners. Christ’s atoning work reconciles believers to God and to one another, calling them to a life of obedience. This book presents a kingdom-framed, substitution-centered, Trinitarian, integrated, communal, and life-changing approach to the doctrine of atonement.\n\nBUY JEREMY\"S BOOK HERE:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Atonement-Introduction-Studies-Systematic-Theology/dp/1433575698/ref=sr_1_1?crid=JGVTBN0SQCZ7&keywords=the+atonement+jeremy+treat&qid=1698959806&sprefix=the+atonement+%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-1\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 141\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/n_TgpOoHWBs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmQj9g9uEOo\nhttps://youtu.be/NOQxIzukcmU\nhttps://youtu.be/D-W6NYrWdHo\nhttps://youtu.be/PRCy_jqYej8\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nBUY STEPHEN'S BOOK HERE: https://www.amazon.com/Return-God-Hypothesis-Compelling-Scientific/dp/0062071505/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1697511903&sr=8-1\n\nIn today’s episode, Becket chats with Dr. Stephen Meyer about his book, “Return of the God Hypothesis: Three Scientific Discoveries That Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe.” \n\nThe New York Times bestselling author of “Darwin’s Doubt,” Stephen Meyer, presents groundbreaking scientific evidence of the existence of God, based on breakthroughs in physics, cosmology, and biology.\n\nBeginning in the late 19th century, many intellectuals began to insist that scientific knowledge conflicts with traditional theistic belief—that science and belief in God are “at war.” Philosopher of science Stephen Meyer challenges this view by examining three scientific discoveries with decidedly theistic implications. Building on the case for the intelligent design of life that he developed in Signature in the Cell and Darwin’s Doubt, Meyer demonstrates how discoveries in cosmology and physics coupled with those in biology help to establish the identity of the designing intelligence behind life and the universe. \n\nMeyer argues that theism—with its affirmation of a transcendent, intelligent and active creator—best explains the evidence we have concerning biological and cosmological origins. Previously Meyer refrained from attempting to answer questions about “who” might have designed life. Now he provides an evidence-based answer to perhaps the ultimate mystery of the universe. In so doing, he reveals a stunning conclusion: the data support not just the existence of an intelligent designer of some kind—but the existence of a personal God.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 140\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/n_TgpOoHWBs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmQj9g9uEOo\nhttps://youtu.be/NOQxIzukcmU\nhttps://youtu.be/D-W6NYrWdHo\nhttps://youtu.be/PRCy_jqYej8\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Even some Christians, swayed by the LGBTQ+ movement, have rejected God’s word on issues of sexuality and gender in favor of popular opinion. In light of these pressures, it’s more important than ever to help women see the truth about who God created them to be.\n\nIn this powerful book, Rosaria Butterfield uses Scripture to confront 5 common lies about sexuality, faith, feminism, gender roles, and modesty often promoted in our secular culture today. Written in the style of a memoir, this book explores Butterfield’s personal battle with these lies―interwoven with cultural studies, literary criticism, and theology―to help readers see the beauty in biblical womanhood, marriage, and motherhood.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 138\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/n_TgpOoHWBs\nhttps://youtu.be/nmQj9g9uEOo\nhttps://youtu.be/NOQxIzukcmU\nhttps://youtu.be/D-W6NYrWdHo\nhttps://youtu.be/PRCy_jqYej8\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

In Don't Follow Your Heart, Thaddeus Williams builds a case that self-worship is not authentic, it's arrogant. It is not satisfying, it robs us of awe. It is hardly new and edgy, but is hopelessly traditionalist, rehashing what is literally humanity's oldest lie.\n\nAs he explores the Ten Commandments of Self-Worship, Williams calls for a new generation of heretics, iconoclasts, renegades, mavericks, and rebels who refuse to march like good little cows, mooing in unison with the herd. He points us to a life beyond the boring, conventional, and self-defeating dogmas of self-worship and shows us how much more meaningful a life centered on God can truly be.\nGET THE BOOK HERE:\nThaddeus William's Website: https://jointheheretics.com/\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 137\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/NOQxIzukcmU\nhttps://youtu.be/D-W6NYrWdHo\nhttps://youtu.be/PRCy_jqYej8\nhttps://youtu.be/8XzZo4xQ1ug\nhttps://youtu.be/U-AWn2ynXf0\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

A follow-up to Koukl's best-selling Tactics, this book focuses on revealing the fundamental flaws in common, current challenges to Christian beliefs and values. It then provides individual strategies to exploit those shortcomings by offering model questions and sample dialogues to help guide believers in genial, yet persuasive, conversations.\n\nKoukl begins by explaining the important difference in evangelism between a harvest approach (reaping) and a gardening approach (sowing). He then provides an overview of the tactical game plan he uses to have fruitful \"gardening\" conversations with those who are not yet Christians. Subsequent chapters tackle specific areas of challenge that Christians frequently face in discussions \"on the street,\" as it were--in those conversations with friends, family, or critics that believers often avoid because they feel out of their element, vulnerable, or exposed.\n\nStreet Smarts equips Christians to handle tough challenges in a straightforward and user-friendly way. It provides the practical tools they need to keep them in the driver's seat of otherwise difficult and discomfiting conversations. It enables them to stand up for Christ in a safe, genial, yet effective way.\n\nPre-Order Greg Koukl's Book: https://www.zondervan.com/p/street-smarts/\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 135\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/8XzZo4xQ1ug\nhttps://youtu.be/U-AWn2ynXf0\nhttps://youtu.be/a42Yh6Njj1E\nhttps://youtu.be/S6ByRslmw50\nhttps://youtube.com/live/Cd3qhRAV3gU?feature=share\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from college, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both. He eventually went on to become a production designer working with the top photographers and directors in the world on fashion shoots for magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and for ad campaigns such as Gap, L'Oréal Paris, and Nike.\n \nFinding a new sense of freedom in L.A., Becket also fully engaged in his new life as a gay man. He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life. Becket was more than happy to count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord.\n\nBecket spends much of his time in ministry speaking at churches, universities, and conferences helping believers (and non-believers) understand this issue biblically, theologically, culturally, and personally. Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance. His goal is to challenge the current cultural narrative about sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular by demonstrating through his personal testimony and biblical truths that, yes, homosexuality is still a sin, and that following Christ is infinitely more satisfying and joyous.\n\nHe has lived all over the world in major cities such as Rome, Vienna, and Tokyo.\n\nBecket graduated from Talbot School of Theology at Biola University in 2017 with a Master of Arts in Theology. \n\nBecket’s book, A Change of Affection: A Gay Man’s Incredible Story of Redemption, with a \nforeword by Francis Chan, published by Thomas Nelson, released July 30, 2019.\n\nTBCS theme song by Seth Kaye\n\n#thebecketcookshow #savannahgeorgia #vlogs",

Ken also tells wild stories of his time as an officer in the LAPD and of an accident he was involved in that changed his life and walk with the Lord. \n\nAre you ready to stop wasting time and start turning your mundane life into one of adventure and blessing? Ken Harrison weaves together powerful stories and deep truths from Scripture to point you to the life for which God has called you.\n\nAsk Christians what they expect to happen to them after they die, and most will say they will go to heaven. And they’ll probably say that they will meet Jesus and hope to hear Him say, “Well done good and faithful servant.” But many believers know they are not living up to God’s calling on their lives. In fact, many might even admit their lives don’t honor God at all—at least Mondays through Saturdays.\n\nKen's Book \"A Daring Faith in a Cowardly World\" - https://amzn.to/479LkFp\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 133\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/a42Yh6Njj1E\nhttps://youtu.be/S6ByRslmw50\nhttps://youtube.com/live/Cd3qhRAV3gU?feature=share\nhttps://youtu.be/3CVOsduUu1s\nhttps://youtu.be/Fguqt2KwGVI\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, Becket chats with Dr. David Berlinski on his new book, Science After Babel. They discuss the deep flaws in Darwin’s theory of evolution, free will, and God.\n\nDavid Berlinski received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University and was later a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics and molecular biology at Columbia University. He is currently a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. Dr. Berlinski has authored works on systems analysis, differential topology, theoretical biology, analytic philosophy, and the philosophy of mathematics, as well as three novels. He has also taught philosophy, mathematics and English at such universities as Stanford, Rutgers, the City University of New York and the Universite de Paris. In addition, he has held research fellowships at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria and the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES) in France.\n\nHe is author of numerous books, including A Tour of the Calculus (Pantheon 1996), The Advent of the Algorithm (2000, Harcourt Brace), Newton's Gift (The Free Press 2000), The Secrets of the Vaulted Sky (Harcourt, October 2003), A Short History of Mathematics for the Modern Library series at Random House (2004), The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Its Scientific Pretensions (Crown Forum, 2008), and The King of Infinite Space: Euclid and His Elements (Basic Books, 2013), Human Nature (and Science After Babel (Discovery Institute Press, 2023). \n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 129\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/sOMOsogXJYU\nhttps://youtu.be/r1Fvxd8VI3s\nhttps://youtu.be/4sIPwdjETHc\nhttps://youtu.be/6tMpmsiS7VY\nhttps://youtu.be/BqQX2apec2k\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from college, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both. He eventually went on to become a production designer working with the top photographers and directors in the world on fashion shoots for magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and for ad campaigns such as Gap, L'Oréal Paris, and Nike.\n \nFinding a new sense of freedom in L.A., Becket also fully engaged in his new life as a gay man. He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life. Becket was more than happy to count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord.\n\nBecket spends much of his time in ministry speaking at churches, universities, and conferences helping believers (and non-believers) understand this issue biblically, theologically, culturally, and personally. Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance. His goal is to challenge the current cultural narrative about sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular by demonstrating through his personal testimony and biblical truths that, yes, homosexuality is still a sin, and that following Christ is infinitely more satisfying and joyous.\n\nHe has lived all over the world in major cities such as Rome, Vienna, and Tokyo.\n\nBecket graduated from Talbot School of Theology at Biola University in 2017 with a Master of Arts in Theology. \n\nBecket’s book, A Change of Affection: A Gay Man’s Incredible Story of Redemption, with a \nforeword by Francis Chan, published by Thomas Nelson, released July 30, 2019.\n\nTBCS theme song by Seth Kaye\n\n#thebecketcookshow  #theoryofevolution  #charlesdarwin  #DavidBerlinski #darwinism",

A trendy hashtag is #KillAllMen. Books are sold titled I Hate Men, The End of Men, and Are Men Necessary?\nHow did the idea arise that masculinity is dangerous and destructive? Nancy Pearcey leads you on a fascinating excursion through American history to discover why the script for masculinity turned toxic—and how to fix it.\n\nPearcey then turns to surprising findings from sociology. Religion is often cast as a cause of domestic abuse. But research shows that authentically committed Christian men test out as the most loving and engaged husbands and fathers. They have the lowest rates of divorce and domestic violence of any group in America.\n\nYes, domestic abuse is an urgent issue, and Pearcey does not mince words in addressing it. But the sociological facts explode the negative stereotypes and show that Christianity has the power to overcome toxic behavior in men and reconcile the sexes—an unexpected finding that has stood up to rigorous empirical testing.\n\n\"The Toxic War on Masculinity\" - https://amzn.to/3JcJVDF\n\nhttps://www.nancypearcey.com/\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 128\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nhttps://youtu.be/r1Fvxd8VI3s\nhttps://youtu.be/4sIPwdjETHc\nhttps://youtu.be/6tMpmsiS7VY\nhttps://youtu.be/BqQX2apec2k\nhttps://youtu.be/-4NR7Z7v-EY\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ.

But at some point in our lives, we may experience particular moments that prompt us to search for something deeper. Sociologist Peter Berger described these hints and clues as \"signals of transcendence\" that awaken us to unseen realities.\n\nOs Guinness tells stories of people who experienced signals of transcendence and followed them to find new meaning and purpose in life. Notable figures such as Leo Tolstoy and C. S. Lewis as well as lesser-known individuals experienced a variety of promptings that signaled to them that life could not continue as they had thought. Through unsatisfied longings or disillusionments that yet yielded glimpses of beauty or joy, these moments drew people toward epiphanies of transformation. And the same can be true for us, should we have the courage to follow the signals wherever they may lead.\n\n\"Signals of Transcendence\" - https://amzn.to/41sVLAz\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 119\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nThe Anti-Gospel \"Woke\" Church - https://youtu.be/cirw0i1As7Y\nAliens, Flat Earth & More - https://youtu.be/v1NV621adEc\nDo Contraceptives Cause Abortions? - https://youtu.be/eKs5kcoVMKk\nPrison, Fame & Christ - https://youtu.be/slIvAmIeD-U\nHow to Grieve A Great Loss - https://youtu.be/O3bJ4Z2qaZ0\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, I talk with Pastor Lucas Miles about his new book, “Woke Jesus: The False Messiah Destroying Christianity.” Today’s social justice movements call for equality, civil rights, love . . . solid Christian values, right? What if there is more to social justice than Christians understand? Even worse: What if we have been duped into preaching ideas that actually oppose the Kingdom of God?\n\nWoke Jesus uncovers the real dangers to Christianity and America from the Christian Left, Progressive or Woke Christianity. These radical alternatives abandon traditional biblical interpretations regarding marriage, gender, racial equality, justice, original sin, heaven and hell, and salvation, replacing them within a new fabricated morality. This fabrication is built around political correctness, cancel culture, hedonistic values, obsession with public health, allegiance to the leftist state, universalism, and virtue signaling.\n\nAuthor Lucas Miles— a pastor and trusted voice in the American church who has consistently addressed some of the most challenging topics in religion—not only outlines how the radical left wing is co-opting Jesus for their own anti-religious views, but also provides a call to action for Christians to resist the siren song of social justice and Wokeism. Rather than ignoring the problems within the church, Miles shows Christians how to grow in the truth of God’s word by expanding their understanding of solid orthodox theology.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 118\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nAliens, Flat Earth & More - https://youtu.be/v1NV621adEc\nDo Contraceptives Cause Abortions? - https://youtu.be/eKs5kcoVMKk\nPrison, Fame & Christ - https://youtu.be/slIvAmIeD-U\nHow to Grieve A Great Loss - https://youtu.be/O3bJ4Z2qaZ0\nThe Church of England Blesses Same-Sex Couples - https://youtu.be/o13A6UU6IPY\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Sitting in an Italian prison for a crime she did not commit, she had a miraculous encounter that led her to the Lord. Facing up to two years in prison, she actually escaped Italy, fled to Switzerland, and made it back to Los Angeles. Upon her return, she wound up becoming very successful in Hollywood, hosting shows on VH1 and her own late night talk show on NBC (\"Later with Cynthia Garrett\").

A twenty-year-old student at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, he had been participating in a school activity with his fiancée, sister, and friends, when he fell unconscious and collapsed to the ground.\n\nNeither students nor a passing doctor nor paramedics were able to revive him. His parents received the news at their home in Toronto and immediately departed for Louisville to be together as a family. While on the plane, Tim, an author and blogger, began to process his loss through writing. In Seasons of Sorrow, Tim shares real-time reflections from the first year of grief—through the seasons from fall to summer—introducing readers to what he describes as the “ministry of sorrow.”\n\nSeasons of Sorrow will benefit both those that are working through sorrow or those comforting others:\n• See how God is sovereign over loss and that he is good in loss\n• Discover how you can pass through times of grief while keeping your faith\n• Learn how biblical doctrine can work itself out even in life’s most difficult situations\n• Understand how it is possible to love God more after loss than you loved him before\n\nTim's Website: https://www.challies.com/\nBuy Tim's Book \"Seasons of Sorrow\" here: https://amzn.to/3xLn0sQ\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 114\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nThe Church of England Blesses Same-Sex Couples - https://youtu.be/o13A6UU6IPY\nHow Christianity Remade the World - https://youtu.be/5zNauohp19M\nCop Resigns Over Views on Marriage - https://youtu.be/dVJjYyLcqqc\nCanada's Cult of Death - https://youtu.be/pl_7oy8RzKI\nTrans Ideology Tearing Families Apart - https://youtu.be/oydLPquSPlc\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, Becket talks with the British historian, Tom Holland, about his brilliant book, “Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World.” We look at how Christian assumptions are underneath practically everything, including the French Revolution, Harvey Weinstein & #METOO, and the Women’s March. Time itself is grounded in Christianity in terms of the calendar we use—B.C (before Christ) and A.D. (anno domini – the year of our Lord). Our entire society is saturated by Christian concepts and assumptions. \n \nAbout the book:\nCrucifixion, the Romans believed, was the worst fate imaginable, a punishment reserved for slaves. How astonishing it was, then, that people should have come to believe that one particular victim of crucifixion-an obscure provincial by the name of Jesus-was to be worshipped as a god. Dominion explores the implications of this shocking conviction as they have reverberated throughout history. Today, the West remains utterly saturated by Christian assumptions. As Tom Holland demonstrates, our morals and ethics are not universal but are instead the fruits of a very distinctive civilization. Concepts such as secularism, liberalism, science, and homosexuality are deeply rooted in a Christian seedbed. From Babylon to the Beatles, Saint Michael to #MeToo, Dominion tells the story of how Christianity transformed the modern world.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 112\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nCop Resigns Over Views on Marriage - https://youtu.be/dVJjYyLcqqc\nCanada's Cult of Death - https://youtu.be/pl_7oy8RzKI\nTrans Ideology Tearing Families Apart - https://youtu.be/oydLPquSPlc\nThe Man Behind Justice for the Five - https://youtu.be/A7Jvmq69Pdw\nAmy Grant & Gay Weddings - https://youtu.be/sct8R6_HV64\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Marriage refers to Christ and the Church. That’s why there’s no such thing as homosexual marriage.” He was effectively forced to resign from his job after being told he could be terminated for posting his religious beliefs on social media. He shares the full story and his lawyer talks about next steps.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 111\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nCanada's Cult of Death - https://youtu.be/pl_7oy8RzKI\nTrans Ideology Tearing Families Apart - https://youtu.be/oydLPquSPlc\nThe Man Behind Justice for the Five - https://youtu.be/A7Jvmq69Pdw\nAmy Grant & Gay Weddings - https://youtu.be/sct8R6_HV64\nThe Slow Death of Marriage - https://youtu.be/mZ6Oi8ALC3Q\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from college, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both.

He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life. Becket was more than happy to count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord.\n\nBecket spends much of his time in ministry speaking at churches, universities, and conferences helping believers (and non-believers) understand this issue biblically, theologically, culturally, and personally. Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://omny.fm/shows/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, Becket interviews Christian Post writer, Brandon Showalter, about the new documentary on trans ideology and how it tears families apart called, Dead Name. \n \nHere is the description of the documentary:\nDead Name, the indie documentary, is not fiery or provocative or slick or political. Rather, it's an intimate portrait of three parents whose lives have been shaken and forever altered because their children have declared (or have been given) a transgender identity. In an hour-length film that weaves back and forth among mostly three stories, we learn how shocking it is for parents to hear that their children in their mid to late teens have seemingly out of nowhere decided to switch from female to male or from male to female. In another story, we follow one parent's nightmarish descent into the transgender world as her ex assigns a female gender to their very young son. In all these stories, we find parents struggling with disbelief, loneliness, helplessness, isolation and despair. Ultimately, each one's ultimate fear is the medicalized transition of their child -- though in one story, the path to medicalization may have proven to be fatal.\nDead Name lets us in on the inner thoughts, the struggles, and the declarations to fight for children who feel lost to them.\nWe have made Dead Name to open the conversation, humanize the subject from the perspective of parents, and give them a voice.\n\nDead Name Documentary: https://www.deadnamedocumentary.com/\nBrandon's Article: https://www.christianpost.com/voices/yes-trans-surgeries-are-being-done-on-minors-heres-proof.html\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 108\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nThe Man Behind Justice for the Five - https://youtu.be/A7Jvmq69Pdw\nAmy Grant & Gay Weddings - https://youtu.be/sct8R6_HV64\nThe Slow Death of Marriage - https://youtu.be/mZ6Oi8ALC3Q\nFree to be You and Me? - https://youtu.be/Vn8CwYnK2Bw\nTexas Oil Heiress - https://youtu.be/Vn8CwYnK2Bw\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

He eventually went on to become a production designer working with the top photographers and directors in the world on fashion shoots for magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and for ad campaigns such as Gap, L'Oréal Paris, and Nike.\n \nFinding a new sense of freedom in L.A., Becket also fully engaged in his new life as a gay man. He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life. Becket was more than happy to count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord.\n\nBecket spends much of his time in ministry speaking at churches, universities, and conferences helping believers (and non-believers) understand this issue biblically, theologically, culturally, and personally. Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance. His goal is to challenge the current cultural narrative about sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular by demonstrating through his personal testimony and biblical truths that, yes, homosexuality is still a sin, and that following Christ is infinitely more satisfying and joyous.\n\nHe has lived all over the world in major cities such as Rome, Vienna, and Tokyo.\n\nBecket graduated from Talbot School of Theology at Biola University in 2017 with a Master of Arts in Theology. \n\nBecket’s book, A Change of Affection: A Gay Man’s Incredible Story of Redemption, with a \nforeword by Francis Chan, published by Thomas Nelson, released July 30, 2019.\n\nTBCS theme song by Seth Kaye\n\n#TheBecketCookShow",

Amy calls it love but what is love according to the Bible? Becket looks Franklin Graham’s response to her hosting this wedding as well as another Christian writer who wrote a piece on this. Becket also talks about the time he attended a gay wedding and how and why he regrets this decision. Finally, Becket discusses whether a Christian should go to a gay wedding or not.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 105\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nThe Slow Death of Marriage - https://youtu.be/mZ6Oi8ALC3Q\nFree to be You and Me? - https://youtu.be/Vn8CwYnK2Bw\nThe Balenciaga Scandal - https://youtu.be/bCUZpIeseQA\nIs Jordan Peterson a Christian? - https://youtu.be/OKTlp3Ii-z0\nA Wake Up Call for the Church - https://youtu.be/6E34XoDLJ4I\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

I share a story of how I was ardently pro-gay marriage when I was dating a guy from Rome. I also share the story of my sending a letter to then President Bill Clinton expressing my frustrations over the prohibition of gay marriage and receiving a letter back from him laying out his views at the time. \n \n“Gay marriage” may seem innocuous, but it actually has a very detrimental impact on society. I get into all of the reasons why. \n \nFinally, I look at a possible solution to “gay marriage.” It’s an unexpected idea that could really work.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 104\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nFree to be You and Me? - https://youtu.be/Vn8CwYnK2Bw\nThe Balenciaga Scandal - https://youtu.be/bCUZpIeseQA\nIs Jordan Peterson a Christian? - https://youtu.be/OKTlp3Ii-z0\nA Wake Up Call for the Church - https://youtu.be/6E34XoDLJ4I\nChristian Conference Embraces LGBTQ+ Agenda - https://youtu.be/xNBob5t_j8E\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Released in 1972, we see how this album indoctrinated a generation with its feminist undertones, and helped pit men and women against each other, leading to all sorts of societal (and church) ills: divorce, broken families, anxiety, depression, and so on. Becket uncovers the link of this album to today’s gender madness. It’s surprising how a seemingly innocent children’s album could wreak so much havoc.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 103\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nThe Balenciaga Scandal - https://youtu.be/bCUZpIeseQA\nIs Jordan Peterson a Christian? - https://youtu.be/OKTlp3Ii-z0\nA Wake Up Call for the Church - https://youtu.be/6E34XoDLJ4I\nChristian Conference Embraces LGBTQ+ Agenda - https://youtu.be/xNBob5t_j8E\nYoga Isn't What It Seems - https://youtu.be/OMgDnitTQzE\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Echoing Bonhoeffer’s prophetic call, Eric Metaxas exhorts his fellow Christians to repent of their silence in the face of evil before it is too late. Can it really be God’s will that His children be silent at a time like this? Decrying the cowardice that masquerades as godly meekness, Eric Metaxas summons the Church to battle. An attenuated and unbiblical “faith” based on what Bonhoeffer called “cheap grace” has sapped the spiritual vitality of millions of Americans. Paying lip service to an insipid “evangelism,” they shrink from combating the evils of our time. Metaxas refutes the pernicious lie that fighting evil politicizes Christianity. As Bonhoeffer and other heroes of the faith insisted, the Church has an irreplaceable role in the culture of a nation. It is our duty to fight the powers of darkness, especially on behalf of the weak and vulnerable.Silence is not an option. God calls us to defend the unborn, to confront the lies of cultural Marxism, and to battle the globalist tyranny that crushes human freedom. Confident that this is His fight, the Church must overcome fear and enter the fray, armed with the spiritual weapons of prayer, self-sacrifice, and love.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 99\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nChristian Conference Embraces LGBTQ+ Agenda - https://youtu.be/xNBob5t_j8E\nYoga Isn't What It Seems - https://youtu.be/OMgDnitTQzE\nGirls Gone Wild - https://youtu.be/XYzvXpgWLoE\nThe Threat of \"Gay Christianity\" - https://youtu.be/iKy0oDne7dg\nFrom Gang Member to Christ - https://youtu.be/JMoRyzRUd98\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Revoice is the organization of Christians who maintain a belief in Biblical orthodoxy related to sexuality, but still identify themselves as “gay,” or “queer,” etc. We get into some of the shocking things that were said and done during this conference (e.g. Organizers handed out name tags and instructed attendees to select a sticker with their preferred pronouns to wear and tote bags/tees with slogans such as “Queer Today, Queer Tomorrow.” Speakers frequently referred to “sexual and gender minorities” along with terms such as women “assigned female at birth.” One presenter was introduced using “they/them” pronouns and wore a black T-shirt w/ the inscription, “Imago Dei” in transgender flag colors.

The affirming church movement has become mainstream through the erosion of mainline denominations. Queer theology has taken hold in many academic settings. The emergence of “gay celibate theology” is causing confusion in evangelical churches through its appeal to modern psychology and LGBT-lived experience. How did we get here? What does the Bible say about all of this?\n\n“Dangerous Affirmation” is an insightful analysis of the influence and spread of “gay Christianity.” Author M.D. Perkins exposes the way this movement handles theology, biblical interpretation, the church, personal and group identity, and political activism. While many Christians are being won over by this immoral cause, this book serves as a sober-minded call to faithfulness in the midst of cultural and religious chaos.\n\nBuy the book \"Dangerous Affirmation\" at: \nhttps://resources.afa.net/dangerous-affirmation-book\nUse promo code \"BECKET\" for FREE SHIPPING\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 95\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nFrom L.A.

    "title": "From Gang Member to Christ: Casey Diaz Interview - The Becket Cook Show Ep. 94",
    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to the podcast version here: https://www.spreaker.com/show/the-becket-cook-show\n\nIn today’s episode, I chat with Casey Diaz about his book, “The Shot Caller: A Latino Gangbanger’s Miraculous Escape from a Life of Violence to a New Life in Christ.” His story will absolutely amaze you! The son of El Salvadorian immigrants, Casey Diaz was brought to Los Angeles at the age of two. An abusive, impoverished family life propelled Casey at only eleven years of age into the Rockwood Street Locos gang. Casey was willing to do anything to be number one, but years of chasing rival gang members led to a dramatic ambush and arrest by the LAPD.\n\nAt just sixteen, Casey was sentenced to more than twelve years in solitary confinement in California’s toughest prison as one of the state’s most violent offenders. He thought his life was over.\n\nYet, when a determined elderly woman paid Casey a visit, a whole new world of possibilities began to unfold. Casey scoffed as she quietly insisted God was going to use him. As the days in solitary wore on, Casey realized Someone else was calling the shots. What happened next can only be described as a miracle.\n\nBuy \"The Shot Caller\" here: https://amzn.to/3RPZP8m\nThe Shot Caller Podcast: https://anchor.fm/theshotcaller\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 94\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nA Guide to Prayer - https://youtu.be/7lZqLRC3Nbw\n5 Simple Steps to Evangelism - https://youtu.be/RcnuxJpEoTs\nFrom Trans to Christ - https://youtu.be/aJSE0SsRd6E\nOne Lie at a Time - https://youtu.be/NpKxKLs621A\nWhat's Wrong with Living My Truth? - https://youtu.be/KQcXsipjZt0\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from Austin College in Texas, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both. He eventually went on to become a production designer working with the top photographers and directors in the world on fashion shoots for magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and for ad campaigns such as Gap, L'Oréal Paris, and Nike.\n \nFinding a new sense of freedom in L.A., Becket also fully engaged in his new life as a gay man. He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life. Becket was more than happy to count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord.\n\nBecket spends much of his time in ministry speaking at churches, universities, and conferences helping believers (and non-believers) understand this issue biblically, theologically, culturally, and personally. Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance. His goal is to challenge the current cultural narrative about sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular by demonstrating through his personal testimony and biblical truths that, yes, homosexuality is still a sin, and that following Christ is infinitely more satisfying and joyous.\n\nHe has lived all over the world in major cities such as Rome, Vienna, and Tokyo.\n\nBecket graduated from Talbot School of Theology at Biola University in 2017 with a Master of Arts in Theology. \n\nBecket’s book, A Change of Affection: A Gay Man’s Incredible Story of Redemption, with a \nforeword by Francis Chan, published by Thomas Nelson, released July 30, 2019.\n\nTBCS theme song by Seth Kaye\n\n#TheBecketCookShow #shotcaller #gang",

She tries, in vain, to get sound advice from her mother and sister. No one has a good answer because they are operating within a secular humanistic worldview. They can only look within. Of course, this was an early iteration of what’s plaguing our culture today: look within, follow your heart, you be you, etc. It’s amazing how we have been indoctrinated in this stiff since the 70s…and before.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 90\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nWhat's Wrong with Living My Truth? - https://youtu.be/KQcXsipjZt0\nRandom Straight Dude who Prayed for Me - https://youtu.be/_2oebhLh2as\nChristian Model Planted a Seed - https://youtu.be/k19bjCrbMBo\nMake-Up Artist Comes to Christ - https://youtu.be/m4MZhxcnjvM\nHis Sermon SAVED Me - https://youtu.be/r0BYEyyFv4s\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

The writer of the article is aghast that Jennifer Lopez took Ben Affleck’s last name. Becket explores the feminist underpinnings of the op-ed and counters it with a biblical foundation, particularly in Ephesians chapter 5. Even though Jennifer Lopez now calls herself Mrs. Affleck, the writer keeps referring to her as Ms. Affleck and castigates her for taking Ben’s name.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nListen to all podcast episodes here: https://thebecketcookshow.buzzsprout.com/\n\nIn today’s episode, Becket chats with author Brett McCracken about his latest book, “The Wisdom Pyramid: Feeding Your Soul in a Post-Truth World.” Brett unpacks what it looks like to live wisely as a Christian in an age of constant distraction. With the quick tap of the finger, we can access an endless stream of addictive information. Accessing information has never been easier—but acquiring wisdom is increasingly difficult. In an effort to help us consume a more balanced, healthy diet of information, Brett has created the “Wisdom Pyramid,” challenging us to increase our intake of enduring, trustworthy sources (like the Bible) while moderating our consumption of less reliable sources (like the Internet and social media). Brett helps us with a healthier approach at a time when so much of our daily media diet is toxic and making us spiritually sick. You’ll walk away from this conversation uplifted and encouraged.\n\nBrett's Book \"The Wisdom Pyramid\" - https://amzn.to/3nP4zhX\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 82\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nHard Questions About Life & Sexuality - https://youtu.be/jGYpMNPO69M\n5 Secular Claims & the Biblical Response - https://youtu.be/zS4MscXc7E8\nShe Prayed Me into the Kingdom - https://youtu.be/IvLSj-VqklM\nThe Strategy to Make Gay OK - https://youtu.be/5cYYtV7WaEM\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from Austin College in Texas, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both.

In her book, Nancy Pearcey goes beyond politically correct slogans with a riveting exposé of the dehumanizing worldview that shapes current watershed moral issues, arguing that a holistic Christian view sustains the dignity of the body and biology.

We see how this so-called “gender-affirming care,” promoted by much of society including the President of the United States himself, is really child abuse. Becket reminds us that in the 90s, Hillary Clinton was on a campaign to end genital mutilation in African countries. But she is silent on this current twist of genital mutilation on American teens sucked into a deeply wicked gender ideology.\n\nThe Michael Knowles Interview with Helena Kerschner: https://bit.ly/3wYZ0ln\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 76\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nLive Q&A - https://youtu.be/WStvEjMGJQ0\nHow to be a Christian in Babylon - https://youtu.be/mveEMSNxm0w\nThis Ends the Abortion Debate - https://youtu.be/-du7CiTRIOc\nTactics for Defending the Faith - https://youtu.be/ZhAn8Hj_fd0\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

We also learn the difference between an \"argument\" and a \"burden of proof.\" Alan gives great illustrations of how these tactics work in real life.

We discover through these key historical figures how our modern world was shaped and the dramatic effects their ideas have had on our culture today including the previously incoherent phrase, \"I am a woman trapped in a man's body,\" and how this phrase came to be known as coherent and meaningful in our world. You will be surprised how far-reaching these ideas are and how they are in the social imaginary whether we realize it or not.

We learn how context and history play an important role in our understanding, and how modern Christians tend to overlook literary themes when reading scripture. It is important for us in the modern church to respect the history, culture and true meanings behind the biblical text. Applying this discipline is crucial to understanding the Bible correctly, and will help you avoid falling into the common mistakes among Bible readers. Our culture would have us interpret the Bible in whatever way feels best to us, but we need to study the Word of God and its original intended meaning rather than bend it to our own cultural whims. We also discuss commonly misunderstood passages in the Bible.

Becket and Sam discuss how the culture's view of sex is destructive and harmful and how Jesus' message about sex and relationships is meant to bring dignity and security.\n\nSam's Books:\n\"What God Has to Say about Our Bodies\" - https://amzn.to/3v9SJnl\n\"Why Does God Care Who I Sleep With?\" - https://amzn.to/3s9UhvR\n\"Is God anti-gay?\" - https://amzn.to/3HfwgI2\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 63\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW:\nHostile Culture - https://youtu.be/ucaDvzzi_co\nSex Education - https://youtu.be/D_ekB6Crugk\n\"Queer\" Cinema - https://youtu.be/4JQJVNzoilY\nMommy Hates Motherhood - https://youtu.be/HuVEmyfPi8U\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Jesuit College Preparatory\nSchool of Dallas. After graduating from Austin College in Texas, Becket moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of writing and acting, finding success in both. He eventually went on to become a production designer working with the top photographers and directors in the world on fashion shoots for magazines such as Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and for ad campaigns such as Gap, L'Oréal Paris, and Nike.\n \nFinding a new sense of freedom in L.A., Becket also fully engaged in his new life as a gay man. He had a series of many relationships with men throughout the next fifteen years. \nIn September of 2009, Becket met a stranger at a coffee shop in Silver Lake who invited him to his church in Hollywood called Reality L.A. Becket reluctantly agreed to attend the service. After hearing the sermon that Sunday, Becket was utterly transformed by the gospel and gave his life to Christ. He also knew on that day when God revealed Himself to him that homosexuality was a sin and that he could no longer live that life. Becket was more than happy to count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord.\n\nBecket spends much of his time in ministry speaking at churches, universities, and conferences helping believers (and non-believers) understand this issue biblically, theologically, culturally, and personally. Balancing grace and truth when teaching on this subject is of primary importance. His goal is to challenge the current cultural narrative about sexuality in general and homosexuality in particular by demonstrating through his personal testimony and biblical truths that, yes, homosexuality is still a sin, and that following Christ is infinitely more satisfying and joyous.\n\nHe has lived all over the world in major cities such as Rome, Vienna, and Tokyo.\n\nBecket graduated from Talbot School of Theology at Biola University in 2017 with a Master of Arts in Theology. \n\nBecket’s book, A Change of Affection: A Gay Man’s Incredible Story of Redemption, with a \nforeword by Francis Chan, published by Thomas Nelson, released July 30, 2019.\n\nTBCS theme song by Seth Kaye\n\n#TheBecketCookShow #SamAllberry #Sex",

The culture is diametrically opposed to Christianity's message and more often than not seeks to undermine and misinterpret the teachings of Jesus. We as Christians need to seek refuge in the Word and not pick and choose what works for us based on a secular worldview.\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 62\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nSex Education - https://youtu.be/D_ekB6Crugk\n\"Queer\" Cinema - https://youtu.be/4JQJVNzoilY\nMommy Hates Motherhood - https://youtu.be/HuVEmyfPi8U\n\"There's No Such Thing as a Gay Person\" - https://youtu.be/cLtJTgzSyS4\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1308604\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nIn today's episode, Becket talks with Monique Duson about Critical Race Theory and how it's actually anti-biblical. We learn of her journey from a CRT activist to rejecting that philosophy and finding the real answers within Scripture. She shares about the extraordinary difficulties of growing up in South Central LA as well as a few harrowing events during her missionary work in South Africa. Monique gives us insight into how to understand racial issues biblically rather than through the lens of a secular humanistic worldview. Monique is a graduate of BIOLA University and currently getting her master's in theology at Talbot School of Theology. Her ministry's aim is to use Scripture to define terms like humanity, race, love, and justice. She wants to bring practical tools for clergy and lay people to walk out the ideals of racial unity and biblical justice.\n\nMonique's Website: https://www.centerforbiblicalunity.com/\n\nStand To Reason Reality Student Apologetics Conference: http://www.realityapologetics.com/\n\nThe Becket Cook Show Ep. 51\n\nWANT MORE? \nBuy Becket Cook's book about his dramatic conversion from gay atheist to born-again Christian: \"A Change of Affection: A Gay Man's Incredible Story of Redemption\" HERE - https://amzn.to/3hirfnh\n\nRECENT EPISODES OF THE BECKET COOK SHOW: \nDivine Appointment with the Cable Guy - https://youtu.be/k1lIn1gvLNA\nInterview with Dr. JP Moreland - https://youtu.be/w9GeB7o7gtI\nWhy Does God Care About Your Sex Life? - https://youtu.be/optDcD3IktE\nSuperman Comes Out - https://youtu.be/qOGFg8PQXN4\n\nSTAY CONNECTED:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/becketcook/​​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/becketcook/​​​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/becket.cook/​​​​\nWebsite: https://www.becketcook.com/​​​​\n\nABOUT BECKET:\nBecket Cook was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

    "description": "Support The Becket Cook Show on Patreon!: https://www.patreon.com/thebecketcookshow\n\nIn today's episode, Becket looks at Leviticus 20 and uncovers an often overlooked verse which explains why certain sins carried the death penalty for the Israelites. Any attack on the nuclear family unit was detrimental to the Israelite society as a whole. Looking at those same sins today we see how they are just as destructive - mental illness, drug addiction, homelessness, mass incarceration, violence, antifa, etc. The LGBTQ movement is particularly pernicious on the family and this passage in Leviticus reveals why.
