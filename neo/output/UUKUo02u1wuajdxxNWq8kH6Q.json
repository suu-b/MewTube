    "description": "In this special episode of Brain in a Vat, Brad Duchaine from the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department at Dartmouth discusses prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) – a condition where individuals see distorted faces.\n\nThe episode explores various manifestations of PMO, including seeing demonic features, dragons, or entirely different faces, and distinguishes it from prosopagnosia (face blindness). It delves into the neurological basis of PMO, touching upon structural and functional differences in the brains of those affected.\n\nWe discuss the significant impact PMO and prosopagnosia have on individuals' social interactions and quality of life, as well as potential management techniques such as using glasses or colored lights to reduce distortions.\n\n00:00 Introduction and Guest Presentation\n00:20 Exploring the Case of Face Distortion\n03:19 Understanding the Nature of Distortions\n05:49 Comparing Prosopagnosia and PMO\n07:17 The Role of Visual System in Face Recognition\n10:01 Impact of Face Recognition on Social Interactions\n14:16 The Spectrum of Face Recognition Abilities\n16:20 The Role of AI and Hallucinations in Face Recognition\n23:48 Understanding the Diagnosis of Face Recognition Disorders\n30:20 Understanding Prosopagnosia: Prevalence and Characteristics\n31:59 The Mystery of PMO: Prevalence and Need for More Research\n32:46 Exploring the Impact of Prosopagnosia and PMO on Social and Sexual Relationships\n33:23 The Intersection of PMO and Other Psychiatric Conditions\n37:03 The Struggles and Challenges of Living with Prosopagnosia and PMO\n41:02 Potential Treatments and Coping Mechanisms for PMO\n51:22 The Neurological Basis of PMO and Prosopagnosia\n54:51 Testing and Characterizing PMO: A Deep Dive into Research Methods\n59:54 Understanding the Perception and Processing of Faces in PMO\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jason Werbeloff\nEditor and Producer: Porter Kaufman and Ella Coleman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

    "description": "In this episode of Brain in a Vat, we’re joined by Jaime Edwards, co-author with previous guest Brian Leiter of \"Marx.\" The conversation begins with a thought experiment featuring the factory owner Mr. Moneybags, used to illustrate Marx’s critique of capitalism’s illusion of freedom.\n\nEdwards explains how Marx saw class struggle and ideology as intertwined — how workers internalize the very beliefs that sustain their exploitation. He unpacks Marx’s view of class division, the psychological function of ideological belief, and the way economic power shapes cultural and moral values.\n\nThe discussion then turns to modern readings of Marx, tracing how 20th-century thinkers shifted his focus from material conditions to consciousness and morality. Viewers are invited to consider whether Marx remains a critic of injustice, a prophet of ideology, or both.\n\nWatch our companion episode with Brian Leiter here: https://youtu.be/sMcvbhyXfgo\n\nRead \"Marx (The Routledge Philosophers)\" by Brian Leiter and Jaime Edwards here: https://www.amazon.com/Marx-Routledge-Philosophers-Brian-Leiter/dp/1138938505\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction and Thought Experiment\n00:18 Marx’s Tale of Mr. Moneybags\n01:55 Class Struggle and Ideological Belief\n04:27 Defining Class in Marxist Theory\n08:06 The Ruling Class and Historical Development\n09:09 The Industrial Working Class as Protagonist\n14:42 Marx’s Perspective on Civil Rights and Economic Structure\n21:22 Morality and Class Definition in Marxist Theory\n27:33 The Diffusion of Class Interests\n34:36 The Role of Ideology in Class Struggle\n43:47 Material Conditions vs. Ideas\n47:54 Evolution of Marxist Thought\n52:51 Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jason Werbeloff\nEditor and Producer: Ella Coleman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

    "description": "In this episode of Brain in a Vat, we’re joined by Brian Leiter, co-author (with Jamie Edwards) of a new book on Marx. We explore whether workers in contemporary capitalism are truly free—or trapped in a form of “wage slavery.” Leiter uses thought experiments to probe the limits of workplace freedom. He also examines Marx’s labor theory of value—its strengths and flaws—and shows how modern capitalism both confirms and diverges from Marx’s predictions.\n\nThe conversation then turns to labor, technological change, human nature, and artificial intelligence—culminating in a pressing question: what futures of work await us under capitalism?\n\nRead \"Marx (The Routledge Philosophers)\" by Brian Leiter and Jaime Edwards here: https://www.amazon.com/Marx-Routledge-Philosophers-Brian-Leiter/dp/1138938505\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction and Guest Welcome\n00:18 Thought Experiment: Are You a Wage Slave?\n02:10 Free Labor vs. Unfree Labor\n05:11 Historical Context and Modern Implications\n16:07 Capitalism's Role in Technological Progress\n20:22 Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work\n32:05 The Essential Nature of Human Beings\n38:59 Critiques of Marx's Naivety\n46:25 Technological Innovation and Labor\n51:33 Marx's Labor Theory of Value\n58:18 Fetishism of Commodities\n01:00:59 Future of Capitalism and Human Nature\n01:10:14 Concluding Thoughts on Marx and Capitalism\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jason Werbeloff\nEditor and Producer: Ella Coleman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

In this episode, Cécile Fabre investigates the moral lives of Cold War operatives like Kim Philby and Oleg Gordievsky. With Fabre, we probe the strange morality of spies and the ethical paradoxes they inhabit.\n\nIs it ever right to betray your country? Can deception be a moral duty? These questions come to life through real stories of espionage. Competing ethical frameworks — such as utilitarian, deontological, and virtue-based — offer different judgments on such acts. We also confront the role of ideology, the weight of consequences, and the question of whether loyalty to the state should override personal conscience.\n\nFrom secrets and double agents to the philosophy of trust and betrayal, this conversation delves into what it really means to be a “moral” spy.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to Espionage\n00:30 Case Study: Kim Philby\n02:48 Case Study: Oleg Gordievsky\n05:32 Ethical Dilemmas in Espionage\n09:55 Philosophical Perspectives on Treason\n30:48 Role Morality and Consequentialism\n43:52 Virtue Ethics and the Spy's Conduct\n58:21 The Duty to Betray\n01:01:24 Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nBrain in a Vat is ranked #15 on FeedSpot’s list of the top 90 philosophy podcasts.

    "description": "In this episode of Brain in a Vat, Georgi Gardiner returns to explore the epistemic value of tarot: its capacity to shape self-understanding, spark creative reflection, and influence major life decisions.\n\nDrawing on personal experience and philosophical analysis, Georgi examines how tarot can serve as a mirror for introspection while also raising concerns about confirmation bias and self-deception. The discussion also considers the history and diversity of tarot practices, and compares tarot with artificial intelligence as a tool for navigating uncertainty and meaning.\n\nWhether you are a skeptic, a believer, or somewhere in between, this conversation offers a thoughtful examination of how we seek knowledge and what counts as a good reason to believe.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Introduction and Guest Welcome\n00:11 Georgie's Personal Journey with Tarot\n00:51 The Impact of Tarot on Decision Making\n11:50 The Epistemic Value of Tarot\n28:22 Potential Criticisms of Tarot\n31:28 The Five Waves of Tarot History\n38:29 Confirmation Bias and Flipping the Reading\n42:25 Comparing Tarot and AI in Epistemology\n44:09 The Role of Tarot in Education and Research\n59:01 Concluding Thoughts\n\nBrain in a Vat is ranked #15 on FeedSpot’s list of the top 90 philosophy podcasts.

    "title": "The Israel Palestine Conflict | David Benatar (Rebroadcast)",
    "description": "Are Jews entitled to their own homeland? Is the Israeli response to the massacre of civilians perpetrated by Hamas on October 7th justified? Should there be a ceasefire? \n\nDavid's Article in Quillette: https://quillette.com/2023/10/21/its-not-the-occupation/ \n\nRaja Halwani wrote to us about Jason's exposition of his view at 33:06. Here is Raja's clarification:\n\n**I wanted to clarify a point that Jason made during the interview with David Benatar. Jason asked Benatar what he thought of the view that “the view is that the Gazans are an oppressed people. They’ve been oppressed for so long that they’ve acted out of desperation. And there’s only two options that they have.” Jason goes on to say that I have defended the view that “the Gazans are an oppressed people who only have two options. The one option is to die and the other option is to attack, to attack Israel in order to secure some sort of freedom. Those are its only two options. And so ... Raja takes the view that if Hamas were to lay down its arms, then it’s just a slow death for the Gazans. That’s, that would be the future of Gaza.”\n\nHowever, I did not make this claim about having only two options, nor would I, because it reads as a justification of killing civilians, especially given the context of the Hamas attacks of October 7 (and other attacks against Israelis). It reads as a justification because if death is one of only two options, then the second, to attack, seems permissible. The last sentence in Jason’s question, about Hamas laying down its arms, seems to especially imply this (though Jason did not intend to make me come out as justifying Hamas’s actions).\n\nJason attributes this view to me based on something I wrote in my blog (as he explained to me in personal correspondence). Here is the specific passage on which Jason bases his attribution:\n\nPeople are quick to condemn Hamas for the evil that it has wrought, but they are as quick to neglect that Hamas acts out of sheer desperation, out of the sheer desire, no matter how steep the price, to score a victory against Israel, a country whose military might not even its prime ministers fully comprehend, and out of the sheer hopelessness of the slow death that their people has been dying. Although to explain this is not to justify it, I also ask the reader: What options do the Palestinians have? What do you advise them to do? Their lives are going nowhere. Peace initiative after peace initiative has failed them (and, to add insult to injury, they are blamed for the failure). No Palestinian state has emerged, and none is likely to given the current map (just look and see whether a state can be built out of the Swiss cheese that is the West Bank). Their tunnel has been long and with no light at its end. So what should they do? They ought to sit still and “take it like a man.” To suck it up. To bear the unfair burden of history. We have to tell them, “Misfortune has fallen upon you, and you may not extricate yourselves from it by killing civilians. Even as you yourselves die, slowly, surely, with no justification, and with barely an explanation, you may not take the lives of the civilians of your enemy. This is the noble way.”\n\nClearly, the passage is a bitter one about Palestinian loss and oppression, but it is as clearly morally ruling out the option of killing civilians. So even though Hamas might take up arms against civilians, this is not a morally viable options for Gazans or Palestinians in general. Hence, insofar as Jason’s question attributes to me a justification of attacks on civilians, this clarification should clarify that this is not my position.**\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:22 Thought Experiment\n7:52 Historical context\n23:13 Two-State Solution\n27:46 Ethical Blockade\n31:37: What if Hamas laid down their arms?\n36:06 Current War\n45:46 Proportionality \n54:59 Concluding thoughts\n59:01 Outro\n\nCheck out FeedSpot's list of 90 best philosophy podcasts, where Brain in a Vat is ranked at 15, here: https://podcast.feedspot.com/philosophy_podcasts/\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jason Werbeloff\nEditor and Producer: Porter Kaufman and Ella Coleman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

The discussion explores a thought experiment involving two states at war and the deployment of autonomous drones capable of targeting terrorists without human intervention. Key topics include the legality and morality of such systems, the potential for reducing civilian casualties, the challenge of machine errors leading to war crimes, and the shifting responsibility in decision-making from humans to machines. The conversation also addresses the technological advances in AI, the issues of accountability and transparency with autonomous systems, and the philosophical implications of removing human judgment from warfare. We examine potential future scenarios where autonomous weapons could be misused by non-state actors or influenced by automation bias, raising critical questions about the control, ethics, and implications of advanced AI in military and civilian contexts.\n\n00:00 Introduction to the Episode and Guest Co-Host Jimmy Mullen\n00:12 Exploring Autonomous Weapon Systems with Father Afonso\n00:55 The Ethical and Legal Quandaries of Autonomous Weapons\n03:01 The Evolution of Warfare and Technology's Role\n06:15 The Human Element in Modern Warfare and AI\n08:19 The Philosophical and Legal Challenges of Autonomous Weapons\n21:08 Addressing Accountability and the Future of AI in Warfare\n30:17 Defining AI and Its Legal Challenges\n31:05 The Future of AI and Moral Agency\n31:51 AI's Emotional Intelligence and Superintelligence\n32:50 Military Strategy and AI: A New Conscience?\n34:21 The Limitations of AI in Understanding Common Sense\n36:13 The Human Element in AI Development\n37:03 Autonomous Weapons Systems and the Essence of Humanity\n39:11 AI on the Battlefield: Efficiency vs. Ethics\n43:37 The Unpredictability of AI and Warfare\n50:45 AI's Role Beyond the Battlefield\n56:27 The Collective Mind and Autonomous Systems\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jimmy Mullen\nEditor and Producer: Jimmy Mullen and Porter Kaufman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

She also explores the complex relationship between pornography, liberty, and equality, emphasizing that context matters when considering whether freedom of speech overrides other concerns.\n \nThe conversation also touches on whether pornography subordinates women, Nadine underlines that she defends the right to pornography not because she is an aficionado, but because she believes in individual choices.\n\nDefending Pornography Book: https://www.amazon.com/Defending-Pornography-Speech-Womens-Rights/dp/0814781497/\n\nFree Speech Book: https://www.amazon.com/Free-Speech-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0197699650/\n\n00:00 Introduction and Guest Presentation\n00:37 Understanding Pornography and Free Speech\n02:00 Controversies Surrounding Pornography\n02:12 Case Study: Provost's Scandal\n03:22 Debate on the Provost's Case\n03:54 Exploring the Concept of Academic Freedom\n05:10 Counter Argument: The Question of Judgment\n06:43 The Impact of Sexual Taboos\n07:30 The Role of the American Association of University Professors\n08:16 Discussion on the Provost's First Amendment Claim\n12:12 The Shift in Pornography Production\n17:58 The Debate on Virtual Child Pornography\n27:14 The Feminist Perspective on Pornography\n40:13 Understanding the Real Case of Subordination\n40:29 The Role of Subordination in Fantasy and Pornography\n41:05 The Radical Feminist Anti-Pornography Movement\n41:56 Analyzing Media and Subordinating Imagery\n42:45 The Impact of Subordinating Imagery\n42:59 The Irony of Anti-Pornography Activism\n43:58 The Controversy of Subordinating Images in Public Spaces\n45:05 The Role of Pornography in Society\n46:15 The Popularity and Impact of Pornography\n47:31 The Positive Benefits of Pornography\n48:30 Balancing Liberty and Equality in Free Speech\n55:02 The Intersection of Hate Speech and Pornography\n01:00:02 The Egalitarian Nature of Pornography\n01:05:48 The Controversy of Being a 'Minority Intellectual Dissident'\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jason Werbeloff\nEditor and Producer: Jimmy Mullen and Porter Kaufman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

    "title": "David Benatar on The Israel Palestine Conflict",
    "description": "Are Jews entitled to their own homeland?  Is the Israeli response to the massacre of civilians perpetrated by Hamas on October 7th justified? Should there be a ceasefire? \n\nDavid's Article in Quillette: https://quillette.com/2023/10/21/its-not-the-occupation/ \n\nRaja Halwani wrote to us about Jason's exposition of his view at 33:06. Here is Raja's clarification:\n\n**I wanted to clarify a point that Jason made during the interview with David Benatar. Jason asked Benatar what he thought of the view that “the view is that the Gazans are an oppressed people. They’ve been oppressed for so long that they’ve acted out of desperation. And there’s only two options that they have.” Jason goes on to say that I have defended the view that “the Gazans are an oppressed people who only have two options. The one option is to die and the other option is to attack, to attack Israel in order to secure some sort of freedom. Those are its only two options. And so ... Raja takes the view that if Hamas were to lay down its arms, then it’s just a slow death for the Gazans. That’s, that would be the future of Gaza.”\n\nHowever, I did not make this claim about having only two options, nor would I, because it reads as a justification of killing civilians, especially given the context of the Hamas attacks of October 7 (and other attacks against Israelis). It reads as a justification because if death is one of only two options, then the second, to attack, seems permissible. The last sentence in Jason’s question, about Hamas laying down its arms, seems to especially imply this (though Jason did not intend to make me come out as justifying Hamas’s actions).\n\nJason attributes this view to me based on something I wrote in my blog (as he explained to me in personal correspondence). Here is the specific passage on which Jason bases his attribution:\n\nPeople are quick to condemn Hamas for the evil that it has wrought, but they are as quick to neglect that Hamas acts out of sheer desperation, out of the sheer desire, no matter how steep the price, to score a victory against Israel, a country whose military might not even its prime ministers fully comprehend, and out of the sheer hopelessness of the slow death that their people has been dying. Although to explain this is not to justify it, I also ask the reader: What options do the Palestinians have? What do you advise them to do? Their lives are going nowhere. Peace initiative after peace initiative has failed them (and, to add insult to injury, they are blamed for the failure). No Palestinian state has emerged, and none is likely to given the current map (just look and see whether a state can be built out of the Swiss cheese that is the West Bank). Their tunnel has been long and with no light at its end. So what should they do? They ought to sit still and “take it like a man.” To suck it up. To bear the unfair burden of history. We have to tell them, “Misfortune has fallen upon you, and you may not extricate yourselves from it by killing civilians. Even as you yourselves die, slowly, surely, with no justification, and with barely an explanation, you may not take the lives of the civilians of your enemy. This is the noble way.”\n\nClearly, the passage is a bitter one about Palestinian loss and oppression, but it is as clearly morally ruling out the option of killing civilians. So even though Hamas might take up arms against civilians, this is not a morally viable options for Gazans or Palestinians in general. Hence, insofar as Jason’s question attributes to me a justification of attacks on civilians, this clarification should clarify that this is not my position.**\n\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:22 Thought Experiment\n7:52 Historical context\n23:13 Two-State Solution\n27:46 Ethical Blockade\n31:37: What if Hamas laid down their arms?\n36:06 Current War\n45:46 Proportionality \n54:59 Concluding thoughts\n59:01 Outro\n\nPresenters: Mark Oppenheimer and Jason Werbeloff\nEditor and Producer: Jimmy Mullen and Porter Kaufman\n\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Shopify): https://smarturl.it/BrainShop\nBrain in a Vat bookshop (Amazon): https://smarturl.it/BrainAmazonShop\n\nPodcast: https://anchor.fm/braininavat\nContact us: Mark.Oppenheimer[at]gmail and Jwerbe[at]gmail",

The material discussed relates to academic articles and books that he has written on the subject. https://philpeople.org/profiles/stephen-kershnar\n\nTwo of the biggest philosophy blogs and the Academic Freedom Alliance have come out in defence of Prof Kershnar.\nhttps://dailynous.com/2022/02/03/kershnar-cycle-reactivated/\n\nhttps://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2022/02/suny-fredonia-philosophy-professor-under-attack-for-doing-philosophy.html\n\nhttps://academicfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFA-Letter-to-SUNY-Fredonia-regarding-Stephen-Kershnar.pdf\n\nClips from the video have been widely disseminated including on Fox News.
