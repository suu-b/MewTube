    "description": "Our world feels more divided and violent than ever. The recent assassination of Charlie Kirk shook millions—because he stood for dialogue, courage, and truth in an age of fear and silence. His death raises a pressing question: Where do we find the strength to keep speaking when truth itself is under attack?\n\nIn this video, we explore how Jesus is not just a figure of the past, but the living answer for today’s brokenness. He is the foundation for truth, courage, and hope in a culture that wants to silence discussion. We’ll look at:\n\nWhy people are willing to die for ideas—and why truth threatens those without Christ.\n\nHow the devil uses fear and death to silence truth-seekers.\n\nHow Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection free us from fear and anchor us in hope.\n\nWhy knowledge of God changes how we live, engage, and love in this fractured world.\n\nIf you’re grieving, fearful, or searching for hope—this message is for you. Jesus is not distant. He is present. He is the Truth. And in Him, silence never wins.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "title": "Do We Earn Our Salvation? Grace, Works & the Catholic View Explained",
    "description": "Do Catholics believe we earn our salvation? It's one of the most misunderstood—and most debated—questions in all of Christianity. And today, we're setting the record straight with clarity, Scripture, and a whole lot of grace.\n\nIn this video, we dig deep into what the Catholic Church actually teaches about faith, grace, and works. Spoiler alert: it’s not salvation by works. But it’s also not a passive, one-time decision that guarantees heaven regardless of how we live.\n\nWe’ll walk through:\n\nWhat St. Paul really meant by “justified by faith apart from works of the law” (Romans 3:28).\n\nWhy James says we’re “justified by works and not by faith alone” (James 2:24)—and why Martin Luther tried to downplay this book.\n\nHow grace is always the initiator and sustainer of salvation—yet that grace empowers us to respond with faith working through love (Galatians 5:6).\n\nWhat the Council of Trent clarified in response to the Reformation—and why its teachings are deeply rooted in Scripture and tradition.\n\nHow salvation is best understood as a relationship, not a legal transaction—something we must remain faithful in, like a marriage, not just a moment we mentally check off.\n\nWe'll also break down the false dichotomy between faith and works, and show how the Catholic view doesn’t contradict Scripture—it completes the picture.\n\nSo if you’ve ever wondered whether Catholics “do” too much or Protestants “assume” too much when it comes to salvation, this is the video for you. Let’s talk about what it means to be saved by grace through faith, and what role our response actually plays in the process.\n\nCome with humility, come with questions, and most of all—come with an open heart. Because salvation isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about becoming who you were made to be, by grace.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "title": "The Early Church Fathers on Apostolic Succession: Part 2 of the Unbroken Chain",
    "description": "How do we know the Catholic Church today teaches the same faith the Apostles handed down? In Part 2 of our series on apostolic succession, we turn to the powerhouse voices of the early Church—those who lived closest to the time of Christ and the Apostles—to see what they actually believed and taught.\n\nThis episode focuses on what the Church Fathers said about apostolic succession, and spoiler alert: it wasn’t just a nice tradition. It was essential for identifying the true Church. St. Irenaeus, writing in the second century, lays it out clearly: if you want to know which church has the true teaching, you look for the one that can trace its bishops back to the Apostles. Plain and simple.\n\nWe’ll examine quotes and context from:\n\nSt. Ignatius of Antioch (writing as early as 107 AD),\n\nSt. Irenaeus of Lyons, who dismantled heresies by pointing to apostolic lineage,\n\nTertullian, who argued that heretics had no right to interpret Scripture because they weren’t in the apostolic chain.\n\nThis isn’t just history—it’s a defense of doctrinal authority and unity that the Church has preserved for 2,000 years. And if you’re coming from a Protestant background, this may be a missing piece that helps explain how the early Church stayed grounded without splintering every time someone had a new interpretation of the Bible.\n\nSo, if you’re ready to hear how the earliest Christians understood authority, succession, and Church unity—grab your notebook, buckle in, and let the Fathers speak for themselves. Their words still echo with clarity, conviction, and continuity.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "title": "Why Apostolic Succession Matters: The Unbroken Chain Back to Christ",
    "description": "Ever wonder how we can trust that the Church today still carries the authority of Jesus Christ? That it teaches the same truth the Apostles taught, without distortion? The answer lies in one of the most underappreciated but foundational truths of the Catholic faith: apostolic succession.\n\nIn Part 1 of this deep dive, we unpack what apostolic succession actually is, why it matters, and how it’s rooted in both Scripture and history. We trace the unbroken chain of bishops stretching all the way back to the Apostles—men who were handpicked, commissioned, and empowered by Jesus Himself.\n\nWe’ll explore how this succession was preserved through persecution, heresies, political upheaval, and cultural shifts—not by human ingenuity, but by the power of the Holy Spirit. You'll hear quotes from the early Church Fathers like St. Irenaeus, who made it clear in the second century that the true Church is the one with apostolic roots. And we’ll show why this matters for authority, unity, and doctrinal fidelity today.\n\nThis isn’t just theology—it’s your spiritual lineage. If you’ve ever wondered why Catholics trust the Church to interpret Scripture, guard the truth, and act in Christ’s name… this is where it all begins.\n\nSo grab your Bible, maybe a highlighter, and let’s go back to the very first bishops—because to understand the Church today, you’ve got to understand where it came from.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

But what if, instead of focusing on division, we took a moment to appreciate the gifts our Protestant brothers and sisters bring to the table?\n\nIn this video, I’m diving into five things I genuinely love about Protestant Christians—from their passion for Scripture to their boldness in evangelism. We’ll talk about the good, the beautiful, and even the uncomfortable, all through the lens of Catholic faith and unity in Christ. This isn’t about watering down differences—it’s about building bridges where they matter most.\n\nWhether you’re Protestant, Catholic, curious, or somewhere in between, this video is an honest, charitable look at how we can grow in mutual respect and understanding. Because Jesus didn’t just pray for correct theology—He prayed that we’d all be one. Let’s talk about what that looks like, and maybe even have a few laughs along the way.\n\nGrab a Bible, maybe some fair-trade coffee, and let’s go.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "description": "Forgiveness—it’s one of the hardest things Jesus commands us to do. It feels unfair, unnatural, even impossible at times. Why should we forgive someone who hurt us? What if they never apologize? And does forgiving really mean forgetting?\n\nIn this video, we’re breaking it all down. We’ll unpack what forgiveness actually is (hint: it’s NOT excusing the offense or ignoring justice), why Jesus commands it, and how releasing resentment frees us—not the person who wronged us. Drawing from Scripture, Church teaching, and the wisdom of saints like Augustine and Aquinas, we’ll see that forgiveness isn’t about pretending nothing happened; it’s about surrendering the weight of vengeance to God.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with forgiveness, this video is for you. It’s not easy, but it is freeing. Watch now to discover how forgiveness is not just a duty—it’s the path to healing.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "description": "Ever been told that praying to saints is unbiblical? That asking for their intercession somehow takes away from our relationship with Jesus? In this video, we break down why that couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nWe dive into Scripture, Church teaching, and early Christian belief to show that the saints are not distant, disconnected figures—they’re fully alive in Christ, cheering us on, and interceding for us before the throne of God. From Revelation’s golden bowls of prayers to Hebrews’ cloud of witnesses, we explore why the Church isn’t just those on earth, but one body across heaven and earth.\n\nAnd no, praying to saints isn’t worship—it’s asking for prayers, just like you’d ask a friend. Except these friends are a little closer to Jesus, and their prayers pack some serious power.\n\nBy the end of this video, you'll not only see why Catholics ask saints for intercession, but why the earliest Christians did too. Watch now to rethink what it really means to be part of the family of God!\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "description": "What makes you… you? Is your identity just a product of brain chemistry and biological processes, or is there something deeper—something immaterial that gives you true self-awareness, free will, and purpose?\n\nIn this episode of Practical Theism, we tackle one of the most profound questions of human existence: Do we have souls?\n\nModern science can explain how our bodies function, but it struggles to define what life actually is—or why we possess the ability to reason, reflect, and long for meaning beyond mere survival. If we were nothing more than biological machines, our thoughts and choices would be nothing but chemical reactions. And yet, we experience love, morality, and the ability to defy our instincts. Why?\n\nDrawing from philosophy, Scripture, and theology, we explore:\n\nWhy the soul isn’t just a metaphor, but the very thing that animates us\nHow personal identity persists, even though every physical part of us regenerates over time\nThe mysterious nature of consciousness, and why near-death experiences challenge a purely materialistic view of life\nWhy free will, rational thought, and moral reasoning point to something beyond the physical\nThe teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas, C.S. Lewis, and the Catechism on the soul’s immortality\nIf we have a soul, then our existence doesn’t end with death—and everything we do carries eternal weight.\n\nThis is more than just a philosophical debate. It’s a question that shapes how we live, what we value, and what we believe about our ultimate destiny.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is the soul real, or are we just neurons firing in a random universe? Let’s discuss in the comments.\n\nAnd if this got you thinking, share this video, hit that like button, and subscribe for more deep dives into the faith.\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "description": "Easter is more than just a celebration—it’s the most important event in human history. But have you ever wondered why the Resurrection was necessary? Couldn’t God have just forgiven our sins without Jesus dying and rising again?\n\nIn this episode of Practical Theism, we break down:\n✅ Why the Resurrection proves Jesus’ identity as the Son of God (1 Corinthians 15:17)\n✅ How the Resurrection conquered sin and death (Romans 6:9, CCC 654)\n✅ What this means for YOU today—freedom from sin, hope beyond death, and purpose in suffering\n✅ The historical evidence that the Resurrection actually happened (empty tomb, eyewitness testimony, and the explosion of Christianity)\n\nAs Saint John Chrysostom said: \"Let no one fear death, for the Savior’s death has set us free.\" The tomb is empty. He is Risen!\n\n👉 This Easter, don’t just celebrate the Resurrection—LIVE in it. Drop a comment below and let me know how Christ’s victory has impacted your life!\n\n#HeIsRisen #EasterSunday #Resurrection #CatholicFaith #PracticalTheism\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

    "description": "Holy Thursday—the night of the Last Supper—was far more than just a meal. It was the first Mass, the institution of the Eucharist, and the fulfillment of the Jewish Passover in a way no one saw coming. But here’s something most people miss: Jesus left something unfinished.\n\nAt the Last Supper, Jesus followed the traditional Passover structure—except for one critical detail: He didn’t drink the Fourth Cup. Why? Because He was saving it for the cross.\n\nIn this episode of Practical Theism, we break down:\n✅ Why the Last Supper was the first Mass\n✅ How the Jewish Passover structure unlocks the meaning of the Eucharist\n✅ Why Jesus skipped the final cup of wine—and how He completed the Passover on the cross\n✅ How this changes the way we see the Mass forever\n\n👉 Challenge: Attend Mass this Holy Thursday. Read the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper. And share this video with someone who’s never heard this before!\n\n📚 Recommended Reads:\n\nJesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist – Brant Pitre\nThe Fourth Cup – Scott Hahn\n#HolyThursday #LastSupper #CatholicFaith #Eucharist #PracticalTheism\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

Morality is just a social construct!\n\nWe’ve all heard these phrases before, but here’s the problem—relativism collapses under its own weight. It’s self-defeating, nobody actually lives by it, and when applied to society, it leads to chaos.\n\nIn this episode of Practical Theism, we’re breaking it all down:\n\n✅ Why relativism is so popular (Hint: It lets people avoid responsibility.)\n✅ Why relativism is completely self-defeating (Try saying “there’s no absolute truth” without contradicting yourself.)\n✅ Why nobody actually lives like a relativist (Just try taking their wallet!)\n✅ How relativism leads to moral chaos (History shows this isn’t just a thought experiment.)\n✅ How to respond to relativism in everyday conversations (Watch their brain short-circuit!)\n\nFrom Bishop Fulton Sheen, C.S. Lewis, and John Paul II, we’ll show you why truth isn’t relative—it’s real, objective, and worth defending.\n\n👉 Have you encountered relativism in conversations? Drop a comment!

Here’s what we’ll cover:\n\n✅ Why is there something rather than nothing? (Spoiler: The universe didn’t just pop into existence.)\n✅ The fine-tuning of the universe—is it luck or design?\n✅ Where do moral values come from? (And why atheism struggles to explain them.)\n✅ Did God reveal Himself in history?

    "description": "Ash Wednesday—what's the deal with all the ashes? Are Catholics just walking around with dirt on their foreheads for tradition’s sake, or is there something deeper happening here?\n\nIn this episode of Practical Theism, we break down the biblical, historical, and spiritual significance of Ash Wednesday. From Genesis to the early Church, we explore why ashes symbolize repentance, mortality, and our need for God’s mercy. Plus, we tackle common misconceptions—like whether Jesus condemned public displays of faith—and why even Protestant reformers kept this tradition alive.\n\nLent is about prayer, fasting, and almsgiving—but it’s more than just giving things up. It’s about becoming more like Christ. So don’t just wear the ashes. Live them.\n\n👉 If you found this video helpful, hit that like button and smash that subscribe button for more deep dives into the faith!\n\nFollow us on our Facebook Page! https://www.facebook.com/practicaltheism\n\nSee more at www.practicaltheism.com\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\nAll Rights Reserved.",

Following truth, is the deepest desire of the heart, but when we rest in that, we find ultimate peace and fullfillment.",

I was fascinated by the Catholic Intellectual tradition and it made sense of Christianity to me in a way that the faith never had before. I started to see the world through a different lens, the lens of the true Jesus, the true God, that is love and that transformed my thinking. This is the part of my testimony where God's Grace so invaded my life to transform it.

After making rounds to different non catholic churches and other christian faith traditions, I started to see that not everything was as it seemed. There were inconsistencies in some of the doctrines verses what I was reading in Scripture and this led to even more confusion. Things such as what is the Eucharist? What role do works play in salvation? Do we really go by the bible alone? Do I need to get rebaptized? All of these experiences led to the moment, which we will get to in part 3, which set me ablaze in my journey for Christ.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/87GaYi9OZd0",
