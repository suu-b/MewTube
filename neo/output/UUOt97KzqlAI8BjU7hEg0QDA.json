    "description": "Description: Was Carlo Acutis’s miracle real — or a medical misdiagnosis? Carlo Acutis, known as the “Millennial Saint,” is on the path to canonization in the Catholic Church. One step in that process is the approval of a miracle: the sudden healing of a young boy diagnosed with a serious illness.

    "title": "Further notes on my never-to-be-aired call with Catholic Answers - on the historicity of Juan Diego",
    "description": "Too long, didn't watch? The main thrust of this video is that the Juan Diego story can be analogized to the Gospel stories. \"Traditional\" views of both have the main account(s) being written by contemporaries of the main events, written within decades of the events themselves. However, in both cases, there are critical scholars who argue that these stories were not written by contemporaries, but rather, written by non-contemporaries, considerably later than only 1 or 2 decades later.\n\nThe traditional authorship view of the Gospel of Matthew, for instance, is that it was written by an eye-witness, within a decade or two of Jesus's resurrection. The \"traditional\" view for the Juan Diego story is that the Nican Mopohua was written within a decade of two of the apparition, by Antonio Valeriano, who would have been 10 when the apparitions at Tepayac occurred. \n\nThe \"critical\" view for the Gospel of Matthew is that it was written some ~5 decades after the events took place, not one or two, and by some Greek-speaking Christian, not an eyewitness from Galilee. And the \"critical\" view of the Nican Mopohua is that it was written by Luis Laso de la Vega in 1649, not by Antonio Valeriano in the 1540s or 1550s. \n\n\n... \n\n\nSo, this video is my case for why we should believe in the \"critical case\" over the \"traditional case\" for the Nican Mopohua. As always, agree or disagree, leave a comment in the comments section and I will do my best to respond. Thanks! \n\nHere's the link to that \"Arcane Knowledge\" website: https://www.arcaneknowledge.org/catholic/guadalupe9.htm \n\nThe author of this site is clearly very knowledgable about the historicity of the Guadeloupe account, but he is not a historian. The author, Daniel J. Castellano, has a degree in Math and he works in finance, it seems. So, there are places in this essay where Castellano disagrees with Poole about the dating of certain documents based off of the writing style and things like that, and I do admit that, when it comes to this, its Poole's word vs Castellanos's (and Burrus and the other scholars on his side), and, since Poole is the historian between then, I do lean towards Poole. But Castellanos could be right and Poole could be wrong and I wouldn't know, since I am not an expert in 16th century spanish and 16th century Nahuatl and all that. \n\n0:00 Convo with Catholic Answers\n3:45 Nican Mopohua\n8:51 Huei tlamahuicoltica \n12:18 The authorship debate \n22:36 Miguel Sanchez\n29:50 Pre-1649 copy?\n33:06 Final considerations",

    "title": "The Catholic Church's teaching on slavery proves that the Catholic Church is NOT the One True Church",
    "description": "Works Cited: \nThe Popes and Slavery (1996) by Fr Joel S Panzer \nAll Oppression Shall Cease (2022) by Fr Christopher J Kellerman\nCollection of Instructions of the Holy Office from 1662 to 1886 (1907) \nCatholic World Report article that wrote \"apparently includes\" but then also linked to a blog expressing skepticism that this 1866 Instruction actually exists: https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2023/05/02/the-truth-about-the-church-and-slavery-held-captive-in-service-of-dissent/\n..........................................\nThe past *apparently includes* an 1866 Holy Office text asserting that “slavery itself, considered as such in its essential nature, is not at all contrary to the natural and divine law, and there can be several just titles of slavery.\n..........................................\n\"Apparently Includes\" is a hyperlink to this blog: \n\nhttps://cathapol.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/slavery-document-1866-instruction-of-the-holy-office/\n\nAnd this is the blog that wrote as follows: \n..........................................\nIf you’ve been around apologetics much at all you’re probably familiar with the argument some dissidents and anti-Catholics like to throw out there – that is the “Instruction of the Holy Office” supposedly signed by Pope Pius IX in June of 1866.  I’ve searched long and hard for this actual document – and about the only thing I can find is quotes from dissidents and anti-Catholics – and not one single source with full context.   It truly seems like one of those “repeat a lie often enough people will believe it, and you will even come to believe it yourself” types of things.  Why is it that this ONLY turns up on anti-Catholic and dissident sites?  Why can you not find the context, anywhere?  I’m quite open to discussing and even debating this topic – but let’s have a valid source first, shall we?  I challenge anyone to present the primary source document, with context, so we can do just that – discuss and debate this matter.\n..........................................\n\nThe main book I am citing in this video is 1996 The Popes and Slavery by Fr Joel S Panzer. Please email me if you cannot find a copy of the book to purchase for yourself. I had some of my Catholic friends express skepticism in the 1866 Instruction, because, seemingly, it was found only in Fr Panzer's book. To help clear up further skepticism, I found the 1866 Instruction in a collection of Holy Office Instructions, which I have linked to below: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1kcZMhdAJU4LSLd72ONSiArX38r00WTWV/view?usp=drive_link\n\nThis collection of Holy Office Instructions covers the years 1622 to 1866, and so, the 1866 Instruction in question is way at the back of the book, on page 719 (which is the 731st page of the scanned PDF). This is only in Latin, but to read the full 1866 Instruction in English, please see Appendix C in Fr Panzer's book. \n\nAnd if I were to summarize my video here, it would be that the 1866 Instruction of the Holy Office, which is the same organization as the modern DDF (after several name changes) states that \"slavery per se\" is not at all contrary to natural or divine law, and there are many \"just titles\" of slavery. Then in 1965, in Gaudium et spes, the Church declared that slavery is an \"infamy\" and a \"supreme dishonor to the Creator\". How can slavery be both \"not at all contrary to Divine Law\" yet also \"a supreme Dishonor to the creator\"? At worst, this is a legitimate contradiction. At best though, there is no contradiction ... but there are still bullets to bite. Perhaps Gaudium et Spes has this unstated assumption built into it where it is excepting the many just titles of slavery (such as being born into slavery) from its critique of slavery. This would be question begging, since Gaudium et Spes does not state that, but it would solve the conundrum. But if you did do this ... you're admitting that slavery is indeed fine, at least slavery per se, and that there exist many \"just titles\" of slavery. To be clear, many Trads do go this route, although some Trads just say Vatican 2 is outright wrong. The other bullet you can bite is by saying that Gaudium et Spes is correct, slavery is a dishonor to God... but then you must admit that the Catholic Church, Her Tradition, from Augustine to Aquinas to the Holy Office, was wrong for over 1,800 years. This is the bullet that Fr Kellerman seems to bite in his book. \n\nI will end it there - thanks all! \n\nChapters: \n0:00 The Argument from Slavery \n2:35 Addressing Skepticism \n6:10 The 1866 Instruction \n19:30 All Oppression Shall Cease\n24:09 Gaudium et Spes \n27:03 Biting Bullets - Option 1\n30:33 Biting Bullets - Option 2",

    "description": "Is this video too long? Here's the \"too long, didn't watch\" summary: \nThe Catholic Church is currently parading around some bone that was found inside an altar in Rome 1830 as if that bone belonged to Saint Jude, despite the fact that there is no evidence that anyone has ever known what happened to Jude after the events of the New Testament. Even the New Testament itself is hardly helpful about Jude. Nobody is sure if the Jude mentioned in Luke's lists of the Twelve in Acts and the Gospel of Luke is the same person as the Thaddeus mentioned in Mark's and Matthew's lists of the Twelve, or if this Jude is the same Jude who was \"Jesus's brother\", or if there were two separate Judes. The post biblical sources for the life of Jude only start to appear around 250 years after Jude would have died, and these sources start to contradict immediately, and, they include \"mythical-seeming\" elements, like Jesus having written a letter to King Abgar. We have traditions that include Jude dying a martyr, and him dying of natural causes. We have traditions of Jude dying and being buried in five different cities across three separate countries. Worst, we have no evidence of his bones ever being transferred to Rome (since nobody actually knows where his bones are). So, for the Church to parade around some bone found in an 11th Century Roman Church as if it is the real bone of St Jude is deceitful. And I suspect that the Church is making money off of this deceit. \n\nSOURCES: \n\n\"The Fate of the Apostles\" (2015) by Dr Sean McDowell\nI understand that an updated edition of this book is coming out later this month, Dec 2024. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Fate-Apostles-Sean-McDowell/dp/1138549134/\n\n\"The Other Gospels: Accounts of Jesus from Outside the New Testament\" (2013) by Dr. Bart Ehrman \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Other-Gospels-Accounts-Outside-Testament/dp/0199335222/\n\n\"Ecclesiastical History\", Book 2 (4th Century) by Eusebius, the bishop of Caesarea\nThis contains the brief mention of Thomas sending Thaddeus to Edessa \nhttps://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm\n\n\"The Acts of Thaddeus\" (~7th Century) \nhttps://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm\n\n\"The Golden Legend, or, Lives of the Saints: Unabridged Premium Edition in Seven Volumes\" (13th Century) by Jacobus De Voragine\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Golden-Legend-Lives-Saints-Unabridged/dp/B09TS3CVFP\n\n\"Saint Jude - Official Explanation\" (2024) by GabiAfterHours\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTFWR8O4JJw&t=300s\nThis is the sermon given by Fr Carlos Martins during the tour of the relic of St Jude \n\nThree examples of Catholic websites saying that Constantine moved the bones of St Jude from Beirut to Rome in the 4th Century, without citing any sources: \nThe Catholic Standard: https://www.cathstan.org/local/relic-of-the-arm-that-embraced-our-lord-venerated-at-st-jude-parish\nCatholic Witness: https://www.catholicwitness.org/arm-of-st-jude-apostle-of-the-impossible-draws-thousands-for-veneration-at-holy-name-of-jesus/\nThe Rad Trad Blog: https://theradtrad.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-resting-place-of-sts-simon-and-jude.html\n\nAnd thank you to Reddit User u/ElderScrollsBjorn_ for sending me the pictures of the banners! \n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Lies from the Pulpit \n1:41 Biblical Evidence\n6:00 Post-Biblical Evidence\n16:46 Evidence of the Relic\n27:11 Why lie? \n31:48 Appendix",

This practice of “testing into compliance” is unscientific and objectionable under CGMPs [this stands for Current Good Manufacturing Practice]. The maximum number of retests to be performed on a sample should be specified in advance in a written standard operating procedure (SOP). The number may vary depending upon the variability of the particular test method employed, but should be based on scientifically sound principles. The number of retests should not be adjusted depending on the results obtained.\n\nSource: https://www.fda.gov/media/71001/download\n\nHere is the TLDR:\n\nThe sample from the 1996 host was analyzed at a lab called \"Forensic Analytical\" in Hayward, California, first, and that lab said that \"no known morphological features could be recognized\".

    "description": "There are a non-insignificant number of times that I say \"Committee\" instead of \"Commission\" in this video, and ironically, it gets worse the further the video goes on. You'd think I learn to say it correctly ... but I am a big dummy. Sorry! \n\nAnother note that I do not get into this video is the modern Commission is nothing like the Commission from 100 years ago. So, as much as I wish that the modern Commission would straight up just say \"Yes, the commission was wrong all those years ago\", the modern commission is at least not repeating its mistakes of the past. \n\nPope Benedict wrote a piece, linked below, where he talks about the Commission, on the 100th anniversary of its founding, back in 2003, before he was pope. He kind of admits that the Commission made mistakes, saying that the \"credibility of the magisterium has been diminished\", which is like, super shocking to me, but then he kinda just says \"Oh well, sometimes it be like that\". Look: \n\n... how should we evaluate, today, the first fifty years of the Biblical Commission? Was all this only, so to speak, a tragic conditioning of the freedom of theology, a set of errors from which we had to free ourselves in the second fifty years of the Commission, or should we instead consider this difficult process in a more articulated way? That things are not as simple as they seemed in the initial enthusiasm at the beginning of the Council is perhaps already evident from what we have just said. It remains true that the Magisterium, with the decisions cited, has excessively broadened the scope of certainties that faith can guarantee; for this reason it remains true that the credibility of the Magisterium has been diminished and the space necessary for exegetical research and questions has been excessively restricted. But it also remains true that, as far as the interpretation of Scripture is concerned, faith has its say and that therefore pastors are also called to correct, when the particular nature of this book is lost sight of and an objectivity, which is pure only in appearance, makes disappear what is proper and specific to Sacred Scripture. A laborious research was therefore indispensable, so that the Bible had its correct hermeneutics and historical-critical exegesis its rightful place.\nhttps://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/pcb_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20021030_stock_it.html\n\nSo yeah, that is another interesting thing that didn't make it into the script.

    "description": "There are a few things that I didn't even get around to in my script, so I am going to leave them here. \n\nIn the City of God part, Augustine is writing about Numa Pompilius as if Numa was a real, historical King. Numa was not. Numa never existed. Its funny, because Augustine points out, in chapter 35, that it is believed that Numa Pompilius married a nymph, and so, Augustine points out that legends can grow over time. Little did Augustine know that the entire story of Numa Pompilius is legend, not just the part about him marrying a nymph. \n\nFor reference, when I called Numa the \"second king of Rome\", I meant \"the successor to Romulus\", who was also not a real, historical person. The listener with an interest in Roman myth may have picked that up already. \n\nAlso, I didn't spend any time at all talking about how Augustine is kind of being a skeptic about the pagan gods in City of God. He is reasoning out why the pagan Gods are all false, and its kinda cool reading it and getting into his head. I am afraid that someone watching my video and not reading this part here might think that I think that City of God is super lame and stuff, but I actually like it! Its neat! \n\nLet me also add here something about the \"Four Winds\" that Irenaeus mentions in Against Heresies (ie, there can only be four gospels because there are four winds). On my reddit post, someone was telling me that  Irenaeus's mentioning of the Four Winds was a callback to the book of Revelation: \n\n\"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.\"\nRev 7:1 \n\nI, however, don't think that Irenaeus was calling back to Revelation, necessarily. Rather, the Four Winds were just a popular conception of like, how the world worked, back then. The earliest reference that we have to the Four Winds is from tablet KN Fp 13, dated to 1450-1375 BC. Virgil's Aenead talks about the Four Winds too, which was written only a few decades before Jesus would have been born. The Four Winds are also mentioned in a few OT books, like Daniel,  Zechariah, Jeremiah and Hosea. \n\nOK, that is probably good for now. I spent a decent while reading these books in order to come up with a script on necromancy, but I tend to read quickly and then forget quickly, so, if anyone wants to challenge my understandings anywhere, please do! The odds of me having misinterpreted something in here is probably pretty decent haha!  \n\nChapters: \n0:00 Suan Sonna and the Limit of Apologetics \n4:31 Weird Reasoning: Four Zones, Four Winds, Four Gospels  \n6:55 Weird Reasoning: Sexual Reproduction, therefore, Resurrection \n9:38 Necromancy: Augustine of Hippo  \n13:03 Necromancy: Justin Martyr \n15:22 Necromancy: Pseudo-Clement of Rome \n18:29 Aquinas, Faith and Humility \n22:22 Post Script: Reddit Roundup \n\nWorks Cited: \n\nThe Church Fathers.

Don Calloway, MIC | Franciscan University”, published by Franciscan University of Steubenville YouTube account. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwVdYXyxln0\n\nPertinent quotes from the speech: \n\nFrom 12:22 to 12:56 \nFather Dominic… went on a preaching campaign to go against [the Albigensian Heretics]. And he thought, with his ability to speak, he'd be able to conquer them easily, but he wasn't able to. And he was pretty bummed out, so he went into the forest to do a retreat in southern France and he prayed and he asked Heaven “I need help, I need help”, and that is when, tradition says, popes have said, Our Lady came to him and said to him, “preach my Salter”. \n\nFrom 15:42 to 16:00 \nThe black plague in Europe, in the 14th century, was a result of Satan seeking to get rid of this [spoken while holding up some rosary beads]. The weapon had been unsheathed. He wanted to destroy all documentary evidence associated with it, and, by the way, this is a frequent tactic of the evil one. When some new form of devotion is given to the world he will seek to burn the original documents. \n\nFrom 37:05 to 37:23 \nYou know about the tilma and Guadalupe, and it's a miracle! I mean the tilma is alive! You know they've studied the eyes and everything - it's just it's a miraculous - it should have disintegrated, it's the color spectrum is not known to us, it's hovering above the fabric, it's unbelievable! \n\nFrom 40:48 to 41:07\nI want to go there so bad [to the Shrine of Our Lady of Las Lajas]. Fully approved! John Paul 2 talked about it! That happened in 1754, to confound “the academics” [spoken while doing air quotes with his hands] . You think you know? You don't know. When you get too involved in your books and you don't have the piety and the devotion, and you're not trusting, there's a problem. And heaven will respond. \n\nFrom 51:20 to 51:55 \nAfter that happened in 1903, Leo the 13th dies, modernism strikes, hard. Oh, big time hard. And what do they go on the attack against? This [holding up a rosary]. As soon as Leo the 13th dies, the scholars come out and they start saying “it's legendary, it's not true, it has no foundation in reality, there's no historical documents”. Right - because they were burned! What does it take to get into your head? That this is how the devil works! And popes have affirmed this time after time after time after time.",

    "title": "Aquinas de Raptu - St. Thomas Aquinas's most revolting opinion (by my, subjective, lights)",
    "description": "QUICK CORRECTION: \n\nAt ~11:24, I say that \"Aquinas thinks that Raptus of a virgin is worse than that of a non-virgin\". This isn't necessarily entailed, though I do still believe that Thomas thinks that they are different, in much the same way that we today might think that raptus of someone under the age of 18 is worse than of someone over the age of 18. \n\nLet's read exactly what Aquinas says: \n\n\"Wherefore adultery is more grievous than seduction. And both of these are aggravated by the use of violence. Hence rape of a virgin is graver than seduction, and rape of a wife than adultery.\" \n\nSo, Aquinas says: \n\nA is more grievous than B. \n\nC = some violence plus A \nD = some violence plus B \n\nC is more grievous than A \n\nD is more grievous than B \n\nThat is all Aquinas says. It is not necessary from these premises that C is more grievous than D, that is true. But I still do believe that Aquinas means this, since he is delineating between the two. But, at that 11 minute mark, I do not go into any of the above, and so, here in the description is the quick correction. \n\nAlso, I say it the wrong way around. Aquinas seems to think that doing that to a non-virgin is worse than someone who is a virgin. \n\nAdultery is worse than seduction. \"Adultery-raptus\" (of a non-virgin) then is worse than \"seduction-raptus\" (of a virgin). So, ignore that entire 5 seconds haha!  \n\nEND CORRECTION \n\nWorks Cited: \n\nThe Summa, second part of the second part, question 154, “The Parts of Lust”, articles 11 and 12: \n\nLatin and English side by side: \nhttps://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Thomas_Aquinas/Summa_Theologiae/Part_IIb/Q154\n\nJust English: \nhttps://www.newadvent.org/summa/3154.htm#article12\n\nChapters: \n0:00 Stage-setting\n1:24 Defining \"raptus\" and \"unnatural vices\" \n5:57 Aquinas on which is worse \n11:32 Why this opinion sounds psychopathic to me \n14:04 Aquinas is consistent \n17:02 Conclusion",

    "description": "The various stories of incorrupt bodies of saints were told to me, time and time again, growing up as a Traditional Catholic. My confirmation name is John Vianney, after Saint Jean-Marie Vianney, who’s body is entombed above the main altar in the Basilica at Ars, France. But perhaps better known incorrupt saints include Saint Bernadette Soubirous (show a picture of a Subaru), Saint Catherine Labouré, and Saint Francis Xavier (show Father John Brown). \n\nIncorruptibility is currently in the limelight after the recent exhumed Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster in Missouri, in the United States. \n\nBut is anything supernatural happening here? Are the laws of Nature being suspended at all? If you know me, you’ll know that I don’t think that the laws of nature have ever been suspended, so… I don’t think so, no. Let’s talk about why I think that. \n\nAnd no, this is not a \"INCORRUPT BODIES DEBUNKED\" video, but this video should give the viewer reason to think that perhaps the Laws of Nature haven't been circumvented in the cases of the Incorrupt Bodies of Saints... and it seems like the Catholic Church already agrees. \n\n\nChapters: \n0:00 Intro \n1:10 Incorruptibility Pre-20th Century \n4:43 Incorruptibility In and Post-20th Century \n11:45 The Science of Incorruptibility\n15:11 Motivation for Creating Incorrupt Bodies\n16:33 Outro\n\nWorks Cited: \n\nThe Life of St Margaret of Cortona, 1888 \nhttps://ia800905.us.archive.org/23/items/thelifeofsaintma00giovuoft/thelifeofsaintma00giovuoft.pdf\n\nThe Incorruptibles, from Discover Magazine, June 2001 \nhttps://archive.ph/20010610014402/http://www.discover.com/june_01/featsaints.html#selection-661.741-661.1091\n\nCatholic News Agency Article on Incoruptibiltiy\nhttps://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254416/what-is-incorruptibility-here-s-what-you-need-to-know\n\nHow religious pilgrimages support a multi-billion dollar industry\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-religious-pilgrimages-support-multi-billion-dollar-industry-flna1b6065909\n\nDe Cadaverum Incorruptione\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=Hflhj2XR4JwC&pg=PR3&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false",

For tomorrow I shall forsake you, godless and impious that ye are, and fly up unto God whose Power I am, though I am become weak. Whereas, then, ye have fallen, I am He that standeth, and I shall go up to my Father and say unto him: Me also, even thy son that standeth, have they desired to pull down; but I consented not unto them, and am returned back unto myself.\"\nAnd already on the morrow ... [Simon the Magician] amazed the multitudes by flying...\n[Then Simon the Magician said to Simon Peter] \"Peter, at this time when I am going up before all this people that behold me, I say unto thee: If thy God is able, whom the Jews put to death, and stoned you that were chosen of him, let him show that faith in him is faith in God, and let it appear at this time, if it be worthy of God. For I, ascending up, will show myself unto all this multitude, who I am.\" And behold when he was lifted up on high, and all beheld him raised up above all Rome and the temples thereof and the mountains, the faithful looked toward Peter. And Peter seeing the strangeness of the sight cried unto the Lord Jesus Christ: \"If thou suffer this man to accomplish that which he hath set about, now will all they that have believed on thee be offended, and the signs and wonders which thou hast given them through me will not be believed: hasten thy grace, O Lord, and let him fall from the height and be disabled; and let him not die but be brought to nought, and break his leg in three places.\" And he fell from the height and brake his leg in three places...\nBut Simon in his affliction found some to carry him by night on a bed from Rome unto Aricia; and he abode there a space, and was brought thence unto Terracina to one Castor that was banished from Rome upon an accusation of sorcery. And there he was sorely cut (Lat. by two physicians), and so Simon the angel of Satan came to his end.\n\nTerulian’s Scorpion, Chapter 15, says that Peter was martyred in Rome under the reign of Nero \nEarly Third Century \nhttps://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0318.htm\n\nPrescription Against Heretics, Tertulian, Chapter 36\nEarly Third Century \nhttps://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm\n\nAgainst Heresies, Iraneus, Book 3, Chapter 1 \nLate Second Century (~120 years after the death of Peter) \nhttps://files.romanroadsstatic.com/materials/romans/early-christianity/IrenaeusV1-0.pdf\n\nSt. Peter in Rome and His Tomb on the Vatican Hill, Swan Sonnenschein & Co., London, 1900\n Barnes, Arthur Staplyton. \nhttps://archive.org/stream/stpeterinromehis00barn#page/n7/mode/2up\n\nTHE REMAINS OF PETER\nby Margherita Guarducci\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090507135933/http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Docs/RemainsofPeter.htm\n\nPaul VI’s UDIENZA GENERALE\nhttps://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/audiences/1968/documents/hf_p-vi_aud_19680626.html\n\nThe Independent: Are they relics of St Peter?

Huge thank you to Suan Sonna (https://www.youtube.com/@intellectualcatholicism) for coming on, and please do go subscribe to Suan if you have not done so already! \n\nIn this episode, we talk about religion, myth and fiction, and how humans might truly need at least one of these to avoid the crushing absurdity of life.

    "description": "I spend the first half of the video trying to be as impartial as possible, laying out all pertinent facts with quotes about slavery from Church Councils, Papal Bulls, Moto Proprios, and Doctors of the Church. Then, I offer a brief critique of Chapter 8 of \"Bearing False Witness: Debunking Centuries of Anti-Catholic History\" by Rodney Stark. After that, I do offer my own opinion about the Church's stance on slavery. Hopefully you'll come away from this video thinking that I was fair and level headed about this topic. And I didn't mention this explicity in the video (I hope you could gather this much) but I obviously commend the Church's current stance that slavery is always wrong. I denounce the earlier Church Councils for teaching that it was permissible to take slaves, of any nature. There is no such thing as a \"well-treated slave\", and the modern Church knows this, but the ancient Church did not. \n\nAlso, lets play \"Name that song\". Can you tell what the melody is in the intro / outro song? I actually dropped a massive hint somewhere in the video... Let's see if anyone gets it. \n\nWorks Cited: \n\nTraditional Doctrine on Slavery, from the Traditional Catholic Subreddit \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalCatholics/comments/sw4yoe/traditional_doctrine_on_slavery/\n\nSlavery in the Writings of Thomas Aquinas, 2011 \nhttps://www.sju.ca/sites/default/files/HEADLEY_2012_Ralph%20Neill.pdf\n\nBearing False Witness: Debunking Centuries of Anti-Catholic History\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Bearing-False-Witness-Debunking-Anti-Catholic/dp/1599474999\n\nThat spreadsheet that I put together, with links to each individual source: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ev0pTXfUkl-KbidF3tMpNjw1XcYqgXU-xy5IiH6a20s/edit?usp=sharing\n\nChapters: \n0:00 - Introduction \n0:13 - Brief Discussion about my Sources \n1:47 - The Data on the Church's stance on Slavery \n8:45 - Critique of \"Bearing False Witness\"  #1: Its still an apologetic work \n10:50 - Critique of \"Bearing False Witness\"  #2: Its too kind to Aquinas \n14:41 - My own opinion on the Church's stance on Slavery (for whatever my opinion is worth) \n15:47 - Conclusion",

I have \"rebuttal rebuttals\" to the rebuttals of my positions THAT I KNOW OF, but there is just so much literature out there on the Shroud that there are undoubtedly rebuttals to my positions that I do NOT know of.

    "description": "Hello friends, \n\nThis is a third video about the James, the brother of the Lord, and possibly the last one that I will make on this topic, at least for now. In this video, I question my prior assumption that there are only two James (Jameses? Jamesi?) in the New Testament - James the Greater and James the Less. What if James the Less is not actually James the Son of Alphaeus? Why isn't James the Just ever mentioned in the New Testament? And wait, James son of Zebedeee is never called James the Greater?? I am so confused. \n\nChapters \n0:00 Introduction \n0:56 Hacking into the Vatican Website to gain secret knowledge \n1:50 Combining and removing the various titles of James the Greater \n4:53 Combining the various titles of the non-Greater Jameses \n7:26 Collapsing all titles into only two Jameses \n8:08 St. Jerome backs me up \n9:20 The Argument from the Brother of Matthew \n11:57 The Argument from Uncertainty \n13:50 St. Jerome's Butt \n13:51 Combining Names to protect the Perpetual Virginity of Mary \n14:16 Does any of this even matter? \n15:15 Closing Thoughts \n16:36 Blooper",

I discuss a possible Thomistic interpretation of beauty, which a redditor on the \"Debate a Catholic\" subreddit postulated as the Bishop's real meaning, but I also discuss how I cannot really understand that meaning either. \n\nAnd yes, I know that the Bishop doesn't think I am colossally stupid :) When I was in the middle of my deconstruction, I actually called into ... Catholic Answers? I think? ... when the Bishop was on.

New Glof disagrees, and we discuss faith, reason, intellectualism, anti-intellectualism, and more. \n\nI hope to make this a series, in which I converse with Catholics, as part of my \"due diligence\" on the Catholic Church. If I claim to be an ex-Catholic, I should be sure that I actually disagree with the real positions of the Church, and not any strawmen positions that the Church does not hold. And I cannot think of a better way for me to do my due diligence than to hold long-form conversations with practicing Catholics and really dig deep into my various hang-ups with the Church. \n\nIf you're a Catholic, reach out!
