We unpack his argument from the ground up, exploring how purification after death might fit within a Protestant framework. Whether you’re Catholic, Protestant, or just curious about the theology of the afterlife, this conversation will challenge your assumptions.\n\n📄 Read Dr. Thurow’s full paper: “Atoning in Purgatory” (linked below)\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/26338780\n\nLink to FREE CAREER MENTORSHIP:\nhttps://bit.ly/3YEziAz\n\nPlease consider becoming a patron.

    "description": "This video features an in-depth discussion led by a professional epistemologist, Dr. Kevin McCain, on the topic of skepticism, particularly external world skepticism initiated by Rene Descartes' idea of being deceived by an evil demon. The conversation delves into philosophical skepticism, its implications, and different responses to skepticism including reliabilism, sensitivity accounts, contextualism, the Moorean approach, hinge propositions, and inference to the best explanation, with a particular focus on demonstrating why the external world hypothesis is superior to skeptical alternatives like Descartes' Demon. The dialogue concludes by addressing four objections to the inference to the best explanation response.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:55 What is Skepticism?\n02:03 Why Should We Care About Skeptical Scenarios?\n05:12 Explaining Descartes' Demon Thought Experiment\n08:26 Seven Responses to Descartes' Demon\n19:35 Inference to the Best Explanation Response\n24:27 Addressing Four Objections to Inference to the Best Explanation\n40:21 Concluding Thoughts and Further Resources\n\nFor Dr. McCain's book \"Evidentialism & Epistemic Justification\" click the link below.\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Evidentialism-and-Epistemic-Justification/McCain/p/book/9781138657335\n\nFor Dr. McCain's book \"Epistemology: 50 Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Thought Experiments\" click the link below.\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Epistemology-50-Puzzles-Paradoxes-and-Thought-Experiments/McCain/p/book/9780367638726",

    "title": "Is Living A Sinless Life Possible Apart from God’s Grace? (Dr. Daniel Speak)",
    "description": "In this Ask A Scholar Video Dr. Daniel Speak answers the following question. \n\"It seems like there is a tension between some Christian doctrines and libertarian freedom. If humans have libertarian freedom (in the leeway sense), isn’t it possible for humans to live a sinless life? If the answer is yes, doesn’t that lead to pelagianism? If the answer is no, why not? One might say ‘because we have a certain character that limits the range of options we have to choose from.’ But there’s a problem with this response. Either we ultimately get to choose our characters or we do not ultimately get to choose our characters. If we ultimately get to choose our characters, then it seems like we could have chosen characters such that we always had the option to refrain from sinning. But if that’s the case, then we run back into the original worry about pelagianism. On the other hand, if we do not ultimately get to choose our own characters, then how am I morally responsible for sinning due to a character that I did not get to choose?”\n\nDr. Speak is a professor of philosophy at Loyola Marymount University.

Non-Local Corporealism which denies claim (3)\n\n01:02:46 Concise summary of the problem of the ascension and the non-local corporealist solution to the problem\n\n01:03:57 Question from Jamie Russell: How much sense, if any, does it have to make to the original audience?\n\n01:05:38 Question by Justin Mooney: How about responding to the Pelagian worry by saying that being in a certain location is necessary, but not sufficient for being in heaven?\n\n01:06:57 Question by Kito: Does the hyperspace solution face the technology objection?  In principle, we could travel the extra spatial dimension(s).  Seems like any locationalism solution faces the objection. \n\n01:07:38 Question from Hayden Stephan\n\n01:08:24 Question from Joseph Aggs: Could the hyperspace theory address trinitarian puzzles?  Like the persons of God exist in three dimensions but are Unitarian in nature?\n\nCruz Davis is a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In a forthcoming paper he presents the \"Problem of the Ascension of Jesus\" and then evaluates various solutions. Here are some of the questions we'll be discussing. If Jesus was *physically* raised from the dead, where is his body now?  If you say it's in heaven, does that mean heaven has a spatial location? If yes, does that mean it's theoretically possible to reach heaven if we just had enough advanced technology? If no, then how can Jesus have a physical resurrection body?\r\n\r\nFor more from Cruz Davis, check out his philpapers page linked below.\r\nhttps://philpeople.org/profiles/cruz-davis-1/publications?app=530&order=added\r\n\r\nPlease consider becoming a patron.

For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\" \n\nDoes this text mean every single non-believer is resistant in their non-belief?

There’s a sorties series from no change between pre and post disassembly watch (same parts and arrangement) to lots of change between pre and post resurrection person (different parts and arrangement).  Suppose there’s no sharp cut-off or vagueness in the sorites series.  Since watches can survive dis/reassembly, it follows that persons can be resurrected. \n\n55:03 Question #2 – Does your model assume that a particle’s history can be tracked? That it is possible to give to a particle a name X and track the entire history of where X was?\n\nScripture teaches that there will be a general resurrection of the dead.

What are some reasons to think “yes?” What are some reasons to think “no”?\n\n13:51 Five models of the resurrection of the dead\n\n14:18 What is the resurrection by reassembly model?\n\n23:08 What is the body snatching model?\n\n28:14 What is the falling elevator model?\n\n36:21 What is anti-criterialism account?\n\n43:16 What is the hypertime model?\n\n50:15 Comment #1: Going back to the point about Christ’s resurrection as a model of ours, Christ’s resurrection wasn’t hyper-temporal. \n\n52:44 How would you like to conclude our discussion?\n\n56:53 Question #1: Tangential, but 1 Cor 15:38-40 suggests that every human (righteous or not) is going to receive an imperishable body by virtue of belonging to humankind.  Does that contradict annihilationism?\n\n\n\nTraditional Christianity teaches that when Christ returns, our bodies will be raised from the dead. But how is resurrection of the same body even possible? In this interview with Dr. Eric Yang, we discuss several models of resurrection including:\n\n- resurrection by reassembly\n- body-snatching view\n- falling-elevator account\n- anti-criterialism\n- hypertime account\n\nFor more, check out Chapter 6 of Dr. Yang's book, \"An Introduction to Christian Philosophical Theology\" linked below.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Christian-Philosophical-Theology-Understanding-ebook/dp/B085XNGFF3/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2ZG3GXO6PY688&keywords=an+introduction+to+christian+philosophical+theology&qid=1646530625&sprefix=an+introduction+to+christian+philosoph%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-2\n\nPlease consider becoming a patron.

    "description": "0:00 Introduction\n\n00:44 How did you get interested in the Argument from Miracles?\n\n03:24 What do the terms “De Rei” and “De Dicto” mean?\n\n04:45 What do you aim to show in this paper? Answer: Try to show there is a solid argument that gives you some rational reason to believe not only that God exists but the God of the Bible exists.  It’s based of the reports of miracles that I think are actually believable. \n\n14:47 What do you mean by miracle?\n\n20:12 How does Hume define miracle and what is the problem with his definition?\n\n25:10 Can you walk us through your version of the Argument for Miracles and offer a defense of each premise?\n\n32:11 How would you defend premise 3?\n\n42:40 What would be a good example of multiple witnesses and occurring in a series to illustrate premise 2?\n\n50:50 Some argue that the resurrection can be explained by the following scenario: someone stole Jesus’ body and then Mary and other disciples hallucinated Him rising from the dead. How do you respond to this type of explanation for the resurrection?\n\n55:09 With the criteria of multiple witnesses and occurring in a series, the response can go beyond the case that both scenarios are very unlikely.  Please comment.\n\n56:17 Even if God raised Jesus from the dead, what follows from that?  Is it even particular to Christianity alone, or can other religions concede that God rose Jesus from the dead?\n\n01:01:41 Question #1: How many cats does Dr. Bonevac have now?\n\n01:02:50 Question #2: Suppose someone's life depended on a flipped coin landing heads and I prayed that God would ensure the coin lands heads. Suppose further that God answered the prayer. Was this a miracle?\n\n01:06:10 Can you summarize the Argument from Miracles in 60 seconds?\n\n01:07:32 Follow-up to Question #2: So not every supernatural intervention is a miracle then...\n\nI'm joined by Dr. Daniel Bonevac (professor of philosophy at the University of Texas Austin) to discuss his paper, \"The Argument from Miracles.\" The paper is linked below.\r\n\r\nbaylor.edu/content/services/document.php/80295.pdf\r\n\r\nPlease consider supporting me on patreon.

Greetings from Brazil!\n\n49:50 Question #1 follow-up: Does the argument presuppose correspondence theory of truth?\n\n50:20  Question #2: Dr. Moon, do you think that if the probability of our cognitive faculties being reliable is inscrutable, the argument would still work?\n\n52:44 Question #3: What is the conditional objection aka objection 3?\n\n57:43 Question #4: What do you say about Richard Swinburne’s objections to Plantinga’s argument?\n\n58:31 Question #5: Are there any books or resources to learn about the discussion of mind/soul, neuroscience and materialism that you’d recommend to mortals like me?\n\n59:47 Question #6: Could a bias towards simplicity solve the problem? A possible world where belief contents are randomly associated with neurological states (i.e. if you change a single, or a single atom in a neuron or environment, you don’t automatically generate a random belief).\n\n01:04:34 Question #7: Does this argument work the same if someone holds to dualism, idealism or Thomism?\n\n01:07:04 Question #8: Why do the content propositions need to be selected for because of their true in order for the cognitive faculties to be reliable?  Isn’t it enough that they supervene on things which are selected for?\n\n01:08:38 Question #9: Do you think evolutionary debunking arguments against moral realism that presupposes naturalism has a self-defeating argument?\n\n01:10:24 Question #10: Does Plantinga think that we are left with a certain choice to make in rejecting either naturalism, evolution or both?\n\n01:11:52 Question #11: What do you think of the following argument? 1. Our cognitive faculties are generally unreliable. 2. (1) is more expected given Naturalism rather than Theism. 3.

Why did you pick out these three premises to defend?\n\n28:41 How do you defend Premise 2 of the Positive Argument (Classical theism provides a good explanation of History)?\n\n34:51 Explain how you defend Premise 2 (Naturalism cannot explain History)\n\n37:35 How did Prof. Oppy object to your argument in defense of Premise 2 (Naturalism cannot explain history)?\n\n43:22 What was Prof. Oppy’s second reply?\n\n44:55 How would you like to conclude this discussion?\n\n45:56 Question #1: Prof. Pearce says God sustains God’s act of creation by performing it, just like a dancer sustains a dance by performing it, but even if the performance grounds rather than causes the dance, isn’t the performance itself a series of causes and effects.  If the same is true of God’s performance, this introduces causation into God’s creative activity. \n\nDr. Kenneth Pearce is a professor of philosophy at Trinity College in Dublin.

    "description": "0:00 Introduction\n\n01:10 What is the evidential argument from evil?\n\n07:33 How does the skeptical theist respond to this argument?\n\n12:55 What are some challenges to skeptical theism?\n\n15:41 What do you try to show in this paper? Answer: Hopefully use the theoretical goods of skeptical theism to respond to the problem of evil but at the same time not letting in all these other forms of skepticism\n\n17:22 Negative skeptical theism\n\n19:04 Positive skeptical theism\n\n21:10 Similarity between positive and negative skeptical theism\n\n21:23 Difference between positive and negative skeptical theism\n\n22:30 Can you elaborate a bit on Bergmann’s negative skeptical theism view?\n\n26:43 Recap the positive skeptical theism view\n\n28:51 What are two second-order reasons God may have for creating a world with seemingly gratuitous evils?\n\n29:05 First second-order reason: epistemic distance\n\n32:19 Second second-order reason: this world allows humans to bring about the greatest acts of love and compassion\n\n41:53 Challenge to the second second-order reason: if someone believes no evil is truly gratuitous due to skeptical theism, does it remove the motivation for that person to intervene in evil to show love and compassion\n\n45:17 Why do you think positive skeptical theism is the better account?\n\n52:44 The Bayesian Comparison between Positive and Negative Skeptical Theism\n\n59:40 How would you like to conclude this discussion?\n\nA common objection to skeptical theism is that if applied consistently it leads one to be skeptical of things we do in fact know about the external world and morality. In this interview, Dr. John DePoe describes two types of skeptical theism- positive vs. negative, and argues that positive skeptical theism avoids this worry.\n\nFor more, check out Dr. John DePoe's paper on the topic linked below.\nhttps://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxqb2huZGVwb2V8Z3g6MzIyYTc3NjY5NWM1M2NhNw\n\nPlease consider becoming one of my patrons.

If P1 and I am free not to raise my hand at t, then it is my power to do something such that, were I to do it, either (i) God would have had at least one different belief 1,000 years ago, or (ii) God would have had at least one false belief 1,000 years ago.\n3. It is not in my power to do something such that, were I to do it, (i) God would have had at least one different belief 1,000 years ago, or (ii) God would have had at least one false belief 1,000 years ago. \n4. Therefore, I am not free to raise my hand at t.\n\nTo explore this argument in more depth, check out the argument map I've created linked below, as well as the link to my interview with Dr. Taylor Cyr.\nhttps://youtu.be/_XoVp1tKrGU\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-tIBA0FP8CiWmchH8zLW0CvHrgr2ri_q1bRk4XMGSEI/present?fbclid=IwAR2WjpsfsLwtAw3wrJEWL2PrRvVo5slsByJobHIVxfqqOLRcRyM8U8sN30o&slide=id.gf0115c6564_0_161\n\n\nPlease consider becoming one of my patrons.

    "description": "Many believe that life in heaven will be characterized by perfect joy. One common objection to this view is that if anyone will be suffering in hell, then the inhabitants of heaven either will experience certain negative emotions about those in hell, thus rendering their heavenly joy imperfect, or they won’t, thus revealing them to be unloving or otherwise deficient. In this interview Dr. Adam Pelser argues that it is plausible that the inhabitants of heaven will experience some negative emotions—for example, heavenly sadness—about the suffering of those in hell and about past evils, without such emotions undermining their perfect heavenly joy.\n\nI did a previous interview on this topic with Dr. Eric Yang, where he outlined four alternative solutions to this problem. You can check it out here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbl7xxXzxs\n\nDr. Pelser is Professor of Philosophy at the U.S. Air Force Academy.

Passages like Deuteronomy 7, 20, and Joshua 1-12 that portray God as commanding and aiding the Israelites to brutally annihilate the Canaanites, young and old, men and women. Dr. Randal Rauser recently authored what I consider to be the best book on this topic, \"Jesus Loves Canaanites\".

    "description": "This week's question was, \"I have a concern with Phenomenal Conservatism (PC). This concern is meta-justificatory. I’m not sure that seemings are capable of conferring justification. This is due to the fact that, by PC's own admission, they only confer prima facie justifcation meaning that they do not necessarily connect with truth. Something could seem to be true and yet fail to be true. But, if that is the case, then why think that they usually connect with truth? Why think that they ever do? You can't appeal to the fact that it seems that seemings usually connect to truth on pain of circularity. But then what is the justification for thinking that a seeming is an indication of truth?”\n\nDr. Chris Tucker is a professor of philosophy at William & Mary.

    "description": "I'm joined by emeritus professor of philosophy, Dr. Stephen T. Davis to offer a defense of kenotic christology. The core idea of kenotic christology is that in the incarnation,  Jesus Christ \"emptied himself\" (Phil 2:7)  by temporarily giving up those divine properties that are inconsistent with being truly human while retaining sufficient divine properties to remain truly divine. In this interview, Dr. Davis will lay out some of the metaphysics behind this view, biblical support for it, and he'll respond to four of the most common objections. \n\nTo explore this topic in more detail, check out Dr. Davis' chapter, \"The metaphysics of kenosis\" in the book, The Metaphysics of Incarnation linked below.\nhttps://bit.ly/metaphysicsofincarnation\n\nPlease consider supporting me on Patreon.

Andrew will then explain how such a proposition plays a key role in his argument that religious believers can permissibly wield an epistemically circular argument in response to certain debunking arguments.\n\nCheck out my previous interview with Andrew arguing that Christian belief can be properly basic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOCbOx9-QTQ\n\nCheck out Andrew's paper on the topic.\nhttps://philpapers.org/rec/MOOCAQ\n\nPlease consider becoming one of my patrons.

When playing defense, one tries to show that criticisms of the view do not succeed, while criticisms of alternative positions do succeed. This could be called, \"The Argument from Elimination.\" When playing offense, one tries to give positive reasons in favor of moral realism. In this interview, Dr. Eric Sampson will  play offense by providing four arguments in support of moral realism.\n\nHere is the google doc used in our discussion.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBPYK_UHOoQhEKjR1URok4tO_tXgqCY5wy5pyFzSZDk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFor more on Dr. Sampson, check out his website.\nhttp://www.erictsampson.com/\n\nIf you value the work I'm doing, please consider becoming a patron.

    "description": "This week's question was, \"Is most theology pure speculation? When we engage in debates on various issues such as the free will defense against the argument from evil, the possible reasons behind divine Hiddenness, or if God can change his mind; all of this is extra-biblical. The Bible is kind of thin when it comes to a lot of theological questions. It’s got the basics covered, but beyond that we’re on our own. If the canon is closed and we can’t expect further revelation, is such speculation ultimately pointless since we’ll never get answers in this life?\"\n\nCheck out my previous videos with Dr. Mullins listed below:\nInterview on God & Time: https://youtu.be/7xeRN9-9PTE\nInterview on God's Attributes: https://youtu.be/c6ufqQiTnf0\n\nCheck out Dr. Mullins website & podcast\nhttps://www.rtmullins.com/\n\nIf you want to participate in \"Ask a Scholar\" go to https://www.patreon.com/ccapologetics.",

    "description": "00:00-3:22 Introduction\n3:23-4:43 what do we mean by ‘God’?\n4:44-5:55 what is it for God to be eternal?\n5:55-7:00 what is it for God to be essentially omniscient?\n7:01-9:00 what is free will?\n9:01-9:43 What’s the general idea about why free will and divine foreknowledge are incompatible?\n9:43-12:09 What is the main argument for the incompatibility of free will and divine foreknowledge?\n12:10-12:56 What is it to have a choice about something?\n12:57-14:07 How does the main argument generalize to other actions?\n14:07-17:13 Is the argument valid?  What is validity?\n17:14-18:34 Is the premise plausible that we don’t have a choice about what God believes a thousand years ago?  What is the fixity of the past?\n18:35-19:57 Does the argument involve backward causation?\n19:57-22:00 Is the second premise (that God’s believing X will occur entails that X will occur) of the main argument plausible? \n22:01-25:35 Can we say that since human foreknowledge allows free will, so does divine free will?  How are human foreknowledge and divine foreknowledge different?\n25:35-29:45 Why isn’t Molinism a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge and free will?\n29:46-30:43 What are, broadly, the compatibilist and incompatibilist responses to the main argument?\n30:44-31:32 How are the terms ‘compatibilism’ and incompatibilism’ used in different ways?\n31:33-34:09 What is the timelessness response to the main argument?\n34:10-36:45 Why does the timelessness response not sufficiently deal with the puzzle?  How can we revise the main argument to avoid the timelessness response?\n36:45-38:52 How is there an analogue of the fixity of the past principle in a revised version of the main argument (designed to deal with the timelessness response?)\n38:52-43:00 What is Ockhamism?  What is the difference between hard and soft facts?\n43:01-44:20 How does Ockhamism apply to the main argument?\n44:21-48:08 What is the first problem with the Ockhamist response?  \n48:09-50:28 What is the second problem with the Ockhamist response?\n50:28-55:58 What is the Dependence view?\n55:59-59:29 What is an objection to the Dependence view?\n59:30-59:46 What are the incompatibilist responses?\n59:47-1:02:06 What is open theism?\n1:02:07-1:04:10 Which premise does the open theist attack?\n1:04:11-1:05:24 How is free will relevant to the problem of evil?\n1:05:25-1:06:35 Does the open theist give up the view that God is omniscient?\n1:06:35-1:08:35 What are the two versions of open theism: open futurism and limited foreknowledge?\n1:08:36-1:10:54 Does God have a mechanism for knowing?  How does God know what he knows?\n1:10:55-1:12:56 What are some objections to open theism?\n1:12:57-1:14:30 What is the semi-compatibilism?\n1:14:30-1:18:30 What are Frankfurt counterexamples and how do they support semi-compatibilism?\n1:18:31-1:20:52 What is PAP (the principle of alternative possibilities)?\n1:20:53-1:23:30 What is an objection to semi-compatibilism?\n1:23:30-1:27:00 What’s an overall summary of the discussion?\n1:27:01-1:27:37 Why do Dr. Cyr and Jordan Hampton look like nemeses?\n1:27:38-1:34:07 Does God have the ability to do otherwise?\n1:34:08-1:37:35 Why do you prefer semi-compatibilism to source libertarianism?\n1:37:36-1:40:11 If God knows the future, then can God be free?\n1:40:12-1:41:58 How, on Molinism, can there be alternate possibilities in specific circumstances?\n1:41:59-1:45:27 Why not be a presentist?  Doesn’t eternalism lead to a weird view of persons?\n1:45:27-1:49:01 Is Dr. Cyr reformed?\n\n\nTheists are faced with a puzzle. If God's foreknows that I will do something  before I do it, then is it the case that I must do that thing? And If I must do that thing, am I really free? \n\nIn this interview, Dr. Taylor Cyr (pronounced \"seer\") joins me to discuss various solutions to this puzzle. He is a philosophy professor at Samford University. For more information, check out his website linked below.\n\nhttps://taylorwcyr.com/",

These individuals lived a devout Christian life at great cost. Despite the losses, their lives were enriched, and enriched many others. After hearing these stories, I suspect you will feel inspired to live a life like that, showing that a life of Christian commitment is desirable.\n\nWe wrap up by saying that if Christianity is both reasonable (as videos 5-11 demonstrated) and desirable (as this video demonstrated) then one should take the Wager (as videos 1-4 demonstrated). Rota then lays out some specific practical steps if you decide to take the Wager.\n\nLink to Rota's book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Taking-Pascals-Wager-Evidence-Abundant/dp/0830851364/ref=sr_1_1?crid=10OXLLAZ5ON4O&dchild=1&keywords=taking+pascal%27s+wager+faith%2C+evidence+and+the+abundant+life&qid=1591038111&sprefix=taking+pascal%27s+wager%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-1\n\nLink to the playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVH-ThCazKlqtTVa-3hvKfBXy5LajVsw",

    "description": "In a recent debate on Capturing Christianity's YouTube Channel (see the link below) Alex O'Connor made several objections to Liz Jackson's updated version of Pascal's Wager. His major objection though, was  that Liz's version of the Wager faces a serious dilemma. EITHER she must accept her intuition and give up the use of infinity in her decision matrix, OR accept the use of infinity in her decision matrix, and give up her intuition. Both alternatives end in failure.\n\nLiz and I discuss this objection in detail, and comment on some of the other objections Alex raised as well.\n\nLink to the Original Debate:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv4jE2TUEGY&t=1439s",

I then present the updated argument, along with some helpful ways of illustrating it in conversation. We then answer some popular objections at the end of the program. The conversation actually begins at 4:30\n\n After the show he invited me to begin blogging for Apologetics 315 on Wednesdays. My first two posts give a simple, easy to remember way of presenting Pascal's Wager in conversation.

    "description": "In this video I explain what Fine-Tuning means and how it points to God. This argument is different from other arguments from Fine-Tuning in that it uses Bayes' Theorem to weigh the evidence. By the end you see that even if you think there probably isn't a God, once you factor in the fine-tuning evidence, the probability of a necessary being who designed the universe for life is really high. The argument presented in the video is a summary from Michael Rota's book, \"Taking Pascal's Wager\" pages 99-124.\n\nHere is the link to Rota's book: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Taking-Pascals-Wager-Evidence-Abundant/dp/0830851364/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=taking+pascal%27s+wager&qid=1567205815&s=gateway&sr=8-1 \n\nCheck out more videos in this playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVH-ThCazKlqtTVa-3hvKfBXy5LajVsw\n\nMusic https://www.bensound.com",
