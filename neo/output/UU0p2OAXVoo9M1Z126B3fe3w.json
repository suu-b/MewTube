    "description": "Was Jesus really born in Bethlehem, or did the gospel writers “invent” the story to fit prophecy? Did a Roman census ever force people to travel back to their ancestral towns? And what about Herod’s massacre of the innocents – pure theology, or plausible history?\nIn this special Advent episode of Ask NT Wright Anything, Tom Wright and Mike Bird respond to challenges raised by historian Tom Holland (of The Rest Is History podcast) about the birth narratives of Jesus. \n\nTom explains why ancient history is full of gaps, how new evidence has repeatedly vindicated biblical details once dismissed as “unhistorical,” and why we should be cautious about confidently declaring, “That could never have happened.”\n\nThey dig into the census in Luke 2, the translation of the key verse about Quirinius, whether we can trust Matthew’s account of Herod and the infants, and why early Christians didn’t simply manufacture stories to “fit” Old Testament prophecy. Along the way, Tom reflects on the place of the virgin conception, why the resurrection is even more central, and how we can hold together faith, history and humility when we read the Christmas stories.\n\n🎧 If you’ve ever wondered, “Did Luke get Christmas wrong?” or felt unsettled by historical objections to the nativity, this episode will help you think more clearly – without losing the wonder.\n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

    "description": "In this live edition of Premier Unbelievable? from Aylesbury High School, stand-in host Sam McKee moderates a thought-provoking dialogue between:\n\nCaleb Woodbridge – Christian writer, editor and cultural apologist\nJohn Richards – President of Atheism UK\n\nTogether they wrestle with questions of meaning, value, morality, evolution, human rights, animal ethics, suffering and religion as comfort. Is “ultimate meaning” even a coherent idea? If morality evolved, can we still say some values are better than others?\n\n⏱️ Chapters \n00:00 – Welcome from Aylesbury High School & introductions\n01:28 – What do we mean by “ultimate meaning”?\n05:00 – Is meaning just human-made value?\n08:30 – Do we need a “meaning-giver” beyond ourselves?\n12:00 – Human rights, slavery & objective moral values\n16:00 – Evolution, empathy and why we care about others\n20:00 – Are Christians responsible for moral progress… or atrocities?\n24:00 – Animal rights, human rights & species loyalty\n28:00 – Can we rank values as “better” or “more civilised”?\n31:00 – When life collapses: is turning to God illusion or contact with reality?\n35:00 – Does God communicate clearly? Scripture, culture and interpretation\n39:00 – Thousands of religions: why think the Christian God gives true meaning?\n43:00 – Audience Q&A and closing reflections\n\nThis episode asks whether our deepest experiences of love, beauty, justice and purpose are just products of nature, or signposts to a transcendent source of meaning.\n\nCan atheism justify calling some values “better” or “more humane”? Does Christian belief offer real contact with ultimate reality, or just a comforting story?\n\nIf you’re interested in atheism vs Christianity, meaning of life, and where morality comes from, this conversation is for you.\n\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://www.premier.plus/unbelievable\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "Do ordained ministers have “more” of the Holy Spirit than lay people? What exactly was John the Baptist doing when he baptised Jews before Jesus’ ministry began? And are the Thirty-Nine Articles still fit for purpose today?\n\nTom Wright and Mike Bird tackle three questions that sit at the heart of church life, theology, and Christian identity in today's episode of Ask NT Wright Anything.\n\nTom explains why ordination is not about spiritual hierarchy but authorised service, why the Holy Spirit belongs fully to the whole people of God, and how clergy exist to equip, not outrank, the church. He then situates John the Baptist firmly within Israel’s story of exile and hope, showing how baptism functioned as a powerful symbol of repentance and new Exodus rather than an early version of Christian conversion. Finally, Tom reflects candidly on the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England: why they were written, what they were trying to hold together, and why many of their answers belong to 16th-century debates rather than today’s questions.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Tom calls the church back to Scripture as the supreme authority, urges humility toward our theological inheritance, and reminds us that reform is not rejection—but faithful listening across time.\n\nQ1 01:43      Do Clergy Have More of the Holy Spirit?\nQ2 12:28    What exactly was John the Baptist doing when he baptised Jews before Jesus’ ministry began?         \nQ3 18:31      Are the Thirty-Nine Articles still fit for purpose today?\n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

And what does it really mean to say that Christ is “present” in the Eucharist?\n\nToday, Tom Wright and Mike Bird dive in on Ask NT Wright Anything to answer your three challenging and deeply human questions about law, holiness, and sacrament. Tom explores how Israel’s legal codes functioned within their ancient social world, how Jesus radically reframes judgment and mercy, and why Christians no longer apply Old Testament penalties in the same way. He then reflects on the Nazirite vow as an ancient form of radical consecration, an Israelite counterpart to later monastic devotion. \n\nThroughout, Tom insists that Scripture must be read as a coherent story rather than isolated proof texts, and that Christian faith is shaped not by abstract theories but by lived practices: meals, vows, forgiveness, and embodied worship.\n\nQ1  00:44  What should I make of the lack of consequence for the men involved in adultery, compared to the public humiliation of women, via the cursed water, whether they did it or not?\nQ2  01:10  Why would anyone choose to be a Nazarite?

    "description": "Where is the Garden of Eden? What did Paul mean by our “earthly tent”? And does Genesis contain later edits, and if so, does that undermine Scripture? In this episode of Ask NT Wright Anything, Tom Wright and Mike Bird tackle three of the most frequently misunderstood biblical questions.\n\nTom explains why Paul’s language in 2 Corinthians 5 isn’t Platonic escapism but robust resurrection hope; why the “tent” points both to the tabernacle and to our mortal bodies; and how the early Christians understood “what is kept in heaven” as something destined ultimately for earth.\n\nNext, they turn to the location of Eden, and Tom challenges the assumption that Genesis 2 must read like Google Maps. They explore how ancient narrative works, what editing does (and does not) mean for inspiration, and why Genesis 1–2 gives us two complementary windows into creation, not a modern-style chronology.\n\nQ1  02:08    In 2 Corinthians 5:1 Paul writes about the 'Earthly Tent' - what is Paul actually describing? Is this an intermediate state?\nQ2: 11:28     In Genesis 2 we see the location of Eden - but where is Eden actually? Was this passage edited later in history and if so, how does this affect reading and accuracy of Scripture?\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered whether Genesis has contradictions, whether Paul believed in an intermediate state, or whether Scripture’s “oddities” weaken its authority, this episode will steady the ground beneath your feet, and deepen your appreciation for the beauty, richness, and layered texture of the biblical story.\n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

    "description": "Demonic activity in the New Testament, the surprising rise of “high church” worship, and whether Christians should be keeping Saturday as the Sabbath…\nThis week on Ask NT Wright Anything, Tom and Mike tackle three big and very different questions. \nFirst: Did Jesus’ arrival trigger a surge in demonic activity, and should Christians today expect to encounter the demonic? Tom draws on decades of pastoral experience (including licensed diocesan exorcists!) to explain how the New Testament frames dark spiritual powers and why neither fear nor fascination is the right Christian response.\n\nNext, they explore why so many young Christians are moving toward “high church” traditions—liturgy, sacrament, structure, and beauty, and how to discern wisely between Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, and low-church evangelical expressions.\n\nFinally, Tom unpacks the Sabbath controversy: If the Bible commands Sabbath on the seventh day, why do Christians worship on Sunday? What changed between the Old and New Testaments? And should we still keep a weekly day of rest in a Sabbatarian sense?\nAnother rich episode (we hope!) full of biblical grounding, pastoral wisdom, and Tom’s signature clarity.\n\n02:24 Why does the New Testament show so much demonic activity?\n18:34 Why are so many young Christians turning to high church traditions?\n30:41 Should Christians keep Saturday as the Sabbath?\n\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://www.premier.plus/unbelievable\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "Is online church really church? Why do Christians add “For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory” to the Lord’s Prayer when it isn’t in the earliest manuscripts? And have New Age practices—like mindfulness, energy work or quasi-spiritual meditation—slipped quietly into modern Christian life?\n\nIn this episode of Ask N.T. Wright Anything, world-renowned Bible scholar Tom Wright joins Mike Bird to take on three listener questions about church life, biblical text, and spiritual discernment.\n0:00 Intro, theme music & Mike’s new book\n1:52 Q1 – Are our church services real Christian community?\n8:59 Is online church really church? Embodiment, communion & COVID\n11:53 Q2 – Why do we add “For thine is the kingdom…” to the Lord’s Prayer?\n17:20 Can we trust Bible passages with later additions?

What is the real church?\nTom and Mike explore the gap between the service-centred Western model and the New Testament vision of daily, embodied community. They also ask whether livestream services and “online church” can ever be a genuine substitute for gathering in person.\n\n🙏 2. Why do we add “For thine is the kingdom…”?\nThe Lord’s Prayer often ends with a line that many modern Bibles don’t include. Tom explains the history, manuscript evidence, early church liturgy, and why Christians still pray this doxology today.\n\n✨ 3. Has New Age spirituality infiltrated Christianity?\nFrom mindfulness to meditation apps to “finding the goddess within,” the hosts discuss where Christian spiritual practice overlaps with wider culture—and where it crosses dangerous lines.\n\nIf you’re interested in biblical studies, church practice, theology, New Age spirituality, scripture reliability, or Christian discipleship, this episode is packed with clarity and insight.\n\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://www.premier.plus/unbelievable\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "Ask N.T. Wright Anything: Precision in Faith, Peter the Rock, and the Virgin Birth\n\nIn this episode Mike Bird and NT Wright tackle three major theological questions.\n\nFirst, a listener from Ohio asks how precise our beliefs need to be in order to be “saved”. Tom reframes salvation away from the idea of “going to heaven when you die” and towards the biblical vision of God’s new creation and the defeat of death. They discuss Romans 10, baptism, assurance, and why Christian faith is about trusting Jesus rather than mastering perfect doctrine.\n\nNext, they look at Matthew 16 and ask: Is Peter himself the rock, or is the rock his confession that Jesus is the Messiah? Tom explores early interpretations and how this passage functions within the wider New Testament.\n\nFinally, they take on the significance of the virgin birth—what Isaiah 7:14 really meant, why first-century Jews weren’t expecting a virgin-born Messiah, the difference from pagan “divine birth” myths, and how the story points to God’s grace, the initiative of the Trinity, and Jesus’ true humanity received from Mary.\n\n0:00 – Intro & Ohio/Birmingham banter\n1:10 – Q1: How precise does faith need to be to be “saved”?\n10:39 – Q2: Is Peter really “the rock” in Matthew 16?\n18:50 – Q3: Why was Jesus born of a virgin?\n33:44 – Did Mary remain a virgin after Jesus’ birth?\n35:53 – Outro & preview of the next episode\n\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://www.premier.plus/unbelievable\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "“Sin is the last taboo.”\nKathy Keller joins Luke Martin for one of the most personal and revealing conversations ever recorded about faith, grief, idolatry, and the theological ideas she shared with her late husband, Tim Keller.\n\nKathy reflects on growing up bookish in Pittsburgh, discovering C.S. Lewis as a teenager – and even writing to him, receiving several personal letters that shaped her early Christian life. She also opens up about the thinkers who most influenced Tim’s preaching: John Owen, Jonathan Edwards, Herman Bavinck, Tolkien, Packer, Stott and more.\n\nA major theme of the interview is sin, which Kathy calls “the last taboo” in modern culture. Drawing on Tim’s posthumous book What Is Wrong with the World?, she explains how sin disguises itself, how idolatry takes root in every heart, and why facing our brokenness is essential for understanding God’s grace.\n\nWe also hear moving reflections on Kathy’s marriage to Tim, the shock of losing him, and the painful discovery of the idols we never knew we had — alongside her conviction that “You were built to run on God.” \n\n⏱️ CHAPTERS\n0:00 – Intro: Who is Kathy Keller?\n1:35 – CS Lewis, Narnia and a teenage call to ministry\n3:03 – Seminary & discovering substitutionary atonement\n6:03 – “Not a biography”: the real sources behind Tim Keller\n11:13 – The books & theologians that shaped Tim’s preaching\n14:32 – Substitutionary atonement & God’s eternal plan\n16:10 – What contextualisation really means\n19:10 – “Sin is the last taboo”\n30:22 – Tim Keller’s posthumous book: What Is Wrong with the World?\n34:02 – The many faces of sin\n41:10 – Idolatry & Kathy’s own painful discovery\n58:02 – Sin as slavery & our culture’s false freedom\n1:09:15 – Why pastors must preach on sin & “you were built to run on God”\n1:14:27 – Final reflections on Tim’s legacy\n\n👉 Support thought-provoking conversations and help keep the show going at www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate💡\n🎧 Never miss an episode!

Tom explains what Scripture actually says (and doesn’t say) about “souls,” “heaven,” and “waiting rooms for the dead,” and why our hope is not escape from earth but the renewal of creation itself.\n\nNext, they reflect on whether we will know everything in the new creation, and how knowledge, love, and transformation intertwine in God’s future.\nFinally, they turn to biblical budgeting, asking how Christians in affluent societies can honour God with their money without being ruled by it.\nIt’s an episode that spans heaven and earth; we hope you'll find this a dive into theology, that's thoughtful, practical, and full of hope.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 – Where do dead souls go?\n11:24 – Will we be perfect in the New Creation?\n22:57 – How should Christians budget biblically?\n\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://www.premier.plus/unbelievable\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "Today on the Ask NT Wright Anything Podcast, Mike Bird and Tom Wright tackle three challenging listener questions that get to the heart of Christian theology and biblical imagination.\nShould we pray for Satan? Tom unpacks how centuries of Christian mythology have distorted biblical ideas of “the Satan” (the accuser), explaining why evil has no rightful place in God’s good creation,and what it really means when Scripture says Jesus “disarmed the powers.”\nNext, the pair discuss Jesus’ words to the thief on the cross — “Today you will be with me in paradise.” What does “paradise” actually mean in the Bible? Tom draws on ancient language and early church thought to clarify the difference between “life after death” and “life after life after death”, showing how the Spirit sustains believers in Christ’s presence until the resurrection.\nAnd our last question today is on the life of purification: what it means for God to prune and refine us, not as punishment but as preparation for holiness and fruitfulness. Tom uses the image of pruning from John 15 to remind us that when God cuts things away, He is often closest to us.\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 Should we pray for Satan — and his repentance?\n10:23 What does “Today you will be with me in Paradise” really mean about salvation?\n21:25 What does it mean to live a life of purification?\n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

    "description": "Can Christianity help rescue a divided democracy—or is religion part of the problem?\nHost Vince Vitale moderates a timely exchange between Jonathan Rauch (author of Cross Purposes: Christianity’s Broken Bargain with Democracy) and Os Guinness (author of America Agonistes).\n\nRauch—once an “apatheist”—now argues that liberal democracy needs Christianity’s moral spine. Guinness agrees that faith undergirds freedom, while warning against both politicised religion and post-religious power politics. Together they discuss truth, forgiveness, civic virtue, and how to rebuild public trust.\n\nKey moments\n\nRauch’s “three Christian principles” he says sustain democracy\n\nGuinness apologises for how some Christians have treated Rauch (and for the Church’s record of antisemitism)\n\nPractical next steps for people of faith and secular neighbours\n\n👇 Chapters\n0:00 – Intro: Can Christianity save democracy?\n0:33 – Guests & books (Jonathan Rauch, Os Guinness, host Vince Vitale)\n2:54 – Rauch renounces “apatheism” and apologises for it\n5:26 – Os on his faith and why he values John’s book\n7:13 – Why Rauch wrote Cross Purposes (religion’s civic role)\n12:06 – Republic vs democracy; Os’s “Hebrew republic” roots\n15:41 – Rauch: three core Christian principles that sustain democracy\n18:57 – Os: covenantal foundations (consent, pledge, mutuality)\n24:59 – Nietzsche, secularisation, and hope of renewal\n28:58 – Can a non-believer urge Christians to “save” democracy?\n31:55 – Can forgiveness stand without Christian grounding?\n37:07 – Rauch’s “four Ms”: mortality, morality, miracles, murder\n44:50 – Liberalism’s roots; the “golden triangle of freedom”\n51:10 – Modelling civil disagreement\n58:25 – Os apologises for the way Rauch was treated by some Christians\n1:03:05 – “Evil speech” vs arguing for truth\n1:08:04 – Truth outlasts power\n1:10:00 – Is the Church off-course—and can it recover?\n1:14:45 – Practical takeaways for listeners\n1:17:05 – The vacuum of trusted institutions\n1:19:56 – How secular neighbours can welcome faith\n1:20:57 – Outro\n\nGuests\n• Jonathan Rauch — writer at The Atlantic, senior fellow at Brookings, author of Cross Purposes.\n• Os Guinness — social critic and author of America Agonistes.\n• Host: Vince Vitale.\n\nSupport & Subscribe\nIf this helped you think, please like, subscribe, and share.\nComment: Which moment challenged you most—15:41 (Rauch’s three principles) or 58:25 (Os’s apology)?\n\nHashtags\n\n#Christianity #Democracy #Politics #Faith #FreeSpeech #PublicSquare #Liberalism #ReligionAndPolitics #Truth #Forgiveness\n\nFor Jonathan Rauch\nBlue Sky: https://bsky.app/profile/jonrauch.bsky.social\n\nJonathan Rauch's Books\nNEW Cross Purposes: https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300273540/cross-purposes/\nand here: https://amzn.to/47laSQC\n\nFor Os Guinness:\nhttps://osguinness.com/\n\nOs Guinness' Books:\nGuinness' America Agonistes:  https://amzn.to/4hmnzzj\nOur Civilizational Moment: https://amzn.to/4qlqHPV\n\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable\nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable\nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, fascinating articles, and early access to new episodes - absolutely free!

    "description": "Does the Bible teach gender hierarchy? What did Paul mean by quoting Habakkuk — “the righteous shall live by faith”? And did Paul actually write all the pastoral epistles?\nToday on Ask NT Wright Anything, Tom and Mike answer your questions about gender, faith, and authorship in the New Testament. They unpack the Greek word for “submit” in Ephesians, showing how Paul emphasizes mutual submission in Christ, not domination. They then explore the rich meaning of Habakkuk 2:4, where “faith” can point both to God’s faithfulness and human trust. Finally, they address the debate over the pastoral epistles — stylistic differences, possible editorial hands, and why these letters still matter for the church today.\n\n00:00 – Intro\n02:06 – Does the Bible endorse gender hierarchy? What does “submit” really mean?\n09:09 – Habakkuk 2:4 – does “his faith” refer to the believer’s faith or the faithfulness of Jesus?\n18:34 – Which parts of the Bible did Paul write?

    "description": "Does Science make God unnecessary?\n\nIn today's Unbelievable? school debate, Zachary Ardern, a christian biologist, and Alex Carter, an atheist scientist, face off on whether scientific progress has made belief in God obsolete. Hosted by Andy Kind and filmed in collaboration with Aylesbury Vale Youth For Christ.\n\nHighlights\n0:43 – Rational vs reasonable (Alex explains the difference)\n2:18 – Zach’s opener: why Christian faith can be rational (science & belief)\n4:53 – Alex: faith as “non-rational” rather than irrational (Wittgenstein)\n9:02 – Can faith be personal trust and still be rational?\n10:55 – Doctrines as events: creation, incarnation, atonement, resurrection\n12:10 – Plato, Job & meaning without tidy explanations (Alex)\n18:05 – Science within a theistic framework; Asa Gray & Darwin (Zach)\n24:47 – Scientism critique; rain-dance vs celebration analogy (Alex)\n27:24 – Signs that point beyond: empty tomb, fine-tuning, beginnings (Zach)\n29:58 – Historicity of Scripture: can the Gospels be trusted?\n31:48 – Skepticism about sources; Plato’s dialogues & bias (Alex)\n34:36 – Faith, doubt and degrees of confidence (both)\n35:22 – Simone Weil, certainty, and intellectual honesty (Alex)\n37:42 – Audience Q&A begins\n40:02 – Q1: God’s plan, hell & inclusivism/annihilationism (Zach; Alex adds Lewis)\n44:07 – Q2: Problem of evil—apologetics vs consolation (Alex; Zach responds)\n49:54 – Wrap-up & credits (applause)\n\nCan science explain everything, or does it point beyond itself? Is faith irrational in the age of reason?What counts as evidence for God?Are morality and meaning possible without a creator?From the fine-tuning of the universe to the limits of human understanding, Zach and Alex debate whether God remains the best explanation, or whether naturalism is more than enough to disprove the existence of a God.

Bolloré, co-author of Bestselling, God: The Science, The Evidence, argues that twentieth-century discoveries - from thermodynamics and entropy to expansion and fine-tuning—stack up as evidence for a Creator. \n\nThey test “beginning versus eternity,” debate whether fine-tuning signals design or selection effects, and ask what constitutes prediction, falsifiability, and proof. Is the “God hypothesis” scientific, metaphysical, or both? Can science ever answer “why there is something rather than nothing”? \n\nThoughtful, spirited, and friendly, this episode brings faith and physics into constructive dialogue.\n\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, fascinating articles, and early access to new episodes - absolutely free!

    "description": "Few topics raise as many questions as hell. Is it eternal torment, final destruction, or something else entirely? In this episode of Premier Unbelievable?, Vince Vitale is joined by Australian apologist Dan Paterson (Questioning Christianity: Is There More to the Story?) and Catholic theologian Jordan Wood (The Whole Mystery of Christ). Together they explore whether the traditional doctrine of Eternal Conscious Torment is biblically and theologically defensible, and why so many Christians today are reconsidering alternative views such as conditional immortality or annihilationism.\n00:00 – Intro & setup: What is hell and why does it matter?\n00:12 – Framing the debate: What *is* hell, really?\n02:32 – Three major views: ECT, Conditionalism & Universalism\n04:50 – Dan’s case: “The fire *destroys* body and soul”\n05:02 – Jordan’s case: Hell as the “door locked from the inside”\n06:26 – Jordan: A restorative *universalism* (with real judgment)\n11:07 – The Fatherhood challenge: Could love will eternal torment?\n13:06 – Dan’s journey: From eternal torment to conditional immortality\n23:01 – Jordan’s Revelation argument: The “kings” return in Rev 21\n29:00 – Dan pushes back: New rulers, not restored rebels\n31:15 – Dan’s key claim: Scripture contrasts *life* vs *destruction*\n34:44 – Two paths only? No “destruction-then-salvation”\n36:00 – Post-mortem repentance? Jordan says yes\n37:06 – Dan’s warning: Parables teach *finality*\n49:12 – Both steel-man their own weaknesses\n55:59 – If they’re wrong… which view they’d prefer\n1:04:02 – Dan: “Hell should make us weep”\n1:07:05 – Jordan: “Perfect love casts out fear”\n\nDan and Jordan unpack historical perspectives, scriptural exegesis, and philosophical concerns, while also asking why the question of hell matters so much for evangelism and apologetics in a suffering-filled world. Is hell a cosmic torture chamber, or the tragic end of rejecting God’s love? Join us for a thoughtful, challenging conversation on one of Christianity’s hardest teachings.\n\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://www.premier.plus/unbelievable\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "Mike Bird and Tom Wright take on three wide-ranging listener questions. First: should Christians work out? Tom reflects on how physical health connects with the life of the soul, and whether Scripture points toward a holistic vision of body and spirit. Next: why is the Bible authoritative? Is it the church’s decision, the content of its teaching, or the work of the Spirit? Tom unpacks how authority is best understood through the story the Scriptures tell. Finally: the unforgivable sin. What does Jesus mean, and how should Christians approach such a troubling saying? Tom offers pastoral guidance shaped by context, hope, and the Spirit’s ongoing work.\n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

    "description": "In this live edition of Unbelievable?, Andy Kind hosts a fascinating conversation on the nature of the soul and spiritual experience.\nPhilosopher Harry Amos, a former Christian turned humanist, challenges whether the soul exists at all, pointing to science, consciousness studies, and the limits of dualism. Meanwhile, Dr. Claire Gilbert, writer and ethicist, shares her profound personal journey through faith, ecology, and cancer, drawing inspiration from Julian of Norwich and the deep mysteries of spirit, love, and human worth.\n\n0:00 – Opening & welcome\n0:12 – Today’s topic: the soul & spiritual experience; guests introduced\n0:32 – Harry’s story: from evangelical Christian to humanist\n3:05 – Claire’s story: Church of England, Julian of Norwich & theology\n5:05 – Medical ethics, grief & the limits of “pure reason”\n6:23 – Cancer diagnosis: learning to face suffering with Julian of Norwich\n7:56 – Writing from the heart: telling Julian’s story\n8:47 – Why the Church’s “depth” matters for a thirsty world\n9:53 – What is a soul?

    "description": "Mike Bird and Tom Wright take on three big listener questions. First: how do we actually cooperate with the Spirit in God’s plan for new creation? Tom reflects on what it means to anticipate heaven and earth being joined, and how our present faithfulness participates in that future hope. Next: ordination and church leadership. Are we in danger of over-structuring the body of Christ? Drawing from the New Testament and church history, Tom considers why ordination emerged and what it means for today.

    "description": "In this explosive end-of-term schools debate, Unbelievable? host Andy Kind moderates a gripping clash between Christian evangelist and CEO of Speak Life, Glen Scrivener and John Richards, President of Atheism UK. Recorded live at St Michael's School in Aylesbury (thanks to Aylesbury Youth For Christ), the debate asks: Does Christianity provide the moral foundation of the West? Glen argues that Western values—such as equality and compassion—are shaped by 2,000 years of Christian influence. John counters that morality evolved naturally and religion often fuels division. From ancient Rome to Richard Dawkins, from the Good Samaritan to scientific discovery, this is a passionate exchange that pulls no punches.\n🔔 Subscribe and share to spark deeper conversations.\n\nTwo key turning points in the debate:\n\n07:47 – Glen argues Christianity expanded compassion beyond tribe/enemy\n16:38 – John argues science & progress happened *despite* Christianity\n\nLet us know which argument do *you* think was stronger — and why?\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro – End of term special in Aylesbury\n00:21 Guests: John Richards (Atheism UK) & Glen Scrivener (Speak Life)\n00:44 Topic: Does Christianity give the West its moral foundations?\n01:04 Glen’s opening analogy: “The air we breathe”\n02:39 Equality, compassion & the “moral atmosphere”\n05:18 John’s opening reply: compassion is evolutionary, not Christian\n07:47 “Help friends, harm enemies” – Glen’s Good Samaritan argument\n10:56 John: Christianity is divided – which version are we talking about?\n13:11 Glen: Christian unity via creeds; diversity ≠ contradiction\n14:52 Putin, just war & Augustine\n16:38 John: Christianity hindered science & progress\n17:33 Glen: Science emerged in Christian civilisation\n19:04 John: All ideas have a geographical origin\n20:00 Resurrection, virgin birth & worldview assumptions\n21:38 “Pick your miracle”: origin of the universe vs resurrection\n23:20 Evidence, narrative & how science interprets data\n25:45 Why do science at all? Glen’s meaning argument\n29:04 John: We continue science because it saves lives (practical benefit)\n30:02 Glen: Hospitals, charity & compassion *also* came via Christian worldview\n31:10 Evolutionary empathy vs Christian love of the enemy\n32:45 The Problem of Suffering – both worldviews respond\n33:58 Is atheism really “just the absence of belief”?\n35:44 Meaning: Can we “make our own” or is there a transcendent source?\n37:03 Does removing God remove objective values?\n38:18 John: Meaning is personal, not universal\n39:47 Tom Holland clip – what Christianity uniquely introduced to the West\n40:48 Q&A: When did John become an atheist?\n42:12 Glen: Even atheism is shaped by Christian assumptions\n43:00 Circumcision & belonging – sharp exchange\n44:02 Q: Is Christianity just behaviour control?\n44:53 Glen: Christianity is a *story*, morality is *fruit* of it\n45:47 John: Popularity ≠ truth\n47:36 Q: Science also tells a story — so what’s the difference?\n48:55 Glen: Christianity helped *make* science possible\n50:01 Islamic & Greek contributions to the West\n51:19 Glen: Christians should celebrate truth wherever it appears\n52:04 Closing remarks & thanks\n\n👉 Support thought-provoking conversations and help keep the show going at www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate💡\n 🎧 Never miss an episode!

    "description": "Is biblical faith just “belief”? What does salvation really mean in the Old and New Testaments? And was Jesus talking about the end of the world or Jerusalem’s fall in the Olivet Discourse?\n\nIn this episode of Ask NT Wright Anything, Tom Wright and Mike Bird unpack the difference between faith and mere belief, showing how true biblical faith means trust, faithfulness, and allegiance to Jesus as King. Together, they trace how salvation unfolds from the Old Testament to the New, clarifying common misconceptions about justification and works. Finally, they explore the Olivet Discourse, explaining why Jesus’ words about the temple’s destruction matter for understanding the second coming— and how context shapes how we read prophecy today.\n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

Who’s right?\nToday we explore a question at the heart of pastoral care, public witness, and Christian leadership: Is empathy a virtue to be cultivated or a vice to be resisted?  \n\nAndy Kind was joined by Professor Joe Rigney and Dr Alastair Roberts. Joe is the author of The Sin of Empathy, a provocative work that argues when empathy becomes \"untethered\" from truth, it ceases to be a virtue and can even become sinful.  Alastair, a fellow theologian, has written a substantial critique, arguing that Joe's language has muddied important distinctions and potentially misrepresents a vital Christian posture.  This conversation is not about labels, but substance—and we'll explore everything from scriptural foundations to gender roles, pastoral ethics, and theological nuance. Can caring too much ever become morally wrong?\n\nDr Joe Rigney serves as Fellow of Theology at New Saint Andrews College and the author of a number of books, including Things of Earth and Strangely Bright.

    "description": "Are we slaves to our genes and is who we are already written in our DNA? \n\nIn this live edition of Unbelievable?, recorded at Aylesbury High School, Andy Kind is joined by humanist physicist Dr. Simon Walker-Samuel and Christian biologist Dr. Denis Alexander for a lively and thought-provoking debate on genetics, free will, and what makes us… us.\n\nFrom CRISPR and epigenetics to moral responsibility, determinism, and the question of \"the soul\", this conversation dives deep into whether our genes define our destiny, or if there's more to the human story. Are we morally responsible if we’re biologically programmed? Can science detect a “soul”? What do twin studies reveal about nature vs nurture? And do your genes influence your beliefs?\n\nAre we just highly evolved biological machines?

    "description": "What does it mean to live faithfully in a politically divided world? How should Christians respond to immigration and power? And what do Paul’s views on time tell us about the return of Christ?\nTom Wright and Mike Bird explore the tensions between faith and politics, the timing of God’s promises in Paul’s theology, and the challenges of religious clarity in a pluralistic world. They reflect on Jesus as an asylum seeker, the church’s role in holding authorities accountable, and why humility, wisdom, and spiritual responsibility are key in navigating life’s biggest questions.\n\nThere is plenty of theology in Jewish culture about delay. Tom Wright has suggested that Paul would not have been surprised by the Lord’s 'delay' in returning. But if Paul had known that Christ’s return would still not have happened 2,000 years later, would it have altered his theology or pastoral urgency? Tom Wright also discusses why some people are born into a half-truncated version of Christianity and some not. \n\nSupport us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/geolink/donate\nGot a question for Tom?

    "title": "Does True Freedom Exist? Max Jeganathan vs Andrew Copson • Hosted by Andy Kind",
    "description": "Is our obsession with personal autonomy leading to fulfilment— or fracture?  Max Jeganathan (author of The Freedom Trap) and Andrew Copson (CEO of Humanists UK) explore the purpose, power, and pitfalls of freedom. While Max argues that unexamined individualism breeds anxiety, disconnection, and moral confusion, Andrew defends freedom as a means to happiness, but warns against excessive egoism. The discussion spans everything from Nazi resistance and speeding laws to Taylor Swift and tech billionaires, with surprising agreements and sharp disagreements - particularly over the value of self-sacrifice and whether belief in God really matters. A nuanced, often humourous journey through politics, ethics and belief hosted by comedian and writer Andy Kind, this episode asks: is true freedom found in autonomy, or in responsibility, community and even love?\n\nAndrew Copson is Chief Executive of Humanists UK and the current President of Humanists International. His books include The Little Book of Humanism (2020) and The Little Book of Humanist Weddings (2021) with Alice Roberts; Secularism: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2019); and The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Humanism (2015) with A. C. Grayling.\nBluesky: @andrewcopson\nFacebook: @mrandrewcopson\n\nPriyan Max Jeganathan is a speaker and writer for the Centre for Public Christianity in Australia. Max is a former lawyer and political and policy adviser. He has spoken at universities including the University of Oxford and Imperial College and at global businesses including Goldman Sachs, Lego, Nike, Samsung and Amazon. \nHis new book: \nThe Freedom Trap explores the nature, power, beauty and trappings of freedom - SHOP HERE:  https://amzn.to/4df6cOW\nInstagram: @primaxjeg\nFacebook: @primaxjeg\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable\nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable\nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, fascinating articles, and early access to new episodes—absolutely free!

    "description": "Tom Wright and Mike Bird delve into the Jewish identity of Jesus in this week's episode of the Ask NT Wright Anything podcast. They respond to a listener's question about Paul's instructions in 1 Corinthians 11 and reflect on the moral dilemmas faced by Dietrich Bonhoeffer during the Nazi regime. \n\nWith depth and clarity, they explore how seeing Jesus within his Jewish context enriches our understanding of the gospel, why Paul's words on worship remain controversial, and how Bonhoeffer's bold choices continue to challenge the church on questions of Biblical ethics, justice, and what role Christians should take on opposing tyranny.\n\n00:41 Why did the God of the Universe choose to operate through a Jewish Messiah? Why was Jesus a Jew?\n08:00 What does 1 Corinthians 11 mean for public worship, both contextually and how is it relevant today? \n17:36 What role should Christians take in opposing Tyranny? Was Bonhoeffer right to try and assassinate Hitler? What does this mean in line with the sin of murder? \n\n👉 Stay Connected & Get More:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "title": "Is the Problem of Suffering the strongest argument against God? David Robertson vs Stephen Law",
    "description": "Can the reality of suffering disprove a good God? Oxford Philosopher Dr. Stephen Law and Christian minister Rev. David Robertson debate the problem of evil, the evil God hypothesis, and whether suffering is evidence for or against theism. \n\nDoes Christianity provide a meaningful answer, or does the sheer amount of suffering make belief in God irrational?\n\nLaw presents the evidential problem of evil and his “evil God” challenge. At the same time, Robertson defends the Christian view that suffering can be reconciled with a loving God through free will, morality, and the hope found in Christ. From the nature of evil to the philosophical implications of faith and atheism, this thought-provoking conversation tackles one of life’s biggest questions.\n\n**** Please note: In this video, David is incorrectly labeled as \"Dr.\" in the on-screen captions.

    "description": "This Easter, Tom Wright and theologian Mike Bird explore the bold claim at the heart of Christianity: that Jesus truly rose from the dead. Mike raises the modern skepticism - how can we believe in resurrection when we know dead people don’t come back? Tom offers a robust response rooted in Jewish messianic hope, early Christian belief, and the bodily resurrection as essential to the identity of Jesus.\n\nThey unpack key Scriptures, contrast Gnostic and early Christian views, and delve into why the resurrection affirms creation, love, and God's ultimate victory.\n\n📌 This is part one of a two-part conversation. In part two, Tom discusses the real-world implications of the resurrection for the Church and Christian mission today. That part is for Ask NT Wright Anything subscribers only.\n\n👉 To access the final part of the discussion and support the show, visit AskNTWright.com\n\nStay Connected & Get More:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PremierUnbelievable/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/premierunbelievable\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@premierunbelievable\n- X (Twitter) https://x.com/unbelievablefe\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/unbelievablefe.bsky.social",

    "description": "Today's episode filmed in front of a live audience of students at John Hampden Grammar School, High Wycombe, UK, seeks to answer the age-old question: Does science bring us closer to understanding a divine creator, or does it steer us away from such a belief?  Sam McKee, researcher and associate tutor in history and philosophy of science at Manchester Metropolitan University guest hosts and he is joined by two distinguished guests. \n\nPaul Ewart, an Emeritus Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford. He has served as an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics. His research areas include fundamental atomic physics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and the design of novel lasers for spectroscopy. He has also focused on developing new techniques for optical diagnostics and gas-sensing for environmental monitoring.\n\nDebating with Paul is Phil Halper, a YouTuber who has interviewed many of the world's leading scientists, including Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, and Alan Guth. Phil is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and was appointed journalist in residence at the Penn State Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos. He has been the lead author on several peer-reviewed papers in fields ranging from cosmology to neuroscience and philosophy. Phil's first book, 'Battle of the Big Bang: The New Tales of our Cosmic Origins,' co-authored with award-winning cosmologist Niayesh Afshordi, will be published by the University of Chicago Press in the spring of 2025.\n\nSo listen below as Paul Ewart and Phil Halper engage in a compelling debate exploring the profound question: Does science point toward or away from God?

    "description": "As the UK government announced the launch of a new Islamophobia council to define ‘anti-Muslim hatred/ Islamophobia’ on February 28th, the start of Ramadan, one thing is clear: This is a hot-button issue that raises serious questions about free speech, blasphemy laws, and the balance between protecting religious sensibilities and upholding open dialogue in a liberal society.\n0:00 — Why Islamophobia Is Exploding as a Debate in Britain\n0:45 — What Is “Islamophobia” and Why Does It Matter?\n1:36 — Meet the Guests: Andy Bannister & Tim Dieppe\n3:28 — The New Islamophobia Council: What’s Really Being Proposed?\n7:06 — Is Islam a Race? The Problem With the APPG Definition\n9:49 — Free Speech, Blasphemy, and the Chilling Effect in the UK\n14:48 — When Criticism Becomes a Crime: Real Cases & Arrests\n26:04 — What the Qur’an Says About Blasphemy (vs Jesus’ Response)\n40:53 — Human Rights, Liberal Values & Islamic Teachings\n57:12 — How Should Christians Engage with Muslim Neighbours?\n\nJoining us on the podcast today are Andy Bannister from Solas CPC and Tim Dieppe from Christian Concern to tackle this complex but important topic. Together, we ask the tough questions: What is the controversy surrounding the definition of Islamophobia in Britain today? What are the chilling effects of unofficial laws on people of all beliefs? How does Islam view blasphemy, and does that perspective clash with modern Western ideals? And what will ultimately be the impact on British society?\n\n#islamophobia #debate #podcast #christiantheology #blasphemylawinislam #blasphemylaw \n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

Tom responds to William Lane Craig’s argument that individual resurrections weren’t expected before the End Times. He unpacks how Jesus’ resurrection differs from all others, marking the beginning of God’s new creation.\nWhat makes someone an 'Apostle'? The discussion explores Paul’s apostleship, the fluid roles of teachers, prophets, and elders, and the importance of apostolic succession in church leadership.\n\n💡 Key Topics this week:\n Did first-century Jews expect individual resurrections?\n Jesus vs. Lazarus—what makes Christ’s resurrection unique?\n The role of an apostle—was Paul truly one?\n Apostolic succession—does church authority really trace back to the apostles?\n\nGot Questions for Tom?

Dr. Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and Christian, believes we must, and his new book, The Road to Wisdom: On Truth, Science, Faith, and Trust, aims to rekindle these values. Collins argues that a foundation of humility, truth, and morality — not partisan loyalty — should guide our judgement. But in an age where allegiance often outweighs evidence, can this vision truly take hold?\n\nIn this episode of Premier Unbelievable, Collins squares off with Phil Halper, atheist scientist and creator of Before the Big Bang, to probe the limits of science and the necessity of faith. \n\nTogether, they’ll tackle pressing questions: \nCan faith and science coexist without compromising truth? How does trust (or lack of it) contribute to today’s social and political divides?Is it possible to transcend polarization and rebuild a fractured world?\nWhether you're a person of faith, a skeptic, or simply searching for answers in a turbulent world, this episode offers a deep dive into the limits of science, the necessity of trust, and the pursuit of wisdom. Can Collins' vision inspire change, or are we too entrenched to move forward?\n\n🔔 Subscribe and hit the notification bell for more!\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

How does the role of Mary and the authority of scripture shape the faith journeys of believers in these traditions?\n\nPremier Unbelievable?, host Andy Kind moderates a compelling dialogue between Dr. Leonardo De Chirico and Trent Horn, examining the key theological distinctions and shared values between Catholicism and Protestantism.\n\nThe conversation goes there - the authority of scripture, the concept of Sola Scriptura, and the role of the papacy. Both guests share personal faith journeys—Leonardo’s transition from Catholicism to Protestantism and Trent’s conversion to Catholicism—highlighting how missionary work, cultural influences, and a quest for authentic faith shaped their beliefs.\n\nKey topics include the role of Mary in theology, the nature of church authority, and the historical context behind doctrinal differences. The discussion explores Catholicism’s emphasis on unity through institutional structures, contrasted with Protestantism’s focus on personal faith and salvation by grace.\n\nWhile addressing points of contention, such as the interpretation of scripture and the role of oral tradition in the early church, the guests find common ground in their shared commitment to scripture and the centrality of Christ.\n\nFor Trent Horn\nWhy I am a Catholic - https://amzn.to/3Ovjrzp\nhttps://www.trenthorn.com/\n\nFor Leonardo De Chirico\nSame Words, Different Worlds -  https://amzn.to/4iaRiLt\n\nMore on this topic: \nhttps://www.premierunbelievable.com/articles/protestant-catholic-and-orthodox-whats-the-difference-and-does-it-matter/14994.article\n\n#Catholicism #Protestantism #ChristianFaith #Theology #FaithDialogue #UnityInChrist #SolaScriptura #Mariology #TrentHorn #LeonardoDeChirico #ChristianUnity #Papacy #FaithExplored\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook: / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable\nInstagram: / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable\nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, fascinating articles, and early access to new episodes—absolutely free!

    "description": "As the UK gears up for a crucial parliamentary debate on the Assisted Dying Bill 🏛️, this week’s episode of the Unbelievable? podcast dives deep into one of the most contentious issues of our time. 🌍\n\nUnlike countries like 🇨🇦 Canada, 🇳🇱 the Netherlands, and parts of the 🇺🇸 USA, assisted dying remains illegal in the UK. But Labour MP Kim Leadbeater’s Private Member's Bill is sparking a nationwide debate about autonomy, ethics, and the future of palliative care.\n\n🎙️ Host Roger Bolton moderates an electrifying conversation between two expert voices:\n\n✨ Meet the Guests\n👨‍⚕️ Professor Keith Brown\nA safeguarding expert and former NHS leader, Keith warns of a \"slippery slope\" 🛑 if assisted dying is legalised. He believes societal pressures could subtly coerce the vulnerable into choosing death prematurely. Keith argues for the sanctity of life and a cautious approach to this sensitive issue.\n\n💡 Neil McKain\nAs Vice Chair of Humanists UK, Neil champions personal autonomy 🕊️, asserting that individuals should have the right to end their suffering on their own terms. Drawing on secular ethics, he advocates for compassion over dogma in end-of-life choices.\n\n💥 Key Questions Explored\n🔹 Should we call it “assisted dying” or “assisted suicide”? How does language shape the debate?\n🔹 Can safeguards protect the vulnerable? What about risks of coercion or mistakes?\n🔹 Does personal autonomy outweigh societal concerns about the sanctity of life?\n🔹 Is palliative care enough to address unbearable suffering?\n🔹 Could this change how we trust healthcare professionals?\n\n🌟 Why This Debate Matters\nWith Parliament set to discuss the Assisted Dying Bill on November 28, the UK faces a turning point on how we balance compassion, ethics, and law.\n\nThis isn’t just a legal debate—it’s a question of how we value life, confront suffering, and support the vulnerable. 🌍🤝\n\n🎥 WATCH NOW: Don’t miss this emotionally charged episode of Unbelievable? with Keith Brown and Neil McKain tackling this timely and crucial topic.

    "description": "🌟 Is faith necessary for a moral life?  🌟\nIs belief in God essential for a meaningful moral framework? Or can secular philosophy give us all the answers? 🤔 This week on Unbelievable?, host Ruth Jackson 🎙️ welcomes two dynamic thinkers to explore one of the most profound debates: the role of God in shaping our moral universe. \n🌌✨ Recorded live at Waddesdon School, UK with Aylesbury Vale Youth for Christ, this episode promises to challenge everything you thought you knew about faith and philosophy. 🙌\n\n👤 British philosopher at Oxford University, Stephen Law, creator of the famous \"Evil God Challenge,\" isn’t afraid to question the existence of a benevolent deity in a world full of suffering. Is God really all-good, or could an “evil god” be just as plausible? 😱💡\n\n👤 Joining him is Christian scholar from Cambridge University,  Matthew Su, whose perspective celebrates life as a gift from a loving creator.

He highlights the biblical teaching that \"the heart is deceitful above all things\" (Jeremiah 17:9) and references Jesus’ words that it is from the heart that actions proceed (Mark 7:21).

    "title": "The Great Morality Debate: Secularism vs. Christianity with Dr Michael Shermer & Rev. Glen Scrivener",
    "description": "In this episode of Premier Unbelievable?, host Vince Vitale moderates a riveting debate that tackles one of the most profound questions in philosophy, religion, and ethics: Can we be 'good' without God? 🤔✨ Dr. Michael Shermer, renowned skeptic and author of The Moral Arc, joins Glen Scrivener, Anglican minister, author of The Air We Breathe, speaker and filmmaker who directs the charity Speak Life, to explore the origins and foundations of morality. Together, they address whether human morality is the product of secular, scientific, and cultural evolution 🧠🌍, or whether it is deeply rooted in divine principles, particularly those derived from Christianity ✝️🙏 .\n\nThis conversation explores key arguments on both sides. Shermer argues that morality can be understood through secular reasoning 🌐 with frameworks like utilitarianism and deontology 📜, and that moral values evolve over time through cultural shifts and reason. He contends that religion has not always been a reliable moral guide and that objective moral values can exist independently of God, emerging from evolutionary and cultural processes. Shermer emphasizes that moral progress, such as individual rights from the Enlightenment 🕊️, often arises from philosophical reasoning and societal change, not divine command.\n\nOn the other hand, Scrivener argues that many moral principles, especially the inherent value of every individual, are rooted in Christian theology ✝️. He asserts that human rights and justice ⚖️  are inseparable from Christian teachings, which have historically shaped modern morality. Scrivener highlights Christianity’s role in moral progress, such as the abolition of slavery and the concept of universal human worth. While recognizing cultural and philosophical influences, he argues that without a divine source, the foundation of absolute moral values is unstable.\n\n#MoralityDebate #GoodWithoutGod #PhilosophyAndReligion #MichaelShermer #GlenScrivener #ChristianityVsAtheism #SecularMorality #FaithAndReason #theenlightenment #humanrights #MoralProgress #EthicsDebate #SpeakLife #UnbelievablePodcast\n\nFor Glen Scrivener\nSpeak Life https://speaklife.org.uk/\nYouTube: @SpeakLifeMedia\nX: @glenscrivener\n\nFor Michael Shermer\nhttps://michaelshermer.com/\nYouTube: @skepticmagazine\nX: @michaelshermer\n\nFurther Reading:\nThe Science of Good and Evil: Why People Cheat, Gossip, Care, Share, and Follow the Golden Rule, Michael Shermer - https://amzn.to/3Afd5AKThe Moral Arc, Michael Shermer - https://amzn.to/3YiYfRJThe Air We Breathe: How We All Came to Believe in Freedom, Kindness, Progress, and Equality, Glen Scrivener - https://amzn.to/3NFRggWHow To See Life: A Guide In 321, Glen Scrivener - https://amzn.to/48pb55I\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "title": "Army Vet Convicted for Silent Prayer Near Abortion Clinic in Shocking UK Ruling Silent Prayer Debate",
    "description": "Update 16/10/24 In Dorset, UK, Army Vet Adam Smith-Connor has been found guilty and convicted in a shock ruling from Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court for praying silently near abortion facility.   Army veteran and father of two, Adam Smith-Connor, found guilty of breaching censorial “buffer zone” with prayerful thoughts in his mind \n\n“All I did was pray to God” , he said. He is considering an appeal. \n\nBournemouth, Christchurch & Poole Council charged Adam Smith-Connor, a military veteran and father of two, following an interrogation by office on “the nature of his prayers” when he stopped to pray for a few minutes near an abortion facility in November 2022. \n\nToday the Court sentenced Smith-Connor to a conditional discharge and ordered him to pay prosecution costs of £9,000. A conditional discharge is a type of conviction that means Smith-Connor will only be sentenced if he is convicted of any future offences in the next two years. In its decision, the court reasoned that his prayer amounted to “disapproval of abortion” because at one point his head was seen slightly bowed and his hands were clasped. \n\nResponding to the ruling, Smith-Connor stated: \n\n“Today, the court has decided that certain thoughts – silent thoughts – can be illegal in the United Kingdom. That cannot be right. All I did was pray to God, in the privacy of my own mind – and yet I stand convicted as a criminal? \n\n“I served for 20 years in the army reserves, including a tour in Afghanistan, to protect the fundamental freedoms that this country is built upon. I continue that spirit of service as a health care professional and church volunteer. It troubles me greatly to see our freedoms eroded to the extent that thoughtcrimes are now being prosecuted in the UK.” \n\n🔇🙏 Should Silent Prayer Be Banned? This week on Unbelievable, we dive into the complex and controversial issue of abortion clinic buffer zones 🛑. As new legislation takes effect in the 🇬🇧 UK on October 31, 2024, making it illegal to influence someone’s decision to access abortion services—including prayer—within a 150-meter radius, the debate over balancing safety ⚖️ and privacy for vulnerable women with preserving free speech 🗣️ and religious freedom 🙏 has never been more intense.\n\nHow do we protect women while upholding individual rights? Join 🎙️ Andy Kind and his guests, Jan MacVarish, a pro-choice advocate, and Lois McLatchie Miller of ADF, a pro-life defender, as they tackle these pressing questions from both sides of the argument.\n\nDon't miss this critical conversation, resonating both in 🇬🇧 the UK and 🇺🇸 the US!

    "description": "🎙️ Today we venture into the intersection of science and faith with Dr. Mirjam Schilling, a postdoctoral virologist and DPhil student in Science and Religion at the University of Oxford. With her unique background in virology and theology, Dr. Schilling grapples with profound questions about the nature of suffering, the existence of God, and how scientific insights can reshape our understanding of good, evil, and the very fabric of life itself. 🌿🧬\n\n As both a scientist and a believer💡Dr. Schilling brings a fresh, nuanced perspective on how viruses—often seen as agents of chaos—can spark meaningful conversations around theodicy, human identity, and the age-old dilemma of why suffering exists. Through the lens of her research, she reveals how these tiny organisms challenge our perceptions of order in creation, while also illuminating credible and scientific reasons to believe in the Christian God in the midst of uncertainty.\n\n🔍 Join us for Part 1 of this captivating conversation, where Mirjam's journey—studying the immune system’s battle with viruses and their theological significance—invites us to rethink some of life's biggest questions. If you’ve ever pondered how science and faith coexist, or why we experience suffering, this episode is for you!\n\nFor Mirjam Schilling: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mirjam-schilling-9bbb2b211/\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-5386-3609\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mirjam-Schilling\nhttps://twitter.com/mirjamschilling\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "Philosophers on God: Talking about ExistenceDid you hear the one about the three philosophers? Yes, on Unbelievable? 👀 🧠 🎙️In this episode, Oxford philosopher Stephen Law, the main proponent of the Evil God Challenge, argues that the evidential problem of evil challenges the belief in a good God. ⚡️ Jack Symes contends that there are asymmetries between the arguments for believing in a good God and an evil God. The debate examines the distribution of good and evil in the world as evidence and explores how theists defend belief in a good God through theodicies, revelation, and religious experience.\n\nJack Symes is a public philosopher and researcher in philosophy at Durham University, whose academic research lies at the intersection of philosophy of mind and religion. Jack is best known as the producer of The Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast, one of the UK’s most popular higher education podcasts. His books include Philosophers on God: Talking about Existence (2024) and Defeating the Evil-God Challenge: In Defence of God’s Goodness (2024). He was recently named one of BBC’s New Generation Thinkers for 2024.\n\nStephen Law is a philosopher and author, currently Director of Philosophy and Cert HE at Oxford University Department of Continuing Education. Stephen has published many popular books, including The Philosophy Gym, The Complete Philosophy Files, and Believing Bullshit. \n\nMore Resources: watch / https://youtu.be/LXY9DJlP5Gs?si=l-JXMB8InPhaUnz_\n\n#debate #evilgodchallenge #philosophy #philosophyofreligion #theism #atheism #evil #goodgod \n\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, fascinating articles, and early access to new episodes—absolutely free!

Questioner's ask if the Old Testament is crucial to Christianity, referencing Andy Stanley's idea of \"unhitching\" Christianity from the Old Testament, as well as questions on the historicity of the Exodus, whether the Old Testament God is a God of war, and whether Theologian Greg Boyd's interpretation of violent portrayals of God in his book The Crucifixion Of The Warrior God are an attempt to present the Old Testament picture of God in a better light.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:47 Andy Stanley's 'unhitching' of Christianity from the Old Testament\n5:05 The Exodus story: myth or history?\n9:48 How do we make sense of Old Testament violence?

    "description": "Why do we tend to go for an experience that feels good and when something feels bad, we tend to avoid it?  Why are conscious experiences and behaviour paired together in the most rational way? 👀 ✨ The Unbelievable podcast unpacks the mystery of psycho-physical harmony with Philip Goff, Professor Philosophy at Durham University (an atheist) as he debates Dustin Crummett, a Christian philosopher. \n\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, fascinating articles, and early access to new episodes—absolutely free! Join now at www.premierunbelievable.com 🎉📢\n\nGoff believes this topic in philosophy will revolutionize how we perceive the relationship between mind and body and how we make choices based on pain-pleasure. And Dustin Crummett presents a compelling argument for God as the key to unraveling today's show's enigma. On the other hand, Philip Goff, in his groundbreaking 'Why?' book, proposes an intriguing solution through radical panpsychism, introducing the concept of 'pan-agentialism'—a form of free will attributed to particles, i.e., everything is the agent of its own behavior, whether it is animate or inanimate.\n  \nWhether you're a seasoned philosopher or a curious mind, this episode will challenge and inspire your views on the harmony between the mind and the physical world. \n\n#philosophy #debate #atheism #christianphilosophy #panagentialism #psychophysicalharmony\n\nFor Dustin Crummet\nTwitter/X: /https://twitter.com/dustin_crummett\nYouTube: / https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWPF0v1EIn4w0tni4QIQ6lA\nRead More: Applied Ethics: an impartical introduction and my book https://hackettpublishing.com/applied-ethics-an-impartial-introduction\n\nFor Philip Goff's new article in Scientific American https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mystery-of-consciousness-is-deeper-than-we-thought/\nTwitter/X: / https://twitter.com/@Philip_Goff) \nYouTube: / https://www.youtube.com/@MindChat\nRead More: Why: the purpose of the universe https://shorturl.at/uoWoz\n\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter/X: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable\nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable\nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/courses\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "🌟 Unbelievable? 🌟\nPrepare for a captivating journey through history as Unbelievable? delves deep into the question: \"Did New Atheism Fail?\" Two intellectual titans, Alister McGrath, one of the world's foremost theologians, and Alex O’Connor, the Oxford-educated philosopher and celebrated YouTuber, engage in a thought-provoking debate that transcends time.  Get Francis Collins new book here https://amzn.to/3YV0Kd7\n📚 Exploring \"Coming to Faith Through Dawkins\" 📚\nThis discussion is ignited by the release of the groundbreaking book \"Coming to Faith Through Dawkins,\" edited by Denis Alexander and Alister McGrath, hitting shelves on August 29, 2023. In its pages, the world's sharpest minds from Australia, South Africa, Egypt, the USA, and the UK come together to share a remarkable commonality: Richard Dawkins and the New Atheists played a pivotal role in their conversion to Christianity.\n🌎 A Global Perspective on Faith and Reason 🌍\nDespite diverse backgrounds and cultural influences, these individuals once ardently championed the ideas of the New Atheists, only to become disillusioned by Dawkins' arguments and conclusions. Their journeys led them to scrutinise religious faith with newfound objectivity, revealing that the fallacies Dawkins warned of simply do not exist.\n🧠 Meet the Debaters: 🧠\nAlister McGrath: A former atheist turned theologian, McGrath's journey to Christianity began during his studies in the natural sciences at Oxford University. With a storied career that includes roles such as Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford and President of the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics, McGrath is renowned for his intellectual prowess. His internationally acclaimed textbook, \"Christian Theology: An Introduction,\" translated into twenty languages, is just one testament to his impact. Stay tuned for his upcoming release, \"Christian Apologetics: An Introduction.\"\nAlex O’Connor: As a YouTuber and host of the Within Reason Podcast, O’Connor's mission is to make philosophy accessible to all.

    "description": "Near-Death Experiences: Proof of a Loving God? 🧠✨\n\nFrom pop icons like Madonna to leading neuroscientists, countless individuals worldwide have reported powerful, life-altering near-death experiences (NDEs). But do these extraordinary accounts provide evidence of a loving God?\n\nThis week on Unbelievable?, Pastor and author John Burke shares insights from his extensive study of over 1,000 NDE accounts, arguing that these experiences offer compelling, faith-building evidence of God’s existence and the truth of the Bible.\n\nNeurosurgeon Dr. Eben Alexander joins the debate, challenging Burke's interpretation. Initially a staunch physicalist and advocate of evidence-based medicine, Dr. Alexander's own vivid NDE—detailed in his bestselling book, \"Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife\"—radically transformed his understanding of life and death. Despite his profound experience, he stops short of embracing Christianity, maintaining a nuanced view of the afterlife that invites deep discussion.\n\n👉 Don't miss out on exclusive content, updates, and early access to episodes—join us for free at www.premierunbelievable.com 🎉📢\n\nExplore this captivating conversation about the intersection of science, spirituality, and the afterlife. \n\n\n#neardeathexperiences #nde #theafterlife #proof #lifeafterdeath \n\nSOCIAL LINKS: \nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe \nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable \n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate\n\nFor JOHN: \nDiscover John's Book Imagine The God Of Heaven: https://shorturl.at/hsTU4\nVisit John's Website: www.imagineheaven.net\n⬇️ Follow John on Social Media:\nFacebook: Search @johnburkeofficial for correct John Burke page\nInstagram: @johnburkeofficial\nX: @Imagine__Heaven\n\nFor EBEN: \nDiscover Eben's Book Proof Of Heaven: https://shorturl.at/ckrvD\nVisit Eben's Website: www.ebenalexander.com\n⬇️ Follow Eben on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556760676917\nInstagram: @ebenalex3md\nX: @LifeBeyondD\nYT: @AllIsWellUnlimited",

    "description": "Where is God in a world of natural disasters? This week's episode dives deep into one of the most challenging philosophical questions humanity has grappled with for centuries: the problem of natural evil. Hosted by Vince Vitale the show delves into the complexities of evil that seem inherent to the fabric of our world – earthquakes, famines, diseases – phenomena that sometimes shake our faith in a benevolent God.\n\nWe're joined by two brilliant minds with divergent perspectives. Sharon Dirckx, a renowned speaker, author, and Christian apologist, returns to Unbelievable? and brings her insights rooted in faith and intellect. With a background in brain imaging from the University of Cambridge, Sharon's latest book, \"Broken Planet,\" offers a compelling exploration of the theological implications of natural disasters and diseases.\n\nAlso returning as a guest to Unbelievable is Stephen Woodford, the influential voice behind the Rationality Rules YouTube channel. With a focus on dismantling religious and supernatural beliefs, Stephen brings a rationalist perspective to the table.\n\n#evil #naturalevil #pandemic #Satan #God #theodicy #disaster  #tsunami  #naturaldisaster #atheism #atheistvschristian \n\nSOCIAL LINKS: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe \nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate\n\nFOR SHARON:\nRead Sharon's book Broken Planet: https://shorturl.at/mwxP8 \n⬇️ Follow Sharon on Social Media\nX: @sharondirckx\nFB: @sharondirckx\n\nFOR RATIONALITY RULES: \n⬇️ Follow Stephen on Social Media\nYT: @rationalityrules \nX: @RationalityRule\nIG: @rationality.r\nFB: @Rationalityrules",

    "description": "In the discussion on the plausibility of an all-evil God versus an all-good God, Dr. Max Baker-Hytch delivered a compelling argument that encapsulated the essence of the debate. He highlighted the inherent scepticism that arises when considering the 'evil God' hypothesis, pointing out that if such a malevolent deity were to exist, it would provide ample reason to doubt the reliability of our cognitive faculties. According to Dr. Baker-Hytch, the very nature of an evil God would entail a desire to deceive humanity, leading to pervasive doubts and uncertainties. In contrast, the 'good God hypothesis' stands in stark contrast, lacking the motive for such pervasive deception. \n\nDr. Asha Lancaster-Thomas, whose scholarly contributions have ignited significant discourse on this topic, brought her insights to bear on the discussion. Holding a PhD from the University of Birmingham and teaching philosophy at Atlanta Classical Academy, Dr. Thomas is no stranger to the complexities of metaphysics and epistemology. Her paper on the 'evil God challenge' has been a focal point for philosophical inquiry, prompting responses such as Dr. Baker-Hytch's co-authored rebuttal, \"Meeting the Evil God Challenge.\" \n\nDr Max Baker-Hytch, lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Oxford received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Oxford and subsequently held research positions at the University of Oxford and the University of Notre Dame. Max has published more than a dozen scholarly articles and book chapters on various topics within the fields of philosophy of religion and epistemology\n\nThis intellectual but friendly exchange between Dr. Baker-Hytch and Dr. Lancaster-Thomas, is hosted by fellow philosopher Vince Vitale.  \n\n#evilgodchallenge #philosophy #morality #philosophyofreligion #goodgod #evil\n\nSOCIAL LINKS: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe \nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable \n\nFor Asha Lancaster Thomas:\nRead Asha's chapter in Jack Symes' Philosophers on God: Talking About Existence (https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/philosophers-on-god-9781350227286/)https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12543https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12502Twitter: @asha_lancaster\n\nFor Max Baker Hytch:\nTwitter: @MaxBakerHytchMax Baker Hytch and Ben Page's paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papq.12304 \n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

This is a mistake argues one of our guests today, Christian academic Nick Spencer, Senior Fellow at Theos, in his new book 📚 'Playing God: science, religion and the future of humanity.' Back on the show is Emily Qureshi-Hurst expert on the philosophy of time ⏳. Emily is a Lecturer in Philosophy at Oriel College, University of Oxford and together Nick and Emily sort out the role of science 🔬 and belief 🙏 when it comes to questions of personhood and the future of humanity. Ably led by host Andy Kind, Unbelievable? digs back into that perennial question, 'can science and religion come together - furiously or fruitfully - over the status and nature of what it means to be human'?\n\n👉 Get bonus content, updates, and early access to new episodes—absolutely free!

Sprinkle host of the Theology in the Raw podcast. Tom Wright stresses the need for Christians to prioritize the Kingdom of God and embody its values within the church. Preston talks about how Israel’s exile to Babylon, Jesus’ mission on earth, and the teachings of Paul all shaped the church’s relationship with politics and can inform our own relationship with politics today.

Baptist Minister Allan Finnegan, a former Britain's Got Talent contender, says we've got to talk death and dying. What's it truly like to live knowing your time is limited? And how does your Christian faith shape this journey? Steve Legg, author of The Last Laugh and editor of Sorted Magazine, sheds light on these poignant questions. #FacingCancer #FaithOverFear 🙏 #HopefulHeart 💖\n\nWatch the full show here: https://youtu.be/p146mw5AuQ4?feature=shared",

    "description": "🌟📖 This week on Unbelievable, join us as we delve into the age-old question: 'Did it really happen – the Resurrection of Jesus?' 🕊️ We're dissecting the narratives surrounding Jesus’ death and Resurrection with two eminent scholars, each with their own perspectives on this pivotal event that shapes the Christian worldview.\n\n👨‍🔬 Dr. Mike Licona, a New Testament scholar and expert on the intricate details of Jesus' life and Resurrection, will be examining their historical reliability. Get Mike Licona's new book here https://amzn.to/3CyDgD6\n\n🤔 On the other side, Dr. Larry Shapiro, a sceptic in such matters, will challenge these assertions and offer alternative explanations he deems more plausible.\n\n🔍 The show will also address reconciling discrepancies in the Resurrection accounts – does that strengthen or weaken the arguments for these events?\n\n📜 Moreover, even if we establish the historical reliability of ancient texts, can we apply their teachings to 21st-century life from a philosophical perspective? Dr. Mike Licona will present evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus, probing its relevance to modern life. If Jesus truly conquered death, what does it mean for those who trust in Him?\n\nDon't miss it! 🎙️✨ #ResurrectionDebate #HistoricalReliability #jesuschrist #faith #debate \n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

Strap in for this mini-series starting with Michael F. Bird (Deputy Principal & New Testament scholar at Ridley College, Australia) and Stephen Wolfe (author of ‘The Case for Christian Nationalism’). These two come to vastly different conclusions about how faith and politics should mix. \n\nStephen Wolfe makes a startling case for Christian nationalism. How can followers of Jesus be part of the solution bringing divided communities together, asks Michael Bird, co-author with Tom “NT” Wright of ‘Jesus and the Powers?’ What are the boundaries of our personal beliefs? How can we achieve the goods we wish to see in society? In the coming weeks, we will also hear from New Testament scholar Tom ‘NT’ Wright, Preston Sprinkle author of ‘Exiles: The church in the shadow of empire,’ and ex-White House and presidential staffer Michael Wear. 📖✝️🏛️\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\nMichael F.

    "description": "Top apologist, Biola professor, and author Dr. Sean McDowell guest hosts Unbelievable on the topic, 'Does God truly love everyone?'.  Most Christians would say yes. At the heart of Christianity is a declaration that God so loved the world that he gave his only Son to make salvation possible for every single person. But there are very strongly held views across the spectrum about what happens when we die?  What about those who have never heard?  Is there a chance to acknowledge and accept God postmortem and spend eternity with him?  How do we affirm the idea of God’s love for all and the idea held dear by some that Christ died for the elect.   Andrew Hronich endeavors to synthesize the many strands of orthodox doctrine into a single telos: ultimate reconciliation. He is a current master's student at Princeton Theological Seminary and an associate apologist, and the author of a new book \"Once Loved Always Loved: The Logic of Apokatastasis\".

    "description": "✨  Louise Perry wrote a book almost no one wanted to publish. 🔥 The Case Against the Sexual Revolution 🔥 explains why today’s liberal hook up culture has been bad for women from a purely socio-evolutionary perspective. Louise Perry, a journalist and campaigner against sexual violence, says she’s had “many, many hundreds of messages from people who tell me that the book has had a profound effect on them. I often hear from young women who tell me they had never in their lives come across the facts and ideas contained in the book – not just the basic information about human behaviour and sexuality, but also the moral message”. \n\n👀 As Louise notes, “almost everyone acknowledges that our sexual culture is dysfunctional but, until recently, it has been difficult for anyone in a progressive milieu to speak honestly about why it is so dysfunctional, for fear of challenging the progressive narrative of feminist history”. 👀\n \n 💜 Louise Perry has said she wants women to be “armed with permission” to defend their own sexual boundaries and turn down a casual hook-up. Because, as she notes, “we have all been lying to ourselves, and to each other, about the true nature of male and female sexuality”.  For more Louise Perry go here  https://www.louiseperry.co.uk/ \n \n👇To hear the full debate between Louise Perry and Rod Dreher on The Big Conversation go here https://www.premierunbelievable.com/unbelievable/unbelievable-rod-dreher-and-louise-perry--christianity-the-sexual-revolution-and-the-future-of-the-west/15467.article",

This discussion between Steve Legg and Allan Finnegan hosted by Andy Kind will transform the way you think about terminal illness. This uplifting show explores why two men in the prime of life feel closer to God than before they received their devastating diagnoses.  \n\n0:00 – The Diagnosis: “I Didn’t Stop Crying”\n0:45 – Choosing Joy After Terminal News\n1:18 – Welcome to Unbelievable: Suffering & Faith\n2:04 – Two Comedians, Two Terminal Diagnoses\n4:11 – Steve’s Story: From Skin Cancer to 5 Months to Live\n10:06 – Alan’s Story: Rare Eye Cancer & Lost Trials\n17:28 – Why Not Me?

After the show, Allan a Baptist minister continued working at his church in Bootle, UK as normal but sought medical advice when he started to experience some issues with his vision in 2022. He has now been given one year to live after being diagnosed with a rare cancer and has been told by doctors they can do nothing more for him.  See below for his GoFundMe.\n\nSteve Legg is also a funnyman of faith who was given 120 days to live. He’s already passed that and his phenomenally successful  book The Last Laugh https://amzn.eu/d/hvoAj0W  tells the gripping story of rather than get busy dying he got busy living.

    "description": "Faith and fright: Navigating Christianity & occult entertainment. Occult-inspired imagery and storylines pervade much of popular culture. Horror has become mainstream. The debate is on entertainment choices for Christians. Should Christians watch whatever they want? Ex-psychic Jen Nizza warns against the dangers of the occult and shares her journey from divination to Christianity. Peter Laws, a pro-horror church minister, author and film critic argues that Christians should be discerning in their entertainment choices but says people have always had a fascination with the macabre and argues the case for escapism. \n\n#spirituality #ghoststories #ghosts #godandghosts  \n\nSOCIAL LINKS: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable\nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable\nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate\n\nFOR JENN: \nRead Jenn's life story from Psychic to Christian: https://shorturl.at/diFR2\nFind out more about Jenn Nizza and her journey to becoming a Christian, and her work exposing divination, the new age and the occult here: https://www.expsychicsaved.com/\n⬇️ Follow Jenn on Social Media\nYouTube:  @Expsychicsaved  \nTik Tok: @expsychicsaved\nIG: @expsychicsaved\n\nFOR PETER:\nRead Peter Laws series of books: https://shorturl.at/fijAQ\nCreepy Cove Podcast: https://www.creepycove.com\nFind out more: https://www.peterlaws.co.uk\n⬇️ Follow Peter on Social Media\nYouTube: @revpeterlaws\nX: @revpeterlaws\nIG: @revpeterlaws\nTik Tok: @revpeterlaws\n\nFor more on on this and related topics check out: \n📺 Occult & Demons: Is modern-day exorcism biblical?

    "description": "The debate is whether abortion should be decriminalised? This week in the UK, discussions are taking place in Parliament around various aspects of the Criminal Justice Bill. One of the most contentious areas is around a couple of tabled amendments* that would remove offences that make it illegal for a woman to perform a self-abortion at any point through to birth. There's lots to unpack about the potential decriminalisation of abortion, the ethical questions around a fetus's right to life and a woman's choice. Even if we can agree on when life begins how do we navigate the rights of the mother and the unborn child. Andy Kind is joined by Lois McLatchie, Senior Legal Communications Officer at ADF,  and Ellie Lee, Professor of Family and Parenting Research, SSPSSR, the Director for Centre for Parenting Culture Studies and the co-author of Parenting Culture Studies. \n*Since this show was recorded the proposed amendments discussed in this show have been withdrawn. The matter has been postponed to the Report stage of the Criminal Justice Bill. However, it is anticipated that similar amendments will be reintroduced during the floor debate in the House of Commons, where all Members of Parliament are expected to vote on the matter.\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\nFor Lois McLatchie: follow @LoisMcLatch on X formerly known as twitter \nFor Ellie Lee: follow @CPCS_UniKent and @SSPSSR on X formerly known as Twitter\n\nFor more on on this and related topics check out: \nLife, Equality and Choice: the abortion debate with Ann Furedi and Dr Calum Miller https://youtu.be/W6b-wKQO9gs?si=VTBN6YlSrIikZTAM\nShould praying outside aborting clinics be banned? with Ann Furedi and Lois McLatchie https://youtu.be/aK5anLOfRWI?si=P5G-_kK7WnK3pMkL\nChristianity, the sexual revolution and the future of the West with Louise Perry and Rod Dreher: https://youtu.be/MYf7aHe_GT0?si=UlTRY7GAq1HQ36Dl\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "Today on Unbelievable? Andy Kind hosts the first part of an occasional series on women in the church, how women are portrayed in the Bible, and questions around women in ministry. Why do women often feel unequal to men in Church? There are plenty of differing views and we will cover a number of them in the coming months. \n\nWomen in the Bible frequently emerge as devoted followers of Jesus, prominently present at significant events such as the tomb and the Cross. They function as followers and disciples of Jesus, with the Apostle Paul acknowledging and respecting female coworkers. However, our understanding often falls short in fully recognising the humanity of these female characters, as attention tends to be directed solely toward Jesus' interactions with them. This series aims to delve deeper into the lives of these women, offering a more comprehensive exploration that may reshape our perspectives today.\n\nFirst up we have Liz Cooledge Jenkins, a writer, preacher, and former college campus minister, and the author of Nice Churchy Patriarchy: Reclaiming Women’s Humanity from Evangelicalism. \n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lizcoolj\nhttps://www.instagram.com/postevangelicalprayers/\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "This week on Unbelievable we return to the topic of free will. Following the debate between Ben Shapiro and Alex O'Connor, Christian apologist Tim Stratton got in touch to say he took issue with some of Alex's arguments against free will. Indeed Tim noted that Alex agreed with Ben Shapiro that if there is no God, then there is no free will. Tim Stratton develops the argument in a spirited debate with atheist philosopher Alex Malpass. \n\nAlex Malpass has a PhD in philosophy from the University of Bristol, and these days specialises in philosophy of religion, but also metaphysics and logic more generally. He runs a podcast called Thoughtology and an infrequently updated blog called the Use of Reason.

    "description": "Ruth Jackson hosts this special edition of Premier Unbelievable? with Oxford scholar and C. S Lewis expert Dr. Alister McGrath.  Buy Alister McGrath's book on CS Lewis https://amzn.to/48Oi3RL\n\nCS Lewis - Jack to his friends - was a 20th Century British writer and lay theologian who is arguably one of the most influential voices in modern Christianity. On November 22nd 1963, Clive Staples Lewis died in Oxford, England. McGrath’s definitive biography C.S.Lewis A Life - Eccentric Genius Reluctant Prophet published in 2013 gives readers a glimpse of McGrath’s extensive research and a thorough chronological examination of Lewis’ correspondence and archival materials to present a new picture of Lewis’s life. The book paints a portrait of an eccentric thinker who became a compelling, if reluctant, prophet for our times. Writing in the London Telegraph, Philip Womach described author Dr. McGrath as a clear-eyed, and learned companion in exploring Lewis the man, and described his analysis of the Narnia books as 'illuminating'. \n\nListen to more of Alister McGrath and Ruth Jackson on their weekly in The C.S. Lewis Podcast. 60 years after his death,  Ruth Jackson puts a variety of listener’s questions to Dr. McGrath including is there an expiry date on C.S.

Unbelievable Host Vince Vitale guides us through as Goff argues that the traditional God is a bad explanation of cosmic purpose. Instead, he explores a range of alternative possibilities for accounting for cosmic purpose, from the speculation that we live in a computer simulation to the hypothesis that the universe itself is a conscious mind. \n\nRichard Swinburne is a Fellow of the British Academy, and has received honorary doctorates from three overseas universities. He was Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the University of Oxford from 1985 until 2002. Since then he has continued to lecture extensively in many countries. He is best known for his trilogy on the philosophy of theism -The Coherence of Theism, The Existence of God, and Faith and Reason.

    "description": "Ruth Jackson hosts a discussion about a 20th Century British writer and lay theologian who is arguably one of the most influential voices in modern Christianity. On November 22nd 1963, Clive Staples Lewis – Jack to his friends – died in Oxford, England. However, 60 years after his death, is CS Lewis still relevant?  Buy Alister McGrath's book on CS Lewis https://amzn.to/48Oi3RL\n\nWe hear from former pastor-turned atheist, Dan Barker, who suggests that many of Lewis’ arguments are fundamentally flawed. Literature professor, Dr Carolyn Weber, highlights where she disagrees with Dan and shares some of her story about coming to faith at Oxford University, in part through CS Lewis. Looking at some of Lewis’ key works, Dan and Carolyn discuss whether faith and reason are antithetical, if Christianity is true and in what ways Lewis speaks to us today.\n\nDan Barker spent many years as a Christian pastor before becoming an atheist. He is co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation and co-founder of The Clergy Project. Dan is an accomplished musician and author of many books, including God: The Most Unpleasant Character in all Fiction. \n\nDr Carolyn Webber is an award-winning author, professor and international speaker. Carolyn’s first memoir, Surprised by Oxford, recently became a feature film. Both the book and film tell her story of coming to faith from scepticism – a journey that, in many ways, mirrors CS Lewis’ own.\n \nFor the CS Lewis podcast, including an episode with Dr Carolyn Weber sharing more of her story and numerous episodes with Dan Barker discussing Lewis’ apologetics alongside Michael Ward: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/shows/the-cs-lewis-podcast\n \nFor Dan Barker and Martin Kuhrt discussing whether the God of the Bible is a capriciously malevolent, misogynistic, sadomasochistic bully: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/unbelievable/unbelievable-is-the-god-of-the-bible-a-capriciously-malevolent-misogynistic-sadomasochistic-bully-dan-barker-vs-martin-kuhrt/11653.article\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n \nFor Dr Carolyn Weber: https://www.carolynweber.com/about/\n \nFor Dan Barker: https://ffrf.org/about/staff-board/item/38960-dan-barker\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "title": "Christian, gay and celibate (or not)? with David Bennett, Taylor Telford & Billy Hallowell",
    "description": "Embark on a journey with host Billy Hallowell exploring a deep friendship between two academics with wildly opposing views but who both attest to the boundless love of God on this week’s podcast. This week’s Unbelievable features an insightful discussion featuring two individuals with contrasting LGBTQI+ faith journeys as they delve into the intersection of faith, sexuality, and the Bible. The debate is between two Christians, one gay and one queer, who have arrived at distinctly different interpretations of the Bible's teachings on sexual ethics, marriage, and human relationships.\n\nAs a young man Dr. David Bennett perceived Christianity as an adversary to LGBTQI+ freedom. Shaped by early encounters with prejudice and homophobia, he embraced life as a gay activist. Opposite David is Rev.Dr. Taylor Telford, an academic theologian whose journey led her from an evangelical upbringing to a progressive perspective, especially concerning gay marriage. Taylor serves as the Associate Pastor for Imaginative Worship at a PC(USA) congregation in Spokane, WA, and as adjunct faculty at Whitworth University and The Seattle School of Theology and Psychology.\n\nDavid Bennett's transformative conversion to Christianity, unfolded in a pub on the gay quarter of Sydney in his native Australia, and propelled him on a profound theological quest that ultimately led him to embrace an historically orthodox sexual ethic. Identifying as gay, a Christian, and living a celibate life, David is currently a postdoctoral research fellow and theologian at the University of Oxford, England. As the Anglican's General Synod meets this coming week and it appears gay and lesbian/ same-sex attracted Christians whatever their theological convictions are upset with the way Bishops have suggested implementing the Prayers of Love and Faith (PLF) in the Church of England, this is an unmissable episode of Premier Unbelievable.\n\nSOCIAL LINKS\nTwitter: / https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable \nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable \nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\nRead David's story\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/War-Loves-Bennett-David/dp/0310538106/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1699556413&sr=8-1\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "Can you be a serious scientist and believe in God, and even believe in miracles?   \n\nTom Rudelius never thought much about God until his brother, a new convert to Christianity, challenged him to explore faith. Tom, now a rising young theoretical physicist based at Durham University in the UK made a journey to unexpected faith, through subsequent doubt and anxiety, and ultimately to a firmer, life-transforming allegiance to Jesus. Phil and Tom wrestle with creation and cosmic origins, the problem of evil and suffering, the compatibility of miracles with science and the plausibility of Jesus’ resurrection.\n\nPhil Halper is an atheist, and Youtuber who's interviewed leading physicists from Stephen Hawking, Sir Roger Penrose to Alan Guth for his YouTube series Before the Big Bang. He is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and published several papers in peer reviewed journals on the Problem of Animal Suffering and has a new film on the subject which features other leading atheists such as Peter Singer and Alex O'Connor.\n \nTaking on Phil is Tom Rudelius author of 'Chasing proof, finding science'. Fresh from post doctoral research at UC Berkeley Tom is now Assistant Professor, Mathematical & Theoretical Particle Physics at Durham University, UK. Tom completed his undergraduate work at Cornell, earned a doctorate in physics at Harvard, and has conducted postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

    "description": "Should we fear AI or make friends with our robots?   How can humans flourish in this brave new world?  \n\nRoger Bolton hosts this edition of Unbelievable with writer and theologian Dr. Eve Poole and Prof. Beth Singler, a digital ethnographer. \n \nOur seemingly irrational qualities, like emotions and intuition, are what Unbelievable guest Dr. Eve Poole calls the \"junk\" code that define humanity, fostering the reciprocal altruism that sustains our existence. Eve argues the`hidden power of humans is that we are imperfect yet essential.\n\nEve Poole's argument might upset or even offend those with a fairly traditional faith, as she argues that we should consider giving robots 'souls'.  But if we give robots, as Eve suggests,  the 'junk code' of humans, will that lead to calls to give robots rights? How do we feel about giving rights to a toaster? Eve Poole did her PhD in Theology and Capitalism at the University of Cambridge and is an expert on leadership and education.\n\nProfessor Beth Singler is a digital ethnographer based at the University of Zurich. Beth explores the social, ethical, philosophical and religious implications of advances in Artificial Intelligence and robotics.\n \nhttps://bvlsingler.com/\nhttps://evepoole.com/\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "🌟 Unbelievable? 🌟\nPrepare for a captivating journey through history as Unbelievable? delves deep into the question: \"Did New Atheism Fail?\" Two intellectual titans, Alister McGrath, one of the world's foremost theologians, and Alex O’Connor, the Oxford-educated philosopher and celebrated YouTuber, engage in a thought-provoking debate that transcends time.  Get Alister's book here https://amzn.to/3Z3Jow0\n📚 Exploring \"Coming to Faith Through Dawkins\" 📚\nThis discussion is ignited by the release of the groundbreaking book \"Coming to Faith Through Dawkins,\" edited by Denis Alexander and Alister McGrath, hitting shelves on August 29, 2023. In its pages, the world's sharpest minds from Australia, South Africa, Egypt, the USA, and the UK come together to share a remarkable commonality: Richard Dawkins and the New Atheists played a pivotal role in their conversion to Christianity.\n🌎 A Global Perspective on Faith and Reason 🌍\nDespite diverse backgrounds and cultural influences, these individuals once ardently championed the ideas of the New Atheists, only to become disillusioned by Dawkins' arguments and conclusions. Their journeys led them to scrutinise religious faith with newfound objectivity, revealing that the fallacies Dawkins warned of simply do not exist.\n🧠 Meet the Debaters: 🧠\nAlister McGrath: A former atheist turned theologian, McGrath's journey to Christianity began during his studies in the natural sciences at Oxford University. With a storied career that includes roles such as Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford and President of the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics, McGrath is renowned for his intellectual prowess. His internationally acclaimed textbook, \"Christian Theology: An Introduction,\" translated into twenty languages, is just one testament to his impact. Stay tuned for his upcoming release, \"Christian Apologetics: An Introduction.\"\nAlex O’Connor: As a YouTuber and host of the Within Reason Podcast, O’Connor's mission is to make philosophy accessible to all. A graduate of philosophy and theology from St. John’s College, Oxford University, he has fearlessly defended his philosophical convictions against experts worldwide. His online content has garnered over seventy million views, and he's a sought-after international public speaker and debater.\n🔔 Join the Conversation! 🔔\nDon't miss this intellectual clash of the titans as they reexamine the legacy of New Atheism and its impact on faith and reason.

    "description": "Unbelievable takes on the often-misunderstood topic of deconstruction in the sense of deconstructing Christian faith or becoming exvangelical is another phrase you might have come across.\n\nIt refers to a process, some would say a movement, where individuals critically examine their beliefs, doctrines, and assumptions about Christianity. It often involves re-evaluating traditional interpretations of scripture, exploring different theological perspectives, and grappling with doubts and uncertainties.\n\nMany proponents of deconstruction argue that it can lead to a deeper and more authentic faith by shedding outdated or harmful beliefs and embracing a more personal and nuanced understanding of spirituality. Critics, on the other hand, express concerns that deconstruction can result in a crisis of one's most foundational beliefs crumble beneath them.\n\nBut is this at all surprising? With failures of the church to reflect Jesus, with abuse by Christian leaders in the news daily, where is one to turn? Will deconstruction take you deeper? Or will it destroy your belief altogether? Vince Vitale hosts this week, and his guests are Olivia Jackson author of (un) Certain A Collective Memoir of Deconstructing Faith and Preston Ulmer, founder of The Doubters Club and author of Deconstruct Faith Discover Jesus -  how questioning your religion can lead you to a healthy and holy God.\n\nOlivia's book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Certain-Collective-Memoir-Deconstructing-Faith/dp/0334063639\n\nPreston's book: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Preston-Ulmer/e/B098F92CQY/ref=aufs_dp_mata_dsk,https://www.instagram.com/ptulmer/,https://www.thedoubtersclub.com/startyourowndc\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "title": "Is violence ever justified? The dilemma of Nigeria’s Christians with Hassan John and Roger Bolton",
    "description": "More Christians are killed in Nigeria than in any other country in the world. According to the charity Open Doors almost nine in ten of the more than 5,600 Christians murdered worldwide during 2022 were in Nigeria.  A report by the British Parliament,  Nigeria: Unfolding Genocide? Three Years On, was released this week, and highlights the massacres. ‘When will the world wake up to the persecution of Nigerian Christians?’, asked a lone headline in the The Spectator magazine. Few other news outlets paid attention.  \n\nThis week, Unbelievable host Roger Bolton speaks to Archdeacon Hassan John, an Anglican minister from Jos in northern Nigeria who has lived through much of the violence.  A former journalist, he is now a church leader and campaigner for religious liberty, who tries to bring reconciliation between Christians and Muslims in the region. Hassan recalls harrowing tales of near-miss encounters with Islamic extremists and on-going anti-Christian violence which continues to tear apart communities.  He also discusses how he and other Christians attempt to work with Muslim in their communities to prevent the violence. \n\nThe Unbelievable conversation will help listeners understand the complexity of the situation of Nigeria and beyond, as well as asking some of the bigger questions facing Christians being persecuted for their faith worldwide.  Is it ever acceptable for Christians to respond to persecution with violence? How can Christians ever practice forgiveness and love for enemies who have killed or harmed their family and friends? And, more broadly, why does the Western media ignore the story in places like Nigeria? \n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "Even in a time of culture wars and controversy about everything, there are few subjects as difficult to discuss as transgender rights. In less than a decade the number of young people identifying as trans has exploded, and with it the number of arguments about the subject.  In British schools nearly 80% of teachers report trans-identified or non-binary students in their classroom. \n\nSupporters say being trans is innate, like being gay, and that this is like the gay-rights movement of 30 years ago, with lots of trans kids coming out of the closet to be themselves. Critics say being trans is not innate and that many kids are identifying as the opposite sex because it is cool, and because they are being indoctrinated by a new ideology, fed to them on social media and by activist teachers. \n\nThe debates have become most heated when it comes to actual medical transitioning.  In all of the disagreement, what frequently gets lost is the need for compassion for anyone struggling with dysphoria. But how far should compassion go? Should it allow any teenager who says they are trans to medically transition? What about the increasing number of studies showing that many such kids have other serious mental-health issues?  \n\nLaura Perry Smalts who was born female, and lived as a young man for almost 9 years. She took cross-sex hormones for years and had two major surgeries. She now regrets ever having done it, has detransitioned, and wants to warn others of the dangers. She is here to tell her story. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Transgender-Transformed-Story-Transition-Truly/dp/1933591307\n\nThis is a helpful article on the Living Out website on how to parent a child who is questioning their gender identity https://www.livingout.org/resources/articles/111/parenting-a-child-questioning-their-gender-identityThe Bayswater Support group helps parents whose children have some form of transgender of nonbinary identity https://www.bayswatersupport.org.ukA quick guide to the issue written for the Christian Medical Fellowship https://www.cmf.org.uk/resources/publications/content/?context=article&id=27357The Society for Evidence-based Gender Medicine https://segm.orgTransgender Trend campaign against medical interventions for gender-questioning children https://www.transgendertrend.comGenspect is an international coalition of professionals and others critical of transgender treatment for gender dysphoria https://genspect.orgThe Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender https://can-sg.org/\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "description": "This week Premier Unbelievable delves into the extraordinary life transformation of Joshua Broome. In this gripping interview we unravel the tale of a man who reached the pinnacle of fame and fortune in the adult film industry, only to be left empty, broken, and yearning for something more.  The interview has much to say to those struggling with addiction to porn, those caught up in creating it and those wondering what to do about its growing influence on our society. \n\n“I was one of the most successful adult film stars in the world,\" says Broome. \"I obtained fame, wealth, and travelled the world all to find out that none of those would fill the emptiness in my heart. Then, I found Jesus.\"\n \nBilly Hallowell, host of Unbelievable?,  peels back the layers of Joshua's remarkable journey, from his meteoric rise to be one of the top five male porn stars, with over 1,000 movies under his belt and numerous accolades, to his haunting realisation that success alone couldn't fill the void within his soul. Joshua describes 2012, the year he won male porn performer of the year, as the worst year of his life. \n\nDiscover how Joshua found redemption in Jesus which led him eventually to become a pastor. Through his own experiences, he shares profound insights on how we can confront our past actions, and any shame attached to them, to embrace forgiveness and find true fulfilment. It’s a transformative personal narrative, which offers hope to those wanting to escape the grip of pornography, as well as a warning about the broader dangers of porn within society. \n\nhttps://www.joshuabroome.me/\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/iamjoshuabroome/?hl=en\n\nIf you would like someone to talk to about anything that has affected you by this show, please call Premier Lifeline our confidential helpline offering a listening ear, and emotional and spiritual support.

    "description": "Is the occult just harmless fun? Or are there hidden dangers to alternative spirituality, satanism, and even new-age practices? Increasingly the debate is not about good vs evil but my truth vs your truth. Ex-psychic Jenn Nizza tells the story of her escape from the occult to Christianity to host Billy Hallowell journalist and author of 'Playing with Fire'. Joining the conversation is deliverance minister Mike Signorelli, lead pastor and founder of V1 Church based in New York City. So is popular culture capitalising on our interest in all things satanic and demonic, or leading us to it? Pauline follows the story of Pauline, an 18-year-old who has school stress, the climate crisis, and the general downfall of society weighing on her mind. This becomes even more complicated when she becomes pregnant from a one-night stand with Lukas, who turns out to be the devil.  What's even more surprising is that this German original show has been green-lit by Disney+, the home of Pixar movies, Mickey Mouse, and National Geographic. So what’s going on here? Should we be pushing back against this obsession with evil, or just chilling out?  And are we in danger of creating a future that no-one wants to live in?\n\n#spirituality #ghoststories #ghosts #godandghosts  \n\nSOCIAL LINKS: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/unbelievablefe\nFacebook:  / https://facebook.com/premierunbelievable\nInstagram:  / https://instagram.com/premierunbelievable\nTik Tok: / https://tiktok.com/@premier.unbelievable\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• Support us: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate\n\nFor JENN: \nRead Jenn's life story from Psychic to Christian: https://shorturl.at/diFR2\nFind out more about Jenn Nizza and her journey to becoming a Christian, and her work exposing divination, the new age and the occult here: https://www.expsychicsaved.com/\n⬇️ Follow Jenn on Social Media\nYouTube:  @Expsychicsaved  \nTik Tok: @expsychicsaved\nIG: @expsychicsaved\n\nFor MIKE: \nFind out more: https://mikesignorelli.com/\nRead Mike's book From Chaos to Clarity: No Turning Back here: https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Clarity-No-Turning-Back/dp/1952602696\n⬇️ Follow Mike on Social Media\nYouTube: @mikesignorelli_ \nIG: @mikesignorelli_\n\nFor more on on this and related topics check out: \n📺 Ex-psychic Jenn Nizza & horror author Pete Laws debate occult horror and divination in entertainment | https://youtu.be/AC3drCh-YkY?si=ZoNCX6NWIt6b3DHD\n📺 Halloween led me to Christianity | https://youtu.be/mRgk0HsCOWE?\nsi=IIOCbveTnefkmkv4\n📺 Ex-healer astrologer Angela Ucci debates demonic new age & theology  with Matt Arnold & Billy Hallowell | https://youtu.be/ogIBLls4FHc?si=ZUJ8T2LjsisyzvCy",

Tim Keller's impact extends far beyond his time, as he fearlessly explored the intricate relationship between faith and culture. With City to City, and other nonprofit organisations he spearheaded, and as the founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan alongside his wife Kathy, Keller seamlessly integrated ancient wisdom into the fabric of the modern city. With his quiet confidence and lack of defensiveness, he made faith thrilling and relevant, captivating hearts with timeless truths. As he neared the end of his journey, Keller taught us about death and dying well. He also shared invaluable advice from the book of Jeremiah: to live on the razor's edge, embrace audacious faith; invest rather than simply consume, leaving a lasting impact on others; and let go of the pursuit of reputation, recognising the fleeting nature of worldly acclaim. Unbelievable? discusses the life of Tim Keller, his style and impact, the question of suffering, how he refused to be drawn in but navigated the culture wars, and the wisdom he leaves through his many books. Unbelievable? show host Ruth Jackson is joined by three guests who knew and worked with Keller.  Lecrae, Grammy award-winning hip-hop artist and actor; Dr. Krish Kandiah, author and social activist; and Pete Wehner, journalist and senior fellow at Trinity Forum all offer candid insights into the profound ways Keller impacted their lives both personally and through his extensive body of work.  As always let us know what you think! We love to hear from you so get in touch if you have stories to share.  And enjoy this edition of Unbelievable as we honour Tim Keller life and legacy and the far-reaching influence of his ministry. \n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

    "title": "Life, Equality, and Choice: The Abortion Debate | Ann Furedi & Dr. Calum Miller",
    "description": "Get ready for a riveting episode of Unbelievable?  part of our ongoing series Rights of Life and Death. Today in The Abortion Debate:  Life, Equality, and Choice, we're diving headfirst into the contentious and thought-provoking topic of abortion. What does it mean to say that life begins? What would it take for the fetus or the child to have a right to life, and for this to outweigh the mother’s right to choice?  How do we determine moral value?  It's a debate that strikes at the very core of life, equality, and personal choice. Brace yourselves as we navigate the delicate balance between the rights of the child and the rights of the mother.\n\nJoining us on this electrifying debate led by moderator Roger Bolton are two extraordinary guests. First, we have Ann Furedi, a leading global pro-choice advocate for almost 40 years,  who worked for 17 years as CEO of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. She has written extensively on the ethics of abortion and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Social Sciences by the University of Kent.  Her groundbreaking book, 'The Moral Case for Abortion: A Defense of Reproductive Choice,' lays out the moral arguments empowering women to make decisions about their pregnancies. \n\nBut that's not all. Presenting the Christian worldview and opposing abortion on demand is Dr. Calum Miller, an NHS doctor and an unwavering pro-life advocate. With a medical degree from the prestigious University of Oxford and a deep understanding of philosophy and biblical studies, Dr. Miller brings a unique insight into the intricacies of abortion policy in practice. He's here to challenge our assumptions and shed light on the moral value of the unborn.\n\nIn this high-voltage discussion, we'll explore the burning questions that lie at the heart of the abortion debate. When does life truly begin? Is there ever a justifiable reason to take another life? How do we assign moral value to the unborn? And are there conditions that would tip the scales in favour of granting the fetus a right to life that supersedes a mother's right to choice?\n\nHold on tight as we unpack the very definitions of 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' and their profound implications for the beginning of life, human equality, and personal autonomy. We won't shy away from the tough questions, including the role of women's choice and the intersection of abortion with women's equality. And for those wondering if men should have a voice in this conversation, we'll address that too.\nPrepare for an exhilarating, thought-provoking, and mind-expanding discussion. Tune in to this week's episode of Unbelievable as we embark on a quest to unravel the intricate threads of the abortion debate. Don't miss out on this explosive episode.\n\nAs always we want to hear what you think, perhaps you have a story or a testimony to share?  Do get in touch with us via our social channels or email us unbelievable@premier.org.uk\nAnd if you want to get access to bonus content and get early bird access to online events sign up for our newsletter: https://account.premierunbelievable.com/register\n\nAnn Furedi's book is The Moral Case for Abortion: A Defence of Reproductive Choice  https://www.amazon.co.uk/Moral-Case-Abortion-Defence-Reproductive/dp/3030901882/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1684796806&refinements=p_27%3AAnn+Furedi&s=books&sr=1-1\n\nCalum Miller an ethicist, philosopher and doctor has created a website https://calumsblog.com/  offering a weath of information on all the questions [https://calumsblog.com/abortion-qa/] and topics surrounding the sanctity of life.

What about the vulnerable who could have their end hastened – who decides? 🤔\n\nWith the UK Government preparing for a pivotal debate on assisted dying, this topic is sparking major conversations across the nation. Following a BBC documentary featuring actress Liz Carr, the spotlight is shining brightly on the question: should anyone be eligible for medical assistance in dying? 🏥\n\n🇨🇦 A shocking Canadian survey reveals that poverty, homelessness, mental illness, and disability are increasingly seen as valid reasons for euthanasia:\n💸 41% say poverty justifies it.\n♿ 60% believe being disabled is enough.\n\nBut should doctors—who are meant to heal—also help end lives? What does Christianity have to say? Are we playing God by deciding when to die?\n\nJoin host Roger Bolton as he moderates this crucial conversation featuring two doctors with vastly opposing views:\n🌍 UK’s Dr. Mark Pickering (Christian Medical Fellowship)\n🇨🇦 Canada’s Dr. Ellen Wiebe\n\n🚨 This debate is more relevant than ever.

    "description": "This week on Unbelievable’s Coronation special Roger Bolton asks how important is the established Church of England to the fabric of life in the United Kingdom and beyond?  Does King Charles as Supreme Governor of the Church of England have divine purpose?  Academic and author Dr. Jonathan Chaplin of Wesley House, Cambridge suggests we should ditch the religious aspects of the Coronation to better reflect multicultural Britain.  Catherine Pepinster author and broadcaster argues the sacral aspects of the Coronation act as a enduring symbol of the country's heritage. Will King Charles III embrace Christianity as a guiding force in his reign? Should he forge a new path for a changing nation?  And what is the role of the established church in public life?  \n\nCatherine Pepinster is an author and expert on the history of coronations, and was editor of the Catholic Tablet journal for over 13 year. She is the author of Defenders of the Faith - The British Monarchy, Religion and the Next Coronation and explains the significance of the deeply sacred Christian event and the unifying role it can play in the nation and beyond.  Dr. Jonathan Chaplin wrote Beyond Establishment - Resetting Church-State relations in England and - as a committed Christian and Anglican - proposes a radical rethinking, of the relationship between the Church and the state. \n\nFollow Catherine Pepinster on Twitter @CPsPepTalk\nor her blog here peptalk519.wordpress.com\n\nFollow Jonathan Chaplin here  where he is an Honorary Fellow at Wesley House, Cambridge\nhttps://www.wesley.cam.ac.uk/single-page-profile/?smid=8691\n\n\nBooks referenced in the podcast:\n\nCatherine Pepinster's book\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Defenders-Faith-Charles-coronation-Christianity/dp/1399800078/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YYU7RLTNQ86O&keywords=CAtherine+pepinster&qid=1683170895&sprefix=catherine+pepinster%2Caps%2C71&sr=8-1\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Defenders-Faith-Monarchy-Religion-Coronation/dp/139980006X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=KTP3JQN0TGPO&keywords=catherine+pepinster%27s+defender+of+the+faith&qid=1683170972&sprefix=Catherine+pepinster%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-1\n\n\nDr Jonathan Chaplin's book \n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Establishment-Resetting-Church-State-Relations/dp/0334061733/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2W4EMUWTFGOJW&keywords=jonathan+chaplin&qid=1683170924&sprefix=jonathan+chaplin%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-1\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Establishment-Resetting-Church-State-Relations-ebook/dp/B0B4F6CGCM/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3MRA7ZO4VX4NT&keywords=jonathan+chaplin&qid=1683171020&sprefix=jonathan+chaplin%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-4\n\n\n• Subscribe to the Unbelievable? podcast: https://pod.link/267142101\n• More shows, free eBook & newsletter: https://premierunbelievable.com\n• For live events: http://www.unbelievable.live\n• For online learning: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/training\n• Support us in the USA: http://www.premierinsight.org/unbelievableshow\n• Support us in the rest of the world: https://www.premierunbelievable.com/donate",

What questions or objections about Christian faith do you find most challenging or important?\n\nWhether you’re a Christian seeking to grow in your faith, or a skeptic wanting to find out more, you’re invited to attend and submit your questions for on-the-spot answers.\n\nWilliam Lane Craig will also be in conversation with Justin Brierley about some of his latest projects and research. His online ministry Reasonable Faith has released an exciting new apologetics resource called Equip, and Dr Craig has been busy working on a complete systematic theology, as well as – in his own words – “grabbing the third rail with both hands” by taking on the question of Adam & Eve’s existence!\n\n​This live online event is free to attend, but advance registration is essential https://www.unbelievable.live/",

    "description": "A brand new weekly podcast with Professor Alister McGrath exploring C.S. Lewis’ thought, theology and teaching.\n\nC.S. Lewis is one of the most influential voices in modern Christianity. The 20th Century British writer and lay theologian has profoundly impacted Christians around the world and brought many atheists and agnostics to faith in Jesus.\n\nOne person whose faith was greatly encouraged by the writings of C.S. Lewis is Professor Alister McGrath. Both men were raised in Northern Ireland, studied at Oxford University and went on to become professors there. They also both came to faith from atheism slightly later in life. Alister has written numerous books on C.S. Lewis, including a seminal biography C.S. Lewis – A Life.\n\nEvery Monday, Ruth Jackson and Professor Alister McGrath will reflect on C.S. Lewis’ ideas, life and influence as well as trying to answer questions that impact culture today.\n\nhttp://www.cslewispodcast.com\n\nFor more info on Alister MacGrath: \nhttps://www.premierchristianradio.com/Presenters/Alister-McGrath\n\nTo find out more about the launch of this podcast and receive exclusive content from Alister McGrath, sign up to the Unbelievable? newsletter: https://www.premier.org.uk/resource/unbelievable/",
