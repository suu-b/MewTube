    "description": "part 2 coming soon!\n\nokay so yesterday i was thinking about how i wanna bring back bedtime stories, belly rubs and naps. And; im also learning to give myself the romance i expect from others. So here we go: a bedtime story - From me to you :)\n\nthis is actually my favourite story of all time, and also the first book we're reading in the Book Club: Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka. It's about a guy, Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning, as a bug (lol mood).\n\nI hope this absurdist-existentialist story about alienation, family and the torture of capitalism can soothe your anxiety and help you sleep better at night.\n\nALSO; dont forget - my first book club meeting is on Saturday December 12th at 3pm EST. We'll be discussing Part I (and maybe Part II) of metamorphosis. All details are on my patreon: www.patreon.com/bobosvoid\n\nP.S I'm definitely not a good actor or by any means a professional storyteller, but hope u enjoy falling asleep to absurdism :))))))\n\nSummary:\n\"The Metamorphosis\" is a novella by Franz Kafka, first published in 1915 and one of his best known works. The story begins with a traveling salesman, Gregor Samsa, waking to find himself transformed into a horrible verminous creature. Terrifying in its banal simplicity, it became one of the seminal works of the twentieth century.",
