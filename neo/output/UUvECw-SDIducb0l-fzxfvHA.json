    "description": "Is James Gunn’s _Superman_ still the moral hero audiences once recognized—or has the Man of Steel been reshaped by modern cultural values?\n\nIn this episode, we examine Gunn’s vision of Superman alongside earlier portrayals, from the moral clarity of Richard Donner’s Superman to the conflicted restraint seen in more recent iterations. But this discussion goes deeper than filmmaking. It asks a cultural and philosophical question: *what do we mean by “good” anymore?*\n\nFrom a Christian worldview, we explore how stories shape moral imagination—especially when compassion is detached from objective truth. Is today’s Superman a symbol of timeless virtue, or a reflection of a culture that prefers sentiment over moral authority?\n\nIf you care about faith, culture, and the ideas shaping our heroes, this conversation matters.\n\n👉 Subscribe for thoughtful Christian engagement with film, culture, and apologetics.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/\n\n00:00 – Why Superman Still Shapes Our Moral Imagination\n02:15 – James Gunn’s Superman: What Kind of Hero Is He?\n06:10 – Superman as a Moral Symbol, Not Just a Superhero\n11:05 – Classic Superman vs. Modern Interpretations\n16:40 – When Compassion Replaces Moral Authority\n22:30 – From Objective Good to Cultural Sentiment\n28:15 – Is This Still a Hero Christians Can Affirm?\n34:05 – Superman, Christ Figures, and Secular Salvation\n40:10 – What These Stories Teach Us About Good and Evil\n46:35 – Why Culture Keeps Rewriting Its Heroes\n52:20 – Final Reflections: Can Modern Heroes Point to Truth?\n01:02:55 – Closing Thoughts and Takeaways",

Drawing from philosophy, real-world AI failures, and Christian theology, this conversation dismantles the myth of sentient machines and exposes the ethical blind spots built into every algorithm.\n\nFrom self-driving car tragedies and AI hallucinations to biased datasets, digital surveillance, and even “AI Jesus,” this episode explores what happens when we confuse simulation with understanding. You’ll learn why machines can never be conscious, why morality cannot be outsourced to algorithms, and why the greatest threat of AI isn’t rebellion—but human surrender.\nIf you care about truth, ethics, faith, and the future of humanity, this is a conversation you can’t afford to ignore.\n\n👉 Topics covered include:\n• Why AI is not truly intelligent\n• The Chinese Room & Turing Test explained\n• Real AI failures you’ve never heard about\n• Bias, hallucinations, and ethical blinders\n• Can machines make moral decisions?\n• AI, Christianity, and the image of God\n• The real danger: human laziness and dependence\n\n🔔 Subscribe for more conversations at the intersection of faith, culture, and reason.\n💡 Support this ministry and keep content like this free by donating below.\n\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/\n\n00:00 – Why AI Isn’t the Threat We Think It Is\n02:40 – The Target Story: When Algorithms Know Too Much\n06:50 – Why “AI” Is a Misleading Marketing Term\n09:20 – The Three Types of AI Explained (ANI, AGI, ASI)\n13:40 – Why Today’s AI Can’t Actually Think\n18:00 – Hollywood vs Reality: Skynet, Terminator, and Fear\n20:40 – Every Technology Gets Weaponized—AI Will Too\n23:00 – The Fatal Flaw: AI Doesn’t Understand Anything\n27:00 – The Chinese Room Argument Explained Simply\n30:40 – Why Machines Can Never Be Conscious\n35:20 – The Benefits of AI (Yes, There Are Some)\n39:30 – The Ethics Problem No One Can Avoid\n43:00 – Self-Driving Cars and the New Trolley Problem\n47:20 – “AI Jesus” and Algorithmic Theology\n51:00 – Blinders: What AI Cannot See\n56:00 – Blinkers: How AI Steers Human Behavior\n59:30 – Surveillance, Social Credit, and Big Brother\n01:03:40 – The Greatest AI Threat: Human Laziness\n01:08:30 – Why AI Can’t Replace What Makes Us Human\n01:13:30 – The Image of God vs the Age of the Machine\n01:16:40 – Final Takeaway: Why Intelligence Isn’t Artificial",

    "description": "Are there contradictions in the Bible? Critics confidently claim “the Bible is full of errors,” and many Christians feel anxious when challenged. But tonight, we’re taking those challenges head-on — and showing why most so-called contradictions collapse the moment you understand context, language, and logic. \n\nIn this episode of Christianity in the Hot Seat, Lenny Esposito breaks down how allegations of “contradictions” often rely on modern assumptions, selective reading, or ignoring how ancient people communicated. Expecting ancient writers to use robot-level precision is a mistake skeptics make all the time — and we’ll show why that isn’t how history works. \n\n💡 What you’ll learn in this episode:\n✔ What a real logical contradiction actually is\n✔ Why translation style ≠ inconsistency\n✔ How Hebrew idioms and figures of speech work\n✔ Why Gospel writers include different details\n✔ How copyist typos differ from “biblical error”\n✔ Why “modern categories” can’t judge ancient texts\n✔ How “God vs Satan tempting David” is easily resolved \n\nYou’ll see examples skeptics love to use — like Jesus’ last words, creation order in Genesis 1 vs 2, whether bats are “birds,” and the number of Solomon’s horses — and you’ll learn how to respond confidently with context and clarity. \n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/\n\n#BibleContradictions #ChristianApologetics #BiblicalReliability #DefendingTheFaith #Jesus #gospelsinger \n00:00 — The Claim That Shakes Faith: Is the Bible Full of Contradictions?\n00:26 — Why Skeptics Attack Scripture (And Why They’re Wrong)\n01:14 — Locked Down but Not Defeated: Launching “Christianity in the Hot Seat”\n02:21 — The Skeptic’s Trap: A Faulty Premise Exposed\n02:50 — Bible Confusion in a Post-Christian Culture\n03:51 — “If the Bible Is from God…Why All the Errors?” Challenge Addressed\n07:19 — Don’t Bluff!

    "title": "Is Christianity Oppressive to Women? History Says the Exact Opposite",
    "description": "Is Christianity truly oppressive to women—or is that one of the most persistent cultural myths of our age? Modern Western society often mocks Christianity as sexist, regressive, or a barrier to human progress. Yet history tells a very different story—one where Christianity uniquely elevates human dignity, uplifts women, and lays the foundation for human flourishing.\n\nIn this episode, Lenny Esposito walks through Romans 16 and shows how the early church shattered ancient cultural norms about gender, ethnicity, class, and status. Paul’s list of greetings reveals surprising truths: women played critical leadership roles, were trusted with Scripture, financially supported the church, planted house churches, mentored preachers, served as deacons, and were praised for their labor in the Gospel.\n\nWe also compare the Christian view of women with the treatment of women in ancient Greece, Rome, first-century Judaism, India (Sati), Islamic nations, and pre-modern Asian cultures. The contrast is stark—and it shows why women historically flocked to Christianity, seeing in it a dignity they found nowhere else.\n\nYou’ll also discover why Christianity fosters human flourishing through community, purpose, moral formation, and redemption. Modern culture may prefer comfort, amusement, and autonomy—but Scripture calls us into a richer, more meaningful life grounded in relationships, equality, and sacrificial love.\n\nIf you’ve ever heard that Christianity is sexist or “oppressive,” this episode digs deep into the historical, sociological, and biblical evidence to set the record straight.\n\n👉 Chapters include:\n• Real human relationships and the Body of Christ\n• How church community improves mental, emotional, and social well-being\n• The full historical record of how women were treated in the ancient world\n• Why Paul trusted women with leadership, teaching, and Scripture\n• How Christianity became the first truly multicultural, multiethnic movement\n• Why the Gospel transforms enemies into brothers and strangers into family\n• Why human flourishing is impossible without a transcendent source of dignity\n\nIf this message encourages you, consider subscribing, sharing, and supporting our work.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/\n\n#Christianity #Women #HumanFlourishing #ChristianHistory #FaithAndCulture #biblicalworldview \n\n⭐ Chapter Divisions \n00:00 – Modern Accusations Against Christianity\n00:32 – What Does It Mean to Flourish as Humans?\n01:21 – Introduction to the Romans 16 Study\n01:26 – Why Romans 16 Matters: Real people, real churches, and real relationships.\n03:20 – The “Real World” Analogy vs. Real Christian Community\n07:40 – The Early Church as Historical Reality\n08:37 – Why Relationship Is Central to Human Flourishing\n09:37 – Human Flourishing vs. Modern Individualism\n10:14 – Christianity’s Three Pillars of Flourishing\n11:12 – Reading Romans 16\n13:20 – Why Paul Focuses on Relationships\n15:47 – We Are Social, Relational Beings\n19:37 – Why Church Community Outperforms Secular Community\n23:25 – Why Secular “Church Imitations” Fail\n26:01 – Christianity’s Radical Multiculturalism\n27:48 – Confronting Modern Anti-Semitism and Cultural Backlash\n30:11 – “Neither Male nor Female”: True Christian Equality\n31:10 – Is Christianity Oppressive to Women?\n32:04 – How Women Were Really Treated in the Ancient World\n39:14 – Women in Romans 16\n45:19 – Women’s Equal Worth in Scripture\n47:19 – Women as Witnesses of the Resurrection\n50:16 – Women and Spiritual Gifts\n52:10 – Women, Literacy, and Global Christian Missions\n54:46 – Purpose, Service, and Sacrifice in the Church\n59:01 – Making Friends Out of Enemies\n1:04:40 – Simon of Cyrene’s Family and Romans 16\n1:07:52 – What the Real World Needs from the Church\n1:08:42 – “Greet One Another with a Holy Kiss”\n1:11:08 – Final Exhortation and Prayer",

    "title": "Christian Nationalism or Biblical Patriotism: What's the Biblical Mandate?",
    "description": "Christian nationalism has been blazing in the headlines, but what exactly is it?  Is it wrong for Christians to express their patriotism publicly? Here, Lenny Esposito and Daniel Darling explore the complex relationship between Christian faith, patriotism, and the concern raised in the media over Christian Nationalism. They look at  the biblical teaching on loving one’s country,  the importance of gratitude in fostering a healthy sense of patriotism, the role of Christians in engaging with politics, and the need for discernment in political allegiances. The conversation emphasizes the significance of local engagement and the church's role in renewing society, while also tackling contentious issues like immigration and family values.\n\nTakeaways\n• Christian nationalism is often misunderstood and mischaracterized.\n• Gratitude is essential for a healthy sense of patriotism.\n• Christians should engage in politics without compromising their faith.\n• The government should not coerce belief or dictate religious practices.\n• Local engagement is crucial for effective civic participation.\n• Patriotism can coexist with a commitment to the kingdom of God.\n• Christians should view political parties as mission fields.\n• The church plays a vital role in societal renewal.\n• Immigration policies should prioritize human dignity and safety.\n• A strong family structure is foundational for a thriving society.\n\nGet Daniel Darling's new book _In Defense of Christian Patriotism_ on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3LjohkN\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/",

    "title": "Why \"Love Is Love\" is a Lie",
    "description": "In a world obsessed with heart emojis, rom-coms, and \"Love Island\" marathons, love feels like the ultimate virtue. But what if the catchy slogan \"Love is Love\" is actually a dangerous half-truth? What if it's blinding us to the radical, self-sacrificial love God calls us to—and the counterfeit versions that lead straight to heartbreak and hypocrisy?\n\nJoin me in this eye-opening talk as we unpack why our culture's fuzzy, feel-good take on love falls short of the Bible's blueprint. Drawing from Jesus' greatest commandments (Mark 12:30-31), John's call to \"love one another\" (John 13:34), and Paul's blueprint in Romans 12, we'll expose:\n\nThe Cultural Trap: From Valentine's Day hype to the \"Love Has No Labels\" campaign, how emotional, self-seeking \"love\" dominates—and why even its champions dodge the extremes (like NAMBLA's twisted claims).\n\nTrue Love Defined: C.S. Lewis's The Four Loves meets Scripture—storge, phileo, eros, and agape. Discover why love without God isn't love at all, and how \"allowing free expression\" can enable harm (think de-transition regrets and lawsuits).\n\nLoving Inside the Church: Discernment that hates evil to cling to good. Build affection, honor, zeal, patience, generosity, hospitality, sympathy, harmony, and humility—as a family that rejoices and weeps together (Romans 12:9-16).\n\nLoving Outside the Church: The radical call to bless persecutors, feed enemies, and conquer evil with good (Romans 12:17-21). No room for cancel culture or vigilantism—leave vengeance to God, and watch \"heaping burning coals\" spark repentance.\n\nFinally, we'll count the cost: As Lewis warns, locking your heart away leads to damnation. True love risks everything—because it's modeled after Christ's.\nIf you're a Christian hungry for authentic faith in a loveless world, or anyone wrestling with what love really means, this is for you. Hit play, grab your Bible, and let's renew our minds (Romans 12:2).\n\nWhat’s YOUR take on \"Love is Love\"? Drop a comment below—did it challenge you?

    "description": "The question of whether Muslims and Christians worship the same God has set social media ablaze, with the Roman Catholic Church arguing \"Yes\" based on philosophical grounds. But is this claim accurate? In this Come Let Us Reason Podcast, Lenny Esposito unpacks the controversy, examining the arguments and highlighting a critical point others have missed. Esposito argues that the theological differences between Christianity and Islam make the \"same God\" claim untenable, offering a fresh perspective on this divisive issue. From the nature of God to the core tenets of each faith, this episode breaks down why the two cannot be reconciled.\n\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/\n\n\nTHE ARGUMENT:\n\n1. Christians worship the one true God.\n2. Worship, by its nature, has constraints.\n     2.1. People can worship many things in many ways, whether true of false.\n     2.2. Different types of worship will have different types of constraints.\n     2.3. However, all worship entails some type of submission to the thing worshiped.\n3. Therefore, for worshipping the one true God to obtain, one must seek submission to that God.\n4. Obedience is a necessary part of submission.\n     4.1. If one intentionally rejects the requirements the one true God reveals for worship of him, one is not in submission to him.\n     4.2. Therefore, if one intentionally rejects the requirements the one true God reveals for worship of him, one is not worshipping him.\n5. Muslims consciously reject the requirements for worshipping the one true God.\n6. Therefore, Muslims do not worship the one true God.\n7. Therefore, Muslims and Christians do not worship the same God.",

Here we see how Tobey McGuire's Spider-Man brings us a vivid illustration of what happens when we allow that sin nature to overtake us. We’ll also look at practical ways to escape the clutches of that fate.\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/",

    "description": "Can Christian morality guide modern governance without alienating a diverse society? This podcast explores the provocative question of whether biblical principles, like ordered love—prioritizing God, family, and community—should influence legislation. Dr. Darren Guerra and Dr. Jacob Daneil join Lenny to discuss whether governments share the same moral duties as individuals, such as charity and justice, or if their role is distinct. The discussion traces the rule of law’s roots to Christian ethics while questioning how far biblical mandates should extend to secular institutions. Should governments enforce virtues like forgiveness or stewardship, or is their purpose purely pragmatic? With rising cultural divides, we examine if Christian morality offers a unifying framework or risks exclusion. Join us for a nuanced debate on balancing faith, freedom, and governance in today’s world.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttps://www.comereason.org\nhttps://x.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\nhttps://www.instagram.com/comereason/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@comereason/",

Christianity teaches that a perfect God created all people knowing that every one of them would be thoroughly evil. He even gave his commands to the Jews, knowing they wouldn’t be able to keep his laws. How can God then judge us, knowing we were made fallible? Doesn’t this also make God ultimately responsible for the evil we see in our world?

    "description": "If God really wants us to believe in him, then why doesn’t He show himself more clearly? The idea that God is hidden, that if he were real he would provide obvious signs to us mere mortals proving his existence is a charge that many skeptics have leveled against believers.  When asked what he would say if after he died he was face to face with God, atheist Bertrand Russel famously replied “Not enough evidence!”\n\nToday, I bring you a talk I recently gave at the Defend Conference in New Orleans. Here I address the charge that God’s hiddenness counts against him being real, tackling issues like the so-called missing miracles today, as well as some more sophisticated objections, like those given by philosopher J.L Shellenberg. We will learn why God’s hiddenness is actually important and good for us.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

    "description": "Is there such a thing as a Deep Fake Christian? The problem of deep-fake Christians—those who act and sound like true followers of Jesus when their beliefs are actually different than what he taught—has been a real problem ever since the inception of the church. How can one tell what marks a true Christian from someone who has been corrupted by a deep fake? Is it simply a desire to follow Jesus, to follow the conviction of the Holy Spirit? As the Apostle John warned the local church in his day, we must be careful because there are wolves out there who like to dress as sheep and, as they say, The Devil's in the details.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

But what Dawkins forgets is for any society to sustain the fruits of Christianity, there needs to be a strong root of true belief in Jesus.

Within the church there are two primary views that Christians hold: God has predestined us to be saved but we also have liberty—we may choose to either follow or deny him.

    "description": "What Does Athens Have to do with Jerusalem? That question was first famously asked by the church father Tertullian when he was contemplating the relationship between Greek philosophy and church theology. Today, many people wonder the same thing. Do we need all that egghead scholasticism or can’t we just love Jesus? Yet, for most of Christian history the pastors *were* the professors! It is only recently that some mistakenly separate belief from intellectual scholarship. Listen in to learn just how much Christian scholarship can contribute to the church and why we need both to love God with all our minds as well as our hearts. \n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

    "description": "Most people who believe in an afterlife hope to be in a paradise. Many will speak of a loving God who wants to give good things to those he loves. But if God is all-loving, how can He stand to send people to Hell? Why would He even create Hell in the first place? \n\nIn this podcast, Lenny explains how God's nature of love actually demands that Hell exists and that the punishment of sin is actually a result of a loving and just God. Watch to find out just how beautiful eternity is.

    "description": "A lot of attention has been given to the alarming trend of young people leaving the faith. Both parents and pastors are concerned as they see kids raised in Bible-believing churches who attended youth group each week \"deconvert\" or identify as one of the \"nones\". How do we communicate the importance and validity of the gospel to young people whose lives and values have been significantly influenced by our modern anti-Christian culture? In this podcast, Lenny joins with Harry Edwards and Jonathan Noyes to talk about ways we can reach out to Gen Z and better communicate the importance of Christianity in living a good life. \n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

    "description": "\"Just how many belief systems did you try before settling on your particular one?\" It is a question that seems to challenge the idea of Christianity as the best understanding of how the world works.  Yet, claiming that one must try all different religions before determining the truth lacks practicality and logical coherence.In this study, springing from a passage in Hebrews chapter 5, Lenny examines how one can rationally eliminate many of the different faiths because they hold incoherent views about God internally. He then turns towards a fuller examination of Judaism and Christianity, demonstrating how Jesus as messiah is the logical completion of the Old Testament faith. \n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

And as for the Christian who is not conscious of his dilemma—and he is in the majority—he is becoming more and more de-Christianized by all sorts of unconscious pressure: paganism holds all the most valuable advertising space.\" That's the theme of this recent Q&A session that took place at Rock Hill Church. \n\nLenny fielded questions from the audience dealing with issues of doubt, confronting the anti-Christian culture, and how science can inform faith.

They fail to realize just how foreign certain Christian beliefs and assumptions are to people today.  Even though we share many cultural touchstones, there are still significant barriers that must be over come to better communicate the great need for Jesus today. \n\nIn this podcast, Lenny joins the Apologetics.com team to identify some of the barriers to belief and how to overcome them in our witnessing efforts.

Critics claim that while the God of the New Testament is a filled with love and forgiveness while the Old Testament God is a God of vengeful wrath. Of course, nothing is further from the truth. In this podcast, Lenny looks at the book of Joel, when God calls judgment upon wayward Israel, and shows how God's actions truly reflect his love and concern for his people. We then turn to our plight today and understand that God can only be considered a loving God if he also upholds justice.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

What does it mean that the new sexual politics, these new identity concepts which are being introduced to our children and to our nation are starting to pull apart the very building block of society that is the family?

The fact \nthat moral values and duties really exist is difficult to square with an atheistic understanding of the world. If there are at least some \nmoral precepts that stand above all humanity, where do they come from and how can we explain why we are beholden to them? Here, Lenny interviews \n  Dr. Adam Johnson on his new book _Divine Love Theory_ which argues that the best explanation for the reality of moral obligations \nflows not simply from God's nature, but specifically from the love relationship that the three members of the Trinity share.\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.comereason.org\r\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason\n\nPreorder Divine Love Theory at Amazon here:\nhttps://amzn.to/3RRR4MP\nVisit Dr. Johnson's web site Convincing Proof here:  https://convincingproof.org/",

In this exchange, the atheists sought to disprove the Gospel conception narrative, but when faced with the problem of the creation of matter out of nothing, which their worldview asserts, their own objections undermined them.

In a deep study, reported in the Los Angeles Times as well as elsewhere, criminologists Jillian Peterson and James Densley laid out four consistent features common to nearly all mass shooters.

    "description": "The recent slaughter at the gay nightclub in Orlando Florida has sparked a variety of reactions. The gunman was Muslim, even claiming to act in solidarity with ISIS and the victims were gay. But, some blame the motivation for the murderous rampage on the anti-homosexual stance taken by Christians. \n\nIt is true that Christians have been at odds with those who lobby for things like same sex marriage. Activists have sued Christian bakers, florists, photographers, innkeepers, and others forcing them to lose their livelihoods. So, how should Christians respond in this instance? The answer is that Christians should love the LGBT so much they are willing to lay down their lives.\n\nIn this short video, Lenny looks to the instructions Paul lays out in Romans 12:9-21 and says Christians should show love. We should be self-sacrificial, even when those who would persecute you are being threatened. See why Christians should be willing to step in front of a bullet meant for another, no matter what their political stance is.

However, all that changed over the last sixty years as young people began to embrace the \"me-first\" philosophy that has taken over. \n\nIn this clip, Lenny takes a look at the shift in values modern culture has undergone and he cites the prescient wisdom of G.K.

    "description": "The Bible contains many prophecies such as those in the book of Daniel that tell of future kingdoms with remarkable accuracy. This has lead some skeptics to claim Daniel was invented after the fact, making up the stories it reports in order to gain credibility. \n\nIn this short clip, Lenny explains just one minor detail from the book of Daniel that demonstrates the book was written by someone with first hand knowledge of the inner workings of the Babylonian government and therefore could not be fabricated centuries later. \n\nThis is one part of a larger series examining Archaeology and the Bible.

    "description": "Christians hold that God exists , but is it only a claim based on nothing more than pure faith? The answer is no. By looking at creation and seeing its design we have evidence of God's existence. \n\nIn this short video, Lenny reviews some of the primary arguments for God's existence and shows why believing in God is the most reasonable position one can hold.

However, as Lenny explains in this short video, the concept of slave in the Ancient Near East wasn't the same thing as it was in the pre-Civil War south. It was much broader, including serfdom and share-cropping type relationships.

Today, a majority of Americans (57%) support same-sex marriage, compared with 39% who oppose it.\"\n\nWhat changed?\n\nIn this video, Lenny looks at the rise of the homosexual rights movement. He traces the coordinated effort to de-vilify homosexuality by masking it in popular media and how the Church didn't offer any good arguments against the push by activists. He also tells why it isn't too late to reclaim the high ground in the same-sex marriage debate.

Do they have rights that are being violated?\" \n\nIn this video, Lenny expands on why these tow questions are the key in helping more people understand just what we can lose if we as a society open the door to same-sex unions.

With the homosexual lobby pushing for states to recognize same-sex marriage, it becomes more important than ever to understand just what marriage means and who has control over its definition.\n\nIn this video, Lenny explains that marriage stems not from any law or court decision, but from the same source as human equality: natural law.

    "description": "It's quite popular today to believe that morality is not something that stands above all of humanity but that moral laws are themselves created by humans. Consistent Christians should deny this view; the Bible teaches that moral duties come from God and are therefore objective and not relative to an individual or to a culture. Yet, most people don't have a good understanding of what we even mean by morality or what is necessary for certain values and duties to be considered moral at all. \n\nIn this video clip, Lenny reviews three specific components that must be accounted for in any moral framework: how do moral obligations obtain, does the person have real moral freedom, and is there a genuine responsibility that attaches the obligation to the person in question. Any theory of morality that is missing one of these components cannot explain morality in any meaningful way.

    "description": "Those critical of Christianity seem to always have a lot of objections they throw at Christians. They ask question after question, seeing if the believer can answer what they believe are seemingly intractable problems. \n\nWell, the reason-giving game goes both ways. Here, Lenny offers one of five questions the Christian should ask of the skeptic. These questions are designed to show how many of the critic's own beliefs can be contradictory and why Christianity makes sense.

    "description": "There seems to be a lot of confusion people have over the biblical teaching that man is created in God's image. Some falsely believe it means that God must be a human being with a body.  However, this cannot be right as God has revealed himself as a spirit. \n\nIn this short clip, Lenny explains just what the phrase \"created in God's image\" means and lists several specific attributes that only humans and God share.\n\nFor more on this idea, see the Come Reason article \"How is Man Created in the Image of God?\" at http://www.comereason.org/created-in-the-image-of-god.asp\n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttp://www.comereason.org\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

However, that doesn't mean that Christians used those dates to create a holiday of their own. In this short excerpt, Lenny demonstrates how December 25 has its origin in a Christian tradition and why it makes no sense to think that early Christians were trying to come up with their own alternative to pagan holidays. \n\nFor more articles, podcasts, and teachings on this subject, follow us online:\n\nhttp://www.comereason.org\nhttp://twitter.com/comereason\nhttps://www.facebook.com/comeletusreason",

Many  people think that while specialists like professional apologists can argue for Christianity, it isn't necessary for the person in the pew to know all those things. Perhaps it's better to ignore the Jehovah's Witness or Mormons knocking on your door, rather than get into countless arguments. However, such an attitude may be more dangerous than you know, and we can lose church members because of it.\n\nWatch this short video where Lenny tells about one man who left the Baptist church to become a Jehovah's Witness because his pastor wouldn't help answer the objections they gave him.
