    "description": "This was really difficult to get through. As angry as I get just speaking these words, they don't express a fraction of my true feelings. I don't know if there are words for that. I don't know if this will help, but I feel helpless, so I'm using my platform, which is something most people don't have. At first, I wondered if it conflicted with my previous video, but after some contemplation, I realized that it doesn't. My previous video never advocated disregarding injustice and atrocity. It never advocated abdicating righteous indignation. It was an anti-hate video. On the contrary, my commitment against hatred is what compelled me to make this video.\n\nI think I'm done trying to make moral arguments. They all feel like bad faith now, like a waste of time. I guess if I ever do bring them up again, I'll really have to consider who exactly I'm trying to convince, because some people have proven to be so completely delusional or dishonest, that it would be useless to argue - like talking to a tree.\n\n▼DARKMATTER2525▼\n►MY BOOKS - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK48Y6RZ\n►PATREON - https://www.patreon.com/darkmatter2525\n►YOUTUBE MEMBERSHIP - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhtZqdkjshgq8TqwIjMdCQ/join\n►MERCH - https://darkmatter.myspreadshop.com/\n►SUBSCRIBESTAR - https://www.subscribestar.com/darkmatter2525\n►MY AUTHOR PAGE - https://www.amazon.com/author/jdmatter\n\nMy channel relies on independent support from people like you.

What is that one sin, and what are the implications of that one being the ONLY one that cannot be forgiven? Ridiculousness, that's what. This is all about the absurdity of God's ability to forgive the most horrific of crimes, while refusing to forgive something each and every one of us endures and forgives countless times throughout our lives, an act that is not only perfectly legal - but constitutionally protected! Ironically, isn't believing God to be so weak an insult in and of itself?

This video is a silly expression (parodying the Twitter takeover) of just how antithetical the 10 commandments are to the First Amendment, which is why it's absurd that anyone thinks the constitution is based on them or inspired by them. Hopefully people can see how restrictive religion would be if given real authority, though they shouldn't have to be told, as history already makes that statement, but it's helpful to showcase it in a modern context, like how it would manifest in social media.\n\n▼DARKMATTER2525▼\n►PATREON - https://www.patreon.com/darkmatter2525\n►YOUTUBE MEMBERSHIP - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhtZqdkjshgq8TqwIjMdCQ/join\n►MERCH - https://darkmatter.myspreadshop.com/\n►SUBSCRIBESTAR - https://www.subscribestar.com/darkmatter2525\n\nMy channel relies on independent support from people like you.

    "description": "This is the final episode of Power Corrupts. I started this series 8 years ago, and it feels strange that it's finally ending. I knew how it needed to end, but I wasn't sure if I could successfully achieve the tone I wanted, but in the end, I think I did achieve that tone. I'm very happy with it, and I hope you are too. I learned a lot, and I will possibly apply that knowledge in a new series. How would I do things differently? I would build the assets and scripts I need first (while working on other animations), so that you won't have to wait months for a new episode. I could put them out more quickly. All I need to do is come up with a good story. I love inventing stories and telling them to you.\n\n▼DARKMATTER2525▼\n►MERCH - https://darkmatter.myspreadshop.com/\n►PATREON - https://www.patreon.com/darkmatter2525\n►YOUTUBE MEMBERSHIP - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhtZqdkjshgq8TqwIjMdCQ/join\n►SUBSCRIBESTAR - https://www.subscribestar.com/darkmatter2525\n\nMy channel relies on independent support from people like you.

    "description": "This channel began when atheists pretty much dominated online. I didn't expect that when I began. I thought it would be more like the offline world, and that I would be hated for arguing against religion. I never expected an audience, but it happened. I've been around a long time. People who are adults today grew up watching my animations when they were children. I'm their Tom & Jerry, their Flintstones. That feels strange, but times change. Youtube went mainstream, and the religions found it. Now the online world looks more like the offline world, with huge religious channels popping up and having an easy time with a readymade audience and funding. I guess I’m still considered a relatively large channel, and I want to keep it growing so that it can compete with all the religious garbage out there. That requires a lot of time on my part, and ads and Patreon have been pretty stagnant, so I’m trying these YouTube memberships to see if they help. In the future, I may do some shirt designs, and of course there will be my Power Corrupts book. I’ll also provide updates on that to members. When Power Corrupts is over, I think I'd like to start a new series, one that's more structured and scheduled. That’s all. If you can become a member of the channel, that’s awesome. It would really help me out. If not, I understand. No hard feelings. Times are rough for a lot of folks. Take care, everyone.",

    "description": "This video showcases some common arguments people use to defend the killing of children and babies in the bible.\n\nPeople use God to justify all kinds of atrocity, and they mitigate guilt not necessarily though making amends with their victims, but through what is ultimately a selfish exercise of forgiving oneself by using the concept of God as a proxy, and asking God’s forgiveness (who conveniently always gives forgiveness). When defending the bible, theists who fancy themselves moral realists often fall back onto moral and cultural relativism, with accusations of presentism for their critics, to rather inappropriately defend the actions of a God who is supposed to be timeless and morally unchanging, and they do this by appealing to the culture of the people who told us of this particular deity. In truth they’re engaging in the same practice that made people think it was morally right to fly planes into buildings, and why we justify occupying foreign lands to this very day.\n\nIf you can support my work, and are so inclined, it is greatly appreciated.

The flaw is temporal. Why must all value be placed upon the future? Does the present not hold value? When something is unlimited, does it not actually lose value? We matter to each other. I don't care about a trillion years from now, when humanity is long gone. I care about the here and now, and the immediate future. Just because it ends, it doesn't mean that it is without meaning; in fact, I'd say that makes it matter more.\n\nPlease consider supporting me on patreon, so I can keep making animations: https://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nBackground Music\n\"Waltz of the Flowers\" by Tchaikovski\n\nEnd Credits Music\n\"The Silence of the Noreg Skog\" by Frostlagte Måne",

    "description": "Even though I’m a nonbeliever, would I be scared to learn that God really does exist? No. Far from it. The belief that God desires praise, worship, and violent retribution, comes from a lack of understanding about what it’s like to be an enlightened being. It is ignorance projecting ignorance.\n\nThe theist view of God is actually far more insulting than the atheist view. It is commonly held that the atheist is the offensive one, that the nonbeliever must walk on eggshells, and be considerate of the beliefs of others. That seems backwards to me. What if there is a god and that god is offended at the thought of people believing he desires worship and praise, demands it even, for eternity - like some petty narcissist? What if that god is disappointed in those who expected him to torture their enemies? What if the believers and the nonbelievers are made to face their creator, and it is the believers who must answer for their offensive beliefs? Even if that’s the case, I don’t think any of us would have anything to worry about, believer and nonbeliever alike, because any mind capable of creating this universe would be enlightened to the point of being beyond such petty concerns.\n\nIf you wish to support my work:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nGaia map of the Milky Way:\nhttp://sci.esa.int/gaia/60169-gaia-s-sky-in-colour/\n\nOther space scenes were created using Space Engine,\nfor which I own a commercial license.\n\nCreative Commons music used:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/savfk/elegy\n“Ethereal Choir Ascends” YouTube Music Library\nhttps://soundcloud.com/savfk/ultra\nhttp://music.tunguska.space/track/astral-shit-subtile-corpus\nhttps://soundcloud.com/isaiah-hall-700100541/kai-engel-09-sunset",

You could choose to bend people to your will, even if only through threats and intimidation, or maybe you could enjoy life with us, help us, and teach us. The bible authors created a character in Yahweh who abuses his limitless power with wanton abandon, reeking of a crude tool of manipulation - not a loving, caring teacher. He is the ultimate bad guy, sold to us as the ultimate good guy - a monumental travesty of history. It certainly is a good thing that Yahweh is a fictional invention of ancient writers.\n\nMy next animations will be about the life and times of King David, as found in 1st and 2nd Samuel (and a bit of 1st Kings).

    "title": "Always Cry Wolf",
    "description": "Human beings often unite during tragedies, foregoing our petty differences. Imagine if we didn't require the tragedy.\n\nWhile \"crying wolf\" is considered bad, the title of this video refers to what happened at Yellowstone, and in that light, the title's meaning is \"always strive for balance\". During my 40 years of life, I have learned that attaining balance is the greatest solver of problems. Be neither excessive nor neglectful. I believe that is a good rule for the macro as well, for society, and for our planet.\n\nEdit: I'm writing these words 6 years after creating this video. It will stay as-is, but if I could do it again, I would strive to make it seem less \"anti-human\". My intent was never to paint humans as a bad thing. It was meant as more of a sci-fi exploration with themes of how excess and neglect are bad for us, that we should strive for balance.\n\nIf you wish to support my work, please consider sponsoring my videos through Patreon here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/darkmatter2525\n\nOr, you can check out my shirt store here:\nhttp://darkmatter.spreadshirt.com\n\nThings I made up VS things I didn't:\nThe Russians did receive a signal, sat on it for a year, and then claimed it was from an old Soviet military satellite. Other experts have stated that it did use a military frequency. I invented the conspiracy myself to tell the story I made for this video. The SpaceX rocket did blow up, but I have no reason to believe it was sabotaged. I just used the timing of the two events to grab your attention and invented the sabotage story to include it in my video. There's no such thing as an \"EC39 media reset\". I made that up (39 was my age at the time of writing, and \"EC\" are random letters). \"SST\" was also made up. Wolves did go extinct in Yellowstone during the 1920s and they were reintroduced by us during the 1990s. The area did dramatically regenerate by the early 21st century. It is believed that the wolves caused these dramatic changes, causing multiple trophic cascades, but that idea is still debated and some believe that there were too many other variables at play to fully credit the wolves with the change. Personally, I think the reintroduction of the wolves, coinciding with the altering of other animal behaviors, offer some compelling evidence, but I'm no expert. Other favorable variables may have been a fortunate coincidence. Regardless, it's a great device for my story, and remains totally possible. Why would aliens invade us? I wanted to create a relatable reason, better than the usual science fiction tropes. Why would people plant wolves? The answer to that is a good reason. The idea clicked, and it seemed more plausible than the usual alien stories.\n\nLink to The Know's video (The Know is an enjoyable channel if you're into video games):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zPzEynolUc\n\nLink to SETI:\nhttp://www.seti.org/\n\nRoyalty-free music used in this video:\n\"Cylinder Seven\" by Chris Zabriskie\nSource: http://chriszabriskie.com/cylinders/\nArtist: http://chriszabriskie.com/\n\n\"Landing on a Dark Planet\" - This piece is in your YouTube music library.\n\n\"Echos of the Universe\" by Windpearl\n\n\"It's Coming\" - This piece is in your YouTube music library\n\n\"I am a Man Who Will Fight for Your Honor\" by Chris Zabriskie\nSource: http://chriszabriskie.com/honor/\nArtist: http://chriszabriskie.com/",

    "description": "If the ideals of Islamism came out of Trump's mouth, how would the Left & Right react? If any Muslims do respond to this cartoon, I have a couple predictions: 1. Some will respond by saying that the verses are out of context (standard response), but notice that none of these verses are actually justified by their context, and 2.

YouTube returned my message, saying that they were aware of the problem and that it was fixed, and they also noticed that my channel qualified to be verified, so they did that while they were at it (tech support was super nice, complimented my videos and even subbed). Thanks, YouTube!\n\nJesus said he was coming back quickly, within the lifetime of his generation, and even explicitly told the people among him that some of them would not see death before his return, yet here we are - 2,000 years later - and Jesus still hasn’t come back. It’s ALMOST as if Christianity isn’t true, isn’t it? When will “soon” not be soon anymore? 3,000 years? 1,000,000 years?

    "description": "When presented together, the two propositions in this video are obviously silly, yet only one of them is recognized as such. Why? Perhaps it has something to do with how our standards shift when we’re dealing with reality as opposed to dealing with something far more fantastical. Perhaps it also has something to do with having a well established political and social system of norms and traditions backing up and perpetuating one of those silly propositions, often presented to us by loved ones when we were vulnerable children, or emotionally compromised by something.\n\nWhy do people accept such silly beliefs, but then live as though they don’t actually believe those things? Perhaps it’s because servitude to a lifetime of running from the whip, whilst chasing the carrot, is too exhausting. I tend to think it’s just not real enough for them, and they’re lying to themselves, a skin-deep lie, because they want it to be true. Maybe they don’t believe as sincerely as their facade makes it seem. After all, if I believed my existence in eternity depends upon what I do in this fleeting instant of a life, then my every waking moment would be devoted to that eternity. Yet that’s not what we see when we look at most believers. We see people standing in line at the bank. We see people sitting in traffic, suffering occasional road rage. We see people not concerned with eternity. We see people concerned with reality.\n\nPlease consider becoming a patron of the DarkMatter2525 channel.

Basically, it ain't gonna fly.\n\nThis video is mainly addressed to people I would define as ultra right wing radical Christians in America. Some people tell me that Islam is worse, because at least the Christians aren't beheading people who don't respect their religion. The whole point of this video is \"beware what you wish for\". The reason certain Christians don't do such things is simply because they live in a secular society that won't allow such things, but they want that to change. They want the theocracy. They want people like me to be punished. They are the Taliban that is not allowed to act like the Taliban. This video is a cautionary comparison, and it is absolutely valid. Furthermore, far more Muslims have been killed by Christians, than the other way around, today and throughout history. It's just that we tend to label it differently.\n\nI've often been told by Christians, \"Hey, if you were in a Muslim country, making fun of religion, you'd be dead by now,\" (John Lennox has said stuff like this). Basically, that means \"At least we Christians let you live.\" Um...thanks. Those are some mighty low standards you have there. I don't trust radicals on either side. I'm alive because the secular government won't allow you to kill me - not because there's a shortage of Christians who would be ready, willing, and able to do it. Of that, I have no doubt.\n\nRoyalty-free music used:\n\"Get It Off\" by Devyn Rose\nhttps://www.jamendo.com/en/track/897544/tanya-t6-get-it-off-feat.-jae-millz",

    "description": "Please consider supporting my work through Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nNo mind - no matter how powerful - could ever honestly claim to be free from deception, or unknown unknowns.\n\nEpisode 2 \"Where No God Treads\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgZaDmvYPw\n\nThe problem with using the bible as \"proof\" of God’s existence and nature, is that even if all the events within its pages actually occurred, it could still not prove God for the simple reason this video points out: God might not be the God you think He is, or even the God He thinks He is. The most likely scenario, however, is that He is a construct of the people.\n\nMan created God in his image.\n\nTry to watch this video in HD if you can. It makes a huge difference.\nSome critiques deserve answers. I'll do that at the bottom of this description.\n\nThis video is the pilot episode of “Power Corrupts”. Whether or not I make any more episodes, and eventually seasons, will largely be determined by you. I will consider this video’s view count, rating, and comments when making my decision to continue or not. Thanks for watching! Please share it with others if you enjoyed it.\n\nPlease sub to these excellent people:\nGrapplingIgnorance: https://www.youtube.com/user/GrapplingIgnorance\nMeridianFrost: https://www.youtube.com/user/MeridianFrost\n\nRoyalty-free music used:\n“Deep Atmospheres” by Mystic Crock\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/1136328/deep-atmospheres\n“Introverted” by Mystic Crock\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/1136330/introverted\n“Ascend” by Of The I\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/881299/of-the-i-ascend\n“Maribo” by Mystic Crock\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/1136334/maribo\n“Confused Reality” by Mystic Crock\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/1136331/confused-reality\n“Grandpa’s Watch” by St. Adam\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/418886/grandpa-s-watch\n\nOne interesting critique is that removing someone's memories will remove who they are, thereby making it pointless to test them. My response is that in our daily activities, we usually need not actually recall the memories that factored into those activities. You know the alphabet, for instance, but how well do you remember learning it, and need you recall those memories in order to read these words? This is why, in the cartoon, I leave the subconscious intact. Of course, this is entirely fictional, and as the professor said \"all CURRENT memories\" will be removed, so by \"current\" perhaps that could mean anything that would hinder the perception of godhood, like the knowledge that you're being tested.\n\nAnother interesting point is that power doesn't actually corrupt, it accentuates, makes you more of who you are. I don't really have a response to this other than \"power corrupts\" is a bit of a saying and in this case the semantics seem negligible, seeing as how the purpose of the test would remain intact. In either interpretation, they're trying to find out \"who Yahweh really is\".\n\n#PowerCorrupts DarkMatter2525",

If that's so wonderful, then why don't you worship God 24/7 in your life right now? If this \"state\" of love, happiness, and joy is compulsory, then is it truly you?

We are often told of the Abrahamic God's perfect moral standard, but this is a standard God Himself does not follow, a double standard, as clearly evidenced in the bible. So, if God is not subject to His own standard of perfect goodness, how can He possibly be defined as perfectly good?\n\n\"God is a 'do as I say, not as I do' kinda guy,\" is not my line; it's something I once heard Richard Coughlan say and I thought it described the Abrahamic God very well.",

That's Christianity - a simple con.\n\nChristianity is based upon advocating the execution of an innocent man so that you can escape accountability. Is this a good message to celebrate and teach our children?\n\nAccountability for what, you ask? It's the accountability for transgressions that mostly occur in the mind and are never actually acted upon. It is thought crime, of which everyone is \"guilty\". Christian mythology creates a \"problem\" which everyone has, and then invents a \"cure\" so that you have to join the cult. Joining the cult is the ONLY way to be \"saved\" from the problem Christianity invented in the first place. It's really quite clever, but not unique to Christianity.

Well, that baby needed to feel the horrifying pain and panic of fluid filling his lungs and suffocating him in order for \"God's plan\" to play out. What?!

Perhaps it has something to do with no longer being allowed to kill the opposition. The story of Elijah on Mt. Carmel is such obvious bunk, probably ancient propaganda, and clearly opposed to Moses' and Jesus' sentiments of not testing God. I thought it would be funny to juxtapose it with a William Lane Craig-style debate. I guess somehow it wouldn't be as convincing for God to show up during one of Billy Craig's debates, with cameras rolling and a few billion potential viewers. Nope. A few hundred ancient desert people atop a drought-stricken Mt. Carmel are obviously much more important than the rest of the world. In fact, they're literally called God's \"chosen people\". Imagine if someone like the president had a \"chosen\" race of people he went out of his way to support above and against all other races. I'd dare say people would call him a racist.

So, refrain from blaming the Führer's atheism (he was a strong believer in the supernatural, btw, so he was likely not an atheist at all). Should you think of examples like communist forces composed of mostly atheists (though how you would know they were truly nonbelievers is beyond me and seems contrary to our disposition to believe in a god), I'm sure you will now agree that it is a human problem - and not one of \"which worldview leads to death and destruction\".\n\nRoyalty-free music used:\n\n\"An Afterthought\" by Mark Nine\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/906902\n\n\"Star Guide\" by Tryad\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/843904\n\n\"Nightscape\" by Stellardrone\nhttp://www.jamendo.com/en/track/890074\n\nLicensed under:\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0",

Well, we're actually made privy of God's \"mysterious\" reason in this particular case, and we find out that it isn't so mysterious after all. Historically, Job has been revered as a great work of literature. Nobody really knows who wrote it, but the powers that be figured it had to be God-breathed. This book disgusts me mainly because it values material possessions over sons and daughters. Job's children were killed, and he's supposed to be fine with that because God returned twice the amount of his possessions. Sorry, not good enough. Yeah, Job had ten more kids, but as any parent who has lost a child can tell you: ONE CHILD DOES NOT REPLACE ANOTHER. This book touts an immoral message, and it's paraded by many as deep and insightful. Many religious folk are told what this book is about, but don't actually read it for themselves, or they squirm with inaccurate interpretations that are directly contrary to the actual literature. They're almost forced to, because they've devoted themselves to the bible, and this immoral message is in the bible. But the message is quite easy to understand.

    "description": "Please consider supporting my work through Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nBecause I was constantly being told that I'm rejecting God, and I knew that wasn't true, I decided to research rejection, which made me aware of its effects. My studies took me in a completely unexpected direction. The epiphany (pun intended) was rather shocking. The evidence indicates that the personal god is a manifestation of the ego, which explains a plethora of theistic tendencies, including their typical dislike of atheists, who theists subconsciously perceive to be rejecting a part of themselves. God is Tyler Durden; and the first rule of Jesus Club is you have to talk about Jesus Club.

    "description": "Please consider supporting my work through Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nSome people don't even realize what they believe.\nIf you didn't understand the end, that's okay. I realize I was being more than a bit silly and vague. Many theists have used dishonest argumentation with me, which no doubt causes them to suspect that I, too, am using dishonest argumentation (projection), which can ironically cause them to be skeptical about the wrong things. That was the point of the misdirection and subsequent alien.\n\nPretty pretty please check out my new channel!!!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/darkantics\n\nI believe it is wrong to harm others. That is my opinion, which is subject to change under different circumstances. Furthermore, even my definition of \"harm\" is subjective. While I believe indoctrination of children is causing harm, there are religious people who see it as vitally important. Our opinions don't get to decide ultimate truth, though. So who is objectively correct? Neither of us. It isn't so simply black or white. Is it better to know a harmful truth or to believe a comforting lie? Which is moral?\n\nIf the vast majority of us agree upon what is good or bad for human beings, for all intents and purposes, that can be like objective morality, and I could see how one could justifiably call it objective, but that's not entirely accurate, and I don't wish to call it objective because that implies transcendence, which is baseless. When something is objective, it is true independent of our minds, yet our minds are a requisite of morality. For morality to be objective, you must explain how morality continues to exist if humans cease to exist.\n\nLet's put it another way:\n\nMorality is an emergent property. It is contingent upon there being people who are interacting. If there are no people interacting, then the property of morality is not generated. Therefore it is not a property that exists in the world or universe independent of us. So who decides what morality is? We do.\n\nTektonTV made a response to this video which I cannot answer because he blocked me. I performed experiments on him in which I provided two types of comments: cogent rebuttal-type comments and insult-type comments. He allowed the insult-type comments, but refused to allow the comments that made good points. This speaks volumes about his motivations, does it not?\n\nHere's a basic response to his video:\nNotice his confusion with penalties and morals? He considers them separate, yet they are inextricable. A punishment that doesn't fit the crime is immoral, is it not? I'd dare say it is a crime in and of itself. Furthermore, I believe punishment is itself an immoral action that should be replaced with preventative measures, positive reinforcement, and correctional action when necessary, leading to behavioral modification. \"Punishment\", is either vengeance or negative reinforcement; while it can produce temporary, insincere change, it has largely failed to produce a sincere desire to be good. In other words, it's treating the symptom rather than the disease.\n\nWhat he suggests is that a penalty can change, while morality cannot. Is that fair? Of course penalties DO change, which he says is because of varying social factors - which INCLUDE changes in a society's moral compass, but he conveniently omitted that piece of information. He describes it as varying penalties for an objective moral. These were written LAWS with set punishments. There weren't amendments or exceptions. They didn't give permission to become lax. Yet, over time, as society changed, it became unacceptable (immoral) to impose certain punishments on people. This is evidence that Christians have engaged in subjective moral standards.",

    "description": "Even Jesus thinks you're idiots.\r\nSpread this video or make your own so that Bastrop High School, and other such schools, cannot easily get away with this deplorable behavior without being seen by thousands of atheists, secularists, moderates, etc.\r\nLink to Bastrop High School:\r\nhttp://mpsb.us/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=1044&\r\nGrapplingIgnorance's excellent video on this:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm89ef4v6i0\r\nFacebook group for Damon Fowler:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Support-Damon/103714833051042\r\nDamon Fowler explains his story here:\r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/hed7y/threatened_to_contact_aclu_for_prayer_at/\r\nWhy is it unconstitutional?\r\nFirst, nobody is stopping prayer, but it is public funding of the prayer that's the problem. If I owned a home near Bastrop High School, then the real estate taxes I must pay by LAW would be used for an organized prayer using facilities, equipment, and employees I paid for - AN ATHEIST BEING FORCED BY LAW TO PAY FOR PRAYER. It is obvious that is unconstitutional. If Gabriel Broadway wanted to privately fund a separate meeting for a prayer, she's perfectly within her rights to do so. Bottom line: pray on your own time and your own dime.\r\n.\r\nIf you need further elaboration, here is a PM I wrote on the matter:\r\n.\r\nEndorsement is different than accommodation.\r\n.\r\nIf a Muslim's religion requires him to pray during school hours (a public school), then by law, the school is not allowed to prevent him from doing so (accommodation). I believe that I have proven beyond the shadow of any doubt, that Christianity doesn't REQUIRE a large public prayer at a graduation ceremony, and that, in fact, the religion actually discourages it. Therefore, it is not unconstitutional to prevent her from doing something like that. A case can be made, however, for her to be stopped from doing something like that if she is using the public's resources in the process (endorsement).\r\n.\r\nI know you don't think this is a big deal, and I can understand why you think so. It can seem petty. As someone who owns a lot of real estate, however, I can look at my tax bills and see exactly how much of my money is going to the schools, and it's a significant amount of money. I do not want kids being preached to there. I do not want to pay for that any more than I would want to drop a dime in a collection plate at a church. People of many religions and non-religion pay for the schools, so the schools should remain neutral.\r\n.\r\nFree speech is limited - however minutely - when public funding is involved. God is off-limits, no matter the speech-giver. In my college speech class, many students chose to give speeches about their religions: specifically some Muslims, Catholics, and a Jehovah's Witness. I was totally cool with that. At the college, they were personally paying for their educations - not me. I was the last speaker, and I chose to give a speech about how all their religions are bullshit. And that's how I handled that.",

If the universe was made for life, with all the universe's dangers and inefficiencies, then to say that it could be no other way is to say your god couldn't do it any other way - and obviously, a way less hostile and more conducive to life would have been a better way.\n\nI'm shocked people still use the fine-tuned universe argument. Though this counterargument is hardly new, I thought it would be fun to give it the DarkMatter treatment.\n\nHere's two other videos I've made which address the fine-tuning argument more thoroughly (as some theists believe this video is a bit of a strawman):\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPICs6YbFtA\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKPrBV_PCKs\n\nA couple questions for creationists:\nWas Adam flesh and bone?

If lions weren't carnivorous before the fall of man, then please explain how a man eating a piece of fruit would cause the digestive systems of large cats to be permanently altered, and why we've never found the fossils of such cats. What is the purpose of an extinct species? Why did God condemn 99% of all species that have existed thus far to extinction? Why did he design them in the first place if He knew that they were going to be unsuccessful (though, humans aren't yet nearly as successful as some species that have survived for many millions of years before their extinction)?",

    "description": "I believe that the human race is currently going through growing pains. The bible was written by a bygone culture, and we are having trouble letting go of it. We are experiencing a temporal culture clash. To use the bible's words...it is time for us to put away childish things. We can't allow ages-old superstition to impede our progress.\r\n\r\n*The bible does clearly state that this ritual \"cleanses leprosy\". But what is \"cleansing\"? Let's look to Matthew 8:2-4, Mark 1:40-45, and Luke 5:12-16. In those passages, Jesus is described as \"cleansing the leper\". for example,﻿ in Matt 8:3, Jesus HEALS a leper and these words are used to describe it: \"Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying 'I am willing; be cleansed.' Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.\" The wording in Leviticus also uses the word \"cleansed\" as it describes cleansing the leper with this bird sacrifice procedure. Occasionally, leprosy has healed without treatment. If that happened it might have given some false credibility to the bird sacrifice. In most cases, however, it surely didn't work, but they might have believed it needed to be done - as with many superstitions. If the leprosy wasn't healed, it was \"God's will\" (punishment).",

    "description": "\"Oops\" ~Creationists\r\nWe tried to tell them, but they just didn't listen. I probably should have pointed out that the Kepler telescope uses the transit method to find planets, which means it can't see the planet until it is \"eclipsing\" its star. In order for that to happen, it has to be at the perfect angle between us and its star. This means that Kepler is only capable of seeing a TINY fraction of the planets that are near us. That, too, greatly adds to the numbers of planets we can safely assume are out there. Ouch, Creationists...ouch.\r\n\r\nKepler science chief William Borucki at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington D.C. estimates that there are at least 50 billion planets in our galaxy with around 500 million residing in habitable zones. The data was extrapolated from Kepler's findings. I also drew a similar conclusion from the data, thus considered my video cautious and conservative. That's why I comfortably posted the video without fear of it turning into an exaggerated arsenic lifeform story, or a \"missing link\" story.

    "description": "I've been attacked by some religious moderates for being critical of the literal interpretation of the bible.\r\n\r\nDragons, unicorns, giants, witches, and wizards were obviously used as metaphorical language in the bible, right? Maybe you could go back in time and see if that brings comfort to a woman burning at the stake because she was accused of being a witch. Or perhaps you could try explaining that to the fundamentalists who tell children that dinosaurs were on Noah's Ark, and that the bible calls them dragons. Maybe you could try explaining photoshop to Nephilimfree when he proclaims with awe that photos of giant human skeletons prove that what the bible says about giants is true. As long as people believe in the literal interpretation (the most dangerous), I'm going to argue against the literal interpretation. No, we don't burn witches anymore, but there's plenty of people who are trying to retard our children's educations. Their primary motivation for doing that comes from interpreting the bible literally. Should they succeed, it could prove to be more terrifying than ten thousand witch trials.\r\n\r\nTo the religious moderates who have fought against creationism: I sincerely thank you. It's not my intention to prevent you from worshipping. I see religion as kind of like a firearm. It can be misused with dire consequences. I just want to help ensure that the firearm remains in the control of responsible people.\r\n\r\nThanks, GrapplingIgnorance, for playing the moderate.

The four sentences you just read came under some criticism for comparing the bible to porn, as porn is intended of sexual gratification, whereas the bible is not meant for that and has plenty of pleasant bits mixed in with all the nastiness. So does a movie that's rated R or NC17, but I'm still not going to take a child to see them. The bible is a mature book that should be age restricted. The only reason for religious people to fight that is because it would hinder their child's brainwashing regimen.",

Invent a time machine, go back, and ask a 9/11 hijacker.\n\nOne video response to this video suggested that people fear going to hell. Well, then that means that they don't really believe in the saving grace of Jesus Christ. That just shifts the doubt from one part of their faith, to an even MORE important part of their faith. Thanks. Furthermore, I don't really buy the whole \"fear of hell\" argument, because when a believer's infant dies, the parents suffer severe grief, yet I've never met a bereaved parent who thought that God sent their baby to hell.

Other atheists have been bullied offline by their jobs as well...many others.\r\n\r\nI never thought about this until this incident, because such maliciousness doesn't come naturally to me, but I have real power over Christians - real power. I interview them; I hire them; they give me their financial details, their residential and professional histories, their social security numbers; I rent real estate to them, high demand real estate that I can rent to anyone I want; they've even used their religion as a selling point to try to convince me to choose them, oblivious that they were trying to sell themselves to an atheist. The livelihoods of entire Christians families depend on my good will...me...an atheist. And as their neighbors are tossed into the streets by the greedy corporations who they would want to remain unchecked and unregulated, my tenants enjoy the attentiveness and security brought to them by an atheist who they would gleefully condemn to hell. I would never, ever discriminate against or negatively affect someone because they're a Christian, or a Muslim, or a Jew. And I do this knowing full well that many of them wouldn't do the same for me. To my integrity and my conscience, I relinquish the power I have over them, the same power they would seek to use against me.\r\n\r\nBeing immersed in this debate for over a decade, in real life and on YouTube, has caused me to meet thousands of Christians and atheists. I can tell you one counterintuitive thing I've witnessed time and time again over the years: atheists are far, far more Christ-like than most Christians could ever hope to be. Jesus was the atheist of his time. The powers that be tried to shut him up too, but that didn't work. Now, it seems many Christians have done a 180. My friend, the atheist high school teacher, the same man who Jesus Christ would've befriended, would also be tossed out on the street by some of Jesus' misguided modern day followers, who call themselves Christians while knowing nothing of Jesus' teachings. But things are getting better. At least they'll no longer burn him at the stake. But would they if they could?",

Tell me that doesn't freak you out (for those of you who don't know why it should freak you out, watch \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"). Fun fact #2: Edward Cullen is in this video. Can you find him? I was going to do a Twilight spoof, but gave up on it. Still, I thought it would be funny to reuse the characters from it.\n\nMost religions scoff at what they have deemed as the \"atheistic worldview\" (what they think atheists think) because they believe it has no \"meaning\". Well, I've heard religious people describe what they believe to be the meaning of our lives...and I find it utterly demeaning and pathetic: to honor an egomaniac who created us just to thank, praise, and love Him - or else?! REAL love is unconditional. And when someone is requested to praise, it is meaningless, disingenuous. Could they not even dream up a god who wasn't bound by the most petty of human emotions: arrogance, jealousy, anger, etc...basically, an attention whore?",

    "description": "Please consider supporting my work through Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nAll your favorite atheists meet God...\nAnd they got a few bones to pick.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/aronra\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/azrienoch\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bionicdance\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/c0ct0pusprime\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/factvsreligion\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ghostofdayinperson\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nykytyne2\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/philhellenes\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/profmth\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/VogterViking\n\nThis just about sums it up:\n\"It would take a sick bastard to enjoy heaven while people are burning in hell.\"\n~Nykytyne2\n\nIf you believe in heaven and hell, do you dismiss God's tyrannical treatment of others because you \"love\" Him, or because you're chicken shit? It's time to grow a backbone and realize that it's just a myth.\n\nFun facts: it took over 200 files, 25GB of info, to create this animation. Mrs.DarkMatter plays one of the religious nuts at the beginning. The story was by DarkMatter, but everybody pitched in with some great extra lines. Oh, and Azrienoch's wee wee is probably perfectly adequate.\n\nThis was a worldwide collaboration: Texas, Maryland, Washington, Florida, Philadelphia, Canada, England, New York, and Denmark.",

    "description": "Please consider supporting my work through Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/DarkMatter2525\n\nMy contribution to Intelligent Design: \"The Wasted Theory\".\n\nMost life is antagonistic to other forms of life. That is illogical if life was designed by a single, perfect, all-knowing creator. For example, why would God design something if He knew it was going to be unsuccessful (go extinct)? Why would God design his creation to be in constant conflict with itself?\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n1. The Wasted Theory\n2. Evolution\n\nOf course, evolution solves the problem perfectly: adaptation, natural selection, etc.\nFor religious people, my \"Wasted Theory\" also solves the problem. You're welcome, religious people; and you may freely use my theory at your discretion.",
