This is creates diverse exploration within the space that has meaning ….you wanter into territory nobody else has been, and the AI couldn’t reach ..\nAi is optimized to continue thought, not generate new thought.",

End your software chaos and try Odoo for free on me: https://www.odoo.com/r/uW5.\n\nLong before dollars, euros, or even gold coins existed, there was only one currency that mattered: energy. Every living thing on Earth, from the first single cell to modern civilization, has faced the same challenge: capture more energy than you spend getting it, or die. That difference between energy gained and energy spent is where profit begins.This video traces profit from its origins in cellular metabolism through photosynthesis, animal life, human agriculture, fossil fuels, and the industrial revolution, to our modern economy.\n\nA key idea in this video is THE BOUNDARY TEST:\nThis is a new idea I had while working on this video. Draw a boundary around what you're analyzing. If the activity increases total usable energy at every scale you examine: from individual to ecosystem then society, it's creating value. If it only looks profitable when you keep the boundary narrow, it's extracting value. This simple test reveals which forms of profit build the future and which ones consume it.\n\nWe examine how rising energy costs, renewable transitions, and thermodynamics constrain economic growth. By understanding profit as a physical phenomenon rooted in energy rather than just finance, we can see what's really happening…\n\nJOIN MY EMAIL LIST: https://forms.gle/YWGRrV6BvqBKY6Sz9\nSUPPORT THIS CHANNEL: https://www.patreon.com/c/artoftheproblem\n\nREFERENCES:\nTim Morgan - Surplus Energy Economics: https://surplusenergyeconomics.wordpress.com/\nGarrett Relation on energy and GDP: https://en.everybodywiki.com/Garrett_relation\nJevons Paradox and the rebound effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\nSocial evolution as computation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08861\nMetabolic scaling across evolution: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1007783107\n\n0:00 Introduction: The Wealth Debate\n0:45 Energy: The Currency of Life\n2:33 Photosynthesis: Life's Greatest Innovation\n4:19 Animals & Storing Energy\n6:20 The Boundary Test: Creating vs Transferring Energy\n10:42 Human Intelligence & Energy Breakthroughs\n12:02 Money: A Portable Claim on Energy\n13:31 Good Profit vs Bad Profit\n15:21 The Mismatch: Infinite Claims, Finite Energy\n17:09 Can We Ever Have Enough?",

Watch Greece go from 3% to 35% bond yields in a death spiral that destroyed their economy.\nWhen investors lose confidence in a government, they demand higher interest rates (yields) to compensate for risk. But higher yields make debt even harder to pay, creating a vicious cycle that can bankrupt entire countries.\nWith bond yields rising in Japan, the US, and worldwide, understanding this mechanism has never been more important. The bond market is the foundation of all borrowing costs - when it cracks, everything gets more expensive.",

    "description": "How Bitcoin works and why it has value. Covers the history of money, value, gold, blockchain, proof of work, hash function & mining. This is the best overview of bitcoin for those who want a deep intuition. We introduce the problem of sending cash in electronic form over the internet and the need for a reliable electronic cash method, and introduces Bitcoin as a solution. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a shared ledger model and eliminates areas of trust through distributed responsibilities for validating and updating transactions among multiple nodes. The speaker describes the process of Bitcoin mining, which involves solving complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain, and explains the consensus mechanism of \"proof of work\" that motivates miners to participate in the network. Overall, the video provides insight into the security, reliability, and significance of Bitcoin in the modern global community. bitcoin 100k / halving / michael saylor",

It traces the key breakthroughs, starting with Alessandro Volta's invention of the voltaic pile - the first electric battery capable of providing a continuous flow of electrical current.\n\nWe'll learn how Volta's work led to a greater understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism, culminating in the development of the electromagnet. This paved the way for groundbreaking innovations in electrical communication, from the early 'bubble telegraph' experiments to the game-changing discovery that a current-carrying wire could deflect a compass needle.\n\nThrough these pivotal moments, we'll see how the fundamental principles of electricity were uncovered and how they laid the foundations for the technological revolution that was to come. Join us on this journey of scientific discovery that forever changed our world.\n\nReferences:\n\"On the Electricity excited by the mere Contact of conducting Substances of different Kinds\" (Alessandro Volta, 1800)\nhttp://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Volta-1800.html\n\nStock footage: \nPrelinger Archives: http://archive.org/details/Telephon1946",

    "description": "This chapter introduces why random shifts result in perfect secrecy. We explore hardware random number generators vs. pseudorandom number generators which expand a short random seed into a long sequences of \"random looking\" numbers. If used in cryptography, can offer \"practical security\" which is based on the secrecy of the random seed only. Alice and Bob can safely assume that the \"enemy knows the system\" (one-time pad + pseudorandom generator), and focus on assuring their seed is shared in secret & generated randomly.\n\nIf you are still wondering: how exactly would Eve break a ciphertext encrypted with a pseudorandom list of shifts? Remember: the pseudorandom generator can only produce a tiny (0.0000...1%) fraction of all possible shift sequences. Eve could program a computer to generate all possible sequences (starting from seed 0, 1, 2, 3.....) and reverse all of these shifts. When the computer hits a seed which decrypts the ciphertext into an \"English looking\" sentence, she can be 99.999% sure it is the message. All of the other seeds will decrypt into unreadable (jumbled looking) messages.",

    "description": "Explore how the one-time-pad was applied during WW2 with the use of rotor encryption machines. The German's Enigma machine would have been nearly impossible to break if it didn't rely on human operators making \"random\" choices.\nThis video purposely ignores many details of the Enigma (such as the plug-board) and how it was broken. The goal is to explain the strength of the machine in terms of the key space. Also, pseudorandom sequences (no matter how you generate them) require a random initial seed. This will be fleshed out in the final chapter on Public Key Cryptography.",
