    "title": "The Illegal Execution of James.",
    "description": "The illegal execution of James\nA political scandal that accidentally confirmed history.\n\nThis passage is often cited by historians as the most authentic reference to Jesus outside the Bible precisely because it is so casual. Josephus wasn't trying to spread the Gospel; he was simply reporting on why a High Priest got fired. By using \"Jesus, who was called Christ\" merely as a label to distinguish which James was on trial, Josephus inadvertently confirms that Jesus was a known public figure in 62 AD, even among the Roman and Jewish elite who opposed Him.\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShFrtcV_tm8&t=2124s\n\n#Earlychurchfathers  #Josephus #Apologetics\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "By cross-referencing the strict rabbinical laws of the Mishnah regarding Passover with the personal biography of Flavius Josephus, we uncover a stunning historical reality. We aren’t just looking at what happened the night of the arrest; we are proving who had to be in the room based on biblical law.\n\n If Josephus’s commander was indeed required to be at his father’s house (Annas) during the trial, it means Josephus didn’t just write about Jesus from vague rumors. It implies that Josephus spent the Jewish War taking orders from a man who stared Jesus in the face on the night of the crucifixion. What can we conclude then from Josephus' writings?\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShFrtcV_tm8&t=2124s\n.\n.\n#gospels #history #Bible #Josephus #apologetics\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Josephus Knew Jesus’ Executioners\nJosephus wasn't just a historian; he was practically sitting at the prosecution's table.\n\nToday, we map out the terrifyingly small world of 1st Century Jerusalem. This is awesome; we are proving that Josephus was professionally subservient to the specific family dynasty dedicated to wiping out the early Church.\n\nIf Josephus was taking orders from the man who killed James, and whose father killed Jesus, it completely reframes the Testimonium Flavianum (Josephus’s famous passage about Jesus). \nIt suggests that Josephus didn't learn about Jesus from public records or street rumors. He likely heard about Him over dinner with the very men who signed the death warrants. It makes Josephus’s writings less of a \"history lesson\" and more of an \"insider leak\" from the enemies of the Gospel.\n\nWatch the breakdown of this connection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShFrtcV_tm8&t=2124s\n\n.\n.\n#ChristianHistory #Josephus #Apologetics #DrThomasSchmidt \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

On the surface, they might look that way, but when we look deeper, the meaning remains consistent.\n\nMany of these differences, though not all, likely come from the way ancient authors were trained to write. In the first century, students learned to summarize, paraphrase, and rearrange material according to certain literary techniques. These methods were common in ancient biography and history. So it’s reasonable to expect that the Gospel writers, following those same conventions, used similar approaches in their accounts.\n\n#Resurrection #Jesus #Christians #Christianity #Bible #Evidence #History #Facts #Apologetics #Theology\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

But during one of his campaigns, he had an experience that changed everything: he claimed that the risen Jesus appeared to him.\n\nThat encounter completely transformed his life—from persecutor to one of Christianity’s most powerful defenders. Paul endured imprisonment, beatings, stonings, whippings, shipwrecks, and countless hardships, and ultimately, he was executed outside of Rome.

It’s a \"hostile witness\" corroborating the story against their own interest. That is the gold standard of evidence in any court of law, ancient or modern.\n\nIn this video, we break down how a simple social network analysis shifts Josephus from a distant historian to a guy who was practically in the room where the decisions were made.\n\nThomas C Schmidt's web: https://tcschmidt.com/\n\n#Apologetics #HistoricalJesus #Josephus #NewTestament #BiblicalArchaeology #Apologetics\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

As far as I can tell, there are no assumptions made without evidence. Some might argue that it presupposes God’s existence, since if Jesus rose, it would almost certainly be a supernatural event. But that’s not a baseless assumption; there’s good evidence for God’s existence.\n\nAs for plausibility, we can treat it as neutral—it neither passes nor fails that test.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the standard historical method for assessing hypotheses strongly suggests that Jesus rose from the dead.\n\n#Resurrection #Jesus #Christians #Christianity #Bible #Evidence #History #Facts #Apologetics #Theology\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "We have an early testimony from First Clement indicating that both Peter and Paul were martyred. In chapter five, Clement specifically mentions Peter and Paul, placing Paul on equal footing with his mentor, Peter. He uses language suggesting that they “suffered unto death,” which implies that they faced persecution to the point of dying. While the phrasing isn’t completely explicit, the context strongly suggests that Clement viewed Peter and Paul as martyrs for their faith.\nWant more resources like this? \n.\n.\n#Resurrection #Jesus #Christians #Christianity #Bible #Evidence #History #Facts #Apologetics #Theology #Peter #Paul #Martyrs\n\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Even the earliest critics of Christianity didn’t deny the empty tomb, they just tried to explain it away.\nMatthew mentions the claim that the disciples stole the body. By A.D. 150, Justin Martyr says that rumor was still being spread. Tertullian later reports another version: the gardener supposedly moved the body so no one would trample his lettuce patch. And Celsus, in the late second century, claimed the disciples merely dreamed the resurrection—“and besides,” he said, “they were just hysterical women.”\n\nIn other words, nobody in those early centuries was saying the tomb wasn’t empty. The debate wasn’t over whether it was empty, but why.\n\n#memes #apologetics #jesus #christianity #christians #Bible\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "As Michael Bird, an evangelical New Testament scholar, has pointed out: many preach the inerrancy of the Bible but practice the inerrancy of their interpretations.\nFor me, inerrancy means that the Bible is inerrant in what it teaches—in its message. Even Norman Geisler, who was about as conservative on inerrancy as one can get and helped shape the Chicago Statement, admitted in his Big Book of Bible Difficulties that there are errors in our present text. The Chicago Statement itself acknowledges that inerrancy applies only to the autographs, not to the copies we have today.\nSo let’s be honest: our current Bibles do contain errors. Could God have preserved a perfectly inerrant text? Of course. But He didn’t. This informs me He didn’t consider it necessary for us to have one.\n.\n#memes #apologetics #jesus #christianity #christians #Bible\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

Pelling note that techniques such as compression, displacement, conflation, and transferal were common across ancient writings. If that’s true, we should expect to find them in the Gospels—and we do.\n\nSo when skeptics claim the Gospels contradict each other, the issue isn’t contradiction but composition.

    "description": "Tips for Becoming a Better Apologist\n\n1. Read widely\nStart by immersing yourself in apologetics literature. There are plenty of excellent books available. Be a voracious reader. The more perspectives you engage with, the stronger your understanding will become.\n\n2. Watch debates\nObserve how leading Christian apologists and scholars present their arguments and how their opponents respond. Seasoned debaters have encountered a wide range of objections and have refined their reasoning through experience. Watching these exchanges will help you recognize which arguments hold up under critical scrutiny and why.\n\n3. Practice through roleplay\nAs you learn new arguments, practice them in discussion settings. Roleplay conversations with others, especially those who can offer honest, critical feedback. This helps you fine-tune your reasoning and communicate more effectively.\n\nBy doing these things, you’ll not only grow in knowledge but also develop the confidence and skill to engage thoughtfully and persuasively in defense of the Christian faith.\n\n#memes #apologetics #jesus #christianity #christians #Bible\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "As my friend, Gary Habermas explained, at the very end of the chapter, Paul urges believers to give themselves fully to the work of the Lord, because their labor is not in vain. Then—without a chapter break in the original letter—he immediately moves into chapter 16, telling the Corinthians to set aside an offering for the poor saints.\n\nThe logic is powerful: If Christ is raised, then Christianity is true. If Christianity is true, it should shape how you live—your generosity, your priorities, even your finances.\n\nSo in just a few verses, Paul ties the resurrection not only to our eternal hope but also to our ethical responsibility: live faithfully, work diligently, and care for those in need.\n\n🎥 Watch my conversation with Dr. Gary Habermas on the Resurrection of Jesus. \n#GaryHabermas #MichaelLicona #Christians #Theology #ChristianVideo \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Some readers may feel uncomfortable at first, but you have to ask: What am I actually observing when I read the Gospels? Take an example: Mark says the disciples were debating among themselves about who was the greatest, and Jesus asked them what they were discussing. Matthew, on the other hand, says they asked Jesus directly, “Who is the greatest?”\n\nWhen you face surface discrepancies like that, what do you do? Do you say they were two different occasions or try another explanation? Would that really satisfy you? And if a Mormon, Jehovah’s Witness, or Muslim gave you the same kind of answer about their book, would you be satisfied then?\n\nThe point isn’t that God is being exposed or that Scripture is somehow embarrassed. What’s really being challenged is our own view of Scripture—how we read the Gospels accurately and as they were intended.\n\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "What about the empty tomb—how solid is the evidence? Many apologists include it as a key fact for the resurrection, and a majority of critical scholars (especially Christian ones) affirm it. Yet, far fewer non-Christian scholars grant the empty tomb, making it a point of caution.\n\nStill, even skeptical scholars like Bart Ehrman acknowledge that the disciples sincerely believed Jesus rose bodily from the dead. Others, like Dale Allison, carefully affirm the empty tomb while striving to avoid bias. The question becomes whether we’re too quick to accept it because of our own hopes—or whether the evidence stands on its own merit.\n\nRegardless, the historical record is clear: the earliest disciples truly believed in a physical, bodily resurrection. That conviction, whether or not one includes the empty tomb as a fact, demands explanation.\n#Jesus #Baptists #Calvinists #Pentecostals #Christians \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

He appeared to individuals, to the Twelve, to all the apostles, even to more than 500 at once. Hallucinations are private—they don’t synchronize across groups.\nSo if Christianity started from hallucinations, it would require a 100% rate of group-visions, all with matching content. That’s not how hallucinations work.\n\n#Baptist #Charismatics #Miracles #Theology \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "title": "Can Some of the Toughest Gospel Contradictions Be Solved?",
    "description": "Are these real contradictions—or compressed narratives with different emphases? Matthew includes the flight to Egypt to highlight prophecy fulfillment (“out of Egypt I called my son”), while Luke omits that episode, moving from Bethlehem to the temple dedication and then to Nazareth—likely compressing the timeline. Historians often omit details not central to their aims.\n\nThe famous Judas case raises similar questions. Matthew says Judas hanged himself; Acts says he fell headlong and burst open. Rather than forcing a single physical sequence, consider Luke’s tendency to skip steps: Acts may be describing Judas’s body at burial—bloated and decomposing—rolling into the valley (Gehenna) and rupturing. In that reading, both accounts can be true, each selecting different moments. These difficult differences don’t undermine the core claim: if Jesus rose, Christianity is true; the minor divergences don’t change that.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "When I called Gary back in 1989 with tough questions about the Bible, he gave me the answer that changed everything: Did Jesus rise from the dead? If the resurrection is true, then Christianity is true — even when we wrestle with other questions. That truth has shaped my faith ever since.\n\nIn this conversation, Gary Habermas and I talk about how studying the resurrection not only strengthens our confidence in the gospel but also gives us hope in grief, courage in suffering, and practical guidance for everyday life. From dealing with doubts to facing the death of loved ones, the resurrection changes everything.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with doubts, grief, or fear of the future, I believe this conversation will encourage you and remind you of the hope we have in Jesus.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "As Michael Bird, an evangelical New Testament scholar, has pointed out: many preach the inerrancy of the Bible but practice the inerrancy of their interpretations.\n\nFor me, inerrancy means that the Bible is inerrant in what it teaches—in its message. Even Norman Geisler, who was about as conservative on inerrancy as one can get and helped shape the Chicago Statement, admitted in his Big Book of Bible Difficulties that there are errors in our present text. The Chicago Statement itself acknowledges that inerrancy applies only to the autographs, not to the copies we have today.\n\nSo let’s be honest: our current Bibles do contain errors. Could God have preserved a perfectly inerrant text? Of course. But He didn’t. This informs me He didn’t consider it necessary for us to have one.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Even J. I. Packer, one of the main scholars who crafted the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, has said that the first chapters of Genesis are a quasi-liturgical celebration of the fact of creation—not at all what we would have seen had we been hovering above the chaos of it all. He asks, “Were there two trees—the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil—in the Garden of Eden? I don’t know. Trees were symbols in poetry back then.” He continues, “Was there really a serpent in the garden? I don’t know. But the message being communicated there and in that genre is true.”\n\nSo, when I come to the Gospels, I ask: Do you want to interpret a parable—like the parable of the Prodigal Son or the Good Samaritan—as if everything about it were recalling historical events? If so, you’re making a bad move with genre.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Some critics claim the idea that Jesus is God was a later invention—\nThat Mark, the earliest Gospel, didn’t teach Jesus’ divinity.\n\nBut let’s walk through Mark real quick… 👇\n\n🔹 Mark 1 – John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus.\n(Mark is applying Isaiah 40 which prepares the way for God.)\n🔹 Mark 2 – Jesus forgives sins—and the religious leaders say, “Only God can do that.”\n🔹 Mark 3 – Jesus casts out demons and says He has bound the strong man (Satan) to plunder his house.\n👉 What human binds Satan?\n🔹 Mark 4 – Jesus calms the storm. The Old Testament says only God can do that.\n🔹 Mark 5 – Jesus raises the dead. Again, a divine act.\n🔹 Mark 6 – Jesus walks on water. The Old Testament says only God treads on the waves.\n🔹 Mark 9 – Jesus casts out a demon without praying, then tells His disciples, “This kind only comes out by prayer.”\nThey’re stunned. Why? He didn’t pray.\n👉 Implication: He doesn’t need to.\n🔹 Mark 12 – Jesus calls Himself David’s Lord, not just David’s son.\n(Who is greater than King David?)\n🔹 Mark 13–14 – Jesus speaks of returning as the Son of Man in glory and judgment—sharing God's authority.\n\nFrom chapter one to the end, Mark shows us a Jesus who speaks, acts, and is worshiped like God.\nThe apostles didn’t “evolve” their view of Jesus.\nThey knew who He was from the beginning.\n\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Romans 10:9 says, “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”\n\nBut here’s what many miss:\nPaul is quoting Joel 2:32, which says, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”\n\nIn Joel’s context, “the Lord” refers to God—Yahweh Himself.\n\nSo what’s Paul doing?\nHe’s taking a verse about God and applying it directly to Jesus.\n\nThis isn’t subtle.

    "description": "Mark’s Gospel uses rough Greek on occasion—like the word ekballō (to drive out) for how the Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness. But when Matthew and Luke retell the same event, they soften the language. Why? They’re editing for style.\n\nLuke also seems to confuse details in the parable of the minas—mixing elements from Matthew’s version of the talents. Scholars call this editorial fatigue. And then there’s Paul, who literally says, “I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else” (1 Cor. 1:16).\n\nIf every word was dictated by God, would we expect memory lapses and stylistic cleanups? Or do these examples suggest something else is going on?\n\nThat’s why building a bottom-up view of Scripture matters—one that considers not only what Scripture says, but how it actually looks.\n\n#BiblicalInspiration #GodBreathed #ScriptureStudy #ChristianApologetics #Inerrancy #EditorialFatigue #NewTestament\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "In that passage, Paul says, “You want proof that Christ is speaking through me?” That sure sounds like inspiration, doesn’t it? Maybe even something close to dictation, similar to how prophets spoke in the Old Testament.\n\nBut here's the tension: if Christ is speaking through Paul, and yet Paul can still have a memory lapse while writing Scripture (like in 1 Corinthians 1:16), then ask yourself—could he also have had a memory lapse while preaching?\n\nThink about it: across three decades of preaching, is it possible Paul ever misattributed a teaching—like quoting something from Jeremiah and accidentally saying it was from Isaiah? Could a mistake like that happen, even while Christ was speaking through him?\n\nIf it’s possible in his preaching, why not in his writing?\n\nThat’s something worth pondering. You don’t need to come to a hard conclusion, but ask honestly: Could a biblical writer make a minor error in detail, even while being inspired by God?\n\nSo what do we do with inerrancy?\n\nMaybe the traditional syllogism needs refining:\n\nGod cannot err.\n\nThe Bible is the Word of God . . . in its meaning and message.\n\nTherefore, the Bible cannot err… in its meaning and message.\n\nThat version aligns more closely with what we actually observe in Scripture—and still affirms its divine authority.\n\n#BiblicalInspiration #GodBreathed #ScriptureStudy #ChristianApologetics #Inerrancy #EditorialFatigue #NewTestament\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "One thing I appreciate about conversations with Jehovah’s Witnesses is that we both agree on something foundational: Scripture is divinely inspired and without error. That gives us common ground. The real issue isn’t whether they believe the Bible—it’s how they interpret it. When I talk with them, I go straight to the Bible and show how certain interpretations fall short, especially regarding who Jesus is. Scripture makes it clear: Jesus claimed to be God.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "📖 What Does “God-Breathed” Really Mean?\n\nWords change over time.\nJust like “apology” once meant a defense—not saying “I’m sorry”—theopneustos needs to be understood in its original context.\n\nSo how was “God-breathed” used in the ancient world?\n\n🧾 In the Sibylline Oracles, it describes rivers and “all things” as theopneustos—not with precision, but with the idea that God was somehow behind them.\n\n🕊️ In the Testament of Abraham, angels anoint Abraham’s body with ointments & perfumes that are God-breathed—sacred, special, divinely influenced.\n\n🌌 Vettius Valens, a Roman astrologer, said ether—an all-encompasing substance—was theopneustos. Again, God was involved in its origin.\n\n📜 And by the time we get to Origen in the 3rd century, he calls Scripture theopneustos 49 times. He didn’t define the word, but believed Scripture came from God—even if it included surface-level contradictions. What mattered to him was its spiritual truth.\n\n🔍 So why does this matter?\nBecause when Paul says “All Scripture is God-breathed” in 2 Timothy 3:16, he’s pointing to divine origin—not dictation, not word-for-word mechanics, but a sacred source behind the message.\n\n#GodBreathed #BiblicalInspiration #2Timothy316 #ChristianApologetics #AncientWords #TheologyMatters #MikeLicona #Christians #Catholics #Presbyterias #HolyBible #Lutherans #Evangelicals \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "The early church didn’t treat oral tradition casually—it was guarded with intentional leadership and doctrinal accountability.\n\nAccording to Acts and Paul’s undisputed letters, the apostles were based in Jerusalem, the central hub of authority in the early Christian movement. In Galatians 2 and Acts 15, even Paul submits to that leadership, showing us that the transmission of Jesus’ teachings was not left to chance.\n\nPaul also appeals to tradition in his letters. In 1 Corinthians, he uses it to settle disputes. And in 2 Thessalonians, he tells believers not to associate with those who refuse to live according to the traditions passed down to them.\n\nThese are the actions of a community committed to preserving the message of Jesus with care.\n\nGiven the structure of oral culture and apostolic leadership, we have strong reason to believe the Gospels faithfully reflect what Jesus said and did.\n\n\n#EarlyChurch #GospelTradition #BibleTrust #OralTradition #ApostolicAuthority #BiblicalReliability #MikeLicona #ChristianApologetics\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "At ApologeticCon 2025, I walked through one of the most misunderstood doctrines in Christianity—what it really means to say the Bible is “God-breathed.” \nIn this session, I explored how inspiration and inerrancy have been defined historically, what Scripture itself claims, and what we actually observe in the text. \nI shared why I believe the Bible is divinely inspired and authoritative—even while acknowledging surface-level differences in the Gospels. If you've ever wrestled with gospel contradictions or wondered how divine truth interacts with human expression, this talk is for you.\n\nYou can fully trust the Bible without demanding rigid perfection in every word.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "In Matthew’s Gospel, we see a fascinating example of how he applies Old Testament prophecy to Jesus. \nIn Hosea 11:1, the verse says:\n \n \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\"\n \n In its original context, Hosea is referring to Israel—God’s \"son\"—being rescued from Egypt during the Exodus. If you look at the surrounding verses (especially verse 10 or early verse 11), it's clear that this passage is about Israel’s deliverance from bondage.\n \nBiblical writers, particularly Matthew, sometimes use this approach, likely because they are thinking in terms of typology rather than strict fulfillment of prophecy. (In one of my latest posts I explained what is typology).\n \n In this case, Matthew sees Jesus as a new Israel—just as Israel was called out of Egypt, so was Jesus. \n \n #Christianity #Bible #CompositionalDevices #Mathew #Gospels #YoungChristians #Christians \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "Typology is when a biblical figure, event, or concept serves as a pattern or foreshadowing of something greater that comes later. It’s not about direct prophecy, but about seeing symbolic parallels in Scripture.\n \n For example, Matthew presents Jesus as a type of Moses. One way he does this is by placing Jesus' Sermon on the Mount on a mountain, even though Luke records a similar sermon as happening on a plain. Why?\n \n - In the Old Testament, Moses received God’s Law on Mount Sinai.\n - In Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus delivers God’s teaching from a mountain, symbolizing that He is the new and greater Moses. \n \n Matthew looks to highlight theological truths—showing Jesus as the fulfillment of patterns established in the Old Testament. \n \n #Christianity #Bible #CompositionalDevices #Mathew #Gospels\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a biography. It still follows the key traits of ancient biographies:\n \n ✅ Focus on a central figure (Jesus)\n ✅ Typical biographical length\n ✅ Emphasis on deeds and sayings that reveal character\n ✅ Brief mention of ancestry (genealogy) before launching into public life\n \n A helpful comparison is Plutarch’s Life of Julius Caesar, which includes historical elements but is still recognized as a biography. Similarly, the Gospel of Luke contains historical details but remains consistent with ancient biographical conventions.\n.\n.\n.\n#RisenJesus #christianity #christians   #youngchristians #drmichaellicona #theology \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "And different models of inspiration result in different kinds of biblical texts, some of which allow errors in the autographs.\nTherefore, our speculations must attempt to have a coherent model of inspiration that takes seriously both the claims of Scripture about itself AND what we observe in Scripture. CSBI made noble efforts in this regard but fell short, because its incorrect concept of inspiration begat an incorrect concept of inerrancy. This problem can be remedied by acknowledging the confluence of Scripture and understanding inerrancy to refer to the message of Scripture.

But here's the thing: if Matthew never intended for this to be understood as a historical event, then I'm not de-historicizing—I'm simply interpreting it as it was meant to be.\n \nNow, if Matthew did intend it as history, and I still interpreted it otherwise, then yes, I'd be disagreeing with him.

    "description": "Consider these powerful thoughts from Gary Habermas during our last Q&A session: Since 1799, with Frederick Schleiermacher and his liberal successors to the present day, the most common criticism of Christianity has been the perceived discrepancies in the Gospels. Interestingly, many people recognize these discrepancies yet still believe in Jesus's resurrection.\n\nThe key issue lies in how we define the gospel according to the New Testament, which centers on Jesus' deity, death, and resurrection. While there may be minor inconsistencies, they do not undermine the core events of the Gospel. This explains how individuals can acknowledge these issues and still affirm the truth of the resurrection.\n\nIf Christ is the Son of God who died on the cross and rose from the dead, then Christianity is true.

    "title": "Christ spoke through Paul. Yet minor errors in speech didn’t undermine his message.",
    "description": "In 2 Corinthians, Paul addresses members of the Corinthian church who were challenging his authority. He says, \"You want proof that Christ is speaking through me?\" Now, if any verse ever conveyed the sense of being “God-breathed” or divinely inspired, it’s this one—Paul explicitly stating that Christ is speaking through him.\n\nPaul is referring to moments when he preached the gospel and shared Christ's teachings—Christ was speaking through him. But does that mean Paul never made a small error, like misattributing a prophecy to the wrong prophet, perhaps saying Jeremiah when it was Isaiah? In 30-plus years of preaching, are we to believe that never happened? Or that he never confused the location of a miracle Jesus performed? It’s almost certain these kinds of minor errors occurred—not just with Paul, but with other apostles too. Think about the thousands of times the apostles preached over the decades before the last one passed away. Minor mistakes were inevitable.\n\nSo, if the apostles could make small errors when Christ was speaking through them while they preached, why not when they were writing? After all, both situations would have been under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. If Christ was speaking through them in their preaching, it seems plausible that minor details might be imperfect in their writings as well. So, there are better terms for describing Scripture than how \"inerrancy\" as it is traditionally understood.\n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

Ignatius, a church leader who knew the apostles, insisted the virgin birth wasn’t just a story—it truly happened.

    "description": "Imagine you're at a theater performance. The stage is filled with actors, but suddenly, the lights dim, and a spotlight shines on one performer delivering a powerful monologue. You know the others are present, but your attention is drawn solely to that one person. That’s exactly what literary spotlighting is!\n \n Authors often use this technique to focus on a key figure while acknowledging the presence of others in the background. We see this in the Gospels too! For instance, in the resurrection narratives, John mentions only Mary Magdalene visiting the tomb. But when she says, “we don’t know where they’ve laid him,” she’s referring to the other women who were with her! 🤔\n \n This technique helps convey essential messages while still recognizing the broader context. So next time you read, pay attention to those literary spotlights illuminating key moments in the text! 💡\n \n #LiterarySpotlighting #AncientLiterature #Plutarch #GospelNarratives #BibleStudy #Resurrection #MaryMagdalene #TheaterOfWords #BiblicalLiterature #ChristianityExplained #InsightfulReading #ScriptureStudy____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "There is no compelling reason to deny that Jesus died by crucifixion. The evidence supporting this fact from the first century is robust, and without any credible evidence to the contrary, historians must conclude that Jesus was indeed crucified and that this process led to his death.

    "description": "A critic of Dr. Mike Licona (Dr. Bill Roach) has challenged Licona on his claims regarding JI Packer, as well as his understanding of the Chicago Statement, inerrancy, and inspiration. Here, Licona reacts to some of what Roach has said. This is part two of two videos reacting to Roach. The first is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_A2waU3fFc\n\nBill Roach's video to which Licona is responding may be viewed at Bill Roach’s video: https://youtu.be/Fjwo12AhVOE\n\nAt 1:26:19, I respond to Roach's claim that I turned his book \"Defending Inerrancy\" into an \"anti-Mike\" book. As part of my response, I claimed that he and his co-author Norman Geisler had to self-publish it because no publisher was interested in it. Whereas it is true that a major publisher told me that Dr. Geisler had approached it with a book proposal, which they had declined, Dr. Roach corrected me that \"Defending Inerrancy\" was not that book and that he and Dr. Geisler had proposed that book to Baker and they accepted it immediately. As a result, I want to apologize for my inaccurate claim and set the record straight. \n____________________\n\nMike Licona is Professor of New Testament Studies at Houston Christian University.

    "description": "On June 16, 2022, Bart Ehrman posted on his blog, \"Are Christian apologists just being dishonest?\" The matter is discussed because, apparently, a number of skeptics think some of the answers given by Christian Apologists are so out of touch that those giving them could not possibly believe what they're saying. Bart likewise finds some answers provided by Christian Apologists difficult to swallow and specifically mentions how Mike Licona answers the difference in how Matthew and Luke report Jesus' instructing his disciples before sending them out. Did he tell them to take a staff or not take one? Bart does not think at least some Christian apologists, perhaps even most of them are intentionally being dishonest. He just thinks they are terribly misguided. Mike Licona responds in this video.",

    "description": "Letters written by the apostle Paul represent perhaps the earliest Christian literature. Because Paul had close ties to the Jerusalem apostles who had walked with Jesus and had certified that Paul's gospel teaching was aligned with their own (Gal. 2:1-10), Paul's statements about what happens to followers of Jesus after their death have direct implications on how he viewed the resurrection of Jesus.

Can a good historical case be made for the existence of Jesus in the first century? Or is the mere belief that he existed something that must be taken on faith only?

    "title": "Were People Raised When Jesus Died?",
    "description": "Matthew 27:51-53 report a number of portents that occurred when Jesus died: the temple curtain tore from top to bottom, there was an earthquake, the rocks split, the tombs were opened, many saints were raised from the dead. After Jesus's resurrection, these saints came out of the tombs, went into the Holy City and appeared to many. Matthew is the only Gospel to report the earthquake, the rocks splitting, the tombs opening, and saints rising the dead. If we had actually been present in Jerusalem at the moment of Jesus's death, would we have seen multiple corpses coming back to life? Dr. Licona shares what he thinks.\n\nThe matter of Matthew's raised saints was discussed in detail in a virtual roundtable, consisting of Mike Licona, Craig Blomberg, Paul Copan, Michael Kruger, Chuck Quarles, and Danny Akin.

    "description": "Have you noticed differences in how the Gospels report the same events? Are there contradictions in the Gospels? In his ground-breaking research, Mike Licona built on the work of classicists who identified various compositional devices used by the ancients when writing biographies. Reading the Gospels with these devices in mind sheds much light on why Gospel differences appear. In this video, two professors at Oklahoma Baptist University express appreciation for Licona's work and how it has opened their eyes to a new way for them to understand why there are differences in the Gospels.\n\nWEBSITE: https://www.risenjesus.com\nDONATE: https://www.risenjesus.com/donate\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/michael.r.li...\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/DrMikeLicona\nBuy \"The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus\": https://amzn.to/38vTfNU\nBuy \"The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach\": https://amzn.to/2NOOZkT\nBuy \"Paul Meets Muhammad\": https://amzn.to/2RdEFoB\nBuy \"Why Are There Differences in the Gospels?\": https://amzn.to/36dzc5C",

    "description": "Near Death Experience (NDE). What happens when we die? Is there life after death? Is there a heaven? Every year I teach a course on the Gospels at Houston Baptist University for the Master of Arts Degree in Christian Apologetics. Doing the course, I ask my students if any of them have ever experienced a miracle. Usually, there are some who say they have and some have not. Of those who claim to have experienced a miracle, 1 or 2 of them have a testimony describing an experience that is quite extraordinary. One of those students in my 2018 course offering is Charlotte Thomason.\n\nNote: Yes, I know the music is too loud. I can't change that now. So, there's no need to mention it in the comments.\n\nAt age 11, Charlotte died after giving birth. In this video she describes what happened in moments before she revived.  Her conversation with Jesus is not what you expect!\n\nCharlotte Thomason holds a Master of Science in Social Work from the University of Texas at Austin and will graduate in May 2019 with a Master of Arts in Cultural Apologetics from Houston Baptist University. Prior to her retirement in 2015, Charlotte worked in Foster Care and Adoption for over 30 years, both with the State and in the private sector.\n\nCharlotte's story is a powerful testimony of redemption and healing after she endured abuse perpetrated by multiple people from age 5-18. Charlotte reflects, \"I recall how I did plead. I did pray. While the prayers did not stop the abuse at the hands of my father, uncle, or others, I never felt that heaven watched with indifference. My belief in Christ sustained me.\"\n\nFor more about Charlotte's story go to: charlottethomason.com\n\nWEBSITE: https://www.risenjesus.com\nDONATE: https://www.risenjesus.com/donate\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/michael.r.li...\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/DrMikeLicona\nBuy \"The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus\": https://amzn.to/38vTfNU\nBuy \"The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach\": https://amzn.to/2NOOZkT\nBuy \"Paul Meets Muhammad\": https://amzn.to/2RdEFoB\nBuy \"Why Are There Differences in the Gospels?\": https://amzn.to/36dzc5C\n\n#NearDeathExperiences #NDEs #MikeLicona",

    "description": "Because Christianity no longer enjoys a privileged position over other worldviews in North America, sharing the gospel and quoting a few Bible verses often carries little or no weight with nonbelievers. However, there is strong scientific and historical evidence for the truth of Christianity that may be employed with great effect. Learn why and how to connect to our culture through apologetics. This talk was given back in 2013 at Woodridge Baptist Church.",

Instead, it reveal a deep longing in people for immortality and the hope of God making things right.",

However, the resurrection of Jesus was not linked to the agricultural cycles and featured a person who had lived within the lifetime of the authors of the New Testament literature.",

Either way, it appears the Quran is mistaken pertaining to Jesus. This is called the Islamic Catch-22. \n\nMuslim apologists must, therefore, deny that Jesus predicted his death.

    "description": "Muslim apologist Ahmed Deedat famously referred to the story that Jesus died by crucifixion as cruciFICTION. This was because the Quran denies that Jesus died. Was Jesus crucified? Did he die on a cross? In this video, Dr. Licona examines whether the Quran is a reliable source pertaining to the fate of Jesus. Using 3 texts and identifying a pattern throughout the Gospels, he contends that Jesus actually predicted his imminent death. This creates a dilemma for Islam. The Quran states that Jesus did not die. So, if the Quran is correct here, then Jesus is a false prophet because he predicted his imminent death and it did not come true. But the Quran would then be mistaken when referring to Jesus as a prophet. On the other hand, if Jesus died as he had predicted, the Quran is mistaken when it says he did not. Either way, the Quran is mistaken pertaining to Jesus' fate.

Even Muslims should reject it, since the Gospel of Barnabas contradicts the Quran in several places.

That process included work using compositional textbooks, also referred to as rhetorical handbooks. Exercises in these trained the student to alter texts in the interest of paraphrasing. Not surprisingly, when reading ancient texts, including the Gospels, we observe their authors altering their source texts as trained. This practice resulted in differences in the way a story was reported.
