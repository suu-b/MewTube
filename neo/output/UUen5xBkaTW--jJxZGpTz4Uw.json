Due to so many grim, glum, grimy, and gloomy portents, people, and all who pander thereto (beyond man, forsooth?) - we finish by reading from Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra:  don't forget the good laughter; I myself have put on this crown.\n\nChannel mention (WWIII) ​⁠@PredictiveHistory \n\nPoets and writers, submit your work to “sharperssubmissions@gmail.com”\n\nThank you for subscribing, liking, commenting, and most importantly - sharing the channel and content!\n\nSharper Pen:\nImage Consulting\nMarketing\nArt & Literature\nUnparalleled Style\n\nSupport real people, artists, and the rare free-and-genius-thinkers, not more sh***y corporate platforms, AI or lazy slop, pointless entertainment and outrage channels which are promoted by all media and corporate platforms that actively demote content like mine, or anything that discusses anything \"real,” including American empire and global domination and slavery. 1). People buy what they’re told. \n\nIt’s ebarrresing and telling that people say “unalive\" on YT instead of \"death,\" for example, a sure sign of a corporate culture in denial and afraid of primal reality; a simulated people who prefer television to \"real life,” a totally retarded form of subhumanism that is against reality, life, and whatever is left of what we used to call “human beings.” 2). Largely automated now, people still buy what they’re sold. \n\nChannels like this receive no promotion, and are actively demoted by platforms like YouTube, because we discuss “culture,\" including slavery, war, death, brutality of empire, pain of life, work, suicide, and many perspectives on it, which is what was formerly known as \"the real,\" what was commonly and formerly known as “human life,” which is evaporating and increasingly dead in a largely mindless empire of slaves like America that long ago jumped the sharknado.  Rest in pieces, america /upsidedown flag emoji here  🪦☠️💐 3). Until it’s too late, and the party is over, and you get what you bought. It’s not that there wasn’t more out there, only that you were sold bu*****t on purpose, by a nation of petty, unmemorable thieves, liars and cons, america:  the dregs of history, scraping, imitating, and stealing it all until there is nothing left. 🪦 \n\nBook a paid consultation:  https://forms.gle/92jcg8b1LkihxhNZ8\n\nLinks:\n\nImage Consulting Services (home site)\nhttps://www.sharperpenimageconsulting.com/\nPayPal Donations\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRZBW85HLJ2BL\nPatreon Support\nhttps://patreon.com/SharperPenImageConsulting?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharperpenimageconsulting/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091858731851",

    "description": "This is not clickbait, but a serious commentary and questioning on religion's oldest curses and blessings through the Fall 2022 Issue of Biblical Archaeology Review.  I couple this examination with values in religion, society, war (Iran vs Israel, featuring the US) and philosophy, including the texts of Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra, as well as Dawn of Day (including the following aphorism):\n\n15. The most Ancient Means of Solace.—First stage: In every misfortune or discomfort man sees something for which he must make somebody else suffer, no matter who—in this way he finds out the amount of power still remaining to him; and this consoles him. Second stage: In every misfortune or discomfort, man sees a punishment, i.e. an expiation of guilt and the means by which he may get rid of the malicious enchantment of a real or apparent wrong. When he perceives the advantage which misfortune bring with it, he believes he need no longer make another person suffer for it—he gives up this kind of satisfaction, because he now has another.\n\nHere is a link to the Predictive History Channel as shown in the video: @PredictiveHistory \n\nThank you for subscribing, liking, commenting, and most importantly - sharing the channel and content!\n\nSharper Pen:\nImage Consulting\nMarketing\nArt & Literature\nUnparalleled Style\n\nBook a paid consultation:  https://forms.gle/92jcg8b1LkihxhNZ8\n\nDonations/revenue from PayPal, Patreon, YouTube, and funds from our business services are all used to fund the channel, and all our work, which includes pro bono consulting services for those who need it.\n\nLinks:\n\nImage Consulting Services (home site)\nhttps://www.sharperpenimageconsulting.com/\nPayPal Donations\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRZBW85HLJ2BL\nPatreon Support\nhttps://patreon.com/SharperPenImageConsulting?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharperpenimageconsulting/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091858731851",

    "description": "Today we continue discussing Nietzsche's \"The Greek State\" - the finale and finality of fate, fatalism, war, and civil war.  Or. Eternal recurrence. \n\nFor clarity sake regarding the title:  \"Civil war\" only means \"internally derived destruction, or decomposition of the state (and its property, or, people).\"  Civil war isn't just physical violence, and is never the same as any \"civil war\" of any single nation's past, but as Thucydides writes, it's when the State, therefor, the culture, therefor the people's words and Values change.  The very \"meaning (and Values) of everything\" is split.  What then is the biggest difference between the Greek State, and all states who have imitated them since?  \n\nThe Greeks weren't \"trying to do/fix/save\" anyone or anything.  They were simply being themselves - murderous and powerful.  The problem with Western History since the original Greeks died off is, since the Platonic and then Christian ideal, the imitation Greek State then lies to everyone that it has any objective (justice, equality, etc) other than Power. There is no goal, purpose, or meaning to existence, and as pertains to the state and the individual subject of it, in some sense, they were never meant to have a mind, being, or \"freedom\" of their own.  They were supposed to be asleep to life as a dream - that the larger species forever falls asleep and wakes up to this.  What is then felt and compelled?  The greed and need of life - a race against time - but to arrive where?  The end.\n\nThank you for subscribing, liking, commenting, and most importantly - sharing the channel and content!\n\nSharper Pen:\nImage Consulting\nMarketing\nArt & Literature\nUnparalleled Style\n\nBook a paid consultation:  https://forms.gle/92jcg8b1LkihxhNZ8\n\nDonations/revenue from PayPal, Patreon, YouTube, and funds from our business services are all used to fund the channel, and all our work, which includes pro bono consulting services for those who need it.\n\nLinks:\n\nImage Consulting Services (home site)\nhttps://www.sharperpenimageconsulting.com/\nPayPal Donations\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRZBW85HLJ2BL\nPatreon Support\nhttps://patreon.com/SharperPenImageConsulting?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharperpenimageconsulting/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091858731851",

    "title": "David Foster Wallace’s “E Unibus Pluram” – Irony is Tyranny Pt. 5 Reaping Perpetual Destruction",
    "description": "All species and their members eventually die, or change into something else.  In trying to deny and tyrannize this \"bad ending\" (death, reality, living and dying in the 'natural world' as real human beings) - Western Christian humanity have fabricated a corporate consumer party who leaches, enslaves, and destroys life far more than they \"create, foster, nurture, and tend to life,\" despite slogans to the contrary, and despite modern industry “producing” an historically unprecedented surplus (largely of and for destruction in perpetual war) through the labor of masses of slaves and wage-slaves the world over, all of which serves one purpose and one purpose alone:  to fund the mono-state's perpetual war of destruction and control.  The irony isn't just that this corporation-state-death-cult lies to the world and one another's face, and says it serves life, \"is the good guy,\" but that it is in fact the most rapacious and destructive force in human history (capitalism is imitation of repetition, not creation, and on someone else's time and dime too; basic reptiles never had it so easy or good). What does irony really say then, as youthful rebellious attitudes designed and sold for decades in commercial advertising; redundant \"art\" and gibberish written by backwards generations of already-backwards Americans in daycares that pass for colleges; and a political body and language that has been regurgitated by a corporate-political machine for decades, all of which is informed by what was stolen from better men, art, literature, philosophy, and psychology?  American irony is a big middle finger, a collapsing into prostration of death worship, a wallowing in and crying over being a prisoner in a vast human abyss, and ultimately, it is a demented salute and cheer of the damned, the annihilation of the self, since the self cannot or Will not ever say what it means, or do what it wants. Irony in the United States real subtext is, then, \"nobody cares, everybody is a slave to something and somebody else, and nobody can do anything about it,\" not even the actors who pretend to be leaders. This cult of nihilistic death worship set the bar, lowered the bar, is the model, and ensures that all species, and the Earth's three super-powers and their denizens, get the worst ending, forever.  In the meantime, liberalism serves to turn mankind into cattle, what psychologist Dr. Erich Fromm calls an obsessive worship of death (objects and parts and their destruction), which is to say, an enjoyment in the happy cannibalism of maliciously subjugating life and eating it; the detachment of emotions and the belief in a statistical and mechanical reality; a worship of objects and paper; an inability to use or create language - not to name and create, but repeat words and think that is the same as \"knowing\" or \"wisdom\"; all of which Fromm describes as a compensation and a 'destructiveness of \"necrophilia.\"  In America, this mindless, prefabricated hedonic treadmill of imitation, repetition and consumption, and the destruction/subjugation of life, is generally called \"success,\" driven by the lust for power called \"progressivism\" created by a recently fabricated and half-assed system that functions by defusing and refusing all responsibility, resembling all of Kafka's worst insectoid-circus nightmares. This system of fatally-ironic death-worship goes by its own names (has its own values, morality) in Eurasia and Eastasia, but in soulless and destructive industrial terms - it rules where man is object and life is statistics and paper.  Which is to say, the truth of life and perpetual war in the other two super powers is much the same. There is one party - the state - it only knows perpetual war and dissimulation, and its province, principle, and aim is controlling life and propagating necrophiliac values, including the assimilation and destruction of people, art, and an imitation “culture” and its tyrannical corporate language. \n\nThank you for subscribing, liking, commenting, and most importantly - sharing the channel and content!\n\nSharper Pen:\nImage Consulting\nMarketing\nArt & Literature\nUnparalleled Style\n\nBook a paid consultation:  https://forms.gle/92jcg8b1LkihxhNZ8\n\nDonations/revenue from PayPal, Patreon, YouTube, and funds from our business services are all used to fund the channel, and all our work, which includes pro bono consulting services for those who need it.\n\nLinks:\n\nImage Consulting Services (home site)\nhttps://www.sharperpenimageconsulting.com/\nPayPal Donations\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRZBW85HLJ2BL\nPatreon Support\nhttps://patreon.com/SharperPenImageConsulting?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharperpenimageconsulting/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091858731851",

    "description": "Irony is tyranny - for a pathological country of hoarders obsessed with money, most people are broke; most companies are a sham or in shambles; and worst, most people are unhappy.  In short, Americans, especially the pseudo-men and pseudo-women who pass as \"leadership,\" \"politicians,\" and \"CapTaInS oF InDuStRy,\" are really low-class, modern imitations of better mercenaries and whores that already came and went in history.  Which is to say, this class of pretentious pseudo-humans, fake leadership, and total actors that dominate a commercially mass-manufactured world of imitation \"culture\" are the greediest, ugliest, and most destructive humans to ever exist in human history, since \"leadership\" ceases to have a function in an intentionally destructive and inefficient factory model.  these modernly manufactured \"leaders of business/thought\" are otherwise the least creative, the least contributing, the least inspiring, the most rapacious, and yet the most pointless, meaningless, and purposeless people to ever exist in human history:  the activity and results have no actual productive or creative purpose than to maintain perpetual war and intentionally waste surplus, in an age of unprecedented surplus (now gone or hoarded).  Understand - man ceases to have any meaning, relevance, or purpose, when people who are not \"first men\" (or \"great men\") are made to stand for such things.  None of these people, and hardly even the largest corporate entity, will be remembered as important to mankind, but the USA will be remembered for at least one thing:  destroying humanity, the soul, the mind, and history itself.  If what I wrote here is upsetting in any manner, just remember, we've always been at war with Eurasia.\n\nThank you for subscribing, liking, commenting, and most importantly - sharing the channel and content!\n\nSharper Pen:\nImage Consulting\nMarketing\nArt & Literature\nUnparalleled Style\n\nBook a paid consultation:  https://forms.gle/92jcg8b1LkihxhNZ8\n\nDonations/revenue from PayPal, Patreon, YouTube, and funds from our business services are all used to fund the channel, and all our work, which includes pro bono consulting services for those who need it.\n\nLinks:\n\nImage Consulting Services (home site)\nhttps://www.sharperpenimageconsulting.com/\nPayPal Donations\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRZBW85HLJ2BL\nPatreon Support\nhttps://patreon.com/SharperPenImageConsulting?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharperpenimageconsulting/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091858731851",

It is contentment...the contentment of the quiet dead, who are scornful of the living for their restless walking. It is negation canonized as the one positive virtue. It is the prohibition of happiness. It is slavery self-sought and self-defended. It is dullness made God. A savorless people, gulping tasteless food, and sitting afterward, coatless and thoughtless, in rocking chairs prickly with inane decorations, listening to mechanical music, saying mechanical things about the excellence of electric automobiles, and viewing themselves as the greatest race in the world.”\n\nThank you for subscribing, liking, commenting, and most importantly - sharing the channel and content!\n\nSharper Pen:\nImage Consulting\nMarketing\nArt & Literature\nUnparalleled Style\n\nBook a paid consultation:  https://forms.gle/92jcg8b1LkihxhNZ8\n\nDonations/revenue from PayPal, Patreon, YouTube, and funds from our business services are all used to fund the channel, and all our work, which includes pro bono consulting services for those who need it.\n\nLinks:\n\nImage Consulting Services\nhttps://www.sharperpenimageconsulting.com/\nPayPal Donations\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRZBW85HLJ2BL\nPatreon Support\nhttps://patreon.com/SharperPenImageConsulting?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sharperpenimageconsulting/\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091858731851",
