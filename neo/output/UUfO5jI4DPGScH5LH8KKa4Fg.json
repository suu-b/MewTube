    "description": "In this video, Tom Schwanda shares about the life of George Whitefield. \n\nGeorge Whitefield’s bold “born-again” theology and passionate sermons established him as a key figure during the 18th century. Many Christians are familiar with evangelists of this time including Jonathan Edwards and John Wesley, but Whitefield, arguably the most significant member of the trio, often goes unnoticed in the church today. \n\nAfter experiencing a profound encounter with Jesus during his time at Oxford, Whitefield dedicated his life to teaching the Scriptures to others and calling people to experience the joy of knowing and loving God. This biography aims to restore Whitefield as a prominent figure in the early evangelical revival while addressing the complexities of the time in an honest, historical, and balanced way. Authors Tom Schwanda and Ian Maddock invite readers to explore the life of George Whitefield and his commitment to guiding souls toward Jesus. \n\nTom Schwanda is associate professor of Christian formation and ministry emeritus at Wheaton College and senior fellow for Christian spirituality for the C. S. Lewis Institute discipleship ministry. He is the author of The Emergence of Evangelical Spirituality: The Age of Edwards, Newton, and Whitefield and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Whitefield on the Christian Life’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/whitefield-on-the-christian-life-tpb/?srsltid=AfmBOorQRJyQEjcFuCLkJHnvx-hFzZ_L12FHNImzOE4yFCvrvarAES5r \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

She is the author of The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert; Openness Unhindered; and The Gospel Comes with a House Key.\n\nWhat did God use to draw a radical, committed unbeliever to himself? Did God take her to an evangelistic rally? Or, since she had her doctorate in literature, did he use something in print? No, God used an invitation to dinner in a modest home, from a humble couple who lived out the gospel daily, simply, and authentically.\n\nWith this story of her conversion as a backdrop, Rosaria Butterfield invites us into her home to show us how God can use this same “radical, ordinary hospitality” to bring the gospel to our lost friends and neighbors. Such hospitality sees our homes as not our own, but as God’s tools for the furtherance of his kingdom as we welcome those who look, think, believe, and act differently from us into our everyday, sometimes messy lives—helping them see what true Christian faith really looks like.\n\n❖ Check out ‘The Gospel Comes with a House Key’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-gospel-comes-with-a-house-key-hcj/?srsltid=AfmBOoptcFeJriFvWw8K_Z9zdq2VZZ_8s9tK60uooYniJpRLgu0j73NB \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, David Mathis discusses the Christian's view on Exercise.\n\nWe live in an age dominated by screens. For many, life is sedentary, and it’s become increasingly difficult to prioritize physical activity. Quietly conformed to this new normal, they feel sluggish and unmotivated. Others, however, have become entangled in a fitness culture that prioritizes the self, fuels pride, and coddles idolatry. Is it possible to make exercise holy?\n\nA Little Theology of Exercise explores how stewarding our bodies can serve the soul, honor God, and bless others. Combining biblical texts with practical guidance, pastor and author David Mathis encourages readers to embrace modest exercise as a way to deepen their knowledge and enjoyment of Christ and then reflect his love in the world. By placing Christ at the center of physical training, readers will discover a greater joy in exercise and an even deeper joy in their relationship with God.\n\nDavid Mathis serves as senior teacher and executive editor at desiringGod.org; a pastor at Cities Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota; and an adjunct professor at Bethlehem College & Seminary in Minneapolis. He and his wife, Megan, have four children. He is the author of several books, including Habits of Grace: Enjoying Jesus through the Spiritual Disciplines.\n\n❖ Check out ‘A Little Theology of Exercise: Enjoying Christ in Body and Soul’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/a-little-theology-of-exercise-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Michael Lawrence answers the question, \"Am I really a Christian if I continue to fall into sin.\" \n\nThe way a church operates says a lot about how they believe people are saved. When a church truly embraces the Bible's teaching on conversion, they will call people to repentance and faith—not just one-time decisions, therapeutic healings, or moral lifestyles. \n\nThis short book was written to help churches rightly understand the difference that a biblical doctrine of conversion should make for teaching, evangelism, discipling, membership, and every other facet of the life of a local church. \n\nMichael Lawrence serves as the lead pastor of Hinson Baptist Church in Portland, Oregon. He is the author of Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Conversion: How God Creates a People’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/conversion-case/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Matthew Boswell shares how believers can engage in congregational singing. \n\nWhen believers worship as one, they delight in the Lord, encourage each other, and declare God’s glory to the world. But sometimes, singing together can be difficult, or even frustrating, due to incompatible music styles or traditions. How can Christians overcome these differences and learn to sing in harmony?\n\nIn this accessible booklet, pastor and musician Matthew Boswell helps readers offer heartfelt, Christ-centered praise during church, even when they don’t like the music or aren’t familiar with the lyrics. He emphasizes the biblical significance of worship in a person’s relationship with God, their discipleship with fellow believers, and their witness to others. Redirecting the focus away from personal preferences, this booklet reminds Christians of the many reasons they have to glorify God with thankful hearts.\n\nMatthew Boswell is a pastor at the Trails Church in North Texas. He also serves as professor of worship ministries at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is an author and hymn writer, known for songs including “His Mercy Is More” and “Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery.” Boswell lives in Texas with his wife and four children.\n\n\n❖ Check out ‘What If I Don't Like My Church's Music?’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/what-if-i-dont-like-my-churchs-music-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Alistair Begg answers what it means that Jesus has the name above all names?\n\nJesus Christ has been given the name above all names, the highest seat of honor, the right to reign and rule. Yet the busyness of our lives and the diversions of this world often distract us from knowing the most important person we could ever know. Perhaps we need some help to see Jesus afresh.\n\nIn this thoughtful study and worshipful reflection, two influential pastors draw on decades of pastoral experience in order to guide us through the whole sweep of Scripture and examine seven key qualities of Jesus’s identity and ministry:\n\nJesus as the True Prophet\nJesus as the Great High Priest\nJesus as the Conquering King\nJesus as the Seed of the Woman\nJesus as the Son of Man\nJesus as the Suffering Servant\nJesus as the Lamb on the Throne\nName above All Names helps us to see and meditate on the incomparable character of Christ—a spiritual exercise that enables us to readily respond to the exhortations of Scripture, to focus our gaze upon the King of kings, and to better understand just how great Jesus really is.\n\nAlistair Begg is the Bible teacher on Truth For Life, a daily and weekend program that brings the exposition of Scripture to a global audience through radio, podcast, and a wide range of digital and streaming platforms. Since its launch in 1995, Truth For Life has featured teaching drawn from Alistair’s decades of faithful preaching at Parkside Church, where he served as senior pastor from 1983 until 2025. Alistair and his wife, Susan, have been married since 1975. They have three grown children and eight grandchildren.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Name above All Names’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/name-above-all-names-tpb-2/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Rosaria Butterfield shares the difference between entertaining and Christian hospitality.\n\nRosaria Butterfield is an author, pastor’s wife, homeschool mom, and former professor of English and women’s studies at Syracuse University. She is the author of The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert; Openness Unhindered; and The Gospel Comes with a House Key.\n\nWhat did God use to draw a radical, committed unbeliever to himself? Did God take her to an evangelistic rally? Or, since she had her doctorate in literature, did he use something in print? No, God used an invitation to dinner in a modest home, from a humble couple who lived out the gospel daily, simply, and authentically.\n\nWith this story of her conversion as a backdrop, Rosaria Butterfield invites us into her home to show us how God can use this same “radical, ordinary hospitality” to bring the gospel to our lost friends and neighbors. Such hospitality sees our homes as not our own, but as God’s tools for the furtherance of his kingdom as we welcome those who look, think, believe, and act differently from us into our everyday, sometimes messy lives—helping them see what true Christian faith really looks like.\n\n❖ Check out ‘The Gospel Comes with a House Key’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-gospel-comes-with-a-house-key-hcj/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Alistair Begg shares about the kingship of Jesus. \n\nAlistair Begg serves as the senior pastor of Parkside Church in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. He has been in pastoral ministry since 1975 and served eight years in Scotland at both Charlotte Chapel in Edinburgh and Hamilton Baptist Church. He has written several books and is heard daily on the radio program Truth For Life. He and his wife, Susan, have three grown children and eight grandchildren.\n\nJesus Christ has been given the name above all names, the highest seat of honor, the right to reign and rule. Yet the busyness of our lives and the diversions of this world often distract us from knowing the most important person we could ever know. Perhaps we need some help to see Jesus afresh.\n\nIn this thoughtful study and worshipful reflection, two influential pastors draw on decades of pastoral experience in order to guide us through the whole sweep of Scripture and examine seven key qualities of Jesus’s identity and ministry. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Name above All Names’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/name-above-all-names-tpb-2/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, John Piper shares what keeps God from being a megalomaniac. \n\n“God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.” This simple but powerful statement has been a cornerstone of John Piper’s ministry for nearly 40 years. Laying out the principles behind this “Christian Hedonism” Desiring God has proved to be a source of rich theological insight for countless readers through the years, guiding them to the fullness of joy found in Christ.\n\nIn this foundational work, John Piper addresses profound questions about the purpose of life and the human pursuit of pleasure. Drawing wisdom from Scripture and insights from church history, Piper challenges the belief that believers must sacrifice joy in order to please God. Instead, finding delight in God does not diminish his glory; rather, it magnifies it and fulfills the deepest desires of our souls.\n\nJohn Piper is founder and lead teacher of desiringGod.org and chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for thirty-three years as a pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than fifty books, including Desiring God; Don’t Waste Your Life; and Providence.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/desiring-god-hcj/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, David Mathis discusses the danger of making fitness too central or irrelevant. \n\nWe live in an age dominated by screens. For many, life is sedentary, and it’s become increasingly difficult to prioritize physical activity. Quietly conformed to this new normal, they feel sluggish and unmotivated. Others, however, have become entangled in a fitness culture that prioritizes the self, fuels pride, and coddles idolatry. Is it possible to make exercise holy?\n\nA Little Theology of Exercise explores how stewarding our bodies can serve the soul, honor God, and bless others. Combining biblical texts with practical guidance, pastor and author David Mathis encourages readers to embrace modest exercise as a way to deepen their knowledge and enjoyment of Christ and then reflect his love in the world. By placing Christ at the center of physical training, readers will discover a greater joy in exercise and an even deeper joy in their relationship with God.\n\nDavid Mathis serves as senior teacher and executive editor at desiringGod.org; a pastor at Cities Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota; and an adjunct professor at Bethlehem College & Seminary in Minneapolis. He and his wife, Megan, have four children.

    "description": "In this video, Matthew McCullough shares why the fight for holiness is so difficult. \n\nWhat we expect from our future has tremendous power over our experience in the meantime—that’s why the Bible places the hope of heaven at the center of the Christian life. But even if we affirm the reality of our heavenly future, we often struggle to long for heaven, much less to connect the promises of the world to come to the concrete details of life in this world as it is. If and when we think about heaven at all, it’s easy to think of it like an insurance policy that will be there when we need it. But the Bible defines our future hope as an inheritance—a trust fund that is certain, inexhaustible, and freely accessible here and now.\n\nIn this book, Matthew McCullough offers a series of meditations that model how to draw on the hope of heaven for everyday life in the meantime. Chapters connect specific struggles of life in this world—from dissatisfaction and inadequacy to anxiety, grief, indwelling sin and more—to specific promises of the world to come. Drawing on insights from Christian writers of the past, McCullough shows how the Bible uses the hope of heaven to help us now.\n\nMatthew McCullough is the pastor of Edgefield Church in Nashville, Tennessee, and the author of Remember Heaven: Meditations on the World to Come for Life in the Meantime.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Remember Heaven’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/remember-heaven-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\n\nMB01SZUPI5PDNUA",

    "description": "In this video, Alasdair Groves shares ways Christians can develop and maintain a healthy emotional life. \n\nOur emotions are complex. Some of us seem able to ignore our feelings, while others feel controlled by them. But most of us would admit that we don’t always know what to do with how we feel.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that our emotions are an indispensable part of what makes us human—and play a crucial role in our relationships with God and others. Exploring how God designed emotions for our good, this book shows us how to properly engage with our emotions—even the more difficult ones like fear, anger, shame, guilt, and sorrow—so we can better understand what they reveal about our hearts and handle them wisely in everyday moments.\n\nJ. Alasdair Groves formerly served as the executive director for the New England branch of the Christian Counseling & Educational Foundation (CCEF).

Laying out the principles behind this “Christian Hedonism” Desiring God has proved to be a source of rich theological insight for countless readers through the years, guiding them to the fullness of joy found in Christ.\n\nIn this foundational work, John Piper addresses profound questions about the purpose of life and the human pursuit of pleasure. Drawing wisdom from Scripture and insights from church history, Piper challenges the belief that believers must sacrifice joy in order to please God. Instead, finding delight in God does not diminish his glory; rather, it magnifies it and fulfills the deepest desires of our souls.\n\nJohn Piper is founder and lead teacher of desiringGod.org and chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for thirty-three years as a pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than fifty books, including Desiring God; Don’t Waste Your Life; and Providence.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/desiri... \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Sharonda Cooper shares how to let truth shape your scripture reading.  \n\nThe Bible calls us to turn our eyes to Christ, allowing his presence to transform our lives. But amid our busy routines, constant distractions, and the pull of worldly temptations, it can be easy to lose sight of him. The Psalms offer a powerful and practical means of connecting with God. These ancient prayers and songs give voice to our emotions, allowing us to praise God for his grace and faithfulness, no matter our current circumstances.\n\nTurn Your Eyes offers a structured, step-by-step approach to help readers observe, interpret, and apply a wide variety of psalms. Over the course of 8 weeks, readers will explore 15 psalms, each week focused on a different key theme, such as wisdom, thanksgiving, lament, kingship, trust, praise, and more. By delving into the Psalms, readers will come to know and love the Lord and his word in new and deeper ways.\n\nSharonda Cooper serves as content coordinator of women’s initiatives for the Gospel Coalition. She is a coauthor of Turn Your Eyes and a contributor to Fruitful and Unto Us. Sharonda is currently pursuing her MDiv in apologetics and philosophy from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and lives in Austin, Texas, with her family.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Turn Your Eyes: A Bible Study on the Psalms’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/turn-your-eyes-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

For many, life is sedentary, and it’s become increasingly difficult to prioritize physical activity. Quietly conformed to this new normal, they feel sluggish and unmotivated. Others, however, have become entangled in a fitness culture that prioritizes the self, fuels pride, and coddles idolatry. Is it possible to make exercise holy?\n\nA Little Theology of Exercise explores how stewarding our bodies can serve the soul, honor God, and bless others. Combining biblical texts with practical guidance, pastor and author David Mathis encourages readers to embrace modest exercise as a way to deepen their knowledge and enjoyment of Christ and then reflect his love in the world. By placing Christ at the center of physical training, readers will discover a greater joy in exercise and an even deeper joy in their relationship with God.\n\nDavid Mathis serves as senior teacher and executive editor at desiringGod.org; a pastor at Cities Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota; and an adjunct professor at Bethlehem College & Seminary in Minneapolis.

But most of us would admit that we don’t always know what to do with how we feel.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that our emotions are an indispensable part of what makes us human—and play a crucial role in our relationships with God and others. Exploring how God designed emotions for our good, this book shows us how to properly engage with our emotions—even the more difficult ones like fear, anger, shame, guilt, and sorrow—so we can better understand what they reveal about our hearts and handle them wisely in everyday moments.\n\nJ.

Laying out the principles behind this “Christian Hedonism” Desiring God has proved to be a source of rich theological insight for countless readers through the years, guiding them to the fullness of joy found in Christ.\n\nIn this foundational work, John Piper addresses profound questions about the purpose of life and the human pursuit of pleasure. Drawing wisdom from Scripture and insights from church history, Piper challenges the belief that believers must sacrifice joy in order to please God. Instead, finding delight in God does not diminish his glory; rather, it magnifies it and fulfills the deepest desires of our souls.\n\nJohn Piper is founder and lead teacher of desiringGod.org and chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary. He served for thirty-three years as a pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is the author of more than fifty books, including Desiring God; Don’t Waste Your Life; and Providence.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/desiring-god-hcj/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\nMB01HGLB5KISW2L",

    "description": "In this video Nicholas G. Piotrowski discusses the 'already' and 'not yet' of God's redemptive promise. \n\nGod’s people, once resting in his divine presence, now toil in exile. The theme of humanity’s expulsion and wandering begins with Adam and Eve, but echoes in events throughout the Bible. Emphasizing the pain of separation from God, exile stories also highlight the hope of resurrection and creation’s imminent restoration back to the Edenic state.\n\nIn this addition to the Short Studies in Biblical Theology series, Nicholas G. Piotrowski traces the theme of exile throughout Scripture, giving readers a renewed appreciation for redemptive history and atonement in Christ. Sharing from his 15 years of study, Piotrowski connects the journeys of Abraham, Joseph, and Jesus with tabernacle imagery and other types to illustrate recurring themes of exile from Genesis until the new creation. This accessible volume helps believers understand their own exile and rejoice with the hope that they will one day worship in God’s holy presence.\n\nNicholas G. Piotrowski is the president of Indianapolis Theological Seminary where he also teaches hermeneutics and New Testament courses. His other books include In All the Scriptures and Matthew’s New David at the End of Exile.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Return from Exile and the Renewal of God's People’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/return-from-exile-and-the-renewal-of-gods-peo-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Nancy Guthrie shares what to do when people don't sympathize with your suffering. \n\nWhen someone we know is grieving, we want to help. But sometimes we stay away or stay silent, afraid that we will do or say the wrong thing, that we will hurt instead of help.\n\nIn this straightforward and practical book, Nancy Guthrie provides us with the insight we need to confidently interact with grieving people. Drawing upon the input of hundreds of grieving people, as well as her own experience of grief, Nancy offers specifics on what to say and what not to say, and what to do and what to avoid. Tackling touchy topics like talking about heaven, navigating interactions on social media, and more, this book will equip readers to support those who are grieving with wisdom and love.\n\nNancy Guthrie teaches the Bible at her home church, Cornerstone Presbyterian Church in Franklin, Tennessee, as well as at conferences around the country and internationally, including her Biblical Theology Workshop for Women. She is the author of numerous books and the host of the Help Me Teach the Bible podcast with the Gospel Coalition.

    "description": "In this video, Alan D. Strange discusses the doctrine that will help heal the disunity of the Church. \n\nThe goal of the church should be simple—share the gospel to the ends of the earth. But in our highly politicized age, Christians can tend to place earthly political and social agendas over God’s spiritual mission of the church. \n\nIn 'Empowered Witness', author Alan D. Strange examines the doctrine of the spirituality of the church, making a clear distinction between the functions of the church and other institutions. Strange argues that if the church continues to push political agendas, no institution will be focused solely on the Great Commission and the gospel will be lost entirely. This book calls readers to become aware of the church’s power and limits and shed light on moral issues in a way that doesn’t alter the deeply spiritual and gospel-centered mission of the church. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Empowered Witness: Politics, Culture, and the Spiritual Mission of the Church’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/empowered-witness-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks/",

Work hard, but prioritize time at home. Parents are faced with an overwhelming mix of advice. Self-help books, blog posts, and endless tips often leave parents feeling more stressed, discouraged, and fearful. \n\nIn Good News for Parents, Adam Griffin offers a refreshing alternative to typical parenting advice. This book reveals how walking by the Spirit can free parents from the anxieties, stress, and self-doubt of parenting. Drawing wisdom from Galatians 5, Griffin demonstrates how each fruit of the Spirit provides the lasting relief they so desperately need. Ultimately, readers will feel more prepared to approach parenting with peace, confidence, and strength, trusting that Jesus is renewing both them and their children day by day. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Good News for Parents: How God Can Restore Our Joy and Relieve Our Burdens’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/good-news-for-parents-case/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\nMB01SYHN7P9SAEE",

    "description": "In this video, Matt McCullough shares that Heaven is suffering from a brand problem. \n\nMatthew McCullough is the pastor of Edgefield Church in Nashville, Tennessee, and the author of Remember Heaven: Meditations on the World to Come for Life in the Meantime.\n\nWhat we expect from our future has tremendous power over our experience in the meantime—that’s why the Bible places the hope of heaven at the center of the Christian life. But even if we affirm the reality of our heavenly future, we often struggle to long for heaven, much less to connect the promises of the world to come to the concrete details of life in this world as it is. If and when we think about heaven at all, it’s easy to think of it like an insurance policy that will be there when we need it. But the Bible defines our future hope as an inheritance—a trust fund that is certain, inexhaustible, and freely accessible here and now.\n\nIn this book, Matthew McCullough offers a series of meditations that model how to draw on the hope of heaven for everyday life in the meantime. Chapters connect specific struggles of life in this world—from dissatisfaction and inadequacy to anxiety, grief, indwelling sin and more—to specific promises of the world to come. Drawing on insights from Christian writers of the past, McCullough shows how the Bible uses the hope of heaven to help us now.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Remember Heaven: Meditations on the World to Come for Life in the Meantime’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/remember-heaven-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Kevin Emmert discusses Baptism and the Lord's Supper. \n\nOur culture today teaches us that we must look inside ourselves to discover our place and purpose in life—we can determine our own identities and express them however we want. This self-centered approach promises freedom and fulfillment, but it leads only to confusion and despair. \n\nIn The Water and the Blood, Kevin P. Emmert combats this egocentric mindset with a sustainable solution through Jesus Christ. Emmert explores the depth of Christian identity, which our triune God makes visible through the sacraments of the gospel.\n\nThis thoughtful, theologically driven book explains how God uses multisensory elements—water, bread, and wine—to communicate to his people and unite them to the life-giving body of Christ. Readers will be inspired to joyfully embrace the identity they have received in Christ as baptized and communing persons.  \n\n❖ Check out ‘The Water and the Blood: How the Sacraments Shape Christian Identity’ here:\nhttps://www.crossway.org/books/the-water-and-the-blood-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Iain Duguind shares a verse that impacted his life. \n\nIain M. Duguid is professor of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary. He has planted churches in England, California, and Pennsylvania. He is the author of numerous commentaries and articles.\nIn their eagerness to share the gospel, modern churches can focus on the wrong things, such as political influence, attendance numbers, or ministry techniques. This is nothing new. In the book of Acts, even Jesus’s disciples wondered which of these earthly methods he would use to establish God’s kingdom. But Jesus taught his followers then—and continues to teach us today—how the church, empowered by the Holy Spirit, will take the gospel to the nations.\n\nIn this accessible exposition of Acts 1–8, Iain Duguid explores the continuing work of Jesus after the ascension. Drawing practical lessons from the life of the early church, as well as his own 30 years as a church planter, Duguid encourages believers today toward gospel-driven, Spirit-filled mission. In a culture that is increasingly hostile toward Christianity, Turning the World Upside Down equips ordinary Christians to witness to the eternal power of the gospel. \n\n\n❖ Check out ‘Turning the World Upside Down: Lessons for the Church from Acts 1–8’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/turning-the-world-upside-down-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\n\nMB01AMOH4UFWZG3",

    "description": "In this Video, Philip Ryken discusses doubt. \n\nWill God do what he says he promises? Can we trust his intentions? Is he even good? Without guidance, these doubt-filled questions can hinder spiritual progress and lead to discouragement. Thankfully, the Bible offers encouraging examples of men and women who remained faithful to God even through seasons of uncertainty. \n\nBased on a series of Wheaton College chapel messages, this encouraging guide explores 10 Bible stories on the topic of faith and doubt to reassure readers that doubt is normal for Christians. These stories cover a wide range of questions and doubts that most Christians experience at some point in their faith journey—doubts about God’s power, protection, justice, healing, and more. Ultimately, readers will better understand the dynamic of faith and doubt, helping them renew their faith in God even through times of uncertainty.\n\nPhilip Graham Ryken is the eighth president of Wheaton College. He preached at Philadelphia’s Tenth Presbyterian Church from 1995 until his appointment at Wheaton in 2010. Ryken has published more than fifty books, including When Trouble Comes and expository commentaries on Exodus, Ecclesiastes, and Jeremiah. He serves as a board member for the Gospel Coalition and the Lausanne Movement.\n\n❖ Check out ‘ Have My Doubts: How God Can Use Your Uncertainty to Reawaken Your Faith’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/i-have-my-doubts-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\n\nMB01BV2ETIS0E7J",

    "description": "In this video, Drew Martin answers the question, who was Francis Grimké.\n\nDrew Martin is associate professor of systematic theology at Covenant Theological Seminary. He has served several churches as a pastor and as a church planter, is the author of The Covenant with Moses and the Kingdom of God, and Grimké on the Christian Life: Christian Vitality for the Church and World. \n\nFrancis Grimké’s life left a significant mark on American Christianity at the turn of the 20th century. Born enslaved in South Carolina, Grimké dedicated his life to teaching and preaching the gospel and confronting the racism and injustice of his time. For 50 years, he served as a Presbyterian pastor in Washington, DC, emerging as a prominent leader in the early civil rights movement.\n\nThis book explores Grimké’s vision of the Christian life, emphasizing his beliefs on personal piety, family, the mission of the church, and the relationship between faith and politics. His blend of doctrinal integrity and social concern helps readers wisely engage in topics like race, ethnicity, culture, and politics in the church today. As the church continues to navigate these polarized issues, Grimké reminds us that, through Christ, unity is possible.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Grimké on the Christian Life’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/grimke-on-the-christian-life-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Jonathan Gibson discusses the depth and renewal found in liturgy.\n\nEvery Christian knows the importance of a daily quiet time with the Lord. But anyone who’s been a believer long enough has likely experienced seasons that feel more mundane or routine, leading to aimlessly skimming a couple of Bible verses or praying the same prayer over and over. \n\nIn Be Thou My Vision, Jonathan Gibson has created a 31-day liturgical guide designed to provide structure to the daily worship of individuals and families. Each daily reading includes a call to worship, adoration, confession, assurance, creed and catechism, the Gloria Patri, a prayer of illumination, Bible reading, intercessory prayer, and the Lord’s Prayer. Designed to be read in 15–20 minutes a day, this beautifully produced liturgy will give readers focus and purpose to their daily quiet time while teaching them historical prayers, creeds, and catechisms that point them to Christ.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Be Thou My Vision: A Liturgy for Daily Worship’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/be-thou-my-vision-cob/\n \n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Philip Ryken discusses doubt. \n\nPhilip Graham Ryken is the eighth president of Wheaton College. He preached at Philadelphia’s Tenth Presbyterian Church from 1995 until his appointment at Wheaton in 2010. Ryken has published more than fifty books, including When Trouble Comes and expository commentaries on Exodus, Ecclesiastes, and Jeremiah. He serves as a board member for the Gospel Coalition and the Lausanne Movement. Ryken is the author of 'I Have My Doubts: How God Can Use Your Uncertainty to Reawaken Your Faith'. Based on a series of Wheaton College chapel messages, this encouraging guide explores 10 Bible stories on the topic of faith and doubt to reassure readers that doubt is normal for Christians. These stories cover a wide range of questions and doubts that most Christians experience at some point in their faith journey—doubts about God’s power, protection, justice, healing, and more. Ultimately, readers will better understand the dynamic of faith and doubt, helping them renew their faith in God even through times of uncertainty.\n❖ Check out ‘Resource’ here: link \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\nMB01S6NLAXPS5RD",

    "description": "In this video, Christina Fox discusses a hard question. \n\nKids have an innate curiosity to explore and discover new things about themselves—they learn their strengths and talents, their preferences and quirks, all while celebrating little victories along the way. While these milestones are undoubtedly important for developing children, our culture mistakenly views them as the foundation of who they are. \n\nDeeply biblical and visually engaging, this picture book uses lyrical rhymes to help children ages 3–5 understand that their true identity is not found in their preferences, past actions, or current emotions. Instead, it is rooted in their relationship with their Creator and Savior. The one who fashioned them in his likeness and calls them to live a life for his glory. A note to parents section at the end of the book offers practical tips and additional Bible verses for instilling these truths in children as they navigate the world and build the foundation of their lives.\n\nChristina Fox is a speaker and author of Tell God How You Feel: Helping Kids with Hard Emotions and Like Our Father: How God Parents Us and Why that Matters for Our Parenting. She works as the assistant director of alumni relations at Covenant College. She and her husband have two sons and reside in the Atlanta area, where she coordinates a soul care ministry at her church.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Who Are You?: A Little Book about Your Big Identity’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/who-are-you-case/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\nMB01IJKHWOZFFLW",

He has served several churches as a pastor and as a church planter, is the author of The Covenant with Moses and the Kingdom of God, and Grimké on the Christian Life: Christian Vitality for the Church and World. \n\nFrancis Grimké’s life left a significant mark on American Christianity at the turn of the 20th century. Born enslaved in South Carolina, Grimké dedicated his life to teaching and preaching the gospel and confronting the racism and injustice of his time. For 50 years, he served as a Presbyterian pastor in Washington, DC, emerging as a prominent leader in the early civil rights movement.\n\nThis book explores Grimké’s vision of the Christian life, emphasizing his beliefs on personal piety, family, the mission of the church, and the relationship between faith and politics. His blend of doctrinal integrity and social concern helps readers wisely engage in topics like race, ethnicity, culture, and politics in the church today. As the church continues to navigate these polarized issues, Grimké reminds us that, through Christ, unity is possible.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Grimké on the Christian Life’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/grimke-on-the-christian-life-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Carl Trueman discusses if our sexual desires should determine who we truly are. \n\nHow did the world arrive at its current, disorienting state of identity politics, and how should the church respond? Historian Carl R. Trueman shows how influences ranging from traditional institutions to technology and pornography moved modern culture toward an era of “expressive individualism.” Investigating philosophies from the Romantics, Nietzsche, Marx, Wilde, Freud, and the New Left, he outlines the history of Western thought to the distinctly sexual direction of present-day identity politics and explains the modern implications of these ideas on religion, free speech, and personal identity. \n\nFor fans of Trueman’s 'The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self', Strange New World offers a more concise presentation and application of some of the most critical topics of our day. Individuals and groups can work through the book together with the Strange New World Study Guide and Strange New World Video Study, sold separately. \n\nCarl R. Trueman is professor of biblical and religious studies at Grove City College. He is a contributing editor at First Things, an esteemed church historian, and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Trueman has authored or edited more than a dozen books, including Strange New World; The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self; and Histories and Fallacies.

Emerson is coprovost and dean of theology, arts, and humanities at Oklahoma Baptist University. He is also a cofounder of the Center for Baptist Renewal and has authored several books, including The Story of Scripture: An Introduction to Biblical Theology and He Descended to the Dead: An Evangelical Theology of Holy Saturday. His latest book with Crossway is titled \"Beholding the Triune God: The Inseparable Work of Father, Son, and Spirit\". In this concise introduction to the doctrine of inseparable operations, Matthew Emerson and Brandon Smith assert that the three persons of the Trinity are eternally the one God of Scripture and act inseparably in creation, salvation, and all other acts of God. Addressing complex questions—such as What does it mean that the Father is one with the Son, but is not the same person as the Son?—they present a refreshing, biblical view of the one triune God and his unified work in revelation, providence, creation, salvation, mission, communion, sanctification, and judgment.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Beholding the Triune God:’ here: crossway.org/books/beholding-the-triune-god-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "title": "\"What Makes You Beautiful\"—A Poem by Kristen Wetherell",
    "description": "In a society that values physical beauty, worldly achievements, and popularity, many young people suffer under the weight of the world’s expectations. The pressure to conform is especially intense for young girls who long to be accepted. Thankfully, the Creator of the world doesn’t judge our beauty through these impossible ideals. Instead, he focuses on the character of our hearts—our love for Christ, our fear of him, and our continual transformation by his grace.\n\nWritten for girls ages 9–12, this devotional traces the theme of beauty to help young readers know and love the one who created them in his likeness. Each reading includes a portion of a poem, a related Bible verse, a concise devotion, and a brief prayer. As young readers marvel at the beauty of God, they will be transformed, learning that the more they appreciate God’s beauty, the more beautiful they will become. \n\nKristen Wetherell is a wife, mother, writer, and speaker. She is the author of several books, including Help for the Hungry Soul and the For the Bible Tells Me So board book series. Kristen is a member of the Orchard and lives in Chicagoland with her husband and three children.\n\n❖ Check out ‘What Makes You Beautiful’ here: crossway.org/books/what-makes-you-beautiful-case/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks\n\nMB01YJHVOYKCJQL",

He has served several churches as a pastor and as a church planter, is the author of The Covenant with Moses and the Kingdom of God, and Grimké on the Christian Life: Christian Vitality for the Church and World. \n\nFrancis Grimké’s life left a significant mark on American Christianity at the turn of the 20th century. Born enslaved in South Carolina, Grimké dedicated his life to teaching and preaching the gospel and confronting the racism and injustice of his time. For 50 years, he served as a Presbyterian pastor in Washington, DC, emerging as a prominent leader in the early civil rights movement.\n\nThis book explores Grimké’s vision of the Christian life, emphasizing his beliefs on personal piety, family, the mission of the church, and the relationship between faith and politics. His blend of doctrinal integrity and social concern helps readers wisely engage in topics like race, ethnicity, culture, and politics in the church today. As the church continues to navigate these polarized issues, Grimké reminds us that, through Christ, unity is possible.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Grimké on the Christian Life’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/grimke-on-the-christian-life-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "title": "Introducing ‘What Makes You Beautiful,’ a New Daily Devotional for Girls",
    "description": "In a society that values physical beauty, worldly achievements, and popularity, many young people suffer under the weight of the world’s expectations. The pressure to conform is especially intense for young girls who long to be accepted. Thankfully, the Creator of the world doesn’t judge our beauty through these impossible ideals. Instead, he focuses on the character of our hearts—our love for Christ, our fear of him, and our continual transformation by his grace.\n\nWritten for girls ages 9–12, this devotional by Kristen Wetherell traces the theme of beauty to help young readers know and love the one who created them in his likeness. Each reading includes a portion of a poem, a related Bible verse, a concise devotion, and a brief prayer. As young readers marvel at the beauty of God, they will be transformed, learning that the more they appreciate God’s beauty, the more beautiful they will become.\n\n❖ Check out ‘What Makes You Beautiful’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/what-makes-you-beautiful-case/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooksMB01ZMM1WIPRDN6",

    "title": "What Does the Cross Have to Do with Justice?",
    "description": "In this video Jeremy Tread discusses what the cross has to done with justice. \n\nThe atonement is central to Christian theology and essential for following Jesus. In this addition to the Short Studies in Systematic Theology series, pastor Jeremy Treat explains what Scripture teaches about the atonement and how it impacts one’s daily life. \n\nTreat demonstrates that the death of Christ is a multi-dimensional work within the story of the kingdom of God. While the accomplishments of the cross are unending (including forgiveness, victory, and renewal), the heart of the cross is substitution—Jesus dying on behalf of sinners. Christ’s atoning work reconciles believers to God and to one another, calling them to a life of obedience. This book presents a kingdom-framed, substitution-centered, Trinitarian, integrated, communal, and life-changing approach to the doctrine of atonement.\n\nJeremy Treat is a pastor for preaching and vision at Reality LA, a church in Los Angeles, California. He is also an adjunct professor of theology at Biola University and is the author of Seek First: How the Kingdom of God Changes Everything and The Crucified King: Atonement and Kingdom in Biblical and Systematic Theology. \n\n❖ Check out ‘The Atonement: An Introduction’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-atonement-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

The great trees, robins, and icy winds—depicted in charming lyrical prose—all witness to God’s majesty. Moved by the beauty around her, Pippa lifts her voice, adding her own song to the chorus.\n\nCombining beauty and rhythm with artwork by P. J. Lynch, this story makes a great gift or church resource.

That's not from the Lord. He already thought you were special long before all these people showed up.

    "description": "In this video, William Osborne discusses blessing in God's plan of redemption.\n\nAs Christians, “blessing” pervades our everyday lives—from testimonies recounting God’s provision, to praise songs, to wishing someone well. The term has been so integrated into our everyday vocabulary that it is rarely considered carefully. Many people think that blessing is described as either physical (Genesis 1:22) or spiritual (Ephesians 1:3), but a fuller biblical-theological approach reveals that God’s blessing has always been physical, spiritual, and—ultimately—relational. Unpacking this pattern throughout redemptive history, William Osborne shows that divine blessing is not just a good gift here or there, but the fullness of all we were created to be, in relationship with our Creator.\n❖ Check out ‘Divine Blessing and the Fullness of Life in the Presence of God’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/divine-blessing-and-the-fullness-of-life-in-th-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

He is the author of several books, including The Local Church; Understanding Biblical Theology; and John, a volume in the Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament. \n\nIn 'The Local Church: What It Is and Why It Matters for Every Christian’', Pastor and trusted scholar Edward Klink III addresses these questions and more with a thoughtful assessment of what the Bible has to say about God’s intention for the local church body. Klink stresses its importance as God’s way of revealing his presence, displaying his power, fulfilling his purposes, and manifesting his activity in the world. In today’s hyperindividualized culture, this book not only demonstrates why it’s vital for individuals to connect to a local church, but also reveals why it’s vital to God’s work in the world.\n\n❖ Check out ‘The Local Church: What It Is and Why It Matters for Every Christian’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-local-church-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, William Osborne discusses what it looks like to be blessed. \n\nWilliam R. Osborne serves as associate professor of biblical and theological studies at College of the Ozarks and is the author of ﻿'Divine Blessing and the Fullness of Life in the Presence of God.'\nAs Christians, “blessing” pervades our everyday lives—from testimonies recounting God’s provision, to praise songs, to wishing someone well. The term has been so integrated into our everyday vocabulary that it is rarely considered carefully. Many people think that blessing is described as either physical (Genesis 1:22) or spiritual (Ephesians 1:3), but a fuller biblical-theological approach reveals that God’s blessing has always been physical, spiritual, and—ultimately—relational. Unpacking this pattern throughout redemptive history, William Osborne shows that divine blessing is not just a good gift here or there, but the fullness of all we were created to be, in relationship with our Creator.\n\n\n❖ Check out ‘Divine Blessing and the Fullness of Life in the Presence of God’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/divine-blessing-and-the-fullness-of-life-in-th-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

He has written numerous books, including Lead; Parenting; and the bestselling devotional New Morning Mercies. For every celebrity pastor exiting the ministry in the spotlight, there are many more lesser-known pastors leaving in the shadows. Pastor and best-selling author Paul David Tripp argues that lurking behind every pastoral failure is the lack of a strong leadership community. Tripp draws on his decades of ministry experience to give churches twelve gospel principles necessary to combat this leadership crisis. Each of these principles, built upon characteristics such as humility, dependency, and accountability, will enable new and experienced leaders alike to focus their attention on the ultimate leadership model: the gospel.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Lead’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/lead-hcj/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Matthew Emerson discusses the doctrine of inseparable operations. \n\n❖ Matthew Y. Emerson is coprovost and dean of theology, arts, and humanities at Oklahoma Baptist University. He is also a cofounder of the Center for Baptist Renewal and has authored several books, including The Story of Scripture: An Introduction to Biblical Theology and He Descended to the Dead: An Evangelical Theology of Holy Saturday. His latest book with Crossway is titled \"Beholding the Triune God: The Inseparable Work of Father, Son, and Spirit\". In this concise introduction to the doctrine of inseparable operations, Matthew Emerson and Brandon Smith assert that the three persons of the Trinity are eternally the one God of Scripture and act inseparably in creation, salvation, and all other acts of God. Addressing complex questions—such as What does it mean that the Father is one with the Son, but is not the same person as the Son?—they present a refreshing, biblical view of the one triune God and his unified work in revelation, providence, creation, salvation, mission, communion, sanctification, and judgment.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Beholding the Triune God:’ here: crossway.org/books/beholding-the-triune-god-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

Ford is an assistant professor of humanities at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He serves as a fellow for the Center for Pastor Theologians. He is also the codirector and research fellow for the Center for Ancient Christian Studies. He also serves as an assistant pastor. He is published in the areas of patristic theology and Christian spirituality. Ford is also the author of 'Ancient Wisdom for the Care of Souls: Learning the Art of Pastoral Ministry from the Church Fathers' which helps pastors to embrace a classic, biblical vision of ministry through the study of selected pastoral virtues and early church figures. Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory the Great both referred to ministry as “the care of souls.” Calling for a “return to the sources,” professors Coleman M. Ford and Shawn J. Wilhite ponder what a scriptural vision of ministry is, how patristic voices help inform this vision, and how pastors today can cultivate this pastoral vision in their churches. Each chapter examines an important pastoral topic—such as humility, the sacraments, and contemplative theology—and brings it to life through a constructive model and profiles of early church fathers. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Ancient Wisdom for the Care of Souls’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/ancient-wisdom-for-the-care-of-souls-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

Addressing complex questions—such as What does it mean that the Father is one with the Son, but is not the same person as the Son?—they present a refreshing, biblical view of the one triune God and his unified work in revelation, providence, creation, salvation, mission, communion, sanctification, and judgment.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Beholding the Triune God:’ here: crossway.org/books/beholding-the-triune-god-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Andrew and Christian Walker help parents learn to teach their kids about politics. \n\n❖ Navigating the world for the first time can be challenging, especially when popular cultural beliefs contradict the teachings of Scripture. So when inevitable questions arise, parents must be equipped with sound biblical answers to guide their children through the complexities of modern life—because if we fail to catechize our children, the world will surely step in to do it for us. Andrew and Christian Walker's latest book with Crossway, 'What Do I Say When . . . ?: A Parents' Guide to Navigating Cultural Chaos for Children and Teens' helps Parents respond to their children’s questions on a wide range of topics, including abortion, sexuality, transgenderism, technology, political engagement, and more. Each chapter contains age-appropriate prompts for parents of children at different stages of development and maturity. Parents can refer to each chapter as specific questions arise, study hot-button topics for future reference, or access a range of conversation starters to proactively cultivate biblical truth within their child’s heart. \n\n❖ Check out ‘What Do I Say When . . . ?’ here: crossway.org/books/what-do-i-say-when-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

Ford is an assistant professor of humanities at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He serves as a fellow for the Center for Pastor Theologians. He is also the codirector and research fellow for the Center for Ancient Christian Studies. He also serves as an assistant pastor. He is published in the areas of patristic theology and Christian spirituality. Ford is also the author of 'Ancient Wisdom for the Care of Souls: Learning the Art of Pastoral Ministry from the Church Fathers' which helps pastors to embrace a classic, biblical vision of ministry through the study of selected pastoral virtues and early church figures. Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory the Great both referred to ministry as “the care of souls.” Calling for a “return to the sources,” professors Coleman M. Ford and Shawn J. Wilhite ponder what a scriptural vision of ministry is, how patristic voices help inform this vision, and how pastors today can cultivate this pastoral vision in their churches. Each chapter examines an important pastoral topic—such as humility, the sacraments, and contemplative theology—and brings it to life through a constructive model and profiles of early church fathers. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Ancient Wisdom for the Care of Souls’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/ancient-wisdom-for-the-care-of-souls-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

Ford is an assistant professor of humanities at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He serves as a fellow for the Center for Pastor Theologians. He is also the codirector and research fellow for the Center for Ancient Christian Studies. He also serves as an assistant pastor. He is published in the areas of patristic theology and Christian spirituality. Ford is also the author of 'Ancient Wisdom for the Care of Souls: Learning the Art of Pastoral Ministry from the Church Fathers' which helps pastors to embrace a classic, biblical vision of ministry through the study of selected pastoral virtues and early church figures. Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory the Great both referred to ministry as “the care of souls.” Calling for a “return to the sources,” professors Coleman M. Ford and Shawn J. Wilhite ponder what a scriptural vision of ministry is, how patristic voices help inform this vision, and how pastors today can cultivate this pastoral vision in their churches. Each chapter examines an important pastoral topic—such as humility, the sacraments, and contemplative theology—and brings it to life through a constructive model and profiles of early church fathers. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Ancient Wisdom for the Care of Souls’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/ancient-wisdom-for-the-care-of-souls-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "A lot of people live with a lot of FOMO—the fear of missing out—and they’re always thinking things like \"Well, you know, if I don’t do this and I can’t do that\", and they live with regret. In this video Cameron Cole describes the one thing that will free us from the fear of missing out. \n\nCameron Cole is the director of children, youth, and family at Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, and the founder of Rooted, a ministry dedicated to fostering gospel-centered student ministry. He is the author of Therefore I Have Hope: 12 Truths That Comfort, Sustain, and Redeem in Tragedy, and the coeditor of Gospel-Centered Youth Ministry and The Jesus I Wish I Knew in High School. His latest book with Crossway is titled 'Heavenward'. \n\nFollowing the unexpected loss of his firstborn child, pastor Cameron Cole’s daily focus shifted drastically heavenward. He discovered that an intentional eternal mindset can bring meaning and joy to every Christian’s life. In this heartfelt, theologically rich book, Cole draws from his personal story of grief, the apostle Paul’s letters, and the examples of believers throughout history to demonstrate how heavenly mindedness fosters contentment, hope in suffering, motivation for missions and evangelism, commitment to morality and ethics, and no fear in death.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Heavenward’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/heavenward-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Alan D. Strange dives into one of the great tragic notes in all of church history. He discusses the 1500s when African slavery came into view and came to such prominence, that the church in all of its quarters (though it had criticisms of the institution and particularly of the slave trade) did not take a clear stand against it. \n\nAlan D. Strange is professor of church history at Mid-America Reformed Seminary, a conference speaker, and the author of various works, including The Doctrine of the Spirituality of the Church in the Ecclesiology of Charles Hodge. His latest book with Crossway, 'Empowered Witness: Politics, Culture, and the Spiritual Mission of the Church' examines the doctrine of the spirituality of the church, making a clear distinction between the functions of the church and other institutions. Strange argues that if the church continues to push political agendas, no institution will be focused solely on the Great Commission and the gospel will be lost entirely. This book calls readers to become aware of the church’s power and limits and shed light on moral issues in a way that doesn’t alter the deeply spiritual and gospel-centered mission of the church. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Empowered Witness’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/empowered-witness-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway  \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

Carefully examining key documents and historical figures, Wilson demonstrates how a monumental number of political, philosophical, economic, and industrial changes in the year of America’s founding shaped the modern West into a “WEIRDER” society: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic, Ex-Christian, and Romantic. This thoroughly researched yet accessible book offers a unique historical perspective on modern views of family, government, religion, and morality—giving Christians the historical lens they need to understand today’s post-Christian trends and respond accordingly.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Remaking the World: How 1776 Created the Post-Christian West' here: https://www.crossway.org/books/remaking-the-world-hcj/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

    "description": "Randy Newman shares why the differences between religions is valuable.\n\nRandy Newman is a senior fellow for apologetics and evangelism at the C. S. Lewis Institute. He was formerly on staff with Cru, ministering in and near Washington, DC. He is the author of several books, including 'Questioning Faith: Indirect Journeys of Belief through Terrains of Doubt'. After 40 years listening to hundreds of people’s stories of faith, Randy Newman has come to see that answering spiritual questions usually involves a series of twists and turns, not a direct ascent from one belief to another. Our political view, family background, understanding of sexuality, and religious background all play a part in our faith journeys. If you or a friend are navigating terrains of doubt, you’ll find Newman to be a faithful guide. He’ll help you sort through your many questions and find solid answers.  \n\n❖ Check out ‘Questioning Faith: Indirect Journeys of Belief through Terrains of Doubt' here: https://www.crossway.org/books/questioning-faith-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

He is the author of several books, including 'Remaking the World: How 1776 Created the Post-Christian West'. In this book, Wilson highlights 7 major developments from the year 1776—globalization, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the Great Enrichment, the American Revolution, the rise of post-Christianity, and the dawn of Romanticism—and explains their relevance to social changes happening today. Carefully examining key documents and historical figures, Wilson demonstrates how a monumental number of political, philosophical, economic, and industrial changes in the year of America’s founding shaped the modern West into a “WEIRDER” society: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic, Ex-Christian, and Romantic. This thoroughly researched yet accessible book offers a unique historical perspective on modern views of family, government, religion, and morality—giving Christians the historical lens they need to understand today’s post-Christian trends and respond accordingly.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Remaking the World: How 1776 Created the Post-Christian West' here: https://www.crossway.org/books/remaking-the-world-hcj/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

He is also an adjunct professor of theology at Biola University and is the author of 'The Atonement: An Introduction'. In this book, Treat demonstrates that the death of Christ is a multi-dimensional work within the story of the kingdom of God. While the accomplishments of the cross are unending (including forgiveness, victory, and renewal), the heart of the cross is substitution—Jesus dying on behalf of sinners. Christ’s atoning work reconciles believers to God and to one another, calling them to a life of obedience. This book presents a kingdom-framed, substitution-centered, Trinitarian, integrated, communal, and life-changing approach to the doctrine of atonement.\n\n❖ Check out 'The Atonement: An Introduction' here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-atonement-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/ \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

Chase is an associate professor of biblical studies at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is also the preaching pastor of Kosmosdale Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, and is the author of several books including 'Short of Glory: A Biblical and Theological Exploration of the Fall'.  In this book, pastor and professor Mitchell Chase argues that in order to understand the fall and recognize its profound impact on later Scripture and the world today, Christians must first understand Genesis 3. Chase identifies themes found in Genesis 3—temptation, shame, messianic hope, and more—and shows how they reverberate throughout the rest of the storyline of Scripture. Understanding Adam and Eve’s fall is crucial to understanding the world as it currently is and the need for redemption through Jesus. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Short of Glory: A Biblical and Theological Exploration of the Fall’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/short-of-glory-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

These Bibles will equip believers to worship the Lord in truth and more faithfully minister to their communities.\n\nEvery $40 you give delivers ten copies of God’s Word into the hands of Christians in need.

He is also an adjunct professor of theology at Biola University and is the author of 'The Atonement: An Introduction'. In this book, Treat demonstrates that the death of Christ is a multi-dimensional work within the story of the kingdom of God. While the accomplishments of the cross are unending (including forgiveness, victory, and renewal), the heart of the cross is substitution—Jesus dying on behalf of sinners. Christ’s atoning work reconciles believers to God and to one another, calling them to a life of obedience. This book presents a kingdom-framed, substitution-centered, Trinitarian, integrated, communal, and life-changing approach to the doctrine of atonement.\n\n❖ Check out 'The Atonement: An Introduction' here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-atonement-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/ \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

He also helps readers learn to apply theology in their everyday lives by integrating invitations to pray and meditate on what they’ve learned.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Knowing God's Truth: An Introduction to Systematic Theology’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/knowing-gods-truth-case/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

    "description": "Jeremy Treat shares the different relational aspects we experience from the cross.\n\nJeremy Treat is a pastor for preaching and vision at Reality LA, a church in Los Angeles, California. He is also an adjunct professor of theology at Biola University and is the author of 'The Atonement: An Introduction'. In this book, Treat demonstrates that the death of Christ is a multi-dimensional work within the story of the kingdom of God. While the accomplishments of the cross are unending (including forgiveness, victory, and renewal), the heart of the cross is substitution—Jesus dying on behalf of sinners. Christ’s atoning work reconciles believers to God and to one another, calling them to a life of obedience. This book presents a kingdom-framed, substitution-centered, Trinitarian, integrated, communal, and life-changing approach to the doctrine of atonement.\n\n❖ Check out 'The Atonement: An Introduction' here: https://www.crossway.org/books/the-atonement-tpb/\n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/ \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

    "description": "In this video, Mitchell Chase shares insight into understanding the garden of Eden.\n\nMitchell L. Chase  is an associate professor of biblical studies at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is also the preaching pastor of Kosmosdale Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, and is the author of several books including 'Short of Glory: A Biblical and Theological Exploration of the Fall'.  In this book, pastor and professor Mitchell Chase argues that in order to understand the fall and recognize its profound impact on later Scripture and the world today, Christians must first understand Genesis 3. Chase identifies themes found in Genesis 3—temptation, shame, messianic hope, and more—and shows how they reverberate throughout the rest of the storyline of Scripture. Understanding Adam and Eve’s fall is crucial to understanding the world as it currently is and the need for redemption through Jesus. \n\n❖ Check out ‘Short of Glory: A Biblical and Theological Exploration of the Fall’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/short-of-glory-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

    "description": "Gavin Ortlund discusses how to cultivate humility in a gospel-centered way.\n\nIn Humility: The Joy of Self-Forgetfulness, Ortlund encourages readers that humility is not just an abstract virtue but a mark of gospel integrity.

Drawing from Philippians 2 and historical texts such as C. S.

    "description": "Mark Vroegop discusses how our lament drives us toward others which motivates reconciliation. \n\nGospel unity creates racial harmony. However, Martin Luther King Jr. once said that the most segregated hour in America is eleven o’clock on Sunday morning. Equipped with the gospel, the church should be the catalyst for reconciliation, yet it continues to ignore immense pain and division.\n\nIn an effort to bridge the canyon of misunderstanding, insensitivity, and hurt, Mark Vroegop writes about the practice of lament, which he defines as “the biblical language of empathy and exile, perseverance and protest.” Encouraging you to “weep with those who weep” (Rom. 12:15), Vroegop invites you to mourn with him over the brokenness that has caused division and to use lament to begin the journey toward a diverse and united church.\n\n❖ Check out “Weep with Me: How Lament Opens a Door for Racial Reconciliation” here: https://www.crossway.org/books/weep-with-me-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/   \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal   \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

We change by going deeper into the same truths that saved us in the first place.

This often happens when believers fixate on their sins while forgetting what Christ has already done on their behalf at the cross. Sam Storms explains it this way: “What consumes us is what we have done by sinning. What ought to consume us is grateful meditation on what God has done with our sinning.”\n\nIn his latest book, Storms addresses this anxiety over sin by reminding believers of the good news of the gospel.

To hear more from her, check out her new book \"Confronting Jesus: 9 Encounters with the Hero of the Gospels\". Rebecca McLaughlin shares important biblical context to help all readers see why the Gospels should be taken seriously as historical documents. Exploring eyewitness testimony about Jesus, McLaughlin points to him as a first-century Jewish man who is the Son of God, King of the Jews, mighty healer, greatest teacher, lover of sinners, suffering servant, perfect sacrifice, and universal Lord. This follow-up to her first book, \"Confronting Christianity\", helps readers understand the message of the Gospels and explore who Jesus really is. Individuals and groups can work through the book together with the \"Confronting Jesus Study Guide and the Confronting Jesus Video Study\".\n\n\n❖ Check out \"Confronting Jesus: 9 Encounters with the Hero of the Gospels\" here:  https://www.crossway.org/books/confronting-jesus-tpb/\nand \"Confronting Jesus Study Guide and the Confronting Jesus Video Study\" here: https://www.crossway.org/books/confronting-jesus-study-guide-tpb/\n\n❖The Crossway Podcast\nEpisode 197\nSeptember 19 2022\n\n❖Contents:\n0:00 Intro\n01:02 - Oversimplifying Jesus\n12:35 - Will Engaging with Non-Believers Lead Me to Doubt My Faith?\n18:59 - Did Jesus Actually Exist?\n28:22 - Wasn’t Jesus Just a Good, Moral Teacher?\n33:58 - Isn’t Christianity Fundamentally Incoherent?\n37:57 - Why Is Jesus's Jewish Identity and Background So Central to Who He Is?\n41:42 - What Is Jesus's Relationship with the Old Testament?\n46:10 - For Those Curious about Jesus\n\n❖ Listen to other episodes of the Crossway Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0YKnaHhCbjpIAdiVCJDtVv?si=36790c885c5b4b7f \nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-crossway-podcast/id1457099163 \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/ \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/?ref=page_internal \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/crossway",

    "title": "Does God Really Care about My Job?",
    "description": "Learn more: https://www.crossway.org/books/grace-at-work-tpb/\n\nHe does care about your job because he cares about you, and he has given you a calling of extending his kingdom, his name, and his glory into the place that you work. How do I know that? Because you and I are made in the image of God. And if you think about what that means, it doesn’t mean that we are God, but we are made to reflect him.\n\nI think at times about what it means to be made in God’s image. You think about the little kid who’s got the toy lawn mower who is trailing after his dad on the super charged mower that’s cutting the lawn. There’s a sense in which the child with the toy mower is not doing the same job as his dad, but there’s an unmistakable reflection. You recognize that what the child is doing reflects his father.\n\nWhen we are doing our job—not as a toy, but doing the things that actually matter—we are reflecting God himself. We are made in his image. And our job, as it were, is reflecting him but also fulfilling his mission. That may seem strange when we think missionaries and pastors are the ones doing the mission of God. But every single one of us is called by God to fulfill his purposes in the world and to reflect him.\n\nSo our jobs are important because they are a primary place that we are reflecting our God in what we do and how we do it.",

But as with many good gifts from God, tech devices are best used in moderation.\n\nIn this new picture book, readers meet Polly while on a trip to her grandparents’ farm. During her visit she spends all her time on her new tablet instead of enjoying the farm animals and playing with her cousins. A chat with her grandfather teaches her that, though screen time can be good, it can also keep kids away from better things. Using simple language and beautiful illustrations, children ages 3–7 are introduced to the idea that technology is best enjoyed within boundaries. \n\nLearn more: https://www.crossway.org/books/polly-and-the-screen-time-overload-case/\n\nCheck other TGC Kids books from Crossway - https://www.crossway.org/search/?q=tgc+kids",

    "description": "In this video, Sam Allberry discusses gender. \n\nSam Allberry is the associate pastor at Immanuel Nashville. He is the author of various books, including One with My Lord; What God Has to Say about Our Bodies; and Is God Anti-Gay?, and the cohost of the podcast You’re Not Crazy: Gospel Sanity for Young Pastors. He is a fellow at the Keller Center for Cultural Apologetics.\n\nThere’s a danger in focusing too much on the body. There’s also a danger in not valuing it enough. In fact, the Bible has lots to say about the body. With the coming of Jesus, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us”—flesh that was pierced and crushed for the sins of the world.\n\nIn What God Has to Say about Our Bodies, Sam Allberry explains that all of us are fearfully and wonderfully made, and should regard our physicality as a gift. He offers biblical guidance for living, including understanding gender, sexuality, and identity; dealing with aging, illness, and death; and considering the physical future hope that we have in Christ.\n\nIn this powerfully written book, you’ll gain a new understanding for the immeasurable value of our bodies and God’s ultimate plan to redeem them.\n\n❖ Check out ‘What God Has to Say about Our Bodies’ here: www.crossway.org/books/what-god-has-to-say-about-our-bodies-tpb/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "In this video, Graham Cole discusses the difference between fallen and unfallen angels. \n\nGraham A. Cole is emeritus dean and emeritus professor of biblical and systematic theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. An ordained Anglican minister, he has served in two parishes and was formerly the principal of Ridley College. He is the author of 'Against the Darkness: The Doctrine of Angels, Satan, and Demons.'  This book explores the doctrine of angels and demons, answering key questions about their nature and the implications for Christians’ beliefs and behavior, helping readers see their place in the larger biblical plotline that includes supernatural beings. An understanding of the reality of angels and demons encourages believers to be vigilant in the light of spiritual warfare and to be confident in Christ’s victory on the cross.\n\n❖ Check out ‘Against the Darkness: The Doctrine of Angels, Satan, and Demons’ here: https://www.crossway.org/books/against-the-darkness-case/ \n\n❖ For more resources from Crossway, check our website: https://www.crossway.org/  \n\n❖ Follow us on social media to stay up to date:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crosswaybooks/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrosswayBooks/\nX: https://x.com/crossway\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@crosswaybooks",

    "description": "Uncomfortable: The Awkward and Essential Challenge of Christian Community\n\nProducers: Josh Dennis, Jon Marshall\nDirector: Micah Lanier\nSound: Adam Billingham\nEditor, FX: Micah Lanier\n\nAbout the book:\nIt’s easy to dream about the “perfect” church—a church that sings just the right songs set to just the right music before the pastor preaches just the right sermon to a room filled with just the right mix of people who happen to agree with you on just about everything.\n\nChances are your church doesn’t quite look like that. But what if instead of searching for a church that makes us comfortable, we learned to love our church, even when it’s challenging? What if some of the discomfort that we often experience is actually good for us?\n\nThis book is a call to embrace the uncomfortable aspects of Christian community, whether that means believing difficult truths, pursuing difficult holiness, or loving difficult people—all for the sake of the gospel, God’s glory, and our joy.\n\nLearn more: crossway.org/books/uncomfortable-tpb/",

Created to help readers understand how Scripture forms the basis for our understanding of God, humanity, sin, salvation, and eternity, this study Bible features over 300 short in-text doctrinal summaries connecting Christian beliefs to specific Bible passages, 25 longer articles explaining important theological topics in greater depth, and introductions to each book of the Bible that highlight the unique ways each book contributes to the whole of Christian theology. Created by an outstanding team of editors and 26 contributors, this resource has been created to help Christians better connect what they believe about God with the very words of Scripture.\n\nLearn more: crossway.org/bibles/esv-systematic-theology-study-bible-hcj/",

    "description": "Do You Control Your Phone—Or Does Your Phone Control You?\n\nWithin a few years of its unveiling, the smartphone had become part of us, fully integrated into the daily patterns of our lives. Never offline, always within reach, we now wield in our hands a magic wand of technological power we have only begun to grasp. But it raises new enigmas, too. Never more connected, we seem to be growing more distant. Never more efficient, we have never been more distracted.\nDrawing from the insights of numerous thinkers, published studies, and his own research, writer Tony Reinke identifies twelve potent ways our smartphones have changed us—for good and bad. Reinke calls us to cultivate wise thinking and healthy habits in the digital age, encouraging us to maximize the many blessings, avoid the various pitfalls, and wisely wield the most powerful gadget of human connection ever unleashed.\n\nLearn more: crossway.org/12Ways\n\nProducers: Josh Dennis, Jon Marshall\nDirector: Jon Marshall\nDP: Tim Kellner\nLighting: Helmut Luchs\nEditor: Adam Billingham\nCompositing, FX: Micah Lanier\nPA: Jonah Parker\nShot the Red Raven in Wheaton, IL\nMusic: Lost & Found, Courtesy of KillerTracks\nActors: Jordan Singer, Clair Kassenbaum, Micah Lanier, Kevin Lipp, Jennie Sophia, Mabel H, Dan Bush\nSpecial Thanks: Fire + Wine, Amor in Motion, Gary Methodist Church, Jessica and Dan Bush",

If you are seeing this error, either try playing this link in a different browser (ie Firefox, Safari, Chrome), or try this link: https://vimeo.com/178598283\n-----\nWhen Nancy Guthrie's daughter, Hope, was born, she quickly learned that something was wrong. Doctors informed her and her husband, David, that all of the little things that weren't quite right with her were evidence of a deeper, more serious problem. They were surprised to hear that Hope had a rare metabolic disorder and would not live past her first birthday.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of their incredible pain, God was at work. In this video, Nancy shares their story of grief as she recounts their experience dealing with the death of not one, but two children—and the hope that God provided in the midst of that painful experience through those around them.\n\nLearn more about the book: crossway.org/books/what-grieving-people-wish-you-knew-about-what-tpb/",

Verse numbers, chapter and section headings, and translation footnotes are helpful navigational and interpretive tools, but they are also relatively recent conventions. In the ESV Reader’s Bible they have been removed from the Bible text. The result is a new kind of Bible-reading experience in a volume that presents Scripture as one extended story line.\nOn the top of each page a verse range is included for orientation. Other features include a single-column text setting, readable type, and a book-like format. The Reader’s Bible is a simple but elegant edition, and is perfect for devotional reading, for extended Bible reading, or for focusing on the overarching narrative of the Bible.",

The problem is that most readers stop short of seeing the bigger picture that Joseph is pointing to, and that story is even bigger and more epic than Joseph's. Take another look at Joseph and you'll see it in a whole new light.\nAbout the book:\nThe story of Joseph is more than just the story of one man.

The only path to real life is through death—a death to self that frees people to live with the fearless love and rock-solid hope that Jesus intended.\r\n\r\nThe gospel turns life upside down and the DiMarcos explain the paradoxes that result: death is the new life; less is the new more; weak is the new strong; slavery is the new freedom. Written with a relatable, contemporary style, they examine what the life and death of Christ means for those who have given their lives to him. This book will give readers a vision to dig deeper and bury themselves in Christ and to find contentment, safety, freedom, and victory in living for him.\"\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\ncrossway.org/books/die-young-tpb/",

Throughout church history the study of the book of Romans has been pivotal to understanding Christian life and doctrine. Convinced that Pauls fullest, grandest, most comprehensive statement of the gospel is just as vital today, R. C. Sproul delivered nearly sixty sermons on Romans from October 2005 to April 2007 at St. Andrews Chapel, where he has pastored for more than a decade. These never-before-published, passage-by-passage expositions will enrich any study of this weighty epistle.",
