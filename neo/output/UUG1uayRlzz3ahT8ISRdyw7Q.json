What is deconstruction like for those who do? Here I address 3 things believers say about faith deconstruction, hoping to provide clarity on the issue. My experiences don’t represent everyone’s, but they can still provide some perspective to those who do believe.\n \nFrom a former Christian’s perspective, I take on the following statements:\n \n“it’s just cool or popular to deconstruct your faith now and that’s why people do it”\n\n“Deconstruction is all about your feelings, not truth”\n\n“Deconstructing some things is good, but deconstructing other things is not. Go ahead and deconstruct, as long as you stay in the faith”\n \n \nIf you liked this video, you might also like:\n4 Mistakes Theists Make When Trying to Convert Atheists\nhttps://youtu.be/hprmo3CifJ0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------\n\n\nFind a Secular Therapist: https://www.seculartherapy.org\n\nRecovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome\n\nResources for Ex-Mu’s: https://exmuslims.org/join-us/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

This company has been marketing their products by integrating essential oils into Christian theology and New Thought ideology for years, but they’ve finally pushed this far enough to trigger a backlash. What Gary Young and David Stewart started with Healing Oils of the Bible, God’s Love Manifest in Molecules, and Raindrop technique, Mary Young and Marcella Vonn Harting have taken to its logical next step.\n \nCheck out The Antibot’s video “Young Living Accused of Being a Satanic Cult”\n https://youtu.be/5nYrjQQg6Gg\n \n \n\n\n\n***Clarification here. Young Living did not *technically* release or distribute My Word Made Flesh. As with David Stewart's books, this book was written by *technically* independent persons, then distributed to many of their reps through high-ranking *technically* independent YL reps. YL CEO Mary Young wrote the book’s forward, and there’s a QR code in the book which takes you to a site where you can join Young Living. So did YL have a hand in creating and distributing this book?

    "description": "Dr. Bart Ehrman joins me here to discuss extremely common misconceptions about the New Testament and early Christianity. The misconceptions are: \n“The gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were written by eyewitnesses, possibly the apostles themselves.”\n“Christianity was relatively unified in the first few centuries, and only became theologically diverse and fragmented with time. The further you go back, the more united Christianity is.”\n“The proto-orthodox church fathers did not accept the authority of any texts we’d now consider non-canonical, such as the apocalypse of Peter.”\n“Legendary accounts of Jesus birth, ministry, and death did not have time to form by the time the Gospels were written. So, the gospel accounts are purely historical.”\n \nCheck out and sign up for Dr. Ehrman’s webinar here (thanks for the support!):\nhttps://gmskeptic--ehrman.thrivecart.com/did-the-christmas-story-really-happen/\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------\n\n\nFind a Secular Therapist: https://www.seculartherapy.org\n\nRecovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome\n\nResources for Ex-Mu’s: https://exmuslims.org/join-us/\n\nThe Deconstruction Network: https://www.phildrysdale.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

You’re trying to destroy the faith by sharing your story. You were never a true Christian. Your faith was obviously theologically weak,” and the like. Everyday Christians, as well as certain Christian apologists respond to deconstruction stories in these ways far too often, making them predictable. Why is this?

Here’s why.\n\nSean has been role-playing as an atheist for christian students for a while, but he recently stepped up the act, telling students in an apologetics class in a christian high school that he really is an atheist. He then held a Q&A where he discussed the multiverse and fine-tuning, biblical prophecy, consciousness and many other subjects related to theology and apologetics. The discourse between Christians and atheists is already strained, and while I think Sean wants to improve that discourse, acts like these are not the way.

    "description": "With an intuitive understanding of human psychology, churches design their services to manipulate your emotions. This is how they do it.\n\nThis video is based on my experience with protestant churches in the US, but the ritual-first format can be found in Mormon, Catholic, and Orthodox churches as well. Worship services are quite effective tools of emotional and psychological manipulation, leveraging group think and emotional priming to their benefit. For many former evangelicals (and others who have deconstructed), these services created a sense of guilt, shame, or worthlessness that kept them in church long after they knew it was time to leave. For Christians, they can simulate God’s presence convincingly. Christian rituals like these are so normalized in the US that their technique of influence isn’t thought of as manipulative or even unusual, and that needs to change.

    "description": "Did you know that Saint Augustine believed that peacock flesh was incorruptible? Proto-orthodox scholars, AKA the early Church Fathers believed some odd things. Legendary phoenixes and heretical, demonic magicians like Simon Magus were very real in their minds, and they told us so. Here we discuss St. Augustine’s City of God, the text of First Clement, the New Testament Book of Acts, Ireneaus’ Against Heresies, and Cyril of Jeruselem’s Catechetical Lecture 6.

    "description": "I graduated from an evangelical university. We believed total nonsense.\n\nBefore my deconstruction of Christianity, I attended an evangelical university. Personally, I had a decent experience, probably due to my demographic and then-fundamentalism. In hindsight, though, I see that many of our common beliefs were not only ridiculous, but dangerous. We thought God could give us the ability to control (AKA completely repress) our sexual needs, that education could threaten our faith if we weren’t careful, and that Jesus can make gay people straight.\n\nThese ideas permeate the cultures of other Christian universities too. Whether it’s Liberty U, Biola, Houston Baptist University, or any other of the sort, these ideas thrive. If only these colleges could see that evangelists like Christopher Yuan are not more reliable sources than actual scientific data.\n\nMy response to Frank Turek on how to treat gay family members:\nhttps://youtu.be/BSFkcfJ6BAk\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/b2tABbV\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic\n\n\n\nSources and other links:\n\nMost people who regularly attend a protestant church as a teen leave church in their college years: https://lifewayresearch.com/2019/01/15/most-teenagers-drop-out-of-church-as-young-adults/?fbclid=IwAR2c5dETDlwIZRTrjQTFi7Kg-uvkqRjv4ULaIk9PFV84wUeaAeV2GVhCZtw\n\nFamily acceptance is positively associated with well-being and negatively associated with mental distress.

    "description": "I no longer call myself a humanist. Here’s why.\n\nIn 2019, I was confronted with some ideas which lead to an ideological shift. Thanks to Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot, Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, and Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation, I came to see morality a bit differently. Rather than humanism, I’ve taken to sentientism and ethical veganism (and have for some time now). Ultimately, I don’t think labels are nearly as important as the principles they’re meant to communicate, so I don’t care to squabble over labels or definitions when I could instead cut directly to the issues at hand.\n\nThe Great Demotions often contribute to the cessation of various kinds of human prejudice. Speciesism, I think, should be the next to go.\n\n\n***Click here to listen to the books mentioned in this video for free with a 30-day free trial from Audible***\nhttp://audibletrial.com/gmskeptic \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/b2tABbV\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic\n\n\n\nSources and other links:\n\nThe Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail: A Social Intuitionist Approach to Moral Judgment \nhttps://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.124.9206&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nThis Is Exactly Why I’m an Atheist\nhttps://youtu.be/7urcE4IwMf0\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------\n\n\nFind a Secular Therapist: https://www.seculartherapy.org\n\nRecovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome\n\nResources for Ex-Mu’s: https://exmuslims.org/join-us/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

Whether tackling astrology, channeling, creationism, homeopathy, or alien abductions, Sagan’s ‘Baloney Detection Kit’ can handle the challenge.

Ebionites and Marcionites clashed over docetism, Marcion disputed the idea that god of the Old Testament was in league with Jesus, and early greek christians likely glossed over Jesus’ teachings about the afterlife as a Jewish apocolypticist. Caught up in the hot theological issues of our time, we often forget about ancient questions like those covered here.\n\nDid Jesus have a physical body? Was Jesus the son of Yahweh? Did Jesus teach about heaven and hell?

Thousands of you guys have written me comments and messages about the religious advertisements playing on my atheist videos. I assumed most of those ads were there to try to discredit atheism in order to convert atheists and skeptics, but it seems the ads running at the moment are there to keep questioning Christians in the faith. In that way, they're staying true to the mission of Christian apologetics.\n\n\"What Would You Say?\" creates intentionally short videos, so their format has limitations, but their content needs work if they want it to answer big questions for Christians, provide solid arguments for God's existence, or defend the faith from skeptics. Here, I discuss their video, \"Do You Have to Choose Between Science and Religion?\" and touch on questions like: \"Do science and religion conflict?\" and \"Is faith reliable?\" as well as concepts like God of the gaps, science literacy, equivocation fallacies, atheistic religion, evolutionary theory, and moral psychology.\n\nOriginal video: https://youtu.be/pB9jAkXlqGY\n\nPledge here to see my Patreon exclusive live stream:  https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic\n\n-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/b2tABbV\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------\n\n\nFind a Secular Therapist: https://www.seculartherapy.org\n\nRecovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome\n\nResources for Ex-Mu’s: https://exmuslims.org/join-us/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

I hope they can help a few others too. #LettersToMe\n\nIf I, a former Christian turned atheist, were to speak to my past self, you might think I'd want to explain how I became an atheist. In reality though, I think I'd just try to show myself that it's ok to be an individual. I was Independent Fundamental Baptist growing up, and that meant I faced judgement from God and the church for listening to secular music, having shaggy hair, and wearing clothes that...actually fit me.

Could we eliminate that harm but keep other aspects of religion around? Religiously unaffiliated people, or \"nones,\" are increasing in number, and many are seeking out new religious ideas.

If someone sent you this video, please take this as a gentle reminder to listen to the atheists with whom you speak before making assumptions. We'd all get along better in a world where more people listen to each other.\n\nA lot of people have tried to convert me. Popular arguments I receive are Pascal's wager, the kalam cosmological argument, the moral argument, the teleological argument, the case for the resurrection of Jesus, arguments from personal experience, arguments from miracles, and a LOT of threats. Rarely does anyone listen to me before trying to convert me. If they did, our conversation would actually be meaningful rather than a waste of time. You're not going to convince me to go from atheist to Christian (or any other faith) if you don't know why I went from Christian to atheist.

I'm an atheist, and I see implications like that as absurd and harmful, so I'm here to counter them. Religious people can be reasonable, just reading the Bible doesn't justify atheism, and you can be reasoned out of beliefs you weren't reasoned into.\n\nLike I said in my last video like this (4 Things Atheists Should Never Say), I see a lot of these sayings and ideas as vestiges of \"New atheism\" from the hayday of The God Delusion, God Is Not Great, and the Four Horsemen: Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Daniel Dennett. Regardless of their source, atheists shouldn't say these things.

Although I haven't yet found any which are without error, some arguments are better, or more convincing, than others. Apologetics can appear dry on the surface, but they're fascinating upon closer inspection. These arguments often sneak in false premises and tricky debate tactics which many don't catch. Here, though, I've analyzed some of the most popular arguments for god, charted their stats, examined their special abilities, and ranked them accordingly. The arguments discussed here are, in no particular order: The Ontological Argument, The Argument from Personal Experience, The Kalam Cosmological Argument, the Teleological Argument, Paschal's Wager, and the Moral Argument.\n\nWant to know how to prove that god exists, or how to convince an atheist of god's existence?

They think they're being actively oppressed by the government. Because measles has had several outbreaks in places like Rockland county, NY, unvaccinated people had been briefly banned from public places. So, the anti-vax crowd, inspired by Del Bigtree, have taken to wearing the Star of David (or Magen) as their own. I did a kind of experiment in asking anti-vax facebook what they think of this.

I deconverted from Christian fundamentalism over 3 years ago now, and I'm glad I did. Issues like old earth vs young earth, evolution vs creationism, the Bible vs LGBT rights, got me thinking about the validity of faith, Christian apologetics, and personal religious experiences, and I eventually changed my perspective on all of those things. The strangest part of my story may be that Young Living Essential Oils played a roll in my becoming an atheist. Because I was without them for so long, I recognize the importance of critical thinking skills, healthy skepticism, and scientific literacy.\n\nI hope that this video will help those who feel isolated as an atheist or agnostic, or who are still in the atheist closet and are thinking of coming out.

Religious media loves to propagate all these falsehoods (I'm looking at you Pureflix's God's Not Dead and CBS' God Friended Me). For those believers who will listen, it only takes 10 minutes with a calm, friendly atheist to explain why all of these statements are false.

They’ve just figured out ways to do it legally. Eric Hovind was recently busted by the FDA and issued a warning letter for selling B17 supplements as a cancer cure, and that inspired me to dig deeper into this issue.\n\nSkepticism is our only defense against scammers who would have us risk our lives over fake cures that make them money. Thunderf00t broke Eric’s story, Aron Ra told me about it, Paulogia and I researched it further, and I’m using his blunder to illustrate how the hucksters of alternative medicine market their bunk.\n\nCollab with Paulogia: https://youtu.be/cUdS29nFZv0\n\nReport scams to the FTC: https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&panel1-1\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more videos on pseudoscience, skepticism, and atheism!\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\nSources:\n(1) https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm118000.pdf\n(2) https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentApprovalProcess/default.htm\n(3)\nhttps://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/transparency/basics/ucm195635.htm\n(4) https://www.fda.gov/food/dietarysupplements/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

Like anyone trying something new and unusual, I had several questions: Is reiki real? Is reiki a hoax? Is it a religion? Although I had some preconceived notions, I attempted to enter my reiki session as unassuming as possible. However, after my reiki treatment, I felt I had good reasons to remain unconvinced that reiki healing has much merit. It seems that the practitioners’ claims relied on anecdotal evidence and the experience of the placebo effect. In that way, reiki is much like other forms of alternative medicine.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more videos on pseudoscience, skepticism, and atheism!\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

Why were black people denied the priesthood until 1978? Kwaku and Ian of the channel “3 Mormons” insist that Mormon doctrine was never racist, just that the founding prophets were. In doing so, they accidently discredit the teachings of Brigham Young entirely. 3 Mormons cherry pick their doctrine in order to defend their church’s integrity, but end up disproving the inherency of Mormon prophecy instead.\n\nAlso, the end of their video shows how dangerously devoted they are to their church. The church’s model of operation seems to be pulled straight from the pages of George Orwell’s 1984. I have no qualms in saying that Mormonism is a cult.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more videos on pseudoscience, skepticism, and atheism!\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\nLINKS:\n3 Mormons video: https://youtu.be/UN5Gp07zaZE\n\nCurse of Ham info: http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Curse_of_Ham\n\nBrigham Young speech on race and the priesthood: http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/sermons_talks_interviews/brigham1852feb5_priesthoodandblacks.htm\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

Likewise, there is no such thing as a true Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Mormon, or any other religious label. There are thousands of ways to interpret scripture, and without external verification of the accounts they contain, why consider one more correct than another? There is no true interpretation of the Bible, so pointing out when Christians disobey its “commands” is of little use. The fact that all scripture is subject to personal interpretation demonstrates the fragility of the assertion that it is inherent, divine, ultimate truth, which directly communicates the mandates of a perfect creator. My fellow atheists need to remember that.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more videos on pseudoscience, skepticism, and atheism!\n\nThis video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA",

Their arguments are just as ill-informed and irrational as any religious fundamentalist’s. So, debunking them takes little more than basic critical thinking skills and a little understanding of how drugs are researched and regulated. Naturopathy is pseudoscience, essential oils don’t work, homeopathy is a scam, the supplement industry is bogus, and the terrible arguments their proponents present are definitely no help.\n\nThe claims I debunk are as follows:\n1. There are no side effects\n2. I’ve experienced it and it works\n3. It's been used for thousands of years\n4. There’s research about it\n5. Big pharma is all about money and alternative medicine isn’t\n6. Pharmaceuticals are derived from plant extracts, so you might as well take the “real thing”\n7.
