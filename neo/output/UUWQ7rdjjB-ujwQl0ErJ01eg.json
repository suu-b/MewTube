Additionally, there is important discourse about issues of ethics, intellectual property, etc surrounding AI imagery.\n\nI have used Midjourney AI to create “stock” image elements including backgrounds, illustrations, and objects. I do this because it allows much greater specificity than is possible with stock image services (you need a white cow and bull, a yellow cow and bull, a spotted cow and bull, and a black cow and bull, and you want them to be in an \"old\" painted style? You got it!). \n\nAdditionally, in this video I used AI generated images of what we popularly imagine Archimedes to look like. Not only are there (obviously) no photographs of Archimedes, there are no surviving images of Archimedes whatsoever. Most of the modern imagery of him is based on a statue, located in the Naples, Italy Archeological Museum. The problem is that scholars eventually figured out that this was actually a statue of ArchiDAMUS, a 4th century king of Sparta, not ArchiMEDES.... All of this being the case, I see no risk of misinforming or creating historically inaccurate images in generating his likeness using AI (after all, it is just as \"inaccurate\" as any other drawing or painting that exists).",

    "title": "How Archimedes Almost Broke Math with Circles",
    "description": "Archimedes proved the area formula for a circle by dividing the shape into infinitesimally small pieces. The concept was behind some of his greatest mathematical achievements, but rested on a paradox that wasn't addressed rigorously for thousands of years. \n\nJoin my Patreon! https://patreon.com/BenSyversen\nOr, support me on Ko-Fi with a one-time donation! https://ko-fi.com/bensyversen\n\nI skipped the detailed proof in this video - you can find an excellent full explanation of Archimedes' proof of the area formula of the circle by @DanielRubin1 here: https://youtu.be/R1HUtt2oo7A?si=r-FQ-OfaES7XVmUM\n\n**A few clarifications and comments, based on helpful viewer feedback**\n\n•While Archimedes is often credited with the invention of the screw style water pump, and it bears his name, evidence shows that this invention existed in Egypt before Archimedes, and he was likely the first to \"demonstrate and fully explain its properties.\" https://books.google.com/books?id=5cP-81xDWuwC&pg=PA759#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\n•Another source, cited in Wikipedia, says that the screw may have been an improvement on a similar pump that existed in the hanging gardens of Babylon: https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/2473 (I have not independently vetted this article since it comprises such a small detail in my video)\n\n•Some have pointed out that Leibniz was given short shrift in my video. Had I known that this video would go viral, I would have held it back for a week or two to fix that problem! As it is, I hope to cover the Newton/Leibniz controversy in a future video.\n\n•It's worth clarifying that parts of the story of Archimedes' death are likely apocryphal, in particular his last words. In the video, I referred to it as a \"legend\" because there's no question that it's a good story. Some 300 years after Archimedes, Plutarch reported multiple versions of Archimedes' death and his last words. There is probably a version of the truth in there somewhere, but storytelling and myth making surely played a role as well.\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:51 - The challenge of curves\n01:44 - The area of a circle\n03:27 - The paradox of infinitesimals\n04:42 - History after Archimedes\n06:45 - Calculus in the modern world\n07:11 - Archimedes' life and death\n_____\nThe inspiration for this video comes from:\n\nInfinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe, by Steven Strogatz https://amzn.to/3RagI0v\n\nI highly recommend this book to anybody interested in reading more.
