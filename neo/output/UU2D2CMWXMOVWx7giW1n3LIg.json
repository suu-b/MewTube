    "description": "David Choe is a world-renowned artist, writer, podcaster and TV host. He tells how as a child, he was made to believe he was destined for greatness but also that he was a complete disgrace, leading him to channel his energy—including deep shame—into art that brought him global recognition. He shares about his addictions that put him on a decades-long cycle of extreme highs and lows and that forced him to eventually acknowledge and heal the childhood trauma he was battling inside. David shows up with raw, authentic presence to show us how we can transmute pain and shame into our best creative work and, more importantly, how complete vulnerability, especially about our hardest experiences, is the ultimate tool for forgiveness and self-acceptance. He also tells us the actual story about early Facebook, Pee-wee Herman and Santa Claus.\n\nNote: This conversation includes topics and language that may not be suitable for younger audiences.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/KYfcdAq\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: ⁠https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nMateina: ⁠https://drinkmateina.com/huberma\n\n*Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*David Choe*\nWebsite: https://davidchoe.com \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@davidchoe \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davidchoe \nX: https://x.com/davidchoe \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/davidchoe1 \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@davidchoe \nMedium: https://medium.com/@David_Choe \nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/david_choe\nIMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2446835\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 David Choe\n00:03:10 Drawing, Black & Colors, Death\n00:12:54 Telepathy, South Bay\n00:17:52 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & LMNT\n00:20:40 Childhood, Podcasts, Mundane Moments & Artist Life\n00:28:45 Mother, Beliefs, Religion, Artistic Ability, Childhood\n00:33:27 Gambling, Transformation; Immigrant, Disgrace\n00:40:10 Street Art, Graffiti, Creativity; Paintings, Payment; Sports\n00:52:08 Sponsor: AG1\n00:53:30 Santa, Belief; Journal, Vulnerability; Heart Break, Art\n01:00:16 Facebook, Graffiti; Theft, Gambling\n01:10:57 Adapting, Creativity\n01:17:16 Album Cover, Art & Payment\n01:23:40 Sponsor: Function\n01:25:28 Immigrant & Belonging, Academics, Learning Art, Marvel Comics, Shame\n01:35:11 Shame, Gambling Addiction, Stress\n01:43:05 Sexual Abuse, Trauma, Shame, Addiction\n01:51:52 Early Career, Pornography, Author\n02:01:20 Graffiti, Disappointment, Rejection; Early Magazines\n02:08:26 Sponsor: Mateina \n02:09:27 Pornography, Co-Dependence; Movie Set\n02:18:00 Pride & Family, Vice; Pokémon\n02:26:44 Podcast, Workaholism, Shame, Reality; Anthony Bourdain, Channing Tatum\n02:38:54 Writing, Career Success, Workaholism, Vice, News, Self-Sabotage, Heart Attack\n02:52:21 Growth & Pain, Sizzler; David Arquette\n02:58:40 Rehab, God, Purpose, Parents & Disappointment, The Choe Show, Pee-Wee Herman\n03:05:53 Gratitude, Korean Immigrant, Self-Reflection, Brokenness\n03:14:37 Emotion, Saying No, Suicide; Vacation & Workaholism, Art\n03:25:23 Legacy; Vacation, Work; Authenticity\n03:31:15 Surviving & Thriving, Suicide, Addiction, Play the Tape Out, Fun, Feeling Enough\n03:44:43 Hope & Faith, Electronics, Santa Claus\n03:51:23 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow, Reviews & Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Creativity \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I explain whether visualizing success or failure better supports goal pursuit, how to choose goals at the right level of difficulty and evaluate progress. I also share a short “space-time bridging” protocol that helps train long-range, goal-directed behavior. These tools will help you stay motivated and reach goals more effectively.   \n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WaR2Hzr\n\nWatch more Huberman Lab Essentials: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4OGNy1yE-W9IX-tPu-tJa7S\n\n*Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Goal Setting\n00:00:23 Brain & Goal Pursuit\n00:03:32 Goal Value, Action Steps\n00:05:49 Peripersonal vs Extrapersonal Space\n00:07:17 Tool: Visual Focus & Pursuing Goals\n00:11:47 Visualization & Goal Pursuit, Tool: Visualize Failure\n00:14:08 Tool: Goal Setting & Difficulty Level\n00:15:47 Dopamine & Goal Pursuit, Reward Prediction Error, Tool: Weekly Goal Assessment\n00:21:00 Dopamine & Vision; Importance of Behavioral Tools\n00:22:57 Recap of Tools for Goal Setting & Pursuit\n00:24:09 Goal Pursuit, Time; Tool: Space-Time Bridging\n00:31:38 Recap, Key Takeaways\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #GoalSetting\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Dr. Martin Picard, PhD, is a professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University and an expert on how our behaviors and psychology shape cellular energy production and rates of aging. He explains that your mitochondria don’t just “make energy”; they translate what you do—your mindset and your relationships—into the energy you experience as vitality or lack thereof. He explains how exercise, nutrition, sleep, meditation, and even certain thought patterns and our sense of purpose can charge our cells like batteries. He also shares findings that hair greying is the result of cellular stress and is reversible. This episode links physical and mental ‘energy’ with cellular energy and provides science-supported tools to improve your physical and mental health.\n\nShow notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/dHanxYL\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1:  https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLingo: https://hellolingo.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Martin Picard*\nPersonal website: https://martinpicard.energy\nLab website: https://www.picardlab.org \nAcademic profile: https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd \nPublications: https://www.picardlab.org/all-publications.html \nTEDx talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJo0hpLhyI \nResources: https://www.picardlab.org/resources.html \nScientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/martin-picard\nX: https://x.com/MitoPsychoBio \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitopsychobio \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Martin Picard\n00:03:50 What is Energy?, Energy Flow & Transformation\n00:07:53 Energy, Vitality, Emotions, Sensory Perception\n00:14:18 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & Lingo\n00:17:19 “Mito-Centric” View of World, Mitochondrial Energy & Information Patterns\n00:25:26 Organelles, Mitochondria & Energy Transformation; Maternal Genes\n00:31:12 Mitotypes & Differentiation, Mitochondria as “Social Organisms”\n00:36:52 Food & Dysfunctional Energy Transformation\n00:40:02 Lifestyle Choices & Interests, Physiological Growth\n00:46:39 Pregnancy, Amenorrhea; Illness & Tiredness\n00:51:07 Sponsor: AG1\n00:52:29 Energy Transformation &amp; Distribution; Body’s Wisdom, Feeling Sick\n00:56:27 Tool: Feel Your Energy; Breath & Energy\n01:02:31 Flow of Energy; Trade-Offs, Life Purpose &amp; Enjoyment\n01:10:15 Biology, Meaningful Experiences & Energy Flow\n01:16:27 Sponsor: Function\n00:18:15 Inflammation, Energetic Flow\n01:20:43 Child Prodigies, Species Lifespan &amp; Mitochondrial Metabolism; Aging\n01:28:56 Lifestyle & Aging: Exercise, Fasting; Inflammation, Sleep, Stimulants\n01:37:06 Energetic Stress Signals, GDF-15, Cancer, Heart Failure\n01:42:18 Genes, Lifestyle & Aging\n01:47:54 Gray Hair Reversal, Stress; Inflammation & Aging\n01:57:37 Energy Recovery, Sleep & Mitochondrial Function, Stress, Meditation\n02:05:16 Tools: Yoga Nidra, NSDR; Pre-Sleep Relaxation, Energy & Restorative Sleep\n02:10:58 Diet  Individualization, Clinical Trials; Mitochondria & Nutrition, Keto\n02:20:14 Alcohol; Energy Budget; Stress\n02:25:02 Exercise, Increase Mitochondria, Overtraining; Resistance & Growth\n02:33:06 Sponsor: Waking Up\n02:34:41 Supplements & Mitochondria Health, Deficiencies, SS31, Methylene Blue\n02:41:31 Energy Flow; Experiences, Balance\n02:49:13 Transform Through Resistance, Energetic Awareness, Connection\n02:56:05 Food Over-consumption Mitochondria Disruption; Tissues & Mitochondria\n03:01:02 Mitochondrial Health Test; Tool: Ways to Increase Energy; Meditation\n03:06:10 Peptides; Fertility Supplements, Urolithin A; Electromagnetic Fields\n03:12:16 Acknowledgements\n03:14:15 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify; Apple Follow, Reviews; Feedback,\nSponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Longevity \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Dr. Glen Jeffery, PhD, is a professor of neuroscience at University College London and a leading expert on how different colors (wavelengths) of light impact cellular, organ and overall health. He explains that long-wavelength light (red, near-infrared and infrared) can enter the body and brain to enhance mitochondrial function and thereby improve metabolism, eyesight, blood glucose regulation, mood, hormones and more. We also discuss how short-wavelength light from LED bulbs can impair mitochondrial health and why balanced, full-spectrum light is essential for health. Dr. Jeffery shares simple yet powerful ways to use natural and artificial light sources to enhance your metabolic function, eyesight and longevity.\n\nShow notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/gwX6N6d\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nWealthfront*: ⁠https://wealthfront.com/huberman\nJoovv: ⁠https://joovv.com/huberman\nRorra: ⁠https://rorra.com/huberman\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Dr. Glen Jeffery*\nAcademic profile: https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/7465 \nUniversity College London Research Domains: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/domains/food-metabolism-society/experts/glen-jeffery \nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UYlObKkAAAAJ&hl=en \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/glen-jeffery-441a2b1b \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Glen Jeffery\n00:03:12 Light, Ultraviolet (UV), Visible & Infrared (IR) Light\n00:06:25 Light's Impact on the Body & Light, Sunburn, Cataracts\n00:09:55 UV Light, All-Cause Mortality, Skin Cancer\n00:14:55 Sponsors: Wealthfront & Joovv\n00:17:58 Light Impacts Mitochondria Function & Structure, Long-Wavelength Light (Red/IR), Nano Water\n00:25:00 Long-Wavelength Light Passes Through Clothing & Body; Tissue Scattering\n00:30:08 Long-Wavelength Light & Blood Glucose; Mitochondria\n00:36:19 Red Light, Parkinson's Disease, Cell Death; Eye Rods & Aging; Mitochondria Community\n00:42:46 Red/IR Light, Skull & Brain; Safe Non-Ionizing Radiation\n00:48:22 Sponsors: AG1 & Rorra\n00:51:04 Offsetting Retinal Aging, Improve Vision & Long-Wavelength Light\n00:59:28 Tool: Long-Wavelength Light & Preserve Retinal Mitochondria; Sunlight\n01:03:50 Mitochondrial Theory of Aging, Circadian Rhythm & Mitochondria\n01:07:57 Tool: Improve Vision with Long-Wavelength Light\n01:10:44 Macular Degeneration, Rescuing Vision, Early Intervention\n01:13:59 Light Effects at Local vs Distant Tissues, Immune System, Body Communication\n01:19:09 Sponsor: Function\n01:20:56 Short-Wavelength Light, LED Light, Mitochondria & Serious Health Detriments\n01:28:39 Lifespan, LED Lights; Sunlight & Balanced Wavelengths; \"Sunlike\" Marketing\n01:34:45 Fires, Incandescent Lights vs LED Lights, Lasers; Long-Wavelength Devices\n01:39:07 Incandescent & Halogen Bulbs, Mitochondria & Built Environments\n01:45:19 Windows, Light & Office Work; Screens, Kids & Myopia; Tools: Plants; Lighting\n01:55:56 Bring the Outdoors Indoors\n02:00:35 Tool: Candlelight; Dim Halogen Lamps\n02:05:06 Mitochondrial Diseases, Children & Long-Wavelength Light; Light Bulbs\n02:11:53 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow, Reviews & Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n_*This experience may not be representative of other Wealthfront clients, and there is no guarantee of future performance or success.

    "description": "My guest is Dr. Jennifer Groh, PhD, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. She explains how our brain encodes sights and sounds and integrates them so we can navigate and understand the world around us. She explains what thoughts really are and how what you focus on determines your thoughts, not just in that moment but your future thoughts too. We discuss this in the context of how to improve your level of focus and happiness and how to complete tasks and task-switch more effectively. We also discuss how you can rewire the neural circuits that underlie your default patterns of thinking and attention.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/8N71cE6\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAGZ by AG1: ⁠https://drinkagz.com/huberman\nLingo: ⁠https://hellolingo.com/huberman\nWealthfront*: ⁠https://wealthfront.com/huberman\nOur Place: ⁠https://fromourplace.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: ⁠https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Jennifer Groh*\nAcademic profile: https://www.neuro.duke.edu/profile/jennifer-m-groh \nMaking Space (book): https://amzn.to/4hSqkZA\nLab website: https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh\nIn the News: https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/index.php.html#media-coverage \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jennifer-Groh-2 \nX: https://x.com/JMGrohNeuro \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-groh-316b6032\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Jennifer Groh\n00:03:41 Sounds & Vision, Sensory Integration; Dynamic Maps\n00:07:42 Context & Mapping; Screens, Projection & Perception, Ventriloquists\n00:13:52 Sound Localization\n00:16:53 Sponsors: Lingo & Wealthfront\n00:19:50 Hearing Loss & Sound Localization, Ear Folds\n00:21:56 Unfamiliarity of Hearing Your Own Voice; Tool: Bone Conduction Headphones\n00:26:16 Tool: Headphone Volume & Protecting Hearing\n00:28:57 3D Sound, Sound Distance, Thunder, Earthquakes\n00:37:24 Sound Integration; Sound Frequency & Distance, Warning Signals\n00:44:36 Sponsors: AGZ by AG1 & Our Place\n00:47:39 Music, Rhythm, Community & Emotion\n00:57:00 Music, Military; Courtship; Evolution of Music & Language\n01:02:37 Ears, Visual & Auditory Integration, Sound Localization\n01:09:48 Evolution of Visual & Auditory Systems, Music; Brain Controlling Vision\n01:15:17 Sponsor: Helix Sleep\n01:16:45 Physical Space & Sounds; Cathedrals, Sound Delay\n01:22:37 Music, Emotion & Community; Science & Admitting Weakness\n01:27:01 Thinking & Sensory Simulations; Forming Thoughts\n01:33:18 Attention, Attractor States, Flow States, Tool: Changing Environment\n01:37:38 Sounds & Environment for Focus, Attention, Tool: Mental Interval Training\n01:44:37 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:45:58 Endurance & Interval Mental Work; Mental Rest, Music\n01:50:37 Musician, Rehearsal & Performance; Pressure\n01:54:16 Chickens; Hypnotizing Chickens, Visual Attention & Focus\n02:03:47 Relaxation, Phones & Schools, Boredom, Social Media\n02:12:48 Acknowledgements\n02:13:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow, Reviews & Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\n_*This experience may not be representative of other Wealthfront clients, and there is no guarantee of future performance or success.

    "title": "Erasing Fears & Traumas Using Modern Neuroscience | Huberman Lab Essentials",
    "description": "In this ⁠Huberman Lab Essentials⁠ episode, I explore the neuroscience of fear and trauma and how to effectively process and eliminate traumatic responses.\n\nI explain why successful fear treatment requires both extinction of the old fearful response and replacement with a new positive association—not just cognitive reframing. I also explain how the threat reflex activates specific circuits connecting the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and dopamine systems, and why detailed recounting of traumatic events progressively reduces their physiological impact. Finally, I review evidence-based approaches, including prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, discuss how five minutes per day of deliberate stress through cyclic hyperventilation can rewire fear responses, explain the critical role of social connection in activating neural pathways that reduce trauma, and share supplementation options for managing anxiety.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WeEXeyX\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past full-length Huberman Lab episodes.

    "description": "My guest is Dr. David Fajgenbaum, MD, professor of translational medicine and human genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. He explains how, unbeknownst to most doctors, many approved medications can successfully treat or even cure diseases other than the ones they are typically used to treat. He shares his story of escaping death from Castleman's disease by discovering a life-saving treatment using repurposed drugs that were approved for other purposes. Our conversation explores how researchers, physicians, and you—the general public—can explore novel treatments and cures to conditions the medical profession has deemed untreatable, including cancers. We also discuss the crucial role of mindset in battling diseases and the lesser-known use of compounds to promote health and longevity.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/4ER98fx\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAGZ by AG1: ⁠https://drinkagz.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: ⁠https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nRorra: ⁠https://rorra.com/huberman\nDavid: ⁠https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. David Fajgenbaum*\nWebsite: https://davidfajgenbaum.com \nAcademic profile: https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8205911 \nTED talk: https://davidfajgenbaum.com/#ted \nSupport Every Cure’s mission: https://everycure.org/ted\nCytokine Storm Treatment & Laboratory: https://www.med.upenn.edu/CSTL\nChasing My Cure (book): https://amzn.to/49Ea3Fg\nTime100 Health 2025: https://time.com/collections/time100-health-2025/7279645/david-fajgenbaum\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dfajgenbaum\nX: https://x.com/DavidFajgenbaum \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/davidfajgenbaum\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfajgenbaum\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 David Fajgenbaum\n00:04:06 Self-Agency in Healthcare; New Uses for Old Medicines\n00:06:44 Other Uses of Aspirin & Viagra; Drug Development & Approved Use\n00:08:53 Lidocaine & Breast Cancer; Pharmaceutical Companies & Incentives\n00:11:36 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & Rorra\n00:14:16 Pharmaceutical Companies, Patents & New Uses; Lithium\n00:18:40 Tools: Finding Reliable Health Sources, Asking Questions & Disease Organizations; DADA2 Treatment\n00:21:53 Medical Community & Connections; Integrated Medical Databases\n00:24:36 Drug Repurposing, Thalidomide, Pembrolizumab\n00:28:45 Medical Research Databases, Mapping Disease Connections\n00:33:51 Every Cure Database & Programs, Bachmann-Bupp Syndrome; Colchicine & Heart Disease\n00:37:57 Sponsors: AGZ by AG1 & David\n00:40:41 David’s Medical & Career Journey, Glioblastoma, Castleman Disease\n00:49:10 Autoimmune Disease, Driven Personality, Stress & Immune System\n00:52:52 Castleman Disease, Treatment, Chemotherapy\n00:55:54 Physician Continuing Education, Santa Claus Theory of Civilization; Science Collaboration\n01:03:32 Medical School, Relapse & “Overtime”, Finding a New Treatment, Rapamycin\n01:12:46 Sport, Football & Resilience; Challenge & Personal Growth, Family\n01:18:41 Sponsor: Function\n01:20:29 Social Support; “Overtime”, Gratitude\n01:23:19 Business School, Castleman Disease Treatment; Repurposing Drugs & AI\n01:28:29 Drug Repurposing, POEMS Syndrome; Mitigating Risk\n01:35:32 Nicotine, Compounds for Preventive Health; GLP-1 Agonists\n01:40:51 Bioprospecting, Drug Development; AI, Prioritization & Novel Connections\n01:46:18 Healthcare & Children; Hope, Action & Impact Circuit; Challenge & Super-Agers\n01:52:50 Get Involved with Every Cure\n01:56:20 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow, Reviews & Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "Improve Your Lymphatic System for Overall Health & Appearance",
    "description": "Here I explain the lymphatic system, a crucial bodily network for overall health and appearance. I explain how the lymphatic system works to remove cellular waste and fluid from your organs and combat infections. I provide science-based tools that support your lymphatic system for the sake of health and appearance, including: how to reduce fluid retention in your limbs, trunk or face, how to eliminate 'bags' under your eyes and brain fog, and how to improve cardiac health and longevity. Because your lymphatic system lacks a central pump, it needs the mechanical forces generated by specific types of bodily movement, breathing and pressure to circulate your lymph properly, and I explain how you can activate these. I also explain how to support optimal functioning of your glymphatic system, a brain- and spinal cord waste-clearing system active during sleep that is crucial for brain functioning and longevity, including to prevent dementia.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/lBpKwX5\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAGZ by AG1: ⁠https://drinkagz.com/huberman\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nDavid: ⁠https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: ⁠https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Lymphatic System\n00:04:11 Circulatory System, Heart; Oxygen, Nutrient & Waste Transfer\n00:11:03 Lymphatic System, Fluid, Lymphedema, Chronic Inflammation; Brain Fog\n00:14:52 Sponsor: LMNT & David Protein\n00:17:28 Lymphatic Vessels, Tool: Enhance Lymphatic Drainage with Movement\n00:26:24 Tools: Jumping (Rebounding), Treading Water, Swimming\n00:27:41 Tool: Swelling, Lymphatic Drainage & Diaphragmatic Breathing\n00:32:05 Swimming & Lymphatic Flow; Tai Chi\n00:34:00 Lymphatic Massage, Cancer & Lymphedema; Jade Roller & Gua Sha\n00:37:28 Sponsor: AGZ by AG1\n00:38:56 Lymph Flow, Tool: Lymphatic Massage & Manual Lymphatic Drainage\n00:45:02 Immune Function of Lymphatic System, Sore Lymph Nodes\n00:54:24 Cancer Treatment, Lymph Nodes & Lymphedema\n00:57:02 Limb Swelling, Minor Lymphedema & Inflammation, Lymphatic Boots\n01:00:09 Sponsors: Eight Sleep\n01:01:43 Glymphatic System, Brain & Sleep\n01:05:56 Sleep & Brain Waste Recycling; Discovery of the Glymphatic System\n01:12:24 Enhance Glymphatic Clearance, Brain Fog, Age, Tool: Side Sleeping Position\n01:15:54 Tools: Optimize Sleep, Cardiovascular Exercise, Elevate Feet, Pillow\n01:17:29 Puffy Face, Tool: Lymphatic & Facial Massage\n01:21:23 Sponsor: Function\n01:23:11 Tool: Hydration & Lymphatic Support\n01:24:48 Tool: Cardiovascular Exercise & Lymphatic Vessels, Heart, Aging\n01:31:06 Tool: Infrared & Red Light, Mitochondria, Lymphedema, Skin Appearance\n01:36:08 Key Takeaways\n01:37:21 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow, Reviews & Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

Turns out, there's a simple answer to that. @StevePressfield explains here and on the Huberman Lab podcast out now.\n\nSteven Pressfield is the author of The War of Art and seasoned expert in how to overcome the inner force of \"resistance\"—the self-sabotaging tendency to procrastinate on your life's most important work that keeps you from realizing your professional and creative potential.\n\nAs the author of numerous best-selling books and screenplays, Steven understands resistance firsthand and how to overcome it.\n\nInstead of giving inspirational stories or quotes, he shares actionable tools for defeating inner resistance that work. His approach is concrete and can teach you how to work like a pro even if you've never been published or are entering a new field.\n\nSteven's routines for cultivating discipline and focus, including his physical training regimen (he is incredibly mentally and physically vigorous at 82), are applicable for anyone.\n\nHe gives you effective practical strategies for how to structure your day, overcome procrastination and self-doubt and do your best, most meaningful work.",

    "description": "My guest is Steven Pressfield, author of The War of Art and expert in how to overcome the inner force of \"resistance\"—the self-sabotaging tendency to procrastinate on your life's most important work that keeps you from realizing your professional and creative potential. Steven shares actionable tools for defeating inner resistance that work. His approach is concrete, not based on slogans or inspirational messages. As the author of numerous best-selling books and screenplays, Steven's routines for cultivating discipline and focus, including his physical training regimen (he is incredibly mentally and physically vigorous at 82), are applicable by anyone. He gives you effective practical strategies for how to structure your day, overcome procrastination and self-doubt and do your best, most meaningful work.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/gVuzPzl\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAGZ by AG1: https://drinkagz.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nRorra: https://rorra.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nDavid: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\n\n*Steven Pressfield*\nWebsite: https://stevenpressfield.com \nBooks: https://amzn.to/3L6dVVr\nWriting Wednesdays: https://stevenpressfield.com/category/writing-wednesdays\nOvercoming Resistance (course): https://silentwritingretreat.com/steven-pressfield\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/steven_pressfield\nX: https://x.com/SPressfield \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@spressfield \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuZco7pCtIm8UvGm8dp8Yg \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StevePressfield\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Steven Pressfield\n00:04:55 Ideas & Resistance, Tree & Shadow Analogy\n00:08:45 Military, Pushing Through Resistance, War of Art\n00:10:14 Physical Training, Tools: Capturing Ideas, Little Successes\n00:16:11 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:18:36 Ideas, Invocation of the Muse, Goddess\n00:23:19 Writing, Focus, Inner Critic, Perfectionism, Tool: Think in Multiple Drafts\n00:28:21 Writing Session; Workout Analogy & Concentration\n00:32:28 Aspiring Writers & Focused Hours; Work Session Timing; Phones\n00:35:31 Inner Voice; Storytelling, Advertising\n00:39:45 Soul & Growth, Creativity, Your Calling & Voices of Resistance, Suppression\n00:48:10 Loved Ones: Projection, Resistance & Sabotage\n00:51:04 Sponsors: AGZ by AG1 & Rorra\n00:53:52 Angry & Numbing Out, Resistance, Internet; Following Your Calling\n00:59:00 Mentors: Lessons on Focus & Quitting\n01:06:46 Perfectionism\n01:10:42 Contemplating Your Mortality, Family Honor\n01:16:49 Proving Yourself & Competition\n01:22:01 First Movie, Failure, Analyze Feedback?, Tool: Self-Evaluation\n01:28:28 Book Success, One-Hit Wonders; Book Titles\n01:34:22 Sponsor: Function\n01:36:09 Personal Sacrifice; High Achievers & Unbalanced Life; Social Media\n01:44:44 Tool: Turning Pro, Amateur vs Professional Habits, Failure, Feelings\n01:49:32 Cost of Turning Pro, Tool: Taking Oneself Seriously & Others’ Reactions\n01:56:42 Creativity: Practical Advice & Muse; Acts of Faith; Surrender\n02:04:00 Sponsor: David\n02:05:17 Workspace, Uncomfortable Chair, Physical Labor, Complaining\n02:08:13 Forthcoming Book, Book Recommendations\n02:13:46 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow, Reviews & Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, my guest is Dr. David Berson, PhD, a professor of neuroscience at Brown University and an expert on the visual system and circadian biology.\n\nWe explore how the brain processes visual information, from photons entering the eye to conscious perception in the cortex. We discuss color vision, the discovery of melanopsin and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, and how light regulates our circadian clock and melatonin release. We also examine the vestibular system's role in balance and motion detection, the cerebellum's function in motor coordination, and the midbrain's integration of multiple sensory inputs. Finally, we discuss the basal ganglia's role in decision-making and an extraordinary case of neuroplasticity in visual cortex.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/kJOETdg\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past full-length Huberman Lab episodes.

    "title": "Magnesium Can Protect Against Hearing Loss",
    "description": "Most people don’t think about hearing loss unless they experience enough of it for life to become challenging, or if they have tinnitus—a very common condition causing ringing in the ear that is very disruptive to focus and sleep.\n\nOn the Huberman Lab episode out now, I talk to the Chair of Otolaryngology at Stanford School of Medicine, Konstantina Stankovic, about how to protect your hearing. Kids and adults nowadays are experiencing progressive hearing loss and most people are not aware of it. There’s also a strong correlation between progressive hearing loss and cognitive challenges later in life.\n\nThis does not mean you can’t go to concerts, etc.! It’s just a matter of taking the correct precautions, including earplugs, magnesium supplementation before and after a particularly loud event, etc.\n\nAlso, if you can hear the sound coming out of someone else’s headphones, they are going to experience hearing loss to some degree. That means it’s too loud. (That’s a tough one for me, given that I love to listen to music loud, but such is biology!)",

    "title": "You Can Learn New Habits Very Fast: Brain Circuits Rewire Faster With Urgency",
    "description": "We’ve all heard “it takes 21 days to form a new habit,” and other times we hear it’s 30 days or 60 days.\n\nThe truth is this: neural circuits will rewire at a rate that is proportional to how urgent the new behavior is.\n\nNow, of course, there are skills (physical, language, music, etc.) that need time in order to form. That’s a different form of neuroplasticity. But it’s also one that can be accelerated. It involves focus, errors (which are the signal for neural circuits to change), reflection on those errors later and quality sleep, especially in the two nights that follow the attempt to learn a new skill.\n\nOn the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast out now, my guest is Dr. Poppy Crum (yes, that’s her actual given name!). She’s a neuroscientist, professor at Stanford and former Chief of Research at Dolby Labs.\n\nWe discussed rewiring your brain circuits by using different tools, and we discussed that in the context of habit formation and new skill development. Excitingly, Poppy shares how you can use simple video of a skill you’re trying to learn and zero-cost AI to get critical, elite-level feedback and thereby learn that skill faster.\n\nShe generously provided instructions for how to use AI for different health and learning purposes. They’re in the caption of the episode and they are easy to use and free.\n\nAnd we discussed how to use zero-cost technologies to control your home environment for healthier and better living.",

    "title": "Why Lifting Tempo Doesn’t Impact Muscle Growth as Much as You Think",
    "description": "Ok, this one surprised me. I was always taught that to get maximum hypertrophy and strength increases, I should lower the weight at least twice as slowly as I lift it on each repetition and really resist the lowering (eccentric) portion in the final repetitions.\n\nTurns out, according to @bretcontreras1, this week’s guest on Huberman Lab, the tempo of lifting and lowering a weight does not impact hypertrophy very much, but he points out that you do need to control the concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) phases of each rep and not use momentum to avoid injury.\n\nI have a feeling this one might spark some controversy, so tell us what your experience is in the comments.\n\nOn the episode, we discuss how to get selective muscle growth. For instance, a lot of people want to increase the strength and size of their glutes (Bret is the expert on this; see his clients...), but not their legs, or perhaps increase their arms or their calves, etc. Or maybe you want even growth across all muscles.\n\nBret explains how to organize your training schedule and the specific workouts to do in order to accomplish your unique goals with resistance training.\n\nHe has decades of experience, and his clients show remarkable “before and after” progress. He also has a PhD in the topic, and he walks the walk (unlike a lot of exercise scientists, he has built a lot of muscle).\n\nAnd if you’re wondering if his advice pertains to women and men, keep in mind that most of his clients are women, but he trains men as well. His programs/techniques work.",

    "description": "My guest is Dr. Christof Koch, PhD, a pioneering researcher on the topic of consciousness, an investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the chief scientist at the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation. We discuss the neuroscience of consciousness—how it arises in our brain, how it shapes our identity and how we can modify and expand it. Dr. Koch explains how we all experience life through a unique “perception box,” which holds our beliefs, our memories and thus our biases about reality. We discuss how human consciousness is changed by meditation, non-sleep deep rest, psychedelics, dreams and virtual reality. We also discuss neuroplasticity (rewiring the brain), flow states and the ever-changing but also persistent aspect of the “collective consciousness” of humanity.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/DvSKMpB\n\nPre-order Andrew's book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAGZ by AG1: ⁠https://drinkagz.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: ⁠https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nOur Place: ⁠https://fromourplace.com/huberman\nHelix: ⁠https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberma\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Christof Koch*\nAllen Institute: https://alleninstitute.org/person/christof-koch\nTiny Blue Dot Foundation: https://www.tinybluedotfoundation.org \nPersonal website: https://christofkoch.com \nStories by Christof Koch: https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/christof-koch \nThen I Am Myself the World: What Consciousness Is and How to Expand It (Book): https://amzn.to/42tLC9a\nOther books: https://amzn.to/46lTHxM\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JYt9T_sAAAAJ\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Christof Koch\n00:02:31 Consciousness; Self, Flow States\n00:08:02 NSDR, Yoga Nidra, Liminal States; State of Being, Intelligence vs Consciousness\n00:13:14 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Our Place\n00:15:53 Self, Derealization, Psychedelics; Selflessness & Flow States\n00:19:53 Transformative Experience, VR, Racism & Self; Perception Box, Bayesian Model\n00:28:29 Oliver Sacks, Empathy & Animals\n00:34:01 Changing Outlook on Life, Tool: Belief & Agency\n00:37:48 Sponsors: AGZ by AG1 & Helix Sleep\n00:40:23 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) & Higher Power\n00:42:09 Neurobiology of Consciousness; Accidents, Covert Consciousness\n00:51:09 Non-Responsive State; Disability Bias, Will to Live, Resilience\n00:55:34 Will to Live, Akinetic Mutism, Neural Correlates of Consciousness\n00:57:43 Conflicting Perception Boxes, Meta Prior, Religion, AI\n01:06:47 AI, Violence, Swapping Perception Boxes, Video\n01:12:19 5-MeO-DMT, Psychedelics, Light, Consciousness & Awe; Loss of Self\n01:20:54 Death, Mystical Experience, Ocean Analogy; Physicalism & Observer\n01:27:57 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:29:29 Meditation, Tool: Spacetime Bridging; Ball-bearing Analogy; Digital Twin\n01:36:16 Mental Health Decline, Social Media, Pandemic, Family & Play, Tool: Body-Awareness Exercises\n01:41:34 Dog Breeds; Movement, Cognitive Flexibility & Longevity\n01:47:17 Cynicism, Ketamine, Tool: Belief Effect; Heroes & Finding Flaws\n01:52:46 Cynicism vs Curiosity, Compassion; Deaths of Despair, Mental Health Crisis\n01:57:26 Jennifer Aniston, Recognition & Neurons; Grandmother Hypothesis\n02:03:20 Book Recommendation; Meaning of Life\n02:09:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "My guest is ⁠Dr. David DeSteno, PhD⁠, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University. We discuss science, God and religion, including what science can and can’t reveal about the existence of God and where religious faith and science do and do not align. We also discuss why questions about life’s origins, miracles and the afterlife have persisted across time. Dr. DeSteno explains how religious rituals cause meaningful improvements in mental and physical health and how prayer and gratitude can markedly reduce stress, increase honesty and compassion and buffer against loneliness and despair. Finally, we explore what distinguishes religions and mission-based communities from cults, and we discuss the role that communities such as 12-step and Burning Man play in modern life.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wXf7nNR\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman⁠\nOur Place: ⁠https://fromourplace.com/huberman⁠\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberman⁠\nEight Sleep: ⁠https://eightsleep.com/huberman⁠\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman⁠\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. David DeSteno*\nWebsite: https://davedesteno.com\nNortheastern University academic profile: https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/david-desteno\nHow God Works (book): https://amzn.to/4njja27\nHow God Works (Podcast): https://www.howgodworks.org\nBooks: https://amzn.to/3HRWIhh\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-kiWT4AAAAJ \nX: https://x.com/daviddesteno \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/howgodworkspod\nBlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/daviddesteno.bsky.social \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-desteno-016ab6110 \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 David DeSteno\n00:02:10 Science & Belief in God, Does God Exist?\n00:07:06 Universe Origins & Scientific Questions; Religion & Life/Health Benefits\n00:15:16 Sponsors: Our Place & LMNT\n00:18:23 Russell's Teapot, “Overbelief”, Faith; Religio-prospecting, Traditional Practices\n00:26:49 Mediation & Compassion, Prayer & Stress Relief, Tools: Meditation, Prayer\n00:34:40 Superstition, Prayers & Rituals; Mourning Rituals, Eulogies, Shiva, Connection\n00:43:58 Grieving & Different Religious Traditions\n00:47:15 Sponsors: AG1 & Eight Sleep\n00:50:12 God vs Religion?; Prayer, Community, Religious Rituals & Ideals\n00:56:17 Psychedelics, Ego Death, Right vs Left-Handed Roots\n01:01:24 Good & Evil; Lies & Cheating; Gratitude & Prayer\n01:11:03 Loneliness, Community & Religion, Relationship with God & “3AM Friend”\n01:16:25 Sponsor: Function\n01:18:12 Feeling God; Intelligent Design, Evolution, Eye; Awe\n01:25:21 Overwhelm & Spiritual Experiences, Awe Despite Understanding\n01:31:01 Fear of Death, Afterlife, Tool: Contemplating Death\n01:37:11 Time Perception, Connectedness, Traditional Practices\n01:42:53 Addiction; 12-Step Programs & Surrender to a Higher Power\n01:49:02 New Religions, Burning Man, Modern Spiritual Experiences, Cults\n01:58:06 Cults vs Religions, Religious Interpretation & Reorientation \n02:03:56 AI, Technology, Religion & Intelligence; Religious “Branding”\n02:11:05 Religion Figures & Flaws, Direct Experience of God\n02:15:13 Finding a Belief System, Embracing Religious Practices, Tool: Sampling Religions\n02:21:40 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "Tools to Set Your Cortisol Rhythm",
    "description": "Getting your cortisol rhythm correct is essential to energy and sleep and much more.  \n \nThe new Huberman Lab episode covers everything you need to know about how to get your cortisol rhythm correct.  \n\nYou want high levels of cortisol in the morning and late morning and low levels at night. I teach you how to do that and the biology underlying the protocols.  \n  \nCaffeine surprisingly does not increase cortisol very much if you drink it regularly. If you don’t drink it regularly it will increase cortisol.  \n\nDeliberate cold exposure does not increase cortisol very much; in fact, it can decrease your cortisol levels if you do it regularly. Yep, you read right. Two times per week or more is regularly.  \n\nExercise is best done in the early part of the day to match your circadian cortisol rhythm, but if you can’t do it early in the day (and many of us can’t) exercise in the afternoon or evening should be followed by a few simple things to lower your cortisol. I discussed those in the episode. Otherwise, your next-morning cortisol is reduced and, over time, this can lead to type 2 burnout (explained on the episode and how to overcome it).  \n\nLicorice root is a potent elevator of cortisol. This can be used early in the day but approach with caution. It can interact with medications. I’ve been using it in the morning and it’s great.  \n\nSame goes for grapefruit, although grapefruit works through a different mechanism. It increases the duration over which cortisol is active and is less potent than licorice for cortisol.  \n\nThe episode also explains how nutrition impacts cortisol, low-carb diets, and more. Lots in there and it’s all time-stamped so you can navigate quickly to the topic most of interest to you.",

Getting your cortisol rhythm right can be transformative for your health and performance.\n\nI outline behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based strategies to raise or lower your cortisol levels at the appropriate times of day and night.

    "description": "My guest is Dr. Nirao Shah, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences and neurobiology at Stanford University School of Medicine. We discuss how the brains of males and females differ and how those differences arise from different genes and hormones during fetal development, in childhood and adulthood. We discuss what drives male- versus female-specific behaviors and how hormonal fluctuations across the lifespan, including puberty, the menstrual cycle, menopause and aging – affect behavior, cognition and health. Additionally, we discuss how biology relates to gender identity and the impact of hormone therapies on brain circuits that regulate mating, parenting and social bonding.  \n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/rJuyFMY\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Nirao Shah*\nStanford lab website: https://med.stanford.edu/nirao.html \nStanford academic profile: https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/nirao-shah \nPublications: https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/nirao-shah#publications\nX: https://x.com/shah_laboratory\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Nirao Shah\n00:02:11 Mice, Humans & Brain, Biological Conservation\n00:05:25 Hormones, Nature vs Nurture\n00:07:13 Biological Sex Differences, Chromosomes & SRY Gene, Hormones \n00:16:01 Sponsors: Maui Nui & Eight Sleep\n00:19:09 Androgen Mutations, Feminization & Masculinization \n00:22:04 SRY Gene; Animals & Sexual Trans-Differentiation\n00:27:49 Hormones & Biological Brain Differentiation \n00:31:22 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Androstenedione; Stress & Pregnancy\n00:35:56 Genes, Brain Differentiation & Sexual Identity; Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\n00:43:37 Testosterone, Estrogen & Brain Circuits\n00:47:27 Sponsors: AG1 & LMNT\n00:50:36 Intersex Individuals, Castration\n00:52:23 Female Sexual Behavior, Brain, Testosterone & Pheromones\n00:57:58 Identify as Heterosexual or Homosexual, Difference in Hormone Levels?\n01:00:42 Gender, Sexual Orientation & Hormones; Hormone Replacement Therapy\n01:10:21 Aromatization; Steroid Hormones & Gene Expression\n01:15:00 Kids & Changing Gender Identity\n01:19:05 Sexual Behavior, Refractory Period & Male Brain, Tacr1 Cells\n01:21:31 Sponsor: Function\n01:23:19 Hypothalamus, Dopamine, Prolactin, Cabergoline, Libido, Dopamine\n01:27:05 Brain Circuits, Aggression & Sexual Behavior\n01:32:40 Refractory Period; Age, Testosterone & Libido\n01:36:07 Tacr1 Cells in Females, Periaqueductal Gray & Innate Behaviors\n01:40:00 Parenting Behaviors & Brain Circuits; Pet Dogs\n01:43:12 Oxytocin, Pair Bonding, Vasopressin; Biological Redundancy \n01:47:22 Libido, Melanocortin, Tacr1 Neurons; GLP-1 Agonists, Clinical Trials; Kisspeptin\n01:56:43 Female Brain Changes, Menstrual Cycle, Pregnancy, Menopause; Estrogen; Men & Hormone Fluctuation?\n02:04:10 Life Experience Male vs Female, Sex Recognition, Behaviors & Context\n02:16:05 Pain Management; Endocrine Disrupters, Gender Identity\n02:21:03 Future Projects\n02:24:29 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "My guest is Michael Easter, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and best-selling author. We discuss how particular daily life choices undermine our level of joy, our sense of purpose, our physical and our mental health and the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly steps we can all take to vastly increase our level of motivation, gratitude and overall life satisfaction. We discuss how effortful foraging for information, undistracted reflection and physical exercise are ways to ‘invest’ and therefore grow our levels of dopamine, energy and motivation, whereas low-friction activities are specifically designed to hijack or diminish them. We also discuss dopamine reward circuitry in the context of how to build and reset one’s energy levels and create a deeper sense of purpose in work, creative pursuits and relationships.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/0OPEp3e\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: ⁠https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: ⁠https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nMateina: ⁠https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Michael Easter*\nWebsite: https://eastermichael.com \nBooks: https://amzlink.to/az0gVEsePZEwp\nTwo Percent Substack (Newsletter): https://www.twopct.com \nSubstack (links from the Huberman Lab podcast): https://twopct.com/huberman \nPodcast: https://www.twopct.com/s/podcast \nUNLV: https://www.unlv.edu/news/experts/in-the-news/140526 \nX: https://x.com/michael_easter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/michael_easter\nThreads: https://www.threads.com/@michael_easter\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/p/Michael-Easter-100063709885769\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Michael Easter\n00:02:14 Discomforts, Modern vs Ancient Life\n00:07:35 Sponsors: Maui Nui & Helix Sleep\n00:10:17 Modern Problems, Exercise, Trail vs Treadmill Running, Optic Flow, Hunting\n00:20:01 Risk & Rewards, Intellectual vs Experiential Understanding\n00:23:39 Modern Luxuries, First-World Problems, Gratitude, Tool: Volunteer\n00:34:33 Rites of Passage, Tool: Challenge, Narrative & Purpose; Embracing Discomfort\n00:40:43 Sponsors: AG1 & Mateina\n00:43:33 Choice, 2% Study, Silence, Tools: Do Slightly Harder Things; Notice Resistance\n00:54:05 Cognitive Challenges, Walking, Screens, Tool: Sitting with Boredom\n01:01:53 Capturing Ideas, Attractor States, Tool: Being in Nature\n01:06:50 2% Rule, Rites of Passage, Tool: Misogi Challenge\n01:14:12 Phones, Sharing with Others, Social Media, Tool: Reflection vs Screen Time\n01:23:23 Dopamine, Spending vs Investing, Guilt\n01:29:48 Sponsor: Function\n01:31:35 Relaxation, Shared Identities & Community, Music, Tool: In-Person Meeting\n01:38:58 Loss of Gathering Places, Internet & Distorted Views, Hitchhiking\n01:45:06 Misogi & Entry Points; Daily Schedule, Caffeine Intake\n01:54:37 Optimal Circadian Schedule, Work Bouts, Exercise\n01:59:12 Outdoor Adventures, Backpacking & Nutrition\n02:04:57 Camping & Sleeping, Nature, Three-Day Effect\n02:10:10 Sea Squirts; Misogi Adventures & Cognitive Vigor, Writing, Happiness\n02:17:55 Effort & Rewards, Addiction, Dopamine, Catecholamines\n02:22:36 Humans, Running & Carrying Weight, Fat Loss, Tool: How to Start Rucking\n02:32:32 Physical/Cognitive Pursuits & Resistance; Creative “Magic” & Foraging\n02:39:27 Motivation; Slot Machines, Loss Disguised as a Win, Speed\n02:46:06 Gambling, Dopamine, Addiction\n02:50:29 Tool: Avoid Frictionless Foraging; Sports Betting, Speed; Junk Food, Three V’s\n02:56:22 Conveniences, Technology; Upcoming Book, Satisfaction\n03:02:57 Substack Links, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "My guest is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD, ⁠Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)⁠ and ⁠Professor Emeritus of Health Policy at Stanford University⁠. We discuss which scientific questions ought to be the priority for NIH, how to incentivize bold, innovative science especially from younger labs, how to solve the replication crisis and restore trust and transparency in science and public health, including acknowledging prior failures by the NIH. We discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and the data and sociological factors that motivated lockdowns, masking and vaccine mandates. Dr. Bhattacharya shares his views on how to resolve the vaccine–autism debate and how best to find the causes and cures for autism and chronic diseases. The topics we cover impact everyone: male, female, young and old and, given that NIH is the premier research and public health organization in the world, extend to Americans and non-Americans alike.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/gkuDlhO\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nDavid: ⁠https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: ⁠https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Jay Bhattacharya*\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH): https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/nih-director \nStanford academic profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/jay-bhattacharya \nX: https://x.com/drjbhattacharya\nGreat Barrington Declaration: https://gbdeclaration.org \nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2wH43aAAAAAJ \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Jay Bhattacharya\n00:06:56 National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mission\n00:09:12 Funding, Basic vs. Applied Research\n00:18:22 Sponsors: David & Eight Sleep\n00:21:20 Indirect Costs (IDC), Policies & Distribution\n00:30:43 Taxpayer Funding, Journal Access, Public Transparency\n00:38:14 Taxpayer Funding, Patents; Drug Costs in the USA vs Other Countries\n00:48:50 Reducing Medication Prices; R&D, Improving Health\n01:00:01 Sponsors: AG1 & Levels\n01:02:55 Lowering IDC?, Endowments, Monetary Distribution, Scientific Groupthink\n01:12:29 Grant Review Process, Innovation\n01:21:43 R01s, Tenure, Early Career Scientists & Novel Ideas\n01:31:46 Sociology of Grant Evaluation, Careerism in Science, Failures\n01:39:08 “Sick Care” System, Health Needs\n01:44:01 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:45:33 Incentives in Science, H-Index, Replication Crisis\n01:58:54 Scientists, Data Fraud, Changing Careers\n02:03:59 NIH & Changing Incentive Structure, Replication, Pro-Social Behavior\n02:15:26 Scientific Discovery, Careers & Changing Times, Journals & Publications\n02:19:56 NIH Grants & Appeals, Under-represented Populations, DEI\n02:28:58 Inductive vs Deductive Science; DEI & Grants; Young Scientists & NIH Funding\n02:39:38 Grant Funding, Identity & Race; Shift in NIH Priorities\n02:51:23 Public Trust & Science, COVID Pandemic, Lockdowns, Masks\n03:04:41 Pandemic Mandates & Economic Inequality; Fear; Public Health & Free Speech\n03:13:39 Masks, Harms, Public Health Messaging, Uniformity, Groupthink, Vaccines\n03:22:48 Academic Ostracism, Public Health Messaging & Opposition\n03:30:26 Culture of American Science, Discourse & Disagreement\n03:36:03 Vaccines, COVID Vaccines, Benefits & Harms\n03:47:05 Vaccine Mandates, Money, Public Health Messaging, Civil Liberties\n03:54:52 COVID Vaccines, Long-Term Effects; Long COVID, Vaccine Injury, Flu Shots\n04:06:47 Do Vaccines Cause Autism?; What Explains Rise in Autism\n04:18:33 Autism & NIH; MAHA & Restructuring NIH?\n04:25:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "My guest is ⁠Dr. Mary-Frances O’Connor, PhD⁠, Professor of Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Arizona and a world expert on the science of grief and loss. We discuss what happens in the brain and body when we grieve, the role of dopamine and yearning in the grieving process, the health risks of getting stuck at particular stages of grief and how to move through loss while also deeply honoring the person, animal or thing that is no longer with us. Dr. O’Connor explains that grief involves cycling back and forth between protest and despair (often guilt and anger too) and explains science-supported ways to move through that process in the healthiest possible way. Everyone experiences grief and loss at some point. Dr. O’Connor provides valuable knowledge and tools to help you navigate grief under any circumstance.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/W8yuZuR\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nWealthfront**: ⁠https://wealthfront.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: ⁠https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: ⁠https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n**This experience may not be representative of the experience of other clients of Wealthfront, and there is no guarantee that all clients will have similar experiences.

    "description": "My guest is Tom Segura, renowned comedian, writer, actor and director. We discuss the “how-to” of comedy writing and storytelling, and what the science of humor and the creative process reveal about human emotion and memory. We explore why surprise and the act of “saying the unspoken truth” activate the brain’s reward circuits, as well as the subconscious mechanisms that shape our sense of what is funny. The episode also examines the bi-directional influence between comedy and cultural standards. It will interest anyone curious about the science of humor, the art of performance and emotional contagion.\n\nRead the episode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/ADV8QSH\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: ⁠https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: ⁠https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nDavid Protein: ⁠https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nFunction Health: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Tom Segura*\nWebsite: https://tomsegura.com\nTour: https://tomsegura.com/tour \nYour Mom’s House (podcast): https://ymhstudios.com/yourmomshouse\n2 Bears, 1 Cave (podcast): https://ymhstudios.com/2bears\nTom Talks (podcast): https://ymhstudios.com/tomtalks\nYMH Studios: https://ymhstudios.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seguratom\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/tomsegura \nX: https://x.com/tomsegura \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@seguratom \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TomSeguraTour\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Tom Segura\n00:01:45 Family, Sports, Running\n00:09:35 Sponsors: Maui Nui & Helix Sleep\n00:12:37 Ideas, Running, Sleep & Brain, Tools: Exercise for Energy; Phone Outside Room\n00:20:16 Capturing Ideas, Cannabis, Storytelling, Experimentation\n00:27:28 Ideas & Set List, Performance\n00:31:52 Wife, Jokes, Reframing Content; Cancel Culture, Audience Reaction\n00:40:56 Jokes, Self & Amusement; Evolution & New Material\n00:48:26 Sponsors: AG1 & David Protein\n00:51:24 Surprise, Hidden Thoughts; Acting\n00:59:02 Voice Impersonation, Kids, Strength Training, Activities \n01:05:40 Repeating Jokes; State Changes, Crowds & Energy\n01:13:11 Silly Mindset; Audience, Emotional Contagion; Humor & Subconscious Mind\n01:27:44 Sponsor: Function\n01:29:32 Crowd Work, Comedy Clubs; Original Comedy\n01:38:13 Comedy & Social Context; Dark Comedy\n01:47:51 Drugs, Overdose, Comedian Deaths, Mental Health; Cynicism, Hope\n01:54:21 Audience, Twin Comics; Vulnerability; Stand-Up & Performance\n02:01:49 Comedy & Passion, Complaints; Childhood Struggle, Insecurities, Therapy\n02:10:53 “Bad Thoughts” Show, Upcoming Projects\n02:14:44 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

He is known for his pioneering research on the impact of dietary interventions on weight loss and health.\n\nWe compare ketogenic, vegetarian, vegan and omnivorous diets—and why there is no one-size-fits-all approach. All agree, however, that eliminating or dramatically reducing processed foods is best for health.\n\nWe discuss the protein needs controversy; plant vs. animal proteins; the importance of fiber and low-sugar fermented foods for gut health and inflammation; and how diet affects gene expression.

    "title": "People Who Do Prenuptial Contracts Stay Together Longer",
    "description": "The Huberman Lab episode out this week is about contracts for love and money—which might sound like a downer, but as attorney James Sexton explains, these contracts are more about defining the specific things people need in order to feel respected and safe, as opposed to protecting “the ending.” In fact, much of what goes into these agreements is about the marriage, not divorce conditions.\n\nAlso, somewhat counterintuitively, people who create prenuptial agreements get divorced far less than the average population. The current divorce rate in the United States is 56% (!).\n\nNote: The episode is not really about divorce. It’s about love, and it also addresses the forces outside a relationship that can erode it, as well as the things to pay attention to in order to avoid those increasingly common pitfalls.\n\nThrough both his profession and his life, James has adopted a unique and important perspective on all of this. It’s an episode that ought to benefit anyone—married, single, divorced, etc.—because it addresses the emotional and legal contracts around romantic relationships that most everyone encounters at some point.\n\nJames is also an amazing storyteller and a genuinely good human being. It was a pleasure to host him.",

    "title": "Contracts of Love & Money That Make or Break Relationships | James Sexton",
    "description": "My guest is James Sexton, Esq., a renowned attorney specializing in contracts related to love and money—prenuptial agreements, divorce and custody. We explore the counterintuitive fact that people with prenuptial agreements tend to stay married longer and report more satisfying relationships than those who don’t. We discuss how legal contracts can foster deeper understanding by encouraging vulnerability and honest communication about each partner’s values and expectations.\n\nWe also examine what defines true, lasting love versus generic romantic ideals—and how social media can distort our understanding of what we truly need. Additionally, we review how cultural traditions, gender dynamics, courtship length, and age at the time of marriage shape marital outcomes.\n\nThis episode offers practical tools for anyone—single or partnered—to build more successful and stable relationships through deeply honest dialogue and contracts that reflect genuine values around love and money.\n\nRead the episode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/uElXh1O\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nWealthfront**: https://wealthfront.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nOur Place: https://fromourplace.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n_**This experience may not be representative of the experience of other clients of Wealthfront, and there is no guarantee that all clients will have similar experiences.

    "description": "My guest is Dr. Karolina Westlund, Ph.D., a professor of ethology at the University of Stockholm and an expert in animal emotions and behavior who uses science-based methods to improve the lives of animals in human care. We discuss the often overlooked needs of domesticated animals—primarily dogs and cats—and the things we can do to improve their well-being and our relationship with them.\n\nWe cover how to interpret animal body language, the unique needs of specific dog breeds, and the needs of cats and birds.

    "description": "In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how to build endurance and describe targeted protocols to enhance different types of endurance.\n\nI discuss how endurance—the ability to sustain effort—requires the coordination of physical and mental systems driven by energy availability, brain willpower, and specific training adaptations in the muscles, heart, lungs and neurons. I explain conditioning protocols designed to enhance four types of endurance, from long-duration steady state to muscular endurance and high-intensity intervals, and how each training style triggers unique adaptations in the body and brain, such as improved mitochondrial function and oxygen utilization. Additionally, I highlight the crucial role of hydration and electrolytes, which are essential for neural function and influence the brain’s willpower to sustain effort.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/PH5df16\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past full-length Huberman Lab episodes.

    "description": "Lori Gottlieb is a world-renowned expert on relationships: finding them, being in them, moving forward if or after they end, and how to repair them.\n\nHere, she explains a common phenomenon in which people seek support from friends when they encounter challenges in relationships. While she acknowledges the benefits of talking to friends about these matters, she emphasizes that most of the time, the compassion we think is helping people merely provides a Band-Aid in the short term—and leads to more suffering overall and in the long run.\n\nShe distinguishes “idiot compassion” from “wise compassion,” which emphasizes our role in the problems we encounter in relationships of all kinds.\n\nDuring the episode, we discuss a wide range of topics related to finding and being an excellent romantic partner. She offers actionable protocols based on decades of experience helping clients find and build the relationships they want most.\n\nIt’s an episode that ought to benefit everyone, including those already in a relationship, as it also focuses on how to be a better partner.\n\nWe also discuss the impact of modern technology on relationships.",

    "description": "When I say the sun is the best source, I’m not just saying that because it’s zero cost. That’s also true, but it has the greatest power to positively impact your mitochondria. There’s also evidence that it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels in both men and women.\n\nEvery time I talk about this, people say, “There’s no sun here.” Unless you live in a cave, there’s sun. But it is true that on overcast days, long-wavelength light is filtered out.\n\nIt’s still important to get sunlight in your eyes on those days for circadian rhythm regulation. On overcast days, as well as when you need more mitochondrial stimulation, red light devices can be useful. Most of them emit both red light and infrared or near-infrared light.\n\nFull disclosure: Joovv is a sponsor of tge Huberman Lab podcast because, to my knowledge, those are the only medical-grade red and infrared light devices that are commercially available.\n\nOne of the really cool things about long-wavelength light, regardless of the source, is that it can penetrate deep into the skin and scatter as much as 8 cm.\n\nIn this post, I talk about how to avoid excess UV exposure while still getting plenty of long-wavelength light from the sun.\n\nI did an entire episode about light—Episode 4 of the Huberman Lab podcast. The episode out now with Roger Seheult, M.D., also covers this in detail, including how red light can improve blood glucose regulation.\n\nThe last point is that photobiomodulation is now considered a core component of dermatology and other fields of medicine.",

It also turns out that training for strength with low repetitions (two to five reps) is safer than training with high repetitions—if done correctly. That’s because higher repetitions fatigue the stabilizing muscles. Still, there’s a proper way to train heavy, and Pavel explains it.\n\nHypertrophy training, or training for muscle size, is far more draining to the systemic nervous system than most people realize. So if you struggle with post-workout fatigue or experience brain fog later in the day, you might try training with heavier weights and lower repetitions for a while, focusing on strength instead.\n\nWe also discussed the longevity benefits of training for strength and endurance. And for those who want to add muscle size, Pavel explains shorter workouts that can be used to augment a strength program while minimizing inroads to recovery.\n\nAdditionally, we covered how to build flexibility, all with minimal time investment. Pavel is a true expert and a no-frills instructor. There’s something for everyone in this episode—it definitely applies to both women and men.",

She explains how specific ways of framing and asking questions about the world shape our physical health and rate of aging. Dr. Langer also explains how our perception of time and control significantly impact our rate of physical healing, hormones, immune system, and longevity. She describes mindfulness as a way of framing life, not simply a meditation or other practice, and discusses data showing how to use one’s mind to overcome health challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes. Dr. Langer is a luminary and pioneer in researching the relationship between the mind and body with scientific rigor.

    "description": "Chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin developed a process to achieve peak performance in any craft or career. He has applied it to investing, professional sports, science, and more. The MIQ Process, or Most Important Question process, is not a quick fix but rather a rewiring of your default settings.\n\nA key aspect of this process is creating space in the stimulus-response dimensions of life—not filling every moment with input. Instead, you seed your mind with critical questions and allow space to capture the answers. This applies to career, relationships, or any other important aspect of life.\n\nWe cannot deny the power of the unconscious mind to solve the problems we consciously feed it. Solid science supports this. Josh has achieved immense success in chess, martial arts, and business. His work coaching individuals across disparate careers further underscores the value of this approach.",

Additionally, we examine the scientific process, the practical and ethical challenges of pursuing groundbreaking discoveries, and the emotional toll of striving for recognition in one’s profession.\n\nFinally, we discuss whether astrology has any scientific validity and consider the possibility of life beyond Earth.\n\nRead the full episode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/8D3hBnM\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Brian Keating*\nWebsite: https://briankeating.com \nBooks: https://amzlink.to/az0UY0FlnS54f\nUniversity of California, San Diego academic profile: https://profiles.ucsd.edu/brian.keating \nPodcast: http://briankeating.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://big-bang.kit.com/huberman\nResearch Projects: http://bkeating.physics.ucsd.edu/index.php?goto=Projects \nX: https://x.com/DrBrianKeating\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrBrianKeating\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/DrBrianKeating \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/DrBrianKeating\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-keating-ab893a10a\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Brian Keating\n00:02:07 Cosmology, Origin of Universe\n00:05:41 Sponsors: LMNT & BetterHelp\n00:08:33 Stars, Planets, Early Humans, Time\n00:14:53 Astrology, Ophiuchus Constellation\n00:19:58 Pineal Gland, Time-Keeping & Stars, Seasons & Offspring\n00:29:19 Humans, Time Perception, Astronomy\n00:36:08 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:47 Brain & Prediction; Moonset, Syzygy; Telescope, Galileo \n00:46:36 Light Refraction; Telescope, Eyeglasses\n00:51:36 Earth Rotation & Sun\n00:53:43 Glass, Microscope, Telescopes & Discovery\n01:02:53 Science as Safe Space; Jupiter, Galileo, Discovery, Time\n01:10:48 Early Humans, Stonehenge, Pyramids, Measurement Standards \n01:15:54 Giants of Astronomy \n01:20:04 Sponsors: Function & Helix Sleep\n01:23:10 Origin of Life, Scientific Method & P-Hacking; Nobel Prize, Big Bang, Inflation\n01:30:20 Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, BICEP\n01:37:58 Father & Son Relationship, Science & Rewards\n01:44:06 Loss, Mentor \n01:49:55 Antarctica, South Pole\n01:56:49 Light & Heat Pollution, South Pole\n02:01:09 Prize Pursuit, First Discovery; Star Collapse, Micrometeorites, Polarization \n02:08:26 Sponsor: ROKA\n02:10:08 Moon, Size & Horizon; Visual Acuity; Rainbow or Moon Bigger?\n02:15:21 Sunset, Green Flash, Color Opponency\n02:23:05 Menstrual & Lunar Cycles; Moon Movement\n02:26:36 Northern Hemisphere & Stargazing, Dark Sky Communities, Telescope\n02:29:51 Constellations, Asterism; Halley's & Hale-Bopp Comets\n02:32:13 Navigation, Columbus\n02:36:29 Adaptive Optics, Scintillation, Artificial Stars\n02:48:28 Life Outside Earth?\n02:57:50 Gut Microbiome; Building Planet\n03:05:00 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Protocols Book, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Cosmology\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss how different forms of exercise impact brain health and performance in both the short and long term. I explain how many of the positive effects of exercise on brain function occur through the action of specific neurochemicals that increase alertness.\n\nI also cover how to best time exercise and which specific types of exercise to include in your weekly routine to maximize benefits for your brain. Additionally, I explain how certain types of exercise trigger the release of a hormone from your bones called osteocalcin, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.\n\nThe positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.\n\nFind show notes with articles, resources and more: https://go.hubermanlab.com/MNDX54b\n\nPre-order Andrew's upcoming book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nDavid: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinui.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://x.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*More Huberman Lab*\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Merch: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Exercise, Brain Health & Performance; Protocols Book\n00:04:03 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Helix Sleep\n00:06:55 Brain Health, Cardiovascular & Resistance Training\n00:11:51 Exercise & Positive Impact on Brain Performance; Arousal\n00:18:20 Learning & Arousal\n00:23:18 Sponsors: AG1 & David\n00:26:01 Exercise & Acute Learning\n00:29:16 Tool: High-Intensity Training & Cognitive Flexibility; Over-Training\n00:33:32 Long-Term Brain Health; Tool: Exercise “Snacks”, Cognitive Performance\n00:36:57 Exercise, Brain & Body Energy, Adrenaline, Norepinephrine\n00:44:08 Adrenal “Burnout”?; Exercise to Increase Energy, Adrenaline\n00:48:20 Tool: Core, Compound Movements; Mind-Body Connection\n00:53:58 Sponsor: Function\n00:55:45 Bones, Osteocalcin, BDNF & Hippocampus; Tool: Jump Training\n01:01:30 Exercise, Fuel, Multifactorial Pathways; BDNF & Activity\n01:05:06 Lactate, Astrocytes & Brain Function; VEGF & Brain Health\n01:11:17 Tools: Zone 2, High-Intensity Training, Time Under Tension Training\n01:19:54 Sponsor: Maui Nui\n01:21:37 Tools: Time Under Tension; Explosive Jumping, Eccentric Control Training\n01:25:30 Injury & Exercise, Illness\n01:28:09 Sleep; Injury, Sleep-Deprivation & Exercise\n01:33:51 SuperAgers, Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex, Grit & Persistence\n01:42:04 Tool: Embrace Challenges; Deliberate Cold Exposure, Rope Flow\n01:47:39 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Exercise \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss the psychology and neuroscience of human drives, sustaining motivation, choosing a direction and vision for one’s life, and the guideposts within philosophy, culture, and religion that can help us select and navigate the best possible path.\n\nIt’s a serious discussion that includes deep dives into topics such as addiction, relationships, politics, and how we need to organize our internal and external lives to become the best versions of ourselves—for the sake of our own happiness and to better serve others.\n\nHere, Jordan refers to the immensely powerful results that come from simply organizing one’s physical space and the ramifications it has on our internal landscape. He explains how this can cascade to positively impact our thinking, emotions, and behavior.\n\nOur conversation is grounded in research data and practical tools that people of all ages and genders should find useful.",

We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life. \n\nWe also explore the innate human drive to create \"impact at a distance\" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time. \n\nListeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.\n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/3qKWtpF\n\nGet summaries, clips, and insights from this episode with Ask Huberman Lab, our zero-cost chat-based tool: https://go.hubermanlab.com/OKw9EDv\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nDavid: https://davidprotein.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*More Huberman Lab*\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Merch: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Jordan Peterson*\nWebsite: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com \nUniversity of Toronto academic profile: https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/jordan-peterson \nBooks: https://amzlink.to/az0woBkDzpJTZ\nThe Jordan B.

    "description": "My guest on the Huberman Lab episode out now is Dr. Bernardo Huberman. He is a physicist who immigrated to the United States to conduct research on particle physics, later transitioning to chaos theory before moving into computer science and quantum computing. As his last name suggests, he is also my father.\n\nIn this episode, we explore what it means to let curiosity guide major career decisions—the benefits, the risks, and the challenge of balancing career ambitions with everyday life.\n\nThe audio in this clip features his response to a question I asked during the podcast: “Do you have any wishes for me—[and for anyone wondering what to aspire to in life]?”\n\nOur conversation also delves into topics like science, family, leaving a politically unstable country for the United States, social dynamics, patriotism, the tension between tradition and self-expression, and, of course, the relationship between parents and children—including why a bit of rebellion can foster personal growth when it serves a meaningful purpose.\n\nThis was obviously a deeply meaningful episode for me to record, given that Dr. Huberman is my father. I also believe the discussion will resonate broadly, particularly with those who frequently switch fields of interest—a journey Dr. Huberman has embraced repeatedly over more than five decades.",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Bernardo Huberman, Ph.D., a research physicist, expert on quantum networks, and vice president of CableLabs’ Next-Gen Systems. We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  \n\nWe explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.  \n\nRead the full show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VTBQQ2V\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/Eywd4Ly\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nHuberman Lab Premium: https://go.hubermanlab.com/premium\nHuberman Lab Shop: https://go.hubermanlab.com/merch\n\n*Dr. Bernardo Huberman*\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-huberman-39b40823 \nX: https://x.com/bhuberman \nThe Laws of the Web (book): https://amzlink.to/az0I0G65K03ya \nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b_GVwg0AAAAJ \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo-Huberman \nCableLabs: https://www.cablelabs.com/blog/author/bhuberman \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Bernardo Huberman\n00:02:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep & BetterHelp\n00:05:08 Early School, Science Interest, Argentina; Soccer\n00:12:29 Physics, Childhood Teacher, Family\n00:20:48 Music; Dictatorship; Humanistic Education\n00:29:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 US Graduate School \n00:39:27 Counterculture, Peer Pressure; Graduation, Job Search\n00:49:19 Xerox, Personal Computers; Risk-Takers, Tachyon\n00:54:49 Sponsors: LMNT & ExpressVPN\n00:57:33 Relativity Theory, Quantum Mechanics\n01:05:53 Chaos Theory, Fractals, Butterfly Effect\n01:17:21 Scientists, Positive Contributions & Flaws\n01:26:19 Sponsor: Mateína\n01:27:45 Enjoyment of Life, Meditation; Goal Pursuit \n01:35:44 Changing Fields, Computers\n01:43:24 Mentors, Students; Restlessness, Curiosity\n01:47:41 Industry, Academia, Graduate Degrees\n01:54:02 Podcast, Interviewing; Mistakes, Working with Others\n02:05:48 Quantum Internet, Unbreakable Code\n02:09:48 Physics & Neuroscience; AI\n02:15:06 Analog vs. Digital Life, Thinking about Future\n02:21:38 Worry, Meditation\n02:24:22 Beliefs, God; Spiritual Experiences, Randomness\n02:33:53 Thinking about Past; Nostalgia\n02:39:19 Politically Incorrect; Libertarians; Cryogenics; Enjoying Life\n02:46:30 Joyful; Pushing to Limits; Worry & Enjoyment, Living with Elegance\n02:55:57 Etiquette, Clothing\n03:04:11 Retirement, Money, Travel\n03:12:00 Future Plans; Joyful Life\n03:13:33 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Curiosity #Science \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "This excerpt is from the Huberman Lab episode titled \"Dr. Layne Norton: Tools for Nutrition & Fitness.\" It covers what the peer-reviewed research says about exercise, nutrition, supplementation, and health. Here we are discussing if resistance training needs to be done \"to failure\" — the inability to further move the resistance in good form for that set. It turns out the answer is relevant if you are seeking hypertrophy and/or strength.\n\nKeep in mind that resistance training has been recommended by numerous guests on the podcast for both women and men regardless of whether you're seeking hypertrophy, or simply strength increases. In fact, resistance training is turning out to be one of the best ways to improve your immediate and long-term health and longevity per se.",

I also provide actionable tools for regulating sleep and wake cycles in babies and new parents.  \n\nThe episode emphasizes the critical role of circadian rhythms, influenced by factors like light exposure, temperature regulation, and eating schedules. Practical tools include using light to shift your circadian clock, understanding the role of temperature in sleep, and adopting strategies to improve rest without medication.

    "description": "Ethan Kross, Ph.D. is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan and a world expert in researching “chatter” (the voice in our heads) and emotion regulation.\n\nMany people believe that verbally venting — or venting via text — makes us feel better. However, the data show that while venting strengthens social bonds, it also makes both the complainer and the listener more unhappy and amplifies negative emotions for both parties. Essentially, venting is counterproductive if your goal is to feel better.\n\nThis is interesting, considering that nearly all of us are prone to venting to some degree.\n\nNote: The data on journaling (covered in this and a previous Huberman Lab episode) strongly suggest that processing bad experiences doesn’t do much to relieve the associated negative emotions. There’s something intriguing about the differences between journaling to oneself and complaining or venting to others.",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Ethan Kross, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, director of the Emotion & Self-Control Laboratory, and author of the bestselling book Chatter. We discuss the purpose of the inner voice in your head and its impact on emotional well-being and motivation.\n\nWe also explore practical tools to manage negative internal chatter and eliminate intrusive thoughts. Topics include how music, exercise, mental distancing techniques, and expressive writing can help rescript your inner dialogue to be self-encouraging and effective in creating outward behavioral changes. Dr. Kross explains why venting to others is self-defeating and offers better alternatives.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Terry Sejnowski, Ph.D., professor of computational neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He is world-renowned for exploring how our brain processes and stores information and, with that understanding, for developing tools that enable us to markedly improve our ability to learn all types of information and skills.\n\nWe discuss how to learn most effectively in order to truly master a subject or skill. Dr. Sejnowski explains how to use AI tools to forage for new information, generate ideas, predict the future, and assist in analyzing health data and making health-related decisions.\n\nWe also explore non-AI strategies to enhance learning and creativity, including how specific types of exercise can improve mitochondrial function and cognitive performance. Listeners will gain insights into how computational methods and AI are transforming our understanding of brain function, learning, and memory, as well as the emerging roles of these tools in addressing personal health and treating brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.\n\nRead the full show notes for this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/IRFAS30\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nDavid Protein: https://davidprotein.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \n\n*Dr. Terry Sejnowski*\nSalk Institute academic profile: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski\nBooks: https://amzlink.to/az0l36dRaKyxv\nLab website: https://cnl.salk.edu\nPublications: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/publications\nUC San Diego: https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/tsejnowski\nCoursera courses: https://www.coursera.org/instructor/terry\nSubstack: https://terrysejnowski.substack.com\nX: https://x.com/sejnowski\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/terry-sejnowski-b89b7b122\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Terry Sejnowski  \n00:02:32 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Helix Sleep  \n00:05:19 Brain Structure & Function, Algorithmic Level  \n00:11:49 Basal Ganglia; Learning & Value Function  \n00:15:23 Value Function, Reward & Punishment  \n00:19:14 Cognitive vs. Procedural Learning, Active Learning, AI  \n00:25:56 Learning & Brain Storage  \n00:30:08 Traveling Waves, Sleep Spindles, Memory  \n00:32:08 Sponsors: AG1 & David  \n00:34:57 Tool: Increase Sleep Spindles; Memory, Ambien; Prescription Drugs  \n00:42:02 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity  \n00:45:58 Tool: ‘Learning How to Learn’ Course  \n00:49:36 Learning, Generational Differences, Technology, Social Media  \n00:58:37 Sponsors: LMNT & Joovv  \n01:01:06 Draining Experiences, AI & Social Media  \n01:06:52 Vigor & Aging, Continued Learning, Tool: Exercise & Mitochondrial Function  \n01:12:17 Tool: Cognitive Velocity; Quick Stressors, Mitochondria  \n01:16:58 AI, Imagined Futures, Possibilities  \n01:27:14 AI & Mapping Potential Options, Schizophrenia  \n01:30:56 Schizophrenia, Ketamine, Depression  \n01:36:15 AI, “Idea Pump,” Analyzing Research  \n01:42:11 AI, Medicine & Diagnostic Tool; Predicting Outcomes  \n01:50:04 Parkinson’s Disease; Cognitive Velocity & Variables; Amphetamines  \n01:59:49 Free Will; Large Language Model (LLM), Personalities & Learning  \n02:12:40 Tool: Idea Generation, Mind Wandering, Learning  \n02:18:18 Dreams, Unconscious, Types of Dreams  \n02:22:56 Future Projects, Brain & Self-Attention  \n02:31:39 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter  \n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #ArtificialIntelligence #AI #Science \n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Allan Schore, Ph.D., a faculty member in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, a longtime clinical psychotherapist, and a multi-book author. We discuss how early child-parent interactions shape brain circuitry, impacting our ability to form attachments, manage emotions, and navigate conflict and stress. We cover how the development of right-brain circuitry related to emotional processing and the unconscious mind regulates physiological responses, influencing adult friendships and romantic relationships. We also explore how improving your ability to listen to the emotional tone—rather than just the meaning—of words is a vital skill for fostering better relationships with yourself and others, and how it plays a role in reshaping brain circuitry.\n\nAdditionally, we explain how circuits in the right brain hemisphere drive creativity and intuition and discuss activities to access the unconscious mind. This episode delves into how the unconscious mind regulates emotions—both your own and others’—and shapes our sense of self. By the end, you’ll have new knowledge and tools to build more secure, meaningful, and impactful connections of all kinds: professional, romantic, familial, friendships, and beyond.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode, including referenced articles, resources, and people mentioned: https://go.hubermanlab.com/SbUJyLX\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/pnoUTEI\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nDavid Protein: https://davidprotein.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman \n\n*Dr. Allan Schore*\nWebsite: https://www.allanschore.com\nBooks: https://amzn.to/3AyS8Rw\nPublications: https://www.allanschore.com/curriculum-vitae/publications\nRight Brain Psychotherapy Institute: https://rightbrainpsychotherapy.com \nMaster Class: https://rightbrainpsychotherapy.com/master-class\nModern attachment theory (video): https://youtu.be/c0sKY86Qmzo?si=3rGee4fAxj1HOjtk \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rightbrainpsych \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rightbrainpsych\nX: https://x.com/rightbrainpsych\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/right-brain-psychotherapy-institute \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Allan Schore\n00:02:37 Sponsors: David & Eight Sleep\n00:05:49 Thoughts & Unconscious Mind\n00:07:36 Right vs Left Brain, Child Development, Attachment\n00:13:19 Attachment Styles & Development, Emotions & Physiology\n00:18:12 Intuition, Arousal, Emotional Regulation & Attachment\n00:23:13 Psychobiological Attunement, Repair; Insecure & Anxious Attachment\n00:28:33 Attachment Styles, Regulation Theory; Therapy\n00:34:20 Sponsor: AG1\n00:35:51 “Surrender,” Therapy, Patient Synchronization\n00:39:46 Synchrony, Empathy, Therapy & Developing Autoregulation\n00:45:07 Mother vs Father, Child Development; Single Caretakers\n00:50:51 MDMA, Right Brain; Fetal Development\n00:55:58 Sponsor: Function\n00:57:46 Integrating Positive & Negative Emotions, Quiet vs Excited Love\n01:03:33 Splitting, Borderline; Therapy & Emotions\n01:09:24 Tool: Right Brain, Vulnerability & Repair\n01:15:32 Right vs. Left Brain, Attention\n01:19:26 Right Brain Synchronization, Eye Connection, Empathy\n01:25:39 Music & Dogs, Resonance\n01:30:58 Right Brain & Body; Empathic Connection, Body Language\n01:36:47 Tool: Text Message, Communication, Relationships\n01:42:18 Right Brain Dominance & Activities; Tool: Fostering the Right Brain\n01:50:10 Defenses, Blind Spots\n01:53:14 Creativity, Accessing the Right Brain, Insight\n01:59:31 Paternal Leave, Parent-Child Relationships, Attachment\n02:05:16 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Relationships #Brain \n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Shanna Swan, Ph.D., professor of environmental medicine and reproductive health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Swan is the world’s leading expert on the harmful impact of chemicals in our food, water, cosmetics, and various household and consumer products on our hormones, and the consequences for fertility and overall reproductive health. She explains how exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors adversely impacts fetal development, puberty, and the adult brain and body. We discuss the global decline in human fertility due to disruptive environmental toxins, such as pesticides, and certain foods and beverages we consume.\n\nWe discuss practical strategies to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), BPS, and PFAS. This includes reducing disposable plastic use, making healthier food preparation, consumption, and storage choices, and selecting personal and household products that don’t contain harmful toxins. This episode allows you to assess your risk of exposure to endocrine disruptors accurately and empowers you to take control of your hormone health and fertility.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode, including referenced articles, resources, and people mentioned: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wJEWPYC\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/uyYEsaS\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman \n\n*Dr. Shanna Swan*\nWebsite: https://www.shannaswan.com \nAcademic Profile: https://profiles.mountsinai.org/shanna-h-swan \nCount Down (book): https://amzn.to/4fsvRDC\nResources: https://www.shannaswan.com/resources\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drshannaswan \nX: https://x.com/DrShannaSwan \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanna-swan-phd-339a4258 \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Shanna Swan\n00:02:58 Sponsors: LMNT, ROKA & BetterHelp\n00:06:49 Environmental Chemicals, Fertility, Hormones, Phthalates\n00:13:30 Phthalate Syndrome, Animal Data, Male Offspring\n00:19:11 Phthalate Syndrome in Humans, Pregnancy & Babies\n00:27:30 Hyenas; Phthalate Syndrome in Males\n00:32:49 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:22 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Mothers & Female Offspring\n00:39:03 Anogenital Distance & Sperm Count\n00:45:03 Sperm Count & Fertility\n00:49:24 Sponsor: Function\n00:51:11 Sperm Count Decline\n00:58:19 Sperm Quality & Pesticides\n01:04:12 Atrazine, Amphibians, Sexual Dimorphism, Behavior\n01:09:00 Preschoolers, Phthalate Exposure, Sexually Dimorphic Behaviors\n01:14:08 Tools: Lowering Exposure to Endocrine Disruptors, Fertility\n01:24:52 Tools: BPA, BPS, BPF & Can Linings; Drinkware; Plastics & Microwave\n01:30:07 Tools: Buying Organic; Skin Products, Fragrance; Sunscreens, Consumer Guides\n01:32:58 Funding\n01:34:31 Tools: Distilling Water, Shoes, Clothing, Food Sourcing; Building Materials\n01:40:12 Europe vs. US Chemical Safety, REACH Program\n01:46:20 Tool: Pregnancy & Fetal Health\n01:49:23 Plastics & Environmental Concern; Fertility \n01:55:26 Sperm Quality, Fertility, Cell Phone, Temperature\n01:58:04 Other Animals & Fertility Decline, Ecosystems\n02:01:58 Advancing Technologies, Fertility, Offspring & Adverse Effects\n02:06:02 Tool: Consumer Guides, Personal & Household Products\n02:09:39 Tool: Receipts; Thyroid System; Non-Stick Pans\n02:15:18 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Microplastics #Fertility #HormoneHealth\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Ari Wallach, most recently an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and host of a new TV series titled A Brief History of the Future. We discuss the importance of learning to project our understanding of ourselves and our goals into the future, both for our own sake and for future generations. We also explore how this fosters a sense of unity and community within our species.\n\nWe examine how technology and modern society influence our perception of time and our ability to make decisions in a fast-paced, reward-driven environment that leads to our best possible future. Additionally, we discuss how the dismantling of traditional institutions has altered people's sense of purpose. We outline protocols to cultivate long-term thinking, connect with core values, and define a deep sense of purpose. This episode provides listeners with actionable tools to merge short- and long-term thinking in ways that create a positive, lasting impact on ourselves, society, and the planet.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/nxoB8eX\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/v7nt4d\n\nPre-order Andrew's book, Protocols: https://go.hubermanlab.com/protocols\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nDavid Protein: https://davidprotein.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\n*Dr. Ari Wallach*\nLongpath: https://www.longpath.org/ari-wallach \nA Brief History of the Future: https://www.pbs.org/show/a-brief-history-of-the-future\nLongpath (book): https://amzlink.to/az0ySyIHkBkzu\nTED talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/ari_wallach_3_ways_to_plan_for_the_very_long_term\nNewsletter: https://longpath.substack.com \nFuturific Studios: https://futurificstudios.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ariw\nX: https://x.com/AriW \nLinkedIn:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariwallach \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/longpath.org/ \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@ariw\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Ari Wallach\n00:01:58 Sponsors: David, Helix Sleep & ROKA\n00:06:13 Mental Time Travel; Technology & Present\n00:15:46 Technology; Tools: Transgenerational Empathy; Bettering Today\n00:22:00 Tool: Empathy for Others\n00:26:09 Empathy for Future Generations, Emotion & Logic\n00:31:48 Tool: Emotion to Guide Action\n00:36:50 Sponsor: AG1\n00:38:02 Tools: Perfect Day Exercise; Cathedral Thinking, Awe & Future Generations\n00:43:52 Egoic Legacy, Modeling Behavior\n00:51:13 Social Media, Time Capsule, Storytelling\n01:00:06 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:01:18 Short-Term Thinking; Life Purpose, Science & Religion\n01:09:23 Longpath, Telos, Time Perception\n01:15:19 Tools: Photo Frames; Behavior & Legacy; Life in Weeks\n01:23:02 Tool: Visualizing Future You\n01:30:17 Death, Western Society\n01:36:20 Tool: Writing Letter to Future Self\n01:41:01 Society, Future Harmony\n01:47:03 Traditional Institutions, Family, Future Consciousness; “Protopia”\n01:58:48 Tool: Behavior & Modeling for the Future\n02:08:11 Tool: “Why Tuesdays?”, Examining Self\n02:14:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter \n\n#HubermanLab \n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss cynicism and its healthier, more adaptive alternative, healthy skepticism, and how embracing healthy skepticism can enhance both our emotional and physical health.\n\nWe discuss the data on how cynicism affects us as individuals and in relationships, causing lower levels of happiness, poorer physical health, and reduced creativity, trust, and collaboration. He also explains novel data-supported tools that we can use to shift ourselves towards a more informed yet more positive worldview and how to adopt a mindset of “hopeful skepticism” — the ideal stance to navigate life. \n\nDr. Zaki offers listeners a positive, hopeful view of humanity grounded in cutting-edge research from his laboratory and other top laboratories.

I explain the neurobiology of learning and neuroplasticity and how correctly timed, self-directed test-taking can be leveraged to improve learning and prevent forgetting. \n\nI discuss the study habits of the most successful learners, ways to limit distractions, how to set study goals, and how tests can be used as tools to learn, not just as a means for evaluating one’s mastery of learned material. A surprising aspect of tests, specifically self-testing soon after exposure to new material, is that they can significantly improve your ability to learn, apply, and maintain new knowledge. I also discuss tools to improve focus and alertness while studying.\n\nBy the end of this episode, you will have learned various science-supported actionable tools you can use to better learn, remember, and apply new information.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/optimal-protocols-for-studying-learning\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Improve Studying & Learning\n00:02:11 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:06:45 Offsetting Forgetting\n00:08:22 Learning & Neuroplasticity\n00:13:06 Periodic Testing\n00:16:09 Focus & Alertness, Sleep, Tool: Active Engagement\n00:21:37 Tool: Improve Focus, Mindfulness Meditation, Perception Exercise\n00:24:38 Sleep & Neuroplasticity, Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)\n00:28:29 Tools: Study Habits of Successful Students\n00:36:21 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:33 Studying & Aspiration Goals; Challenging Material\n00:42:54 Tool: Testing as a Learning Tool\n00:48:23 Self-Testing, Repeated Testing\n00:55:29 Testing Yourself & Knowledge Gaps\n01:01:11 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:02:23 New Material & Self-Test Timing\n01:07:21 Familiarity vs Mastery\n01:10:55 Self-Testing & Offsetting Forgetting\n01:15:53 Best Type of Self-Tests; Phone & Post-Learning Distractions\n01:22:03 Tool: Gap Effects; Testing as Studying vs. Evaluation\n01:25:40 Tool: Emotion & Learning, PTSD, Deliberate Cold Exposure, Caffeine\n01:33:28 Tool: Interleaving Information; Unskilled, Mastery & Virtuosity\n01:39:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Learning\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Teo Soleymani, M.D., a double-board-certified dermatologist and specialist in skin cancer and reconstructive surgery. We discuss science and clinically supported protocols to improve skin health and give your skin a more youthful appearance and structure, reducing premature aging and skin cancer risk.\n \nWe discuss the impact of sun exposure on skin appearance and aging and the surprising relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer. We explain how mineral-based (inorganic) sunscreens differ from chemical (organic) sunscreens, whether sunscreen can minimize premature skin aging, reduce cancer risk, and if there are any health risks associated with sunscreen use.\n \nWe discuss skincare routines to significantly improve skin appearance and how to select skincare products. We discuss how caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stress impact the skin and describe how nutrition and anti-inflammatory diets can improve skin health. We also discuss the causes and treatments for common skin conditions, including dandruff, acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo.\n \nOur conversation also covers topics such as the use of retinoids, laser treatments, red-light phototherapy, supplements, and how to best monitor for skin cancer. This episode provides numerous actionable protocols, most of which are zero-to-low cost, for improving skin health and appearance, reducing cancer risk, and treating skin problems.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-teo-soleymani-how-to-improve-protect-your-skin-health-appearance\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Teo Soleymani*\nClinical practice: https://www.californiadermatology.com/provider/teo-soleymani-md-faad-\nfacms\nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teo-Soleymani\nSol Sciences*: https://sunpowder.co/pages/about\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/teosoleymanimd\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/teo-soleymani-m-d-f-a-a-d-f-a-c-m-s-151a5941\n\n*We have no financial relationship with Sol Sciences.\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Teo Soleymani\n00:01:35 Sponsors: ROKA, Joovv & Helix Sleep\n00:05:45 Skin Turnover; Skin Appearance & Stress \n00:13:35 Caffeine, Vasoconstriction & Skin Redness\n00:16:31 Nicotine, Vaping & Skin Appearance\n00:18:37 Alcohol, Skin Health\n00:24:33 Hydration, Fluid Intake & Genetics\n00:26:19 Tool: Selecting a Moisturizer\n00:29:28 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:40 Puffiness Under Eyes & Cause\n00:32:14 Tool: Skin Cleansing; Frequency, Showers\n00:41:57 Dry & Flaky Scalp, Dandruff\n00:46:09 Cost & Skincare Products\n00:50:20 Tool: Sun Exposure & Skin Health, Mood\n00:56:24 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:57:35 Sunscreens vs. Sunblocks; Mineral-Based (Inorganic) vs. Chemical (Organic) Sunscreen\n01:02:45 Physical Barriers, Sunscreens, Oral Supplements & Skin Cancer\n01:07:27 Skin Cancer, Genetics; Sunscreen, Premature Aging\n01:12:11 Premature Aging & Skincare\n00:15:56 Choose Mineral or Chemical Sunscreen?\n01:20:24 Polypodium Supplement, Sun Exposure, Skin Redness\n01:26:02 Tool: Selecting Mineral-Based Sunscreens\n01:28:30 Chemical Sunscreens & Blood-Brain Barrier\n01:30:13 Nutrition, Gut Microbiome & Skin Health\n01:34:28 Tool: Nutrition for Skin Health, Protein, Anti-Inflammatory; Collagen; Omega-3\n01:42:58 Retinoids vs. Retinol, Skin Appearance\n01:49:45 Laser Resurfacing; Exfoliation, Microdermabrasion\n01:56:52 Red Light Therapy & Phototherapy, Face Masks, Light Panels\n02:04:10 Psoriasis, Phototherapy\n02:10:03 Vitiligo, Immune System & Skin Cancer Risk\n02:15:41 Acne, High Glycemic Index Foods, Dairy\n02:19:38 Rosacea, Types & Treatments\n02:23:00 Eczema, Immune System\n02:25:37 Popping Pimples & Acne Scars; Corticosteroids\n02:30:15 Tattoos; Tool: Monitoring for Skin Cancer, Moles, Annual Exams\n02:36:28 HPV, Cancer & Warts; Vaccine & Cancer Risk\n02:43:31 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #SkinHealth\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Layne Norton, Ph.D., one of the world’s top experts in nutrition and training for physical fitness. We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.\n\nWe explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.\n\nWe also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to “failure,” how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity. We also address why certain behaviors and supplements might work for some people but not others.\n\nListeners to this episode will benefit greatly from Layne’s science-based expertise on a wide range of topics, including health, nutrition, and fitness.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-layne-norton-tools-for-nutrition-fitness\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMateina: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Layne Norton*\nWebsite: https://biolayne.com  \nREPS Research Review: https://biolayne.com/reps\nCarbon Diet Coach: https://www.joincarbon.com \nBooks: https://biolaynestore.com/collections/accessories \nX: https://x.com/BioLayne \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LayneNorton \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/biolayne \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@biolayne \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@biolayne1\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Layne Norton\n00:01:49 Sponsors: Mateina, Eight Sleep, Maui Nui\n00:06:39 Science-Based Evidence, Mechanism vs. Outcome\n00:14:31 Meta-analysis, Methods, Evidence Quality\n00:22:45 Evidence Hierarchy, Randomized Controlled Trials, Cohort Data\n00:33:53 Sponsor: AG1\n00:35:05 “Don’t Turn Your Brain Off”; Protein Synthesis\n00:42:01 Protein Synthesis, Refractory Response; Resistance Training  \n00:46:05 Protein Intake, Intermittent Fasting & Training\n00:54:52 Tool: Total Protein Intake, Distribution & Protein Synthesis\n01:00:25 Muscle Quality, Protein Remodeling, Muscle Growth\n01:05:34 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:06:46 Early vs. Late Time-Restricted Eating; Fasting Blood Glucose & HbA1c\n01:10:30 Carbohydrate Timing, Individual Response, Placebo; Tool: Tracking Diet\n01:19:50 “The Norton Method”; Tool: Consistency\n01:25:16 Resistance & Cardiovascular Training; Competition; Immune System & Rest\n01:33:50 Mind & Body Effects, Stress; Belief Effects\n01:41:30 Training to Failure, Reps in Reserve, Hypertrophy & Strength Training\n01:50:24 Fatigue & Training to Failure, Speed, Strength Training\n01:59:06 Tool: Training After 50, Consistency\n02:09:12 Fat Cells, Diabetes, Exercise\n02:16:50 Metabolism & Age-Related Changes?, Appetite\n02:23:17 Ozempic, Mounjaro, GLP-1 Agonists, Lean Mass, “Food Noise”\n02:33:42 GLP-1 Agonists, Judgement & Obesity\n02:40:19 Sugar, Excess Calories, Body Weight\n02:49:16 Satiety, Sugar & Calorie Budget\n02:54:56 Tool: Individualization, Context & Diet Psychology\n02:57:22 Seed Oils, Butter, Olive Oil\n03:06:56 Red Meat, Carcinogenic?; Simple Diet; Fiber Benefits\n03:13:43 Saturated Fat, Cholesterol; Seed Oils\n03:18:41 Artificial & Low-Calorie Sweeteners, Insulin, Appetite\n03:29:06 Artificial & Low-Calorie Sweeteners, Gut Microbiome; Cancer\n03:37:58 Tools: Training Recovery, Glycogen Replenishment; Stress & Activity\n03:45:56 Collagen Supplementation, Skin & Nails, Whey Protein\n03:57:00 Evidence-Based Approach\n04:01:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Nutrition #Fitness \n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

This episode is a recording of the live stream AMA, exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\n\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation and other donors.\n\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023\n\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-18-cold-therapy-advice-skin-health-tips-motivation-learning-strategies-more \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00 Introduction & Announcements\n00:15 Supporting Mental & Physical Health Research\n01:56 Exciting New Research Initiatives\n03:39 Skin Health & Appearance\n14:46 Cold Therapy Benefits & Guidelines\n21:18 Self-Motivation Strategies\n27:05 Understanding REM Sleep\n28:45 Morning Routine: Exercise & Cold Exposure\n29:17 The Importance of REM Sleep\n29:49 Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) Protocols\n31:27 REM Sleep Rebound & Compensation\n32:55 Impactful School Strategies for Learning\n34:19 Meditation & Micro Gaps in Learning\n39:13 Physical Activity & Learning\n41:01 Exploring Shilajit & Testosterone\n47:51 Writing Process & Overcoming Obstacles\n51:32 Addiction & Recovery Resources\n53:47 Closing Remarks & Gratitude\n\n#HubermanLab #AMA\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine-trained physician expert in improving human healthspan and lifespan. Dr. Attia is also the host of The Drive podcast and author of the best-selling book Outlive. \n\nWe discuss the NAD pathway in human cells and its possible links to aging and health. We evaluate how supplementation can augment molecules in the NAD pathway; we compare NAD, NMN, and NR, different routes of administration, their safety, and bioavailability. Then, we discuss the broader research and clinical literature on longevity to decide if supplementation with NAD, NR, NMN, rapamycin, or resveratrol can indeed extend lifespan. \n\nFinally, we each describe our supplement regimens and compare the role of supplementation to behaviors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise for longevity. We also discuss whether tests of biological age are true indicators of aging and whether normal radiation levels increase cancer risk. \n\nListeners of this episode will learn if supplements purported to improve lifespan show any efficacy and the behaviors and other factors that can prevent disease and extend lifespan.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-peter-attia-supplements-for-longevity-their-efficacy\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman  \n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Peter Attia*\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nThe Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter\nX: https://x.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia, NAD Pathway\n00:02:31 Sponsors: LMNT, Levels & Eight Sleep\n00:06:38 Categories of Longevity Approaches\n00:17:22 Peter’s Supplements; Rapamycin & Research Data\n00:25:01 NAD Pathway: Energy & DNA Repair; Knock-Out & Knock-In, Klotho\n00:30:35 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:25 Yeast, Sirtuins, Caloric Restriction & Lifespan\n00:38:56 Sirtuins, Transgenic Mice, Gender & Lifespan\n00:43:42 DNA Repair, Sirtuins, Cancer; Resveratrol\n00:53:31 Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin Podcast\n00:54:18 NAD & NADH, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), Mitochondrial Health\n01:02:17 NAD vs NR vs NMN Supplementation; IV & Oral Routes\n01:11:33 NR vs. NMN, Doses, Side Effects; Interventions Testing Program\n01:17:43 Fatty Liver Disease & NR; NMN & Glucose; Clinical Significance\n01:25:17 Safety & FDA, NMN & NR Supplementation; Skin Cancer Benefits\n01:30:38 Longevity, NR & NMN Supplementation, Inflammation\n01:41:00 Rapamycin & Immune Function\n01:44:37 Biological Aging Tests, Chronologic & Biologic Age; Vigor \n01:55:24 Radiation & Cancer Risk\n01:58:12 Tool: Self-Care in 50s-70s & Aging; Energy Decline\n02:07:12 Tool: Exercise Timing & Energy Levels\n02:11:22 Peter’s Supplements\n02:18:46 Andrew’s Supplements\n02:24:34 Tool: Supplement Use vs. Critical Behaviors; Titanic Analogy \n02:26:52 NAD Pathway Supplementation for Longevity?\n02:28:52 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stacy Sims, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist, nutrition scientist, and expert in female-specific nutrition and training for health, performance, and longevity. We discuss which exercise and nutrition protocols are ideal for women based on their age and particular goals.\n\nWe discuss whether women should train fasted, when and what to eat pre- and post-training, and how the menstrual cycle impacts training and nutrition needs. We also explain how to use a combination of resistance, high-intensity, and sprint interval training to effectively improve body composition, hormones, and cardiometabolic health, offset cognitive decline, and promote longevity. \n\nWe also discuss supplements and caffeine, the unique sleep needs of women based on age, whether women should use deliberate cold exposure, and how saunas can improve symptoms of hot flashes and benefit athletic performance. Dr. Sims challenges common misconceptions about women’s health and fitness and explains why certain types of cardio, caloric restriction, and low-protein diets can be harmful to women’s metabolic health.\n\nListeners will learn a wealth of actionable information on how to improve their training and nutrition to enhance their health and how to age with greater ability, mobility, and vitality.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-stacy-sims-female-specific-exercise-nutrition-for-health-performance-longevity\n\nPre-order Andrew's new book, Protocols: https://protocolsbook.com\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman  \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Stacy Sims*\nWebsite: https://www.drstacysims.com \nBooks: https://www.drstacysims.com/booksandmore \nTEDx Talk:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5LYGzKUPlE \nBlog: https://www.drstacysims.com/blog \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drstacysims\nX: https://x.com/summerstack \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@DrStacySims\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drstacysims\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-t-sims-phd\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Stacy Sims\n00:02:24 Sponsors: Maui Nui, Eight Sleep & Waking Up\n00:07:03 Intermittent Fasting, Exercise & Women\n00:12:50 Cortisol & Circadian Rhythm, Caffeine & Training\n00:17:25 Reps in Reserve, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE); Age & Women\n00:21:06 Pre-Training Meal & Brain, Kisspeptin\n00:26:45 Post-Training Meal & Recovery Window\n00:29:59 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:48 Hormones, Calories & Women\n00:34:24 Women, Strength Improvements & Resistance Training\n00:39:10 Tool: Women & Training Goals by Age Range\n00:44:16 Women, Perimenopause, Training & Longevity\n00:47:14 Women & Training for Longevity, Cardio, Zone 2\n00:51:42 Tools: How to Start Resistance Training, Machines; Polarized Training\n00:58:23 Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin Podcast\n00:59:10 Menstrual Cycle & Training, Tool: Tracking & Individual Variability\n01:04:31 Tool: 10-Minute Rule; High-Intensity Training & Menstrual Cycle\n01:08:36 “Train Hard & Eat Well”; Appetite, Nutrition & Menstrual Cycle\n01:12:22 Oral Contraception, Hormones, Athletic Performance; IUD\n01:20:57 Evaluating Menstrual Blood, PCOS; Hormones & Female Athletes\n01:26:31 Iron, Fatigue; Blood Testing & Menstrual Cycle\n01:29:33 Caffeine & Perimenopause; Nicotine, Schisandra\n01:34:24 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Women, Endometriosis; Tool: Sauna & Hot Flashes\n01:42:19 Tools: “Sims’ Protocol”: Post-Training Sauna & Performance; “Track Stack”\n01:49:37 Women, Hormones & Sleep, Perimenopause & Sleep Hygiene\n01:52:54 Supplements: Creatine, Water Weight, Hair Loss; Vitamin D3\n01:57:21 Protein Powder; Adaptogens & Timing\n02:00:11 Pregnancy & Training; Cold & Hot Exposure\n02:06:19 Tool: Women in 50s & Older, Training & Nutrition for Longevity\n02:09:38 Tool: Women in 20s-40s & Training, Lactate\n02:12:18 Tool: What is High-Intensity Training?, Cardiovascular Sets & Recovery\n02:17:22 Training for Longevity, Cellular & Metabolic Changes\n02:19:30 Nutrition, 80/20 Rule\n02:23:30 Listening to Self\n02:26:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter \n\n#HubermanLab #Fitness #Nutrition\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stuart McGill, Ph.D., a distinguished professor emeritus of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo and a world expert on spine anatomy and physiology, back pain, and rehabilitation. We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain. \n\nWe discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how “McGill’s Big 3” exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness. \n\nWe also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This episode provides clear, actionable tools to strengthen, prevent, and remedy back pain and injury so you can be pain-free while enjoying sports, exercise, and daily activities at any age. \n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-stuart-mcgill-build-a-strong-pain-proof-back\n\nWatch the clip on back pain relief and spine anatomy that accompanies this episode: https://youtu.be/6SSxgAUfFug\n\nDemonstration of The McGill Method: https://youtu.be/f7HLP96HVNM\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Stuart McGill*\nWebsite: https://www.backfitpro.com\nUniversity of Waterloo academic profile: https://uwaterloo.ca/kinesiology-health-sciences/people-profiles/stuart-mcgill\nPublications: https://www.backfitpro.com/medical-publications/\nBooks: https://www.backfitpro.com/books\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@backfitpro9992\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backfitpro\nX: https://x.com/drstuartmcgill\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Backfitpro\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Stuart McGill\n00:02:33 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:06:23 What Causes Back Pain?; Genetics, Dog Breed Analogy\n00:12:55 Tool: Skeleton & Body Type; Spine Flexibility & Discs\n00:20:25 Flexibility & Exercises; Discs & Collagen\n00:25:43 Sponsor: AG1\n00:27:32 Stress & Tipping Point; Athletic Tradeoffs, Triathletes \n00:36:17 Back Pain, Goals & Training Program\n00:45:57 Spine Hygiene, Back Pain, Powerlifting\n00:53:33 Genetics & Running\n00:59:34 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:00:46 Rehabilitation & Reducing Volume; Injury \n01:07:42 Tool: Training for Lifelong Fitness, Injury & Joints\n01:17:40 Pain Types, Biopsychosocial Model of Pain\n01:26:15 Coaching, Explosivity & Endurance\n01:32:43 Virtual Surgery & Rest, Pain Recovery\n01:41:25 Tool: McGill’s Big 3; Building Back Strength & Stability\n01:46:39 Inversion Tables & Spine Deloading, Disc Bulge, Tool: Lumbar Support\n01:51:09 Tool: Daily Walking; Sitting\n01:55:33 Deadlift & Bone Density, Glute-Ham Raise\n02:06:20 Training & Age, Osteoporosis, Tool: Deadlift Alternatives\n02:16:47 Tools: Biblical Training Week; Spine Stability & McGill’s Big 3; Shrinking & Age\n02:24:16 Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP); Disc Damage\n02:27:56 Tools: Biblical Training Week & Strength Exercises, Neck Strength\n02:35:24 Tools: Sword Play, Distal Limb Loading, Training for Symmetry\n02:42:38 Tools: Biblical Training Week, Mobility & Cardiovascular Exercises, Athletic Panel\n02:49:22 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #BackPain\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matthew Hill, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary and an expert on the biology of cannabis. We discuss how cannabis affects the brain to produce its psychoactive effects (feeling “high”), including altered time perception, focus, memory, appetite, and stress.\n\nWe discuss how THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD) affects the brain, the effects of different routes of cannabis administration (e.g., smoking, vaping, edibles), high-potency THC, and whether cannabis is addictive. We discuss if there is a link between cannabis use and the development of psychosis, anxiety, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia. \n\nWe discuss whether CBD has clinical benefits in regulating stress, promoting sleep, and treating certain diseases. We also discuss if there are real and consistent differences in the biological effects of different cannabis strains, if cannabis impacts hormones, and the uses of cannabis for the management of pain, stress, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and nausea.\n\nListeners of this episode will get an up-to-date understanding of what is currently known about how cannabis affects the brain and body, including both its potential benefits and risks.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode at https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-hill-how-cannabis-impacts-health-the-potential-risks\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Matthew Hill\nHotchkiss Brain Institute: https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/mist/team/research-chair\nUniversity of Calgary academic profile: https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/matthew-hill\nPublications: https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Q494JnAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao\nLab website: http://www.hill-lab.ca/\nX: https://x.com/canna_brain\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Matthew Hill\n00:00:00 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT & BetterHelp\n00:07:16 Cannabis, THC, Cannabidiol (CBD), Terpenes\n00:12:08 Psychoactive Effects, Cannabis “High”; Time Perception\n00:16:55 Cannabis & Brain, CB1 Receptor, Endocannabinoids\n00:26:19 Endocannabinoids Types: Anandamide, 2-AG\n00:33:46 “Munchies”, Cannabis & Appetite\n00:42:17 Sponsor: AG1\n00:44:06 THC & Anandamide, Pharmacology\n00:52:37 THC & CB1 Receptors, Intoxication & Appetite\n00:58:57 Cannabis & Focus, Memory\n01:04:09 Routes of Administration, Concentration, Cannabis Research\n01:15:12 Self-Regulation, Inhalation & THC, Tolerance; THC Concentrates\n01:22:25 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:23:36 Addiction & Cannabis, Cannabis Use Disorder\n01:31:30 Cannabis Legalization & Use, Edibles & ER Visits\n01:36:48 Oral Consumption, Edibles, Dosing & Time Course\n01:41:12 Drug Testing & Cannabis, Exercise\n01:46:04 Cannabis & Hormones, Gynecomastia, Sperm Quality\n01:54:37 Cannabis & Pregnancy; Selling Recreational Cannabis\n02:04:07 Vaping\n02:07:05 Psychosis, Anxiety & Cannabis\n02:17:17 Cannabis, Psychosis, Schizophrenia & Genetics\n02:30:45 Cannabis Use & Schizophrenia, Manic Bipolar, THC Potency, Nicotine\n02:40:37 Schizophrenia, Cannabis Legalization\n02:45:06 Cannabis Strains, Indica, Sativa, Subjective Effects & Expectancy Bias\n02:57:00 CBD, Pediatric Epilepsy, Adenosine\n03:07:22 Entourage Effect; Placebo Effect, CBD & Doses\n03:19:12 Cannabis Health Risks, Cardiovascular Risk, Schizophrenia \n03:27:08 Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome & Hot Shower\n03:31:30 Cannabis Benefits: Pain, Stress, Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n03:40:18 Cannabis & Anxiety, Anandamide & Stress Response\n03:45:55 Scientific Discussion, Clarification & Advancement\n03:49:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss skin health appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.\n\nI also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome. \n\nI explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.\n\nI also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions. \n\nThis episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.\n\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-improve-skin-health-appearance\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Skin Health\n00:02:59 Sponsors: Joovv, BetterHelp & ROKA \n00:07:18 Skin Biology, Skin Layers\n00:12:40 Sun Exposure, UV Light & Skin Cancers; Sunscreen\n00:19:51 Aging, Sun Exposure, Skin Cancers, Physical Barriers\n00:27:24 Sunburn & Skin Cancers\n00:30:09 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:58 Vitamin D, Sun Exposure & Sunscreen\n00:36:50 Organic (Chemical) Sunscreen & Inorganic (Mineral-Based) Sunscreen\n00:49:20 Skin Cancers, Moles, Laser Resurfacing\n00:53:59 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:55:34 Sun Exposure, Melanoma & Life Expectancy\n01:03:13 Tool: Youthful Skin, Collagen & Vitamin C\n01:12:55 Peptides, BPC-157, Copper\n01:20:58 Tool: Niacinamide (Nicotinamide), Youthful Skin, Dark Spots, Hyaluronic Acid\n01:26:25 Tool: Retinol (Retin-A, Tretinoin, Retinyl Esters), Youthful Skin\n01:33:07 Tool: Phototherapy, Youthful Skin, Treating Skin Conditions\n01:41:10 Tool: Nutrition for Skin Health, Anti-Inflammatory Diets\n01:47:54 Highly Processed Foods, Advanced Glycation End Products & Skin Health\n01:52:08 Tools: Reduce Inflammation: Gut Microbiome, Sleep, Alcohol, Smoking, Stress\n01:58:58 Acne, Hormones & Insulin; Tool: Low Glycemic Diet, Dairy\n02:07:26 Tools: Face Cleansing & Acne; Scarring & Popping Pimples\n02:13:29 Tool: Treating Rosacea, Alcohol, Skin Care, Nutrition\n02:18:31 Stubborn Rosacea, Over Cleansing, Pulsed Dye Laser\n02:21:04 Psoriasis Treatment, Immune System & Prescriptions\n02:25:24 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Health #SkinHealth\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Time-restricted feeding is just one approach to regulating food intake that many people find useful for weight loss, but others find it less useful than simply caloric restriction across a “normal” meal distribution.\n\nOf course, this is individual, but there are certain incentives to fasting that most people don’t consider. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is the guest on the current Huberman Lab podcast, which is out now. She discusses some of the advantages of fasting as well as who should probably avoid fasting.\n\nDuring the episode, we discuss protein intake and sources and specific types of training for men and women as it relates to physical health and longevity of the body and brain.

    "title": "The Science of Hunger & Medications to Combat Obesity | Dr. Zachary Knight",
    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Zachary Knight, Ph.D., a professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied. \n \nWe discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss. \n \nDr. Knight provides an exceptionally clear explanation for our sense of hunger, thirst, and food cravings that translates to practical knowledge to help listeners better understand their relationship to food, food choices, and meal size to improve their diet and overall health. \n\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-zachary-knight-the-science-of-hunger-medications-to-combat-obesity\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Zachary Knight\nUCSF academic profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/zachary.knight \nHHMI profile: https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/zachary-knight \nPublications: https://knightlab.ucsf.edu/publications \nLab website: https://knightlab.ucsf.edu \nX: https://x.com/zaknight \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zknightsf\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-knight-29a37977\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Zachary Knight\n00:02:38 Sponsors: BetterHelp, Helix Sleep & Waking Up\n00:07:07 Hunger & Timescales\n00:11:28 Body Fat, Leptin, Hunger\n00:17:51 Leptin Resistance & Obesity\n00:20:52 Hunger, Food Foraging & Feeding Behaviors, AgRP Neurons\n00:30:26 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:15 Body Weight & Obesity, Genes & POMC Neurons\n00:39:54 Obesity, Genetics & Environmental Factors\n00:46:05 Whole Foods, Ultra-Processed Foods & Palatability\n00:49:32 Increasing Whole Food Consumption, Sensory Specific Satiety & Learning\n00:58:55 Calories vs. Macronutrients, Protein & Salt\n01:02:23 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:03:58 Challenges of Weight Loss: Hunger & Energy Expenditure\n01:09:50 GLP-1 Drug Development, Semaglutide, Ozempic, Wegovy\n01:19:03 GLP-1 Drugs: Muscle Loss, Appetite Reduction, Nausea\n01:23:24 Pharmacologic & Physiologic Effects; GLP-1 Drugs, Additional Positive Effects\n01:30:14 GLP-1-Plus Development, Tirzepatide, Mounjaro, AMG 133\n01:34:49 Alpha-MSH & Pharmacology\n01:40:41 Dopamine, Eating & Context\n01:46:01 Dopamine & Learning, Water Content & Food\n01:53:23 Salt, Water & Thirst\n02:03:27 Hunger vs. Thirst\n02:05:46 Dieting, Nutrition & Mindset\n02:09:39 Tools: Improving Diet & Limiting Food Intake\n02:14:15 Anti-Obesity Drug Development\n02:17:03 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Health #Obesity\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jonathan Haidt, Ph.D., professor of social psychology at New York University and bestselling author on how technology and culture impact the psychology and health of kids, teens, and adults. We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games.\n \nHe explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution — all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function. \n \nDr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation. \n\nThis is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.\n\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jonathan-haidt-how-smartphones-social-media-impact-mental-health-the-realistic-solutions\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Jonathan Haidt\n00:02:01 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, AeroPress & Joovv\n00:06:23 Great Rewiring of Childhood: Technology, Smartphones & Social Media\n00:12:48 Mental Health Trends: Boys, Girls & Smartphones\n00:16:26 Smartphone Usage, Play-Based to Phone-Based Childhood\n00:20:40 The Tragedy of Losing Play-Based Childhood\n00:28:13 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:02 Girls vs. Boys, Interests & Trapping Kids\n00:37:31 “Effectance,” Systems & Relationships, Animals\n00:41:47 Boys Sexual Development, Dopamine Reinforcement & Pornography\n00:49:19 Boys, Courtship, Chivalry & Technology; Gen Z Development\n00:55:24 Play & Low-Stakes Mistakes, Video Games & Social Media, Conflict Resolution\n00:59:48 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:01:23 Social Media, Trolls, Performance\n01:06:47 Dynamic Subordination, Hierarchy, Boys\n01:10:15 Girls & Perfectionism, Social Media & Performance\n01:14:00 Phone-Based Childhood & Brain Development, Critical Periods\n01:21:15 Puberty & Sensitive Periods, Culture & Identity\n01:23:55 Brain Development & Puberty; Identity; Social Media, Learning & Reward\n01:33:37 Tool: 4 Recommendations for Smartphone Use in Kids\n01:41:48 Changing Childhood Norms, Policies & Legislature\n01:49:13 Summer Camp, Team Sports, Religion, Music\n01:54:36 Boredom, Addiction & Smartphones; Tool: “Awe Walks”\n02:03:14 Casino Analogy & Ceding Childhood; Social Media Content\n02:09:33 Adult Behavior; Tool: Meals & Phones\n02:11:45 Regaining Childhood Independence; Tool: Family Groups & Phones\n02:16:09 Screens & Future Optimism, Collective Action, KOSA Bill\n02:24:52 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #MentalHealth\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Diego Bohórquez, PhD, professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University and a pioneering researcher into how we use our ‘gut sense.’ He describes how your gut communicates to your brain and the rest of your body through hormones and neural connections to shape your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. He explains how your gut senses a range of features such as temperature, pH, the macro- and micronutrients in our foods, and much more and signals that information to the brain to affect our food preferences, aversions, and cravings. \n\nDr. Bohórquez describes his early life in the Amazon jungle and how exposure to traditional agriculture inspired his unique expertise combining nutrition, gastrointestinal physiology, and neuroscience. We discuss how the gut and brain integrate sensory cues, leading to our intuitive “gut sense” about food, people, and situations. This episode provides a scientific perspective into your gut sense to help you make better food choices and, indeed, to support better decision-making in all of life.\n\nAccess the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-diego-bohorquez-the-science-of-your-gut-sense-the-gut-brain-axis\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Diego Bohórquez\nAcademic profile: https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/diego-v-bohorquez \nLab website: https://gutbrains.com \nThe Gastronauts Podcast: https://thinkgastronauts.com/podcast\nPublications: https://gutbrains.com/articles\nX: https://x.com/gutbrains \nYouTube: https://youtube.com/@thebohorquezlabatdukeunive9762\nTED Talk: https://youtu.be/utFG8GEvmfg\nNature Neuroscience profile: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01373-w \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Diego Bohórquez\n00:02:37 Sponsors: Joovv, LMNT & Helix Sleep; YouTube, Spotify & Apple Subscribe\n00:06:49 Gut-Brain Axis \n00:11:35 Gut Sensing, Hormones\n00:15:26 Green Fluorescent Protein; Neuropod Cells & Environment Sensing\n00:26:57 Brain & Gut Connection, Experimental Tools & Rabies Virus\n00:35:28 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:00 Neuropod Cells & Nutrient Sensing\n00:43:55 Gastric Bypass Surgery, Cravings & Food Choice\n00:51:14 Optogenetics; Sugar Preference & Neuropod Cells\n01:00:29 Gut-Brain Disorders, Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n01:03:03 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:04:04 Gut & Behavior; Gastric Bypass, Cravings & Alcohol\n01:07:38 GLP-1, Ozempic, Neuropod Cells\n01:11:46 Food Preference & Gut-Brain Axis, Protein\n01:21:35 Protein & Sugar, Agriculture & ‘Three Sisters’\n01:25:16 Childhood, Military School; Academics, Nutrition & Nervous System\n01:36:15 Plant Wisdom, Agriculture, Indigenous People\n01:41:48 Evolution of Food Choices; Learning from Plants\n01:48:15 Plant-Based Medicines; Amazonia, Guayusa Ritual & Chonta Palm\n01:56:58 Yerba Mate, Chocolate, Guayusa\n02:00:22 Brain, Gut & Sensory Integration; Variability\n02:06:01 Electrical Patterns in Gut & Brain, “Hangry”\n02:12:43 Gut Intuition, Food & Bonding; Subconscious & Superstition\n02:22:00 Vagus Nerve & Learning, Humming\n02:26:46 Digestive System & Memory; Body Sensing\n02:32:51 Listening to the Body, Meditation\n02:40:12 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #GutHealth #Science \n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. James Hollis, Ph.D., a Jungian psychoanalyst, renowned educator and author on finding and pursuing one’s unique purpose. Dr. Hollis is also an expert in the psychology of relationships and healing from trauma. We discuss how early family dynamics and social context create patterns of both adaptive and maladaptive behavior and internal narratives that, when examined, lead to better choices and a deeply fulfilling existence.\n\nWe discuss discovering your unique self-identity and purpose through specific practices of reflection, meditation and conversations with others. We also discuss self-perception and the evolution of roles within marriages, parent-child relationships, and work.\n\nThroughout the episode, Dr. Hollis provides both basic knowledge and practical tools to help us assess ourselves and better understand who we are and what we really want in careers, relationships of all kinds, and society.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/cNcfTmo\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. James Hollis*\nWebsite: https://jameshollis.net \nBooks: https://jameshollis.net/hollisBooks.html \nJung Platform: https://bit.ly/3yjVhTJ\nVideos: https://jameshollis.net/hollisVideos.html \nUpcoming lectures: https://jameshollis.net/hollisLecture.htm \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. James Hollis\n00:02:14 Sponsors: Mateina, Joovv & BetterHelp\n00:05:57 Self, Ego, Sense of Self \n00:13:59 Unconscious Patterns, Blind Spots, Dreams; Psyche & Meaning \n00:21:56 Second Half of Life, Purpose, Depression \n00:25:37 Sponsor: AG1\n00:27:08 Tool: Daily Reflection; Crisis \n00:31:47 Families & Children, Permission & Burdens\n00:37:27 Complex Identification, Self-Perception; Social Media & Borderline \n00:41:55 Daily Stimulus Response, Listening to the Soul\n00:45:40 Exiting Stimulus-Response, Loneliness, Burnout\n00:51:19 Meditation & Perception, Reflection\n00:54:58 Sponsor: Waking Up\n00:56:15 Recognizing the “Shadow” & Adulthood\n01:02:48 Socialization; Family & Life Journey\n01:09:04 Relationships & “Otherness”, Standing Your Ground\n01:15:51 Marriage, “Starter Marriages” & Evolution; Parenting\n01:19:37 Shadow Issues, Success & External Reward, Personal Growth \n01:27:59 Men, Alcohol, “Stoic Man”, Loneliness, Fear & Longing \n01:37:33 Women & Men, Focused vs. Diffuse Awareness; Male Rite of Passage\n01:44:31 Sacrifice, Relationships; Facing Fears \n01:48:20 Therapy, “Abyss of the Self”, Repeating Patterns & Stories \n01:55:17 Women, Career & Family, Partner Support; Redefining Roles\n02:01:40 Pathology & Diagnosis, Internet\n02:07:05 Life, Suffering & Accountability, “Swamplands” & Task\n02:11:32 Abuse & Recovery of Self, Patience, Powerlessness\n02:14:11 Living a Larger Life; “Shut Up, Suit Up, Show Up”\n02:17:49 Life Stages; Despair & Integrity Conflict\n02:25:00 Death, Ego, Mortality & Meaning\n02:38:07 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab \n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I explain how to strengthen and build a stable, pain-free back and how to reduce or eliminate existing back pain. I explain the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord and vertebrae, intervertebral disks and nerve pathways, and the abdominal and back muscles that together can be leveraged to stabilize the back. \n\nThen, I describe protocols: “McGill’s Big 3” exercises, a highly effective psoas stretch, abdominal stabilization, breathing techniques, and protocols to reinforce essential supports for the back, including the neck, pelvis, feet and toes. \n\nI also explain how you can reduce and potentially eliminate back pain and sciatica using a specific type of bar hang, “cobra push-ups,” medial-glute strengthening exercises and more. \n\nBack pain greatly impedes one’s ability to enjoy daily activities; this episode provides zero-cost, minimal time-investment protocols to improve your back strength and stability and allow you to move through life pain-free and with ease and mobility. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\n\nResources\nAndrew Huberman demonstrates the McGill Big 3: https://youtu.be/f7HLP96HVNM\nThe McGill Big 3: https://youtu.be/LXYPETeHZlA\nGlute medius exercise (Toe Stab Hip Raises): https://youtu.be/6pKKnVg1hzE?si=Zxb8XeC2P0UZyxyx&t=68 \nToe spreaders: https://amzn.to/3JBDNV4\nSquat University Core Exercises: https://youtu.be/2_e4I-brfqs\nAthleanX medial glute exercises to relieve lower back pain: https://youtu.be/DWmGArQBtFI\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Sean Mackey: Tools to Reduce & Manage Pain: https://youtu.be/K9lORz2_XSU\nGuest Series | Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness: https://youtu.be/zEYE-vcVKy8\nJeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools: https://youtu.be/UNCwdFxPtE8\n\nSean Wheeler, MD\nWebsite: https://bodyguitar.com \nUprise: Back Pain Liberation (book): https://amzn.to/3JBR54b\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/drseanwheeler \nX: https://twitter.com/DrSeanWheeler \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drseanwheeler\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@dr.seanwheeler7390 \n\nStuart M.

We also cover how childhood development and aging affect sleep biology and needs. We also discuss whether polyphasic sleep (multiple short sleep periods) is beneficial. \n\nThen, we discuss naps, including their positive benefits, individual variability, those who should not nap, and alternative rest states like non-sleep deep rest. Dr. Walker shares protocols to optimize nap duration, timing and effectiveness.\n\nWe also explore the effects of caffeine on sleep and other health aspects, as well as the optimal timing for caffeine intake.\n\nThis episode describes many actionable science-based tools for optimizing sleep, naps and caffeine use for better health and performance.\n\nThe next episode in this special series explores the relationship between sleep, memory, and creativity.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Matthew Walker\nWebsite: https://www.sleepdiplomat.com \nPodcast: https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/podcast \n\"Why We Sleep\": https://amzn.to/4a9Tyyl \nAcademic profile: https://bit.ly/3UK2Ags\nX: https://twitter.com/sleepdiplomat \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drmattwalker \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sleepdiplomat \nMasterClass: https://bit.ly/3U4iEYI\n\nArticles\nIn short photoperiods, human sleep is biphasic: https://bit.ly/3Ugrt2N\nSleep-Dependent Facilitation of Episodic Memory Details: https://bit.ly/4aOYlFy\nA Role for REM Sleep in Recalibrating the Sensitivity of the Human Brain to Specific Emotions: https://bit.ly/3xC8mYa\nSleep, alcohol, and caffeine in financial traders: https://bit.ly/44iI7Cx\nThe alerting effects of caffeine, bright light and face washing after a short daytime nap: https://bit.ly/3VWUbaj\nAdverse impact of polyphasic sleep patterns in humans: Report of the National Sleep Foundation sleep timing and variability consensus panel: https://bit.ly/4aOYp8g\nSleep deficiency and motor vehicle crash risk in the general population: a prospective cohort study: https://bit.ly/4aAgvuU\n\nOther Resources\nCrew Factors in Flight Operations IX: Effects of Planned Cockpit Rest on Crew Performance and Alertness in Long-Haul Operations (NASA Technical Memorandum): https://go.nasa.gov/3xC8bfs\nThe Matt Walker Podcast: Insomnia Series: https://bit.ly/3W1d5fZ\nPolyphasic Sleep Community: https://bit.ly/3VZdSy8\nDymaxion Sleep (TIME Magazine): https://bit.ly/43YfJW5\nAcute Sleep Deprivation and Risk of Motor Vehicle Crash Involvement (AAA): https://bit.ly/3W1iFzh\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nJocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others‍: https://youtu.be/__RAXBLt1iM\nGuest Series | Dr. Matthew Walker: The Biology of Sleep & Your Unique Sleep Needs (Episode 1): https://youtu.be/-OBCwiPPfEU\nGuest Series | Dr. Matthew Walker: Protocols to Improve Your Sleep (Episode 2): https://youtu.be/hvPGfcAgk9Y\n\nPeople Mentioned\nHoward Roffwarg: sleep researcher pioneer: https://bit.ly/49DtkTW\nMichael Pollan: author and journalist: https://bit.ly/3W2Nqnk\nDavid Dinges: professor of psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania: https://bit.ly/3WkljAn\nMark Rosekind: NASA expert: https://bit.ly/3vUp70a\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Sleep Structure\n00:01:29 Sponsors: BetterHelp, LMNT & Waking Up\n00:05:42 Sleep Phases & Lifespan\n00:11:58 Sleep Stages & Lifespan, Sleep Paralysis & Animals\n00:20:19 Adults & Biphasic Sleep, Modern Society\n00:25:14 Chronotype, Circadian Rhythms & Biological Flexibility\n00:29:07 Genetics & Chronotype\n00:31:42 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:55 Biphasic Sleep, Adults; Body Position & Sleepiness\n00:40:09 Naps, Positive Benefits, Nighttime Insomnia\n00:49:38 Tool: Optimal Nap: Duration & Timing; Grogginess\n00:58:15 Nap Capacity, “Liminal” States & NSDR\n01:07:37 NASA Nap Culture, Power Naps\n01:11:49 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n01:12:50 Tools: Nap Timing, “Fragile” Nighttime Sleep; On-Off-On Protocol\n01:18:57 Avoiding Naps: Insomnia, Aging & Sleep Quality Decline\n01:28:20 Caffeine, “Nappuccino”; Hot Drinks\n01:38:28 Adenosine Clearance, Sleep \n01:43:10 Tool: Delaying Caffeine, Afternoon Crash, Sleep Quality\n01:49:06 Caffeine, Health, Antioxidants; Caffeine Tolerance & Alcohol\n01:56:54 Tool: Nap “Enhancements”, Caffeine, Light & Face Washing\n02:04:33 Polyphasic Sleep, Adverse Effects\n02:12:43 Sleep Deprivation & Car Crashes; Polyphasic Sleep\n02:16:49 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Sleep \n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "A Simple Solution for Quickly Returning to Sleep at Night",
    "description": "Dr. Matthew Walker explains one of the common issues people face: waking up in the middle of the night. That itself is not so much a problem if it just happens once per night, but often, people have difficulty falling back asleep, which then sets in motion anxiety about sleep, sleep deprivation, and, in turn, the negative effects of sleep deprivation.\n\nSomething as simple as looking at the time can create a cascade of issues, leading to more sleep challenges.\n\nThe takeaway: If you have trouble waking up in the middle of the night and difficulty falling back asleep afterward, consider removing all clock faces, electronic or otherwise, from the bedroom.\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Coleman Ruiz, a former Tier One U.S. Navy SEAL joint task force commander. He served in Afghanistan and Iraq and as a BUD/S training officer. He shares his journey from childhood through the Naval Academy to elite Navy SEAL special operations. He shares the physical and emotional challenges he has overcome and discusses his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He also talks about the key role of mentors, family and friends in building resilience. Coleman gives us a raw, humble account of hitting rock bottom. He tells of the intense pain, fear, depression and suicidality in his journey of redemption. Coleman’s story is a real-life hero’s journey. He tells it with extraordinary vulnerability and humility. He explains the challenges and sudden tragedies that helped to ground, shape and renew him. His story will inspire listeners of all ages and backgrounds.\n\nNote: This conversation includes profanity and topics that are not suitable for all audiences and ages.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivension.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nColeman Ruiz\nTeam Red, White & Blue: https://bit.ly/3vKu0Jc \nLiminal Collective: https://bit.ly/3PSl4bn \nAmes Watson: https://bit.ly/49AwCY8 \nNaval Academy: https://bit.ly/4aprPKc \nX: https://twitter.com/colemanruiz \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/colemanruiz\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleman-ruiz-b65a2531\n\nBooks\nA Fighter's Heart: https://amzn.to/43Rr1uX\nMindset: https://amzn.to/3TS8CK7\nBridge at Dong Ha: https://amzn.to/3PUtmQ2\nFearless: https://amzn.to/49mTwC9\nThe Hero with a Thousand Faces: https://amzn.to/49rFzTd\nThe End of Faith: https://amzn.to/3vx35k8\nWhy Buddhism is True: https://amzn.to/4cQuyxJ\nThe Body Keeps the Score: https://amzn.to/4cGSDHr\nRange: https://amzn.to/3xuzwQH\n\nOther Resources\nThey Shall Not Grow Old: https://imdb.to/3VPYVyy \nPale Blue Dot: https://youtu.be/wupToqz1e2g\nExtortion 17: https://bit.ly/3U7hP2r\nVeteran Solutions: https://vetsolutions.org\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction: https://youtu.be/p3JLaF_4Tz8\nDr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance: https://youtu.be/dFR_wFN23ZY\nRobert Greene: A Process for Finding & Achieving Your Unique Purpose: https://youtu.be/50BZQRT1dAg\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health: https://youtu.be/tLRCS48Ens4\nSpace-Time Bridging (timestamp): https://youtu.be/wTBSGgbIvsY?si=mk4-iUrvAvGaaqFp&t=8094 \nWhat Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain & Health: https://youtu.be/DkS1pkKpILY \n90-min Caffeine Delay (timestamp): https://youtu.be/iw97uvIge7c?feature=shared&t=3224\n\nPeople Mentioned\nDoug Zembiec: wrestler, Major USMC: https://bit.ly/3W7CB3B\nJohn Ripley: Colonel USMC, Dong Ha Bridge: https://nyti.ms/3xrj5EN\nMike Martin: SEAL Master Chief, Vietnam War: https://bit.ly/3TMCY0E\nBritt Slabinski: Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator, SEAL: https://bit.ly/4aIaoUJ\nThomas Valentine: Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator, SEAL: https://bit.ly/49sI87L\nAdam Brown: Chief Petty Officer, SEAL: https://bit.ly/4d1bqgT\nPaul Bucha: Captain US Army, Vietnam War: https://bit.ly/3TNm2XJ\nSir Charles Sherrington: Nobel Prize in Physiology: https://bit.ly/3VPUL9D\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Coleman Ruiz\n00:01:55 Sponsors: BetterHelp, Maui Nui Venison & Eight Sleep\n00:06:06 Childhood, “Wildness”\n00:13:24 Wrestling, Combat Sports & Respect\n00:22:26 Divorce, College Applications & Naval Academy\n00:29:51 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:22 Prep School, Patriotism, Fear\n00:40:08 Growth Mindset, 24-Hour Horizon\n00:43:02 Naval Academy, Mentor, Focus\n00:52:45 Wife, Work Ethic\n00:59:23 Sponsor: Plunge\n01:00:51 Navy SEALs, BUD/S, Hell Week\n01:04:51 BUD/S Success Predictors; Divorce & Aloneness; Rebellion\n01:16:30 Patriotism, Navy SEALs, Green Team\n01:22:15 Advanced Training, Tier One, Free-Fall\n01:26:13 Special Operations, Deaths & Grief\n01:36:08 Mentor Death & Facing Mortality\n01:47:49 Warriors & Compassion; Trauma, Family\n01:52:37 Civilian Life Adjustment\n01:57:39 Hero With a Thousand Faces, Civilian Return & PTSD\n02:07:03 Massage, Perspective, Space-Time Bridging\n02:14:10 Psychedelics, Connection, Warrior Culture\n02:19:15 Rock Bottom: Talk Therapy, Depression, Alcohol\n02:25:50 Emotional & Physical Pain, Vulnerability, Fighter Mentality \n02:30:42 Suicide, Asking For Help & Support\n02:38:32 Therapy, PTSD Recovery, Dread; Pharmacology\n02:44:54 Healing Process: Unsatisfaction & Asking For Help\n02:54:03 Daily Routine, Movement, Nutrition\n03:02:22 Manhood, Range, Parenthood, Surrender\n03:10:08 Current Pursuits\n03:16:01 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

I also discuss peptide sourcing, dosages, cycling, routes of administration, and how peptides work in combination. \n\nThis episode will help you better understand the rapidly expanding landscape of peptide therapeutics and how to evaluate if specific peptides might be advantageous towards achieving your physical or mental health goals.\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode: https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/NOL4NN0X\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nJournal Articles\nGastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 accelerates healing of transected rat Achilles tendon and in vitro stimulates tendocytes growth: https://bit.ly/3TYHRoB\nGastric pentadecapeptide body protection compound BPC 157 and its role in accelerating musculoskeletal soft tissue healing: https://bit.ly/3xcwRLc\nModulatory effects of BPC 157 on vasomotor tone and the activation of Src-Caveolin-1-endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway: https://go.nature.com/43DYYz2\nStable Gastric Pentadecapeptide BPC 157 and Wound Healing: https://bit.ly/3J0sS77\nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1): a growth hormone: https://bit.ly/43WpDaN\nMK-677, an Orally Active Growth Hormone Secretagogue, Reverses Diet-Induced Catabolism1: https://bit.ly/3PInRnA\nTwo-Month Treatment of Obese Subjects with the Oral Growth Hormone (GH) Secretagogue MK-677 Increases GH Secretion, Fat-Free Mass, and Energy Expenditure: https://bit.ly/3PJKrfB\nKisspeptin signalling and its roles in humans: https://bit.ly/4cBfMeh\nAge-Related Changes of the Pineal Gland in Humans: A Digital Anatomo-Histological Morphometric Study on Autopsy Cases with Comparison to Predigital-Era Studies: https://bit.ly/3TGYzHv\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Natalie Crawford: Female Hormone Health, Fertility & Vitality: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-natalie-crawford-female-hormone-health-fertility-vitality \nDr. Michael Eisenberg: Improving Male Sexual Health, Function & Fertility: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-michael-eisenberg-improving-male-sexual-health-function-fertility \nThe Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Peptides\n00:03:20 Sponsors: Mateína, Levels & Joovv \n00:07:44 What is a Peptide?, Effects\n00:12:06 Peptide Sourcing, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\n00:14:48 Rejuvenation & Tissue Repair: BPC-157, Angiogenesis\n00:21:50 BPC-157 & Tissue Injury; Mode of Delivery\n00:27:53 BPC-157: Safety, Doses, Cycling, Tumor Risk\n00:35:16 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:43 Tissue Repair: Thymosin Beta-4, TB-500\n00:40:49 Growth & Metabolism: Growth Hormone, IGF-1, Risks\n00:45:25 Secretagogues, Sermorelin, Tesamorelin, CJC-1295\n00:52:21 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:53:44 Ipamorelin, Hexarelin, GHRP-3, MK-677; Risks & Timing\n00:58:69 Peptides for Growth Hormone & IGF-1, Risk; Combinations & Dosing\n01:06:12 Longevity: Thymosin Beta-4, Epitalon (Epithalon)\n01:12:09 Vitality: Melanotan, PT-141 (Vyleesi), Risks\n01:17:21 Vitality: Kisspeptin\n01:21:46 Peptides, Potential Benefits, Side-Effects & Risks\n01:24:19 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Asi Wind. He's one of the world’s top magicians and mentalists. \n\nWe discuss what magic and mentalism reveal about the human mind, including how memories are made, how to erase them, and how and why we perceive things the way we do, all in the context of how he performs his astonishing tricks. \n\nAsi explains that magic works because it involves storytelling, which is key to how we organize memories. He also explains how emotional connection allows people to co-create and believe a common narrative, even one that did not actually occur. \n\nWe also discuss how Asi's love of painting and photography and his specific daily routine allow him to access creativity. We also discuss fear, perfectionism, and how feeling emotions deeply serves his craft. \n\nWhether you are interested in magic or not, this conversation with Asi will give you an incredible window into how you perceive, learn, and remember the world around you and how what you believe may or may not be based in reality. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nAsi Wind\nWebsite: https://www.asiwind.com \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@asiwind \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asiwind \nX: https://twitter.com/asiwind \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AsiWindsIncrediblyHuman \nBefore We Begin (book): https://bit.ly/3TxN9Wt\nMasterclass: https://bit.ly/43vdsBk\n\nAsi Wind Clips\nPenn & Teller: Fool Us: https://youtu.be/fg0CC99hVK8\nSalt and Pepper Trick: https://youtu.be/aEg3bKYiaGI\nInvisible Die Card Trick: https://youtu.be/OrLpp6I_YM8\nKelly Clarkson: https://youtu.be/BNAd_HoYtAo\nThe View: https://youtu.be/YaVneB7YCus\n\nOther Resources\nThe Magic Castle: https://bit.ly/3IQH9mR \nKarl Deisseroth on Lex Fridman Podcast: https://bit.ly/43EqVqz\nThinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman: https://amzn.to/3Tzsph8\nEpicly Later’d: The John Cardiel Story: https://youtu.be/xSESz6oU4Ss\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind: https://youtu.be/w9MXqXBZy9U \nRick Rubin: How to Access Your Creativity: https://youtu.be/ycOBZZeVeAc\nDr. David Spiegel: Using Hypnosis to Enhance Mental & Physical Health & Performance: https://youtu.be/PctD-ki8dCc\nChris Voss: How to Succeed at Hard Conversations: https://youtu.be/q8CHXefn7B4\n\nPeople Mentioned\nDavid Blaine: illusionist, magician: https://davidblaine.com\nAvner the Eccentric: magician, clown, mime: https://bit.ly/3Tqvpwi\nFranco Pascali: magician, cardist: https://bit.ly/3TElMdI\nJuan Tamariz: Spanish magician: https://nyti.ms/3Tz8qz4\nTommy Wonder: Dutch magician: https://youtu.be/AgteMZ8qnog\nChan Canasta: Polish mentalist: https://bit.ly/3TN5vEr\nLucian Freud: English painter: https://bit.ly/3TMFmFE\nAndrew Wyeth: American realist painter: https://mo.ma/3Twm0mT\nVincent van Gogh: Dutch painter: https://bit.ly/3TyZFoU\nMark Rothko: American painter: https://bit.ly/4crUkZ3\nBevil Conway: researcher, senses and perception: https://bit.ly/4cohAax\nChuck Close: American painter: https://bit.ly/3TxPO2x\nJohn Cardiel: skateboarder: https://www.instagram.com/johncardiel\nHenri Matisse: French artist: https://bit.ly/4ctyTH6\nLaura Alexander: American artist: https://bit.ly/3VxBklL\nHarry Lorayne: American magician: https://bit.ly/4cvHMjf\nHernri Cartier-Bresson: French photographer: https://bit.ly/3vhlnpp\nJohn Graham: magician, mentalist: https://bit.ly/3TuhZzj\nDoug McKenzie: magician, mentalist: https://bit.ly/43tIDwV\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Asi Wind\n00:02:48 Sponsors: LMNT, BetterHelp & AeroPress\n00:07:07 “Jazzy Magic”, Tricks & Improvisation, Memory\n00:14:57 Magic & Imagination\n00:24:06 Memory “Experiments”\n00:29:18 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:46 Reality Augmentation, Free Will\n00:35:31 Audience Interactions & Connection, Empathy, Tool: Breathing\n00:41:20 Audience, Empathetic Attunement & Connection; Skeptics\n00:49:10 Trick Explanation, Props\n00:57:21 Exposing Magic, Misdirection, Storytelling\n01:07:29 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:36 Delight, Hypnosis, Behavior Patterns\n01:17:35 Hypnotists & Guiding Attention; Social Media\n01:23:01 “Power of Pauses” & Memory; Tool: Gap Effects & Learning\n01:30:14 Tension, Understanding Magic\n01:36:16 Storytelling\n01:43:00 Painting & Composition\n01:51:08 Truths, Clean Slate, Art & Storytelling\n01:59:03 Art & Motivation, Honesty\n02:05:17 Inspiration & Creativity, “Sponge”\n02:12:38 Morning Routine & Creativity\n02:19:28 Memory & Fear, Power of Story; Tool: Walking & Creativity\n02:29:53 Body Language\n02:33:01 Perfectionism; Negative Emotions, Photography\n02:40:19 Sensitivity, Empathy, Family\n02:45:16 Incredibly Human Show\n02:49:22 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. E.J. Chichilnisky, Ph.D., a professor of neurosurgery and ophthalmology at Stanford University. He studies how we see and uses that information to build artificial eyes that restore vision to the blind. \n\nWe discuss how understanding the retina (the light-sensing brain tissue that lines the back of our eyes) is critical to knowing how our brain works more generally. \n\nWe discuss brain augmentation with biologically informed prostheses, robotics, and AI and what this means for medicine and humanity. \n\nWe also discuss E.J.’s unique journey into neuroscience and how changing fields multiple times, combined with some wandering, taught him how to guide his decision-making in all realms of life. \n\nThis episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in learning how the brain works from a world-class neuroscientist, those interested in the future of brain therapeutics and people seeking inspiration and tools for navigating their own professional and life journey.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. E.J.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss placebo and belief and mindset effects — all of which exert a powerful and real influence on our biology and psychology. I discuss how your beliefs and expectation that a certain outcome will occur after taking a substance (or any intervention cause genuine changes in brain and bodily function. I discuss how placebos can change neurotransmitter and hormone release, pain levels, whether the stress response is beneficial or detrimental and more. I also explain how placebo effects can work with traditional drug or behavioral treatments to help improve health outcomes and why some people are more susceptible to placebo effects. By the end of the episode, listeners will understand the placebo effect, how it works, and how beliefs and mindsets can be leveraged toward mental health, physical health, and performance goals. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX (formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nJournal Articles\nExpectation and Dopamine Release: Mechanism of the Placebo Effect in Parkinson's Disease: https://bit.ly/3IrhjWc\nConscious Expectation and Unconscious Conditioning in Analgesic, Motor, and Hormonal Placebo/Nocebo Responses: https://bit.ly/49TSlKY\nImpact of brand or generic labeling on medication effectiveness and side effects: https://bit.ly/3IkUWSn\nDEMONSTRATION TO MEDICAL STUDENTS OF PLACEBO RESPONSES AND NON-DRUG FACTORS: https://bit.ly/3IofHws\nEffect of capsule colour and order of administration of hypnotic treatments: https://bit.ly/3TiZG1k\nEffect of colour of drugs: systematic review of perceived effect of drugs and of their effectiveness: https://bit.ly/3P4vF2G\nDo medical devices have enhanced placebo effects?: https://bit.ly/3P4vJPY\nPlacebo Effects in Oncology: https://bit.ly/3TkNOMc\nActive Albuterol or Placebo, Sham Acupuncture, or No Intervention in Asthma: https://bit.ly/3T4Kfsf\nNicotine-related beliefs induce dose-dependent responses in the human brain: https://go.nature.com/3V15yNM\nMind over milkshakes: Mindsets, not just nutrients, determine ghrelin response: https://bit.ly/42ZKnhe\nMind-Set Matters: Exercise and the Placebo Effect: https://bit.ly/3IkV7Nx\nA central master driver of psychosocial stress responses in the rat: https://bit.ly/3uJSBgU\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nNicotine's Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/nicotines-effects-on-the-brain-and-body-and-how-to-quit-smoking-or-vaping \nDr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-alia-crum-science-of-mindsets-for-health-performance \n\nPeople Mentioned\nIvan Pavlov: physiologist, developed the conditioned reflex concept: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1904/pavlov/biographical\nTed Kaptchuk: Harvard, professor of medicine, studies placebo effects: https://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/ted-jack-kaptchuk\nAlia Crum: Stanford, professor of psychology, studies mindset and belief effects: https://profiles.stanford.edu/alia-crum\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Placebo Effects\n00:02:40 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, AeroPress & Levels\n00:07:24 Placebo, Nocebo vs. Belief Effect, Prefrontal Cortex\n00:14:03 Dopamine, Placebo & Parkinson’s Disease; Placebo Controls \n00:21:36 Hormone Release & Placebo Effect, Paired Associations\n00:28:52 Conditioning Effect & Insulin; Pavlovian Response\n00:32:50 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:17 Context & Expectations; Placebo Effect & Brain\n00:40:51 Cancer, Mind-Body Practices; Placebo Effects & Limits\n00:44:54 Asthma, Specificity & Placebo Effects\n00:48:01 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:49:03 Nicotine & Dose-Dependent Placebo Effects\n00:55:31 Placebo Effects vs. Belief Effects, Food & Mindset\n01:01:02 Exercise & Belief Effects\n01:04:08 Placebo Effect, Brain & Stress Response\n01:11:18 Individual Variation, Genetics & Placebo Effect\n01:16:11 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Placebo\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Welcome to a special edition of the 16th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium, recorded in Sydney, Australia. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\n\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\n\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.\n\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-16-sleep-vertigo-tbi-ocd-tips-for-travelers-gut-brain-axis-more\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:02:34 Achieving Key Health Pillars While Traveling\n00:07:11 Improving Sleep Quality\n00:13:11 Understanding and Managing Vertigo\n00:20:44 Enhancing Brain Function Post-TBI\n00:26:58 Getting Closer to Unraveling OCD\n00:30:44 Adjusting Circadian Rhythms for Travel\n00:34:58 Optimal Dosage for Fish Oil Supplements\n00:40:17 Monitoring Hormone Levels\n00:46:09 Optimizing the Gut-Brain Axis\n00:52:04 Best Practices for Tongue Cleaning\n00:56:36 Conclusion & Thank You\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AMA\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Becky Kennedy, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, bestselling author, and founder of Good Inside, an education platform for parents and parents-to-be. We discuss actionable protocols for raising resilient, emotionally healthy kids and effective alternatives to typical forms of reward and punishment that instead teach children valuable skills and strengthen the parent-child bond. These protocols also apply to other types of relationships: professional, romantic, friendships, siblings, etc. \n\nWe explain how to respond to emotional outbursts, rudeness, and entitlement, repair fractured relationships, build self-confidence, and improve interpersonal connections with empathy while maintaining healthy boundaries. \n\nWe also discuss how to effectively communicate with children and adults with ADHD, anxiety, learning challenges, or with “deeply feeling” individuals. \n\nThe conversation is broadly applicable to all types of social interactions and bonds. By the end of the episode, you will have learned simple yet powerful tools to build healthy relationships with kids, teens, adults, and oneself.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMateína: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Becky Kennedy\nGood Inside website: https://www.goodinside.com \nTED talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_kennedy_the_single_most_important_parenting_strategy \nGood Inside book: https://www.goodinside.com/book\nPodcast: https://www.goodinside.com/podcast\nNewsletter:  https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drbeckyatgoodinside \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@drbeckyatgoodinside \n\nJournal Articles\nThe tenacious brain: How the anterior mid-cingulate contributes to achieving goals: https://bit.ly/48p5SZW\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: How to Understand Emotions: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-lisa-feldman-barrett-how-to-understand-emotions \nThe Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body \n\nPeople Mentioned\nGabor Maté: physician and author: https://drgabormate.com\nRonald Fairburn: psychiatrist and psychoanalyst: https://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/ronald-fairbairn\nJames Hollis: Jungian psychoanalyst and author: https://jameshollis.net/welcome.htm\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Becky Kennedy\n00:02:44 Sponsors: Mateína, Joovv & AeroPress\n00:07:35 Healthy Relationships: Sturdiness, Boundaries & Empathy\n00:14:34 Tool: Establishing Boundaries\n00:18:24 Rules, Boundaries & Connection\n00:22:19 Rewards & Punishments; Skill Building\n00:29:48 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:16 Kids & Inherent Good\n00:34:06 Family Jobs, Validation & Confidence, Giving Hope\n00:41:54 Rewards, Pride\n00:44:48 Tool: “I Believe You”, Confidence & Safety; Other Relationships\n00:52:15 Trauma, Aloneness & Repair\n00:57:07 Tool: Repair & Apologies, Rejecting Apology\n01:01:04 Tool: Good Apologies\n01:03:35 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:04:37 Tool: Rudeness & Disrespect, Most Generous Interpretation\n01:12:32 Walking on Eggshells, Pilot Analogy & Emotional Outbursts, Sturdy Leadership\n01:20:49 Deeply Feeling Kids; Fears, Sensory Overload\n01:30:10 Co-Parenting Differences & Punishment\n01:37:11 Tool: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); Meditation\n01:41:20 Tool: Tolerating Frustration, Screen Time, Learning\n01:51:57 Grace & Parenthood, Parenting Job Description; Relationship to Self\n01:55:24 Tool: “I’m Noticing”, Asking Questions; Emotional Regulation\n02:01:15 Adolescence & Critical Needs, Explorers vs. Nomads\n02:09:58 Saying “I Love You”, Teenagers; Family Meetings\n02:15:07 Self-Care, Rage & Boundaries; Sturdy Leaders; Parent Relationship & Conflict\n02:22:08 Tool: Wayward Teens, Marijuana & Substance Use, Getting Additional Help\n02:30:03 Mentors\n02:34:26 Tool: Entitlement, Fear & Frustration\n02:41:57 Tool: Experiencing Frustration; Chores & Allowance\n02:46:31 Good Inside Platform\n02:51:27 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Parenting #Relationships\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols.

    "description": "Dubbed by ElevenLabs\n\nThe new Huberman Lab episode is all about oral health. It covers everything from brushing and flossing, as well as how to repair cavities without drilling (which depends on how deep they are into the tooth, of course), as well as the oral microbiome, which is critical for whole body health, gum health, the legitimate concerns of being a mouth breather, especially during sleep, and much more.\n\nResearching this episode has led me to significantly revamp my oral health protocols. The good news is all of them are easy, take a limited amount of time, and are either zero cost or will save you costs.\n\nMany of the suggested protocols from experts are counterintuitive. The field of oral health has undergone significant strides in recent years, and the episode reflects the latest.\n\nThis Short is dubbed in German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Polish, and Portuguese.

I cover the best approaches and timing for brushing and flossing, tongue, gum, and oral microbiome care and how oral health is critically important to offset metabolic, cardiac, and brain diseases, including dementia. I also discuss proper nutrition for oral health, fluoride, and how sugar and mouth breathing can accelerate tooth decay.

We discuss the neural circuit basis of social interactions and loneliness. We also discuss how animals and people establish themselves in a group hierarchy by rank and how the brain responds to dominance and subordination. \n\nMuch of our discussion relates to how social media impacts our sense of social connectedness or lack thereof. The topics covered in this episode are directly relevant to anyone interested in the neuroscience of mental health, work-life balance, abundance versus scarcity mindset, and interpersonal dynamics.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Kay Tye\nAcademic profile: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/kay-tye\nLab website: https://tyelab.org \nHHMI profile: https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/kay-tye \nPublications: https://tyelab.org/publications\nTED talk: https://www.ted.com/speakers/kay_tye \nX: https://twitter.com/kaymtye \n\nJournal Articles\nInput-specific control of reward and aversion in the ventral tegmental area: https://go.nature.com/3ubT3nT\nExtraneous factors in judicial decisions: https://bit.ly/3SLZiqL\nTotal social isolation in monkeys: https://bit.ly/4bmL1Jo\nDorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent the Experience of Social Isolation: https://bit.ly/4bAKtjk\nNeural mechanisms of social homeostasis: https://bit.ly/3OvNGXp\nThe neural circuitry of social homeostasis: Consequences of acute versus chronic social isolation: https://bit.ly/48WjRYa\nCortical ensembles orchestrate social competition through hypothalamic outputs: https://go.nature.com/4bmL73I\n\nOther Resources\nThe Eisenhower Matrix: How to prioritize your to-do list: https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix \nChimp Empire (Netflix series): https://www.netflix.com/title/81311783 \nAdvice for a Young Investigator: https://amzn.to/3HO6tJU\nNIH Human Connectome Project (HCP): https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/human-connectome/connectome-programs \n\nPeople Mentioned\nS.M.: patient with bilateral amygdala damage: https://w.wiki/5N3g\nHarry Harlow: Psychologist, known for his social isolation experiments in monkeys: https://w.wiki/9562\nMarkus Meister: Professor of Biological Science at Caltech: https://bit.ly/3Osn3Ta\nBen Barres: Neuroscientist at Stanford: https://stan.md/3HMBxtl\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Kay Tye\n00:02:39 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & LMNT\n00:06:40 Amygdala; “Valence” \n00:12:43 Novelty; Reward & Punishment Response\n00:20:06 Amygdala & Hunger; Social Interaction\n00:26:21 Social Media & Social Connection; Tool: Email & Time Management\n00:35:03 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:30 Social Media; Friction & Feedback, Leadership\n00:43:44 Social Isolation, Harlow Experiments, “Loneliness Neurons”\n00:51:47 Social Homeostasis, COVID-19 Pandemic & Loneliness\n01:01:29 Quality of Social Contact, Social Homeostasis, Social Media\n01:08:40 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:09:42 Social Media, Relationships; Social Isolation & Exclusion\n01:18:26 Empathy: Friend vs. Foe\n01:28:40 Background & Empathy, Diversity, Emotional Regulation\n01:34:34 Abundance vs. Scarcity Mindset\n01:37:22 Social Rank & Hierarchy, Sibling Order, Development\n01:45:54 Dynamic Hierarchy; Dominants vs. Subordinates; Mentors\n01:55:32 Psychedelics: Research & Mechanisms; Psilocybin \n02:06:28 Work-Life Balance, Fitness & Extracurriculars\n02:11:56 Personal Life, Diversity, Happiness; Typical Day\n02:15:42 Science & Academia; Future Directions\n02:23:48 Research & Science Outreach\n02:28:48 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Emotions\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss working memory, which is critical for learning and productivity, strategy setting, goal seeking, and navigating new environments. I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.\n\nI also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention—including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.\n\nThis episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMateina: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nBetterHelp:  https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\n*Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Journal Articles*\nWorking Memory Capacity Predicts Dopamine Synthesis Capacity in the Human Striatum: https://bit.ly/3UjmP4z\nInverted-U–Shaped Dopamine Actions on Human Working Memory and Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3UdfWBP\nCognitive Deficit Caused by Regional Depletion of Dopamine in Prefrontal Cortex of Rhesus Monkey: https://bit.ly/49g3yW5\nThe dopamine agonist bromocriptine differentially affects fronto-striatal functional connectivity during working memory: https://bit.ly/3SyMjcY\nIncreased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness: https://bit.ly/3QDfE53\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3HCniHC\nThe Effect of Binaural Beats on Visuospatial Working Memory and Cortical Connectivity: https://bit.ly/3SAFuHT\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/48QQjv8\n\n*Resources*\nNSDR: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u&feature=shared\nThe Science & Use of Cold Exposure for Health & Performance: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wqrjXIsYYT\n\n*Huberman Lab Episodes Mentioned*\nUnderstand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools: https://go.hubermanlab.com/miohHKRSYT\nADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XReodaB9YT\nAdderall, Stimulants & Modafinil for ADHD: Short- & Long-Term Effects: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VS83tuCgYT\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://go.hubermanlab.com/LgeyAbznYT\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WMwb80NkYT\n\n*People Mentioned*\nDonald Hebb: Psychologist, influential contributions to understanding of learning: https://bit.ly/4bbhXEx\nMark D’Esposito: Psychology Professor at the University of California, Berkeley: https://bit.ly/3vRcFhj\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Working Memory\n00:01:12 Sponsors: Mateina, BetterHelp & Helix Sleep\n00:05:00 Short- vs. Long-Term Memory\n00:09:59 Neuroplasticity\n00:15:42 Working Memory; Attention & Focus\n00:20:04 Working Memory Test\n00:25:35 Sponsor: AG1\n00:27:02 Brain & Working Memory; Dopamine\n00:36:13 Working Memory Capacity Test\n00:44:37 Increasing Dopamine & Working Memory\n00:49:26 Task Switching, Distractions\n00:54:42 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:56:04 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Dopamine\n01:03:08 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n01:11:02 Tool: Working Memory & Binaural Beats\n01:15:23 Supplements to Increase Dopamine: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n01:22:53 Dopamine Prescriptions, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\n01:29:12 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors,  Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Memory\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "This is an excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode with David Goggins.\n\nIt’s a brutally direct, mechanistic, and actionable discussion about how to embrace, confront, and control the dialogue in your mind — paying specific attention to the negative voices as a way to transmute all that into successful real-world behavior. Daily.\n\nOne thing is made clear: there is no way to avoid internal agony if your goal is to be the ultimate version of yourself.\n\nThe good news is that anyone can do it, but it requires going inward. Over and over again. David explains how.\n\nHe also explains how people get distracted by the observable things in others — choosing to point their fingers at others, criticize, focus on hacks, etc, as a way to avoid doing the real internal work for themselves.\n\nThe episode is a roadmap anyone can apply to better themselves, but only if they are willing to embrace the full reality of their deepest self-doubts, fears, shame, and darkness. As David explains, that’s the basement and the place from where true growth starts.\n\nWatch the full episode on YouTube: https://youtu.be/nDLb8_wgX50\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. \n\nI discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. \n\nThis episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.\n\nCorrection: I misspoke in the episode. A micron is 1/10,000 of a centimeter, not 1,000. Additionally, 1 millimeter equals 1/10 of a centimeter, not 1/100.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nArticles\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://bit.ly/3Lo5kK6\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wIjg4eIiYT\nAlterations in Oral–Nasal–Pharyngeal Microbiota and Salivary Proteins in Mouth-Breathing Children: https://go.hubermanlab.com/pww3thWHYT\nHuman nasal microbiota: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XWfDZyZBYT\nHow (and why) the immune system makes us sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/TL09NaWxYT\nThe compelling link between physical activity and the body's defense system: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XXvkR83eYT\nThe effects of a single and a series of Finnish sauna sessions on the immune response and HSP-70 levels in trained and untrained men: https://go.hubermanlab.com/0uiWBVO5YT\nRetracted: Extra Dose of Vitamin C Based on a Daily Supplementation Shortens the Common Cold: A Meta-Analysis of 9 Randomized Controlled Trials: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WxCUtZmXYT\nVitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data: https://go.hubermanlab.com/POdJvqscYT\nAttenuation of influenza-like symptomatology and improvement of cell-mediated immunity with long-term N-acetylcysteine treatment: https://go.hubermanlab.com/TLcxQb74YT\n\nBooks\nJaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic: https://amzn.to/3TUXc9Z\n\nOther Resources\nNon-sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u&feature=shared\nToolkit for Sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/AEUHya3EYT\nFoundational Fitness Protocol: https://go.hubermanlab.com/fyv8uNAsYT\nDr. Roger Seheult (YouTube): https://youtu.be/fZ8rqZK_RiA\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Noam Sobel: How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior: https://youtu.be/cS7cNaBrkxo\nSleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing: https://youtu.be/h2aWYjSA1Jc\nHow to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health: https://youtu.be/15R2pMqU2ok\nTools for Managing Stress & Anxiety: https://youtu.be/ntfcfJ28eiU\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health: https://youtu.be/ouCWNRvPk20\nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health: https://youtu.be/q1Ss8sTbFBY\nUsing Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System: https://youtu.be/poOf8b2WE2g\nGuest Series with Dr. Andy Galpin: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4N_PVVoq0Za03YKASSGCazr\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Avoid Colds & Flu\n00:01:58 Sponsors: Joovv, Helix Sleep & ROKA\n00:06:00 Common Cold: Source & Transmission; Cold Temperature Myth\n00:13:48 Spreading a Cold; Symptoms & Contagious Myths\n00:17:43 Flu Virus & Transmission; Flu Shots\n00:23:56 Tools: Injections & Safety; Charting Health Trends & Sickness\n00:27:16 Sponsor: AG1\n00:28:44 Spreading Cold & Flu, Symptoms\n00:30:43 Immune System, Physical Barriers\n00:39:33 Tool: Social Connection & Touch, Avoiding Flu & Cold\n00:45:14 Innate Immune System\n00:53:13 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:54:15 Adaptive Immune System; Lymphatic System\n01:00:19 Tools: Enhance Innate Immune System\n01:06:19 Tool: Microbiome & Nasal Breathing\n01:10:58 Tools: Enhance Gut Microbiome: Foods & Water Protocol\n01:16:13 Exercise When Feeling Sick?, Sleep\n01:21:39 Tool: Exercise & Preventing Sickness\n01:28:13 Exercise When Sleep Deprived?\n01:32:24 Tool: Exercise Recovery & Carbohydrates\n01:34:52 Tool: Sauna & Enhance Immune System\n01:42:20 Supplements: Vitamin C, Vitamin D\n01:50:58 Echinacea, Zinc\n01:55:08 N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Decongestants\n02:03:42 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Welcome to a special edition of the 14th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\n\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\n\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.\n\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-14-2023-philanthropy-evening-routine-light-therapy-health-metrics-more\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:34 2023 Scientific Research Contributions\n00:07:07 Anterior Mid Cingulate Cortex Studies: Discussion on Research & Findings\n00:12:32 Evening Routines and Light: Insights on Managing Light Exposure Before Sleep\n00:21:26 Light Therapy in Northern Regions: Tips for Coping With Limited Morning Light\n00:28:48 Annual Health and Fitness Metrics: Key Metrics to Monitor Yearly\n00:39:59 Dealing With Midnight Wakefulness: Strategies for Falling Back Asleep\n00:46:41 Strength Training for Women: Protocols for Strength Without Hypertrophy\n00:50:56 Full Body Scan MRIs: Evaluating the Benefits and Usage\n00:55:07 Dog Wellness and Communication: Potential Exploration Into Canine Well-Being\n00:56:17 Balancing Muscle Strength: Strategies for Equalizing Arm Strength\n01:00:54 Content on Children's Development: Future Plans and Current Resources\n01:03:23 Conclusion & Thank You\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AMA\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the “calories in- calories out” (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-lustig-how-sugar-processed-foods-impact-your-health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Robert Lustig\nWebsite: https://robertlustig.com \nBooks: https://robertlustig.com/books\nPublications: https://robertlustig.com/publications\nBlog: https://robertlustig.com/blog\nUCSF academic profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robert.lustig \nMetabolical (book): https://amzn.to/48mNhOE\nSugarScience: http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu \nX: https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrRobertLustig\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-lustig-8904245 \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertlustigmd \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@robertlustigmd \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robert Lustig\n00:02:02 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & AeroPress\n00:06:41 Calories, Fiber\n00:12:15 Calories, Protein & Fat, Trans Fats\n00:18:23 Carbohydrate Calories, Glucose vs. Fructose, Fruit, Processed Foods\n00:26:43 Fructose, Mitochondria & Metabolic Health\n00:31:54 Trans Fats; Food Industry & Language \n00:35:33 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:04 Glucose, Insulin, Muscle\n00:42:31 Insulin & Cell Growth vs. Burn; Oxygen & Cell Growth, Cancer\n00:51:14 Glucose vs. Fructose, Uric Acid; “Leaky Gut” & Inflammation\n01:00:51 Supporting the Gut Microbiome, Fasting\n01:04:13 Highly Processed Foods, Sugars; “Price Elasticity” & Food Industry\n01:10:28 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:11:51 Processed Foods & Added Sugars\n01:14:19 Sugars, High-Fructose Corn Syrup\n01:18:16 Food Industry & Added Sugar, Personal Responsibility, Public Health\n01:30:04 Obesity, Diabetes, “Hidden” Sugars\n01:34:57 Diet, Insulin & Sugars\n01:38:20 Tools: NOVA Food Classification; Perfact Recommendations\n01:43:46 Meat & Metabolic Health, Eggs, Fish\n01:46:44 Sources of Omega-3s; Vitamin C & Vitamin D\n01:52:37 Tool: Reduce Inflammation; Sugars, Cortisol & Stress\n01:59:12 Food Industry, Big Pharma & Government; Statins\n02:06:55 Public Health Shifts, Rebellion, Sugar Tax, Hidden Sugars\n02:12:58 Real Food Movement, Public School Lunches & Processed Foods\n02:18:25 3 Fat Types & Metabolic Health; Sugar, Alcohol & Stress\n02:26:40 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners, Insulin & Weight Gain\n02:34:32 Re-Engineering Ultra-Processed Food\n02:38:45 Sugar & Addiction, Caffeine\n02:45:18 GLP-1, Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Tirzepatide), Risks; Big Pharma \n02:57:39 Obesity & Sugar Addiction; Brain Re-Mapping, Insulin & Leptin Resistance\n03:03:31 Fructose & Addiction, Personal Responsibility & Tobacco\n03:07:27 Food Choices: Fruit, Rice, Tomato Sauce, Bread, Meats, Fermented Foods\n03:12:54 Intermittent Fasting, Diet Soda, Food Combinations, Fiber, Food Labels\n03:19:14 Improving Health, Advocacy, School Lunches, Hidden Sugars\n03:26:55 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors,  Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Nutrition\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Karen Parker, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and director of the Social Neurosciences Research Program at Stanford University School of Medicine. We discuss the biology of social connections and bonding in babies, children and adults. Dr. Parker explains our current understanding of autism and autism spectrum disorders: what they are, why the incidence of autism has increased so dramatically in recent years and both the current and emerging treatments for autism. We also discuss the condition formerly called “Asperger’s.” This episode ought to be highly relevant for anyone interested in child and human development, how social bonds form, and to those curious about autism and other spectrum conditions.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Karen Parker\nStanford academic profile: https://stan.md/3RjIkyY \nParker Lab website: https://stan.md/3NicqBV\nPublications: https://stan.md/3RkO5N1\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-parker-52485 \n\nJournal Articles\nPrenatal exposure to ultrasound waves impacts neuronal migration in mice: https://go.hubermanlab.com/ptyyU8HyYT\nLancet retracts 12-year-old article linking autism to MMR vaccines: https://go.hubermanlab.com/dsvVI1uTYT\nMother love: what turns it on?: https://go.hubermanlab.com/pdgfu9CEYT\nIntranasal oxytocin treatment for social deficits and biomarkers of response in children with autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/a8XJjHAVYT\nIntranasal Oxytocin in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: https://go.hubermanlab.com/roEfpTB5YT\nThe effect of oxytocin nasal spray on social interaction in young children with autism: a randomized clinical trial: https://go.hubermanlab.com/JF1DoSnWYT\nAutism-associated biomarkers: test–retest reliability and relationship to quantitative social trait variation in rhesus monkeys: https://go.hubermanlab.com/lw3BnJ47YT\nEarly Predictors of Impaired Social Functioning in Male Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta): https://go.hubermanlab.com/mGm2a7KEYT\nCerebrospinal fluid vasopressin and symptom severity in children with autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/vKY2h2EVYT\nA randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial shows that intranasal vasopressin improves social deficits in children with autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/CpRAxmCsYT\nProbiotic Therapy with Lactobacillus reuteri Rescues Social and Emotional Recognition Behavior in an Environmental Mouse Model of Autism: https://go.hubermanlab.com/5gXuKmcXYT\nOxytocin and the microbiome: https://go.hubermanlab.com/dsP3pfl8YT\nBalovaptan vs Placebo for Social Communication in Childhood Autism Spectrum Disorder: https://go.hubermanlab.com/8bT6VLhWYT\n\nArticles & Other Resources\nMAPS “Can Ecstasy [MDMA] Treat Autism?”: https://maps.org/news/media/can-ecstasy-treat-autism\nDr. Robert Malenka: How Your Brain's Reward Circuits Drive Your Choices (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-malenka-how-your-brains-reward-circuits-drive-your-choices \nAutism Speaks: https://www.autismspeaks.org \nChimp Empire (Netflix): https://www.netflix.com/title/81311783 \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Karen Parker\n00:01:30 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT & Aero Press\n00:06:25 Autism, Frequency, Diagnosis\n00:10:41 Early Interventions; Heritability & Autistic Traits\n00:13:00 Autistic Spectrums; Studying Autism\n00:21:29 Environment, Risk Factors & In Utero Development\n00:29:55 Sponsor: AG1\n00:31:26 Oxytocin, Vasopressin, Social Behavior & Parent-Child Bonding\n00:43:24 Oxytocin in Humans; Social Features of Autism, Intranasal Oxytocin\n00:54:14 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:55:16 Oxytocin & Autism; Benefit & Risks\n01:06:30 Neuroplasticity & Autism; Early Intervention; Challenges of Early Diagnosis\n01:14:30 MDMA & Autism\n01:17:05 Vasopressin, Social Interaction; Voles & Parenthood\n01:27:07 Human Social Connection, Oxytocin Levels & Autism\n01:33:45 Primate Model of Social Impairment\n01:42:47 Preclinical Animal Models, Mouse & Primates\n01:47:11 Primates, Biomarkers & Social Connection; Vasopressin\n01:52:20 Vasopressin Levels & Autism, Children & In Utero\n02:03:06 Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) & Vasopressin; Urination; Alternative Therapies\n02:10:32 Intranasal Vasopressin, Children, Autism & Social Responsiveness\n02:19:15 Vasopressin & Social Connection, Mechanism & Future Studies\n02:26:35 Gut Microbiome & Vasopressin; Scientific Funding\n02:34:52 Vasopressin Pathways, Social Behavior, Autism\n02:43:00 Vaccine Theory & Autism; Immunology\n02:54:06 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Autism\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Robert Greene, multiple New York Times bestselling author and expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society. We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one’s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert’s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one’s relationship with the self, others and society. \n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our chat-based tool, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/e8qm6c\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Robert Greene*\nWebsite: https://powerseductionandwar.com \nBooks: https://amzn.to/3UnT3L6\nBlog: https://powerseductionandwar.com/blog \nFacebook: https://Facebook.com/48LawsofPowerbook\nX: https://twitter.com/RobertGreene \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertgreeneofficial \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@robertgreene \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@RobertGreeneOfficial\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Robert Greene\n00:01:58 Sponsors: ROKA, Helix Sleep & Waking Up \n00:05:56 Mastery (The Book), Purpose\n00:08:26 Finding Purpose, Childhood, Learning & Emotional Engagement\n00:18:00 Early Interests, Delight & Discovery\n00:22:50 Love vs. Hate Experiences & Learning\n00:28:25 Self-Awareness, Frustration, Excitation\n00:31:47 Sponsor: AG1\n00:33:18 Sublime Experiences, Real vs. False; Authenticity & Time\n00:43:57 Power & Relationships; Purpose & Mastery\n00:55:51 Seduction, Vulnerability, Childhood\n01:07:04 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:05 Power Dynamics & Romance; Equality, Love Sublime & Connection\n01:18:42 Vulnerability in Relationships, Creativity; Social Media, Justice\n01:29:45 Outrage, Control, “Art of Ignore”\n01:33:50 Masculinity & Femininity\n01:42:16 Picking Role Models; Purpose & Mentor Relationship\n01:51:07 “Alive” Thinking; Anxiety & Creativity \n01:58:55 Convergent Interests & Romantic Relationships\n02:07:19 Self-Awareness, Core Values & Romantic Relationships\n02:15:27 Non-Verbal Communication & Relationships\n02:24:58 Eyes, Voice, Intuition & Seduction\n02:28:38 Virtual World, Social Skills, Non-Verbal Communication\n02:32:19 Self-Awareness & Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nuance\n02:41:43 Human Brain, Plasticity\n02:45:18 Stroke & Near-Death Experiences, Self, Time\n02:55:49 Appreciation & Near-Death Experience, Urgency\n03:01:36 “Death Ground” & Urgency\n03:09:13 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #RobertGreene\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Dubbed by ElevenLabs\n\nIn this excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode \"How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance,\" I explain how to stop hiccups using a science-supported tool. Hiccups are caused by spasming of the phrenic nerve to diaphragm connection. Based on the way the phrenic nerve controls the diaphragm, you can stop that spasm by inhaling three times in a row with no exhales in between, then holding your breath for 15 to 30 seconds, and then slowly exhaling. \n\nDone correctly, this should eliminate hiccups the first time and every time, but if it's a severe spasm, you may have to repeat it a few times. All the other purported methods out there, such as drinking a glass of water backward, upside down, or scaring someone, etc., are all designed to adjust the pattern of diaphragmatic control by the brain. The technique described here actually does that.\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Adam Grant, Ph.D., a professor of organizational psychology at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in the science and practical steps for increasing motivation, maximizing and reaching our potential, and understanding how individuals and groups can best flourish. He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-adam-grant-how-to-unlock-your-potential-motivation-unique-abilities\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Adam Grant\nWebsite: https://adamgrant.net \nBooks: https://adamgrant.net/books\nPodcasts: https://adamgrant.net/podcasts\nAcademic profile: https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad\nTED Talk: “Are You a Giver or a Taker?”: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker \nTED Talk: “ The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers”: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamgrant \nX: https://twitter.com/adammgrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdamMGrant \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@adamgrant \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Adam Grant\n00:01:37 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & Waking Up\n00:05:56 Procrastination & Emotion; Curiosity\n00:14:06 Creativity & Procrastination; Motivation\n00:20:48 Intrinsic Motivation & Curiosity\n00:27:59 Tool: Tasks & Sense of Purpose\n00:30:52 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:34 Extrinsic Rewards, Choice; Social Media\n00:42:24 Tool: “Quiet Time” Protocol, Chronotypes\n00:49:20 Tool: Creativity: Mornings, Movement, Stillness\n00:57:05 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:58:14 Tools: Ideas & Filtering, Feedback & Opinions, Advice\n01:07:15 Tool: Constructive Criticism, “Second Score”; Verbs\n01:14:40 Tool: Growth Mindsets, Scaffolding; Job Innovation\n01:21:50 Tools: Task Sequencing & Intrinsic Motivation; Tapering & Frame of Reference\n01:30:03 Tools: Momentum, Confidence & Domains; Negative Thought Spirals\n01:36:16 Tool: Phone & “To Don’t” List; Writing Ideas\n01:39:54 Tool: Bias Blindspot, Reflected Best-Self Portrait\n01:45:36 Helping Others, Synthesizing Information\n01:50:24 Modes of Thinking, Blind Spots & Assumptions\n01:56:10 Thinking Like a Scientist: Hypothesis-Testing & Discourse, Social Media\n02:05:15 Tool: Authenticity, Sincerity & Etiquette, “Snapshot” & Online Presence\n02:12:49 Realizing Potential: Motivation, Opportunity & Process\n02:21:53 Skills to Realize Potential, Perfectionism\n02:27:52 Tool: Early Success & Performance Cycle, “Failure Budget”\n02:31:56 Future Projects, Complex Issues & Challenging Ideas\n02:40:10 Artistic Hobbies, Magicians\n02:45:55 Science Communication, Interest & Self-Relevance\n02:52:16 Languishing, Descriptive Language & Emotions\n03:00:09 Tool: Nurture Potential in Children, “Coach Effect”\n03:10:16 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #AdamGrant #Science\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In a recent Huberman Lab episode, my guest was Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator. During the episode, we discuss how the tone of speaking voice shapes the emotional tone of an entire conversation and why a low-frequency, calm voice creates a calm state in the listener and a calm, rational conversation.\n\nRegardless of whether your voice is high or low or somewhere in between, this information can be applied to have more effective conversations of all kinds.\n\nIt all boils down to how the neurons in the auditory cortex respond to low-frequency sounds — they essentially create a low-frequency oscillation pattern within the listener.\n\nThe episode also focuses on how to detect lies, the essential features of benevolent negotiations and more.\n\nWatch the full episode on YouTube: https://youtu.be/q8CHXefn7B4",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Natalie Crawford, MD, a double board-certified physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, fertility and reproductive health and host of the “As a Woman” podcast. We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman’s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Natalie Crawford\nAs a Woman podcast: https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/podcast \nWebsite: https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com \nFora Fertility clinical practice: https://www.forafertility.com \nPinnacle: https://pinnacle-conference.com \nCourses: https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/courses \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nataliecrawfordmd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/NatalieCrawfordMD  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nataliecrawfordmd \nX: https://twitter.com/ncrawfordmd \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nataliecrawfordmd \nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/nataliecrawfordmd\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-crawford-md-8a56021a0\n\nArticles\nOral contraceptive use in women changes preferences for male facial masculinity and is associated with partner facial masculinity: https://bit.ly/40Ecami\nIntake of protein-rich foods in relation to outcomes of infertility treatment with assisted reproductive technologies: https://bit.ly/47bjKXK\n\nOther Resources\nINVOcell Same-Sex Couple: https://bit.ly/479R4P4\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Natalie Crawford\n00:01:40 Sponsors: Maui Nui Venison & Helix Sleep; The Brain Body Contract\n00:04:59 Female Puberty & Growth Characteristics, Height\n00:13:27 Eggs & Ovulation, Harvesting Eggs, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)\n00:17:31 Endocrine Disruptors, Fetal Development\n00:21:39 Lavender, Tea Tree & Evening Primrose Oils, Scents, Diapers\n00:25:13 Breast Milk vs. Formula & Fertility\n00:26:04 Menstruation Cycle & Hormones, Timing\n00:34:08 Sponsor: AG1\n00:35:59 Estrogen, Progesterone & Menstrual Cycle\n00:38:08 Hormonal Birth Control & Ovarian Reserve, AMH Testing, Fertility\n00:42:42 Spermatogenesis & Testosterone; Heat: Ovaries vs Testes\n00:46:11 Period & Pregnancy, Conception Window\n00:48:56 Estrogen, Libido & Ovulation; Mittelschmerz\n00:51:33 Tool: Intercourse Timing & Conception; Artificial Insemination, IVF\n00:55:03 Egg/Sperm Quality, Cigarettes, Vaping, Cannabis & Alcohol \n01:02:20 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:29 Intrauterine Device (IUD), Depo-Provera & Fertility\n01:10:00 Birth Control Risks & Benefits, Cancers, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)\n01:19:39 Blood Clotting & Birth Control Pill; Health Screening \n01:24:50 Tool: AMH Testing, Ovarian Reserve, Antral Follicle Count Ultrasound\n01:29:55 IVF, In Vitro Maturation (IVM); Early Ovarian Reserve Screening\n01:35:40 Tools: Egg Freezing, IVF; Age & Egg Quality\n01:43:37 Egg Freezing & IVF Procedures, Maternal Age, Success Rates\n01:51:30 Tool: Sperm Freezing & Paternal Age, Vasectomy\n01:55:01 Hormones, Egg Freezing & IVF\n02:00:42 Three-Parent IVF, Mitochondrial DNA\n02:05:21 IVF Embryo Storage & Donation; Donor Education & Consent\n02:14:29 Autism, Developmental Disorders, IVF Babies, Age \n02:20:36 Tools: Sleep, Nutrition & Fertility; Dietary Fat\n02:27:32 Protein, Meat, Tofu, Fish; Sugar, Artificial Sweeteners; Weight & Miscarriage\n02:37:38 Tools: Supplements; Prenatal Vitamins, Omega 3s, Vitamin D, Coenzyme Q10\n02:42:26 L-Carnitine & Male Fertility; PCOS & Myo-inositol; Metformin\n02:47:11 Egg Retrieval, Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, Minimal Stimulation\n02:57:56 INVOcell\n03:03:12 Egg Freezing, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), Sperm Fragmentation\n03:11:45 Genetic Testing, IVF Transfer & Success Rate, Embryo Banking\n03:15:10 Menopause\n03:19:47 Hormone Replacement Therapy & Menopause\n03:22:25 Early-signs of Menopause\n03:25:18 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #HormoneHealth #Fertility\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "Mental Health Toolkit: Tools to Bolster Your Mood & Mental Health",
    "description": "In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the “Big 6” core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., a distinguished professor of psychology at Northeastern University and a world expert in the science of emotions. She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how the specificity of language impacts emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also share actionable tools to regulate feelings of uncertainty and to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode will interest anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\nWebsite: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com \nAcademic Profile: https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/lisa-barrett \n\"How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain\": https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made\n\"Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain\": https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain \nTED Talk: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/2018/01/13/ted-talk-you-arent-at-the-mercy-of-your-emotions-your-brain-creates-them \nX: https://twitter.com/lfeldmanbarrett \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@professor.lisa \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-feldman-barrett\n\nArticles\nEmotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial Movements: https://bit.ly/46R3XNq\n\nBooks\n\"Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution\": https://amzn.to/3QirDEZ\n\"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma\": https://amzn.to/3rUQyVO\n\"An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us\": https://bit.ly/3QhMFU9\n\"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life\": https://amzn.to/3M2CY9B\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/karl-deisseroth-understanding-and-healing-the-mind\nCounterintuitive Ideas About How the Brain Work (Lex Fridman Podcast): https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett\nLove, Evolution, and the Human Brain (Lex Fridman Podcast):: https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett-2\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\n00:03:01 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & Levels \n00:05:46 Core Components of Emotions\n00:10:42 Facial Movement & Interpretation, Emotion\n00:19:33 Facial Expressions & Emotion, Individualization\n00:31:03 Emotion Categories, Culture & Child Development\n00:36:53 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:50 Legal System, ‘Universal’ Emotions & Caution\n00:41:07 Language Descriptions, Differences & Emotion\n00:48:18 Questions & Assumptions; Language, Emotions & Nervous System\n00:53:40 Brain, Uncertainty & Categories\n01:02:51 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:57 Brain & Summaries; Emotions as “Multimodal Summaries” \n01:14:45 Emotional Granularity, Library Analogy \n01:19:40 Brain & Compression, Planning \n01:29:04 Labels & Generalization\n01:34:29 Movement, Sensation, Prediction & Learning\n01:42:44 Feelings of Discomfort & Action\n01:50:32 Tool: Feelings of Uncertainty, Emotion, “Affect”\n02:01:18 Tool: Experience Dimensions & Attention; Individualization\n02:08:36 Affect, Allostasis & Body Budget Analogy\n02:15:41 Depression, “Emotional Flu”\n02:20:20 Tool: Positively Shift Affect; Alcohol & Drugs; SSRIs\n02:27:40 Relationships: Savings or Taxes, Kindness\n02:36:50 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss neuroscience and psychology studies that address the basis of willpower and tenacity, how they differ from motivation and how we can all increase our levels of willpower and tenacity. I discuss whether willpower is a limited resource, the controversial “ego depletion” theory of willpower and the role that beliefs play in determining our tenacity and willpower. Then I discuss the neural basis of willpower in the brain and body and how tenacity and willpower relate to sleep, stress, focus and possibly to lifespan. Then, I provide a series of science-supported tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Willpower\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEgo depletion: Is the active self a limited resource?: https://bit.ly/3LTqnVY\nSelf-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor: https://bit.ly/46Gs15n\nBeliefs about willpower determine the impact of glucose on self-control: https://bit.ly/3Fa9Au6\nThe tenacious brain: How the anterior mid-cingulate contributes to achieving goals: https://bit.ly/48LnGzJ\nThe Will to Persevere Induced by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Cingulate Gyrus: https://bit.ly/3tift5M\nAerobic Exercise Training Increases Brain Volume in Aging Humans: https://bit.ly/45nmM9F\nStress relief as a natural resilience mechanism against depression-like behaviors: https://bit.ly/46AVhuc\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Irrelevant: Neural Mechanisms of Learning Real and Hypothetical Rewards and Effort: https://bit.ly/46mqWA6\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Roy Baumeister: https://roybaumeister.com \nDr. Carol Dweck: https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck \nDr. Lisa Feldman Barret: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com \nSleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing \nToolkit for Sleep (Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter): https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/toolkit-for-sleep \nDr. Matthew Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-walker-the-science-and-practice-of-perfecting-your-sleep \nHealthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/healthy-eating-and-eating-disorders-anorexia-bulimia-binging \nDr. Robert Sapolsky: Science of Stress, Testosterone & Free Will (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will \nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health (Huberman Lab episode): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tenacity & Willpower\n00:01:19 Sponsors: Maui Nui & Helix Sleep\n00:03:49 Tenacity & Willpower vs. Habit Execution; Apathy, Depression & Motivation \n00:10:40 Ego Depletion & Willpower as a Limited Resource; Controversy \n00:19:14 Tool: Autonomic Function, Tenacity & Willpower; Sleep & Stress \n00:28:02 Sponsor: AG1\n00:28:58 Willpower as a Limited Resource (Theory)\n00:35:36 Willpower & Glucose, Brain Energetics\n00:42:44 Beliefs about Willpower & Glucose; Multiple Challenges\n00:52:43 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:54:01 Willpower Brain ‘Hub’; Anorexia Nervosa, Super-Agers\n01:07:15 Anterior Midcingulate Cortex & Brain/Body Communication \n01:14:54 Allostasis, Anterior Midcingulate Cortex Function\n01:25:19 Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex (aMCC), Difficult Tasks & Neuroplasticity\n01:29:30 Tool: Novel Physical Exercise & Brain; Cognitive Exercise\n01:43:43 Tool: “Micro-sucks”, Increase Tenacity/Willpower\n01:50:58 Impossible Tasks, Super-Agers & Learning, Will to Live\n01:57:23 Tool: Rewards & Improving Tenacity/Willpower\n02:01:07 Tenacity & Willpower Recap\n02:05:55 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "This is episode 4 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D. Dr. Conti explains what true self-care is and how our mental health benefits from specific self-care and introspection practices — much in the same way that our physical health benefits from certain exercise and nutrition habits. He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one’s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzlink.to/az01KBLaUX3m6\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health (Episode 1): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health (Episode 2): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-improve-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Build and Maintain Healthy Relationships (Episode 3): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-build-and-maintain-healthy-relationships\nThe Iceberg Model: https://bit.ly/3LDNCn1\nPillars of Mental Health: https://bit.ly/48y0cOo\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Self Care\n00:02:37 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:05:34 What is Self-Care?, Foundation, Self-Understanding\n00:13:18 Life Narratives\n00:15:24 Journaling, Self-Inquiry & Therapy\n00:24:41 Unconscious Mind, Salience & Journaling; Panic Attacks\n00:28:20 Self-Inquiry; Grief & Death\n00:33:23 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:39 Self-Harm, Hopelessness & Therapy\n00:37:27 Apprehension of Unconscious Mind Exploration\n00:42:34 Mental Health Map: Cupboards, Agency & Gratitude, Generative Drive\n00:54:18 Structure of Self, Unconscious Mind, Abscess Analogy\n01:01:57 Exploring the Unconscious Mind, Curiosity, “Question the Givens”\n01:10:48 Conscious Mind Exploration; Self Curiosity, Busyness\n01:19:20 Exploring Defense Mechanisms, Character Structure\n01:24:54 Self & Character Structure, “Tending the Garden”\n01:32:45 Function of Self Cupboards\n01:35:50 Self-Awareness Exploration, Mirror Meditation\n01:38:34 Defense Mechanisms in Action & Self-Inquiry, Patterns\n01:47:15 Salience Exploration, Grounding Meditation\n01:52:37 Behavior & Self-Reflection; Phantom Driver Analogy\n02:00:14 Self & Strivings; Empowerment & Humility\n02:09:07 Challenges in Certain Life Domains\n02:17:49 Friendships & Support, Social Media\n02:23:50 Anger & Self-Care\n02:34:18 Self-Care & Challenges\n02:38:43 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We discuss nutrition, food additives, social media and mental health, public health initiatives to combat the crisis of social isolation, the obesity crisis, addiction and other pressing issues in public health. Dr. Murthy explains the role of the U.S. government in promoting specific public health issues and the steps needed to rebuild public trust in scientific and medical information. We also address health care accessibility, insurance barriers and individual versus team-based medical care, along with topics gleaned from listener questions, such as the facts and myths about the “Big Pharma” and “Big Food” industries, scientific research and public health policies.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Vivek Murthy\nHealth & Human Services Profile: https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/vivek-murthy.html \nHouse Calls with Dr. Vivek Murthy podcast: https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/house-calls/index.html \nX (Surgeon General): https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General \nPersonal Website: https://www.vivekmurthy.com \nTogether: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World book: https://www.amazon.com/Together-Connection-Performance-Greater-Happiness/dp/0062913298 \nBetter Together Newsletter: https://www.vivekmurthy.com/blank \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drvivekmurthy/\nX (personal): https://twitter.com/vivek_murthy \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrVivekMurthy\n\nArticles\nHabitual daily intake of a sweet and fatty snack modulates reward processing in humans: https://bit.ly/3ZuLmUK\n\nOther Resources\nOffice of the Surgeon General (OSG): https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/index.html \nU.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory Social Media & Youth Mental Health: https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/youth-mental-health/social-media/index.html \nU.S Surgeon General’s Current Priorities: https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/index.html \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Vivek Murthy\n00:01:53 Sponsors: Maui Nui & ROKA\n00:04:35 Surgeon General Roles\n00:07:44 Illness Framework, Enhancing Wellbeing\n00:12:42 Priorities as Surgeon General\n00:19:50 Public Health Message Distribution\n00:28:24 Diagnosis vs. Optimizing Health\n00:33:04 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:01 Food Additives, Highly Processed Foods, Food Availability\n00:39:11 Difficulties Addressing Health Issues & Highly Processed Foods\n00:49:53 Retribution, Integrity & Public Trust\n00:54:41 Company Opposition\n00:58:32 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:59:50 Public Health Communication, Masks & COVID-19, Public Trust\n01:07:01 Masks, Humility; Building Public Trust\n01:10:45 Rebuilding Relationship to Public, Vaccines\n01:17:41 Community Core & Diversity; Federal Funding\n01:24:55 Big Pharma, “Pill for Every Problem” Society \n01:31:48 Interdisciplinary Medical Teams, Individualized & Value-Based Medical Models\n01:38:44 Insurance Barriers, Mental Health Care, Drug Prices\n01:44:40 Isolation Crisis, Social Disconnection, Health Risks \n01:49:15 Community Organizations & Modern Life, Social Media\n01:56:36 Youth & Social Media, Parents, Policy Change\n02:06:45 Real Life vs. Social Media, Kids & Playtime\n02:11:56 Social Media Advice for Parents\n02:20:43 Society & Disconnection, Human Connection & Service\n02:31:20 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "This is episode 3 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist who did his medical training at Stanford School of Medicine and residency at Harvard Medical School. He is the author of the book, “Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic.” Dr. Conti explains how to find, develop and strengthen healthy relationships — including romantic relationships, work and colleague relationships, and friendships. He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative “us” and how to continually improve that dynamic. The next episode in this special series explores true self-care, which can be cultivated through a process of building self-awareness along with other important practices.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzlink.to/az01KBLaUX3m6\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health (Episode 1): https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health (Episode 2): https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-improve-your-mental-health\nThe Iceberg Model: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Iceberg-Model.pdf\nPillars of Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pillars-of-Mental-Health.pdf\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Build Healthy Relationships\n00:02:04 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:05:01 Healthiest Self in Relationships\n00:10:51 Structure & Function of Self\n00:15:44 Relationships, Levels of Emergence\n00:22:48 Generative Drive in Relationships\n00:35:00 Sponsor: AG1\n00:36:26 Generative Drive, Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive\n00:45:16 Romantic Relationships & Matched Generative Drives, Trauma Bonds\n00:53:05 Generative Drive Expression, Libido, Giving & Taking\n01:04:29 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n01:05:50 Generative Drive in Partnerships\n01:11:16 Libido, Avoidance & Working through Barriers\n01:18:02 Repeating Bad Relationship Patterns, Repetition Compulsion\n01:29:23 Narcissism, Dependence, Attachment Insecurity\n01:34:10 Abusive Relationships, Demoralization\n01:39:37 Oppressors, Darkness, Hope & Change\n01:48:08 Work Relationships, Oppression & Accountability\n01:53:53 Jealousy vs. Envy, Narcissism\n01:59:13 Power Dynamics in Relationships\n02:05:54 Giving vs. Taking in Relationships\n02:09:39 Transactions & Relationships; Family & Generative Drive; Flexibility\n02:19:47 Relationships & Kindergarten\n02:23:04 Anxiety in Relationships, Communication\n02:31:32 The “Magic Bridge of the Us”\n02:37:09 Mentalization, Getting into Another’s Mindset; Navigating Conflict\n02:46:51 Healthy Boundaries\n02:52:08 Self-Awareness, Mentalization\n02:55:28 “Broken Compass” & Self Inquiry, “Map” Analogy\n03:02:25 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I describe how your brain and body are fundamentally wired to perceive and respond to music and how those responses can be leveraged to improve your mood, allow for processing sad emotions and enhance learning and performance. I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Music\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman  \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nTickets: https://hubermanlab.com/tour\nCode: \"Huberman\"\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEffects of music on the cardiovascular system: https://bit.ly/3Rqkmnn\nMusic versus midazolam during preoperative nerve block placements: a prospective randomized controlled study: https://bit.ly/3RqB5a5\n40-Hz Binaural beats enhance training to mitigate the attentional blink: https://go.nature.com/3LmXWQk\n\nOther Resources\nHow to Increase Motivation & Drive (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-increase-motivation-and-drive\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction\nTools to Manage Dopamine and Improve Motivation & Drive (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/tools-to-manage-dopamine-and-improve-motivation-and-drive/\nBrainwaves (App Store): https://apple.co/3ZBK36N\nBrainwaves (Google Play): https://bit.ly/3enO8HP\nDr. Eddie Chang: The Science of Learning & Speaking Language (Huberman Lab episode) https://hubermanlab.com/dr-eddie-chang-the-science-of-learning-and-speaking-languages\nDr. Erich Jarvis: The Neuroscience of Speech, Language & Music (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/dr-erich-jarvis-the-neuroscience-of-speech-language-and-music \nPhysiological Sigh: https://youtu.be/afAZ1hlvRjI\nMarconi Union – Weightless: https://youtu.be/qYnA9wWFHLI\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Music & Your Brain\n00:03:32 The Brain Body Contract\n00:04:12 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & ROKA\n00:07:09 Music & Emotions; Brain & Body Interpretation\n00:13:03 Music & Intent; Babies, Music & Movement\n00:19:19 Tool: Health Metrics & Music, Breathing & Heart Rate\n00:29:54 Sponsor: AG1\n00:30:50 Music, Brain & Predictions\n00:38:07 Music & Brain: Novelty, Arousal, Memories\n00:44:22 Tool: Movement; Motivation & Faster Music\n00:50:49 Tool: Cognitive Work & Binaural Beats \n00:54:11 Silence or Music for Studying?, White Noise, Binaural Beats\n00:58:47 Tool: Retain Information & Internal Dialogue\n01:00:53 Tool: Focus, Work Breaks & Music\n01:04:11 Physical Exercise, Performance & Music\n01:07:37 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:43 Music & Shifting Mood\n01:14:41 “Happy” vs. “Sad” Music, “One-Hit Wonders” & Artificial Intelligence\n01:19:30 “Bass Face”; Music, Movement & Facial Expressions\n01:22:46 Tools: Shift to Happy Mood with Music; Sad Mood Catharsis\n01:27:30 Tool: Music & Reducing Anxiety, “Weightless”\n01:31:16 Playing Instruments, Singing & Brain Connectivity\n01:39:58 Music & the Brain \n01:42:14 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "This is episode 2 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist currently running a clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group. Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life’s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful “generative drive” of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as “acting out” or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzlink.to/az01KBLaUX3m6\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nThe Iceberg Model: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Iceberg-Model.pdf\nPillars of Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pillars-of-Mental-Health.pdf\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Improve Mental Health\n00:02:19 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n00:05:26 Structure & Function of Healthy Self \n00:16:25 Agency & Gratitude\n00:21:14 Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive, Generative Drive\n00:30:00 Physical & Mental Health Similarities, Verb States\n00:37:05 Sponsor: AG1\n00:38:32 Lack of Motivation, Drives\n00:43:06 Video Games/Social Media & Distraction, Generative Drive\n00:51:46 Asking Better Questions, Psychiatric Medicine, Physical Health Parallels\n00:59:10 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n01:00:30 Self-Reflection & Structure of Self “Cupboards”, Trauma & Agency\n01:08:53 Feeling Stuck, Defense Mechanisms & Sublimation, Character\n01:13:58 Self-Reflection & Function of Self “Cupboards”, Self-Awareness\n01:19:24 Defense Mechanisms & “Acting Out”\n01:26:43 Salience, Intrusive Thoughts\n01:31:24 Self-Reflection, Behaviors & Strivings; Roadmap Forward\n01:38:25 Internal Narratives, Childhood\n01:44:44 Internal Narratives: Self-Scrutiny & Overcoming; Trauma\n01:55:18 Time Required for Change, Understanding Intrusive Thoughts\n02:03:13 Self-Reflection on Internal Drives; Envy\n02:09:56 Generative Drive; Strong Aggressive Drive & Envy\n02:21:50 High Aggressive Drive & Social Relationships, Narcissism\n02:28:43 Narcissism, Destruction, Envy\n02:37:18 Narcissism & Childhood, Change\n02:41:26 Engaging with Narcissists, Disengagement\n02:44:47 Demoralization, Learned Helplessness\n02:49:34 Self-Inventory of Drives, Optimization\n02:56:09 Social Media & Salience, Generative Drive\n03:03:21 Rational Aspiration\n03:13:16 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity.\"\n\nWe each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings' strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways.\n\nFirst, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.\n\nOur conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nOutlive: The Science & Art of Longevity: https://peterattiamd.com/outlive\nThe Peter Attia Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter \nX (formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \n\nArticles\nReassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in Type 2 diabetes treated with metformin compared with controls without diabetes: a retrospective cohort study: https://bit.ly/3EypTAJ\nThe Hallmarks of Aging: https://bit.ly/3ZeqnFI\nCan people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without?

    "description": "This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group.\n\nDr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, and over-thinking, as well as how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate.\n\nThis episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns, and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional.\n\nThe subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.\n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://go.hubermanlab.com/nkyO23n\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\n*Huberman Lab Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. Paul Conti*\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzlink.to/az01KBLaUX3m6\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Paul Conti\n00:03:46 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:06:55 What is a Healthy Self?\n00:10:41 Agency & Gratitude; Empowerment & Humility \n00:16:13 Physical Health & Mental Health Parallels\n00:20:21 Structure of Self; Unconscious vs. Conscious Mind; “Iceberg”\n00:26:15 Defense Mechanisms; Character Structure “Nest”, Sense of Self \n00:31:27 Predispositions & Character Structure\n00:36:01 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:27 Character Structure & Action States; Physical Health Parallels\n00:46:20 Anxiety; Understanding Excessive Anxiety\n00:53:12 Improving Confidence: State Dependence & Phenomenology; Narcissism\n00:59:44 Changing Beliefs & Internal Narratives\n01:06:04 Individuality & Addressing Mental Health Challenges\n01:11:21 Mental Health Goals & Growth\n01:17:32 Function of Self\n01:23:00 Defense Mechanisms: Projection, Displacement\n01:30:14 Projection, Displacement, Projective Identification\n01:34:50 Humor, Sarcasm, Cynicism\n01:40:41 Attention & Salience; Negative Internal Dialogue \n01:45:02 Repetition Compulsion & Defense Mechanism, Trauma\n01:58:55 Mirror Meditation & Self Awareness; Structure & Function of Self, “Cupboards”\n02:04:57 Pillars of the Mind, Agency & Gratitude, Happiness\n02:13:53 Generative Drive, Aggressive & Pleasure Drives\n02:21:33 Peace, Contentment & Delight, Generative Drive; Amplification\n02:24:18 Generative Drive, Amplification & Overcoming\n02:33:00 Over-Thinking, Procrastination, Choices\n02:42:20 Aggressive, Pleasure & Generative Drives, Envy\n02:49:46 Envy, Destruction, Mass Shootings\n02:55:38 Demoralization, Isolation, Low Aggressive Drive\n03:02:50 Demoralization, Affiliate Defense \n03:09:32 Strong Aggressive Drive, Competition, Generative Drive Reframing \n03:20:02 Cultivating a Generative Drive, Spirited Inquiry of the “Cupboards”\n03:26:06 Current Mental Health Care & Medications\n03:35:33 Role of Medicine in Exploration\n03:40:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Marc Andreessen, the legendary software innovator who co-created the Internet browser Mosaic, co-founded Netscape and is now at Andreessen Horowitz — a venture capital firm that finds and brings to life technologies that transform humanity. We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics and AI regulation. This episode is for those interested in the innovative mind, psychology, human behavior, technology, culture and politics.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nMarc Andreessen\nAndreessen Horowitz: https://a16z.com \nMarc Andreessen: https://bit.ly/3sBHapY\nMarc Andreessen Substack: https://bit.ly/44SmQOJ \nPmarca Blog: https://bit.ly/45GvRvh\nX: https://twitter.com/pmarca\n\nArticles\nA Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity.

    "title": "Life, Death & the Neuroscience of Your Unique Experience | Dr. David Linden",
    "description": "In this episode my guest is Dr. David Linden, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of many popular books about the brain. We discuss individual differences between people, focusing on how they sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining physical and cognitive traits. We examine the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact health. We also explore the link between inflammation and depression. Dr. Linden shares his terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what the diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life.

    "title": "Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD & Neuroplasticity | Huberman Lab Podcast",
    "description": "In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain’s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term ‘K-holes’). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine, treatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles \nAntidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients: https://bit.ly/44YTGxY\nAttenuation of antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine by opioid receptor antagonism: https://go.nature.com/3qesrR8\natai Life Sciences Announces Results from Phase 2a Trial of PCN-101 (R-ketamine) for Treatment-Resistant Depression: https://bit.ly/47j6wsC \nComparative effects of (S)-ketamine and racemic (R/S)-ketamine on psychopathology, state of consciousness and neurocognitive performance in healthy volunteers: https://bit.ly/44WMxOR\nKetamine Metabolite (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine Interacts with μ and κ Opioid Receptors: https://bit.ly/44e4SWB\n\nOther Resources\nThe Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Ketamine\n00:02:29 Sponsors: ROKA & Eight Sleep\n00:05:13 Ketamine & PCP; Clinical & Recreational Use\n00:09:00 Depression & Current Treatments\n00:15:17 Preclinical Models of Depression & Ketamine; “Learned Helplessness” \n00:22:11 Ketamine & Clinical Uses; Depression & Suicidality \n00:28:32 Ketamine & Other Psychiatric Challenges; Relief & Durability \n00:33:24 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:29 NMDA Receptor & Neuroplasticity\n00:41:36 Excitatory & Inhibitory Communication, Seizure, NMDA Receptors & Ketamine\n00:48:26 How Ketamine Functions in Brain; Acute & Long-Term Effects\n00:55:36 Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) & Ketamine Therapy\n01:02:28 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:03:40 Ketamine & Opioid Pathway \n01:10:00 Divergent Mechanisms of Immediate & Long-Term Effects\n01:15:45 Habenula, Pro-Depressive Behaviors & Ketamine Therapy\n01:20:36 Ketamine & Context-Dependent Strategy; Reward Pathway\n01:22:45 Dissociative States\n01:26:04 Doses & Routes of Administration; “K-holes”; Risk & Caution\n01:32:25 Ketamine Forms; R-, S- vs R/S- Ketamine; Micro-Dosing \n01:38:24 Ketamine: Effects & Therapy\n01:40:40 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Maya Shankar Ph.D., a cognitive scientist, former senior advisor to the White House and Chair of the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team. She is the creator and host of the podcast A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset — the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort — to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #GrowthMindset\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPraise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003\nWhy do beliefs about intelligence influence learning success?

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Robert Malenka, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine who has made numerous seminal discoveries about how the brain changes (neuroplasticity) in response to learning and to rewarding and reinforcing experiences. We discuss the brain’s reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how they motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug-seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Robert Malenka\nStanford academic profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-malenka\nPublications: https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-malenka?tab=publications \nCurrent clinical trial: https://clinicaltrials.stanford.edu/trials/e/NCT03841682.html \nMapLight: https://maplightrx.com/team/robert-malenka\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-malenka-09b3a016b\n\nArticles\nDistinct neural mechanisms for the prosocial and rewarding properties of MDMA: https://bit.ly/3PNs2ze\nOxytocin receptor is not required for social attachment in prairie voles: https://bit.ly/3XLguOZ\nGating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area: https://bit.ly/3rigeee\nAnterior cingulate inputs to nucleus accumbens control the social transfer of pain and analgesia: https://bit.ly/44z3qP1\nSocial reward requires coordinated activity of nucleus accumbens oxytocin and serotonin: https://go.nature.com/44iOQvl\nSelective filtering of excitatory inputs to nucleus accumbens by dopamine and serotonin: https://bit.ly/44UG8n1\nSerotonin receptor regulation as a potential mechanism for sexually dimorphic oxytocin dysregulation in a model of Autism: https://bit.ly/44DS24e\n5-HT modulation of a medial septal circuit tunes social memory stability: https://go.nature.com/3rjlXk7\n\nOther Resources\nMapLight: https://maplightrx.com \nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nMindMed: https://mindmed.co \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robert Malenka\n00:02:37 Sponsors: ROKA & Levels\n00:05:21 Dopamine & Reward Circuitry\n00:11:31 Reward, Arousal, Memory & Dopamine \n00:17:34 Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification\n00:25:38 Memory & Reward Scaling\n00:30:50 Dopamine, “Addictive Liability” & Route of Administration \n00:39:07 Sponsor: AG1\n00:40:04 Drugs of Abuse & Brain Changes; Addiction & Individual Variability\n00:50:51 Reinforcement vs. Reward, Wanting vs. Liking\n00:57:50 Opioids, Psychostimulants & Dopamine\n01:03:38 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:04:51 Self-Doubt, Confidence & Career\n01:12:40 Autism Spectrum Disorder\n01:19:29 Pro-Social Interaction & Reward; Oxytocin, Serotonin & Dopamine\n01:30:30 Nucleus Accumbens & Behavior Probability\n01:38:28 Reward for Pro-Social Behavior\n01:43:13 Social Media & “Addictive Liability”; Gambling\n01:52:17 Pain, Social Behavior & Empathy\n02:02:19 Empathy Circuitry, Dopamine & Serotonin \n02:10:07 Autism Spectrum Disorder & Social Interactions, Empathy\n02:17:23 MDMA, Serotonin & Dopamine; Addiction & Pro-Social Effects\n02:28:13 Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, MDMA & Pharmacology\n02:37:18 Serotonin, MDMA & Psychedelics \n02:40:16 Psychedelics: Research & Therapeutic Potential\n02:47:57 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Jeffrey Goldberg, MD, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University. His clinical and research efforts focus on retinal and optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma and on discovering stem cell and nanotechnology treatments to cure blindness. We discuss how to maintain and improve eye health throughout life; the advantages and disadvantages of corrective lenses, including whether you should wear “readers”; the use and risks of contact lenses; considerations for LASIK eye surgery; floaters; dry eye; the importance of sunlight and UV protection; and specific exercises to improve eye and vision health. Dr. Goldberg also explains age-related conditions—cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy—and the behavioral, supplementation-based, prescription and surgical tools used to promote eye health. This episode provides essential tools for listeners of any age and background to maintain eye health and offset vision loss.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Jeffrey Goldberg\nAcademic Profile: https://stanford.io/3NKhyiP \nLab Website: https://stan.md/3r4fgCf \nPublications: https://stanford.io/3Pvyo6r \nOpen Clinical Trials: https://stanford.io/44cJ5yA \nMedical Profile: https://shc.is/3CLYPwX \nStanford Ophthalmology website: https://stan.md/44fIIn9\nSupport Stanford Ophthalmology research: https://stan.md/3qRDAHh\n\nArticles\nWeeklong improved colour contrasts sensitivity after single 670 nm exposures associated with enhanced mitochondrial function: https://go.nature.com/46jzN5P\nImprovement in inner retinal function in glaucoma with nicotinamide (vitamin B3): supplementation: A crossover randomized clinical trial: https://bit.ly/3peYWOB\nNovel Foveal Features Associated With Vision Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis: https://bit.ly/3pg7rZN\n\nOther Resources\n“Pencil Pushups” Near-Far Exercise: https://youtu.be/ObtW353d5i0?t=4130  \nSmooth Pursuit Eye Exercises: https://www.youtube.com/c/VisualExercises/videos \nStanford Vision Performance Center: https://med.stanford.edu/vpc.html \nAREDS2 Supplements for Age-Related Macular Degeneration:  https://bit.ly/3NKIFdC\nClinical Trials Glaucoma & Vitamin B6 Supplementation: https://bit.ly/3r3bGbB\nDr. Dubra Lab: https://dubralab.stanford.edu \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg\n00:03:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Eight Sleep\n00:06:29 Childhood & Eye Exams\n00:11:36 Eye Misalignment & Recovery\n00:20:38 Myopia (Near-Sightedness), Children & Sunlight\n00:30:04 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:31:18 Eye Safety & Protection; Eye Hygiene \n00:40:07 Adults & Eye Exams; Optometrist vs Ophthalmologist\n00:46:35 Presbyopia (Age-Related Vision Decline), Reading Glasses\n00:54:54 Reading Glasses: Use & Recommendations\n00:58:34 Night Vision & Glasses\n01:02:55 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:54 Corrective Eye Glasses, Exercises\n01:09:52 Near-Far Exercise & Presbyopia; Smooth Pursuit Exercise & Concussion \n01:13:25 Supranormal Vision & Performance Training\n01:19:11 20/20 Vision; Visual Acuity \n01:24:51 Contact Lenses: Use, Risks & Aging\n01:31:34 UV Protection & Cataracts, “Blue Blockers”\n01:38:20 Light Sensitivity & Eye Color\n01:40:29 LASIK Eye Surgery\n01:46:26 Dry Eye, Tears & Age\n01:53:24 Dry Eye, Serum Tears & Preservative-Free Artificial Tears; PRP\n02:00:46 Vision Loss: Cataracts, Glaucoma\n02:09:23 Age-Related Macular Degeneration, Dry & Wet Forms\n02:14:02 Diabetic Retinopathy, Type I vs Type II Diabetes\n02:18:54 Diabetic Retinopathy Treatment, Blood Pressure\n02:22:17 Glaucoma Screening & Treatment\n02:28:07 Smoking, Vaping & Vision Diseases; Cannabis & Eye Pressure\n02:35:13 Eye Pressure & Sleep Position\n02:37:48 Macular Degeneration, Optic Neuropathies & Red-Light Therapy\n02:42:23 “Floaters” \n02:45:29 Eye Twitching\n02:48:10 AREDS2 Supplementation & Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n02:53:39 Glaucoma & Vitamin B3 Supplementation\n02:58:42 Retinal Imaging & Neurodegeneration Screening, Multiple Sclerosis \n03:06:30 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Tim Ferriss — a five-time #1 New York Times bestselling author, technology investor and host of the iconic podcast The Tim Ferriss Show. We discuss Tim’s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery — themes that have spanned his career and placed him on the cutting edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery; how to find and work with mentors; and the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim’s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges, and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners as Tim’s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTim Ferriss\nPodcast: https://tim.blog/podcast\nBooks by Tim Ferriss: https://tim.blog/tim-ferriss-books\nBlog: https://tim.blog \nTED talks: https://www.ted.com/speakers/tim_ferriss \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tferriss\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/timferriss\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/timferriss\n\nResources\nPeter Attia ‘Studying Studies’ series: https://peterattiamd.com/ns001\nPeter Attia episode: https://tim.blog/2023/03/14/peter-attia-outlive \nThe Slow-Carb Diet: https://tim.blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds\nHow to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days: https://tim.blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise\nSeth Godin episode: https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin \nSuicide article: https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide\nHealing After Childhood Abuse episode: https://tim.blog/2020/09/16/how-to-heal-trauma-transcript\nDog Training episode: https://tim.blog/2016/11/14/susan-garrett\nSaisei Foundation: https://saiseifoundation.org \nThe Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation (POPLAR): https://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/research/the-project-on-psychedelics-law-and-regulation-poplar \nFerriss-UC Berkeley Psychedelic Journalism Fellowship: https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/bcsp\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com \nCockpunch: https://cockpunch.com \n\nBooks\nBuilt to Move: https://a.co/d/0z5Q6pu\nWhy We Sleep: https://a.co/d/2Ff5QHH\nThe Art of Fiction: https://a.co/d/1SCNIzl\nBad Science: https://a.co/d/iv5SM24\nHow to Lie with Statistics: https://a.co/d/dhbEsUp\nBrain Energy: https://a.co/d/bt8hTLU\nGold: https://a.co/d/1sWaF1i\nDon't Shoot the Dog: https://a.co/d/d5zOjgH\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tim Ferriss\n00:04:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Levels\n00:07:43 4-Hour Body & Development Mindset\n00:15:22 Origins of Good Ideas \n00:20:06 Writing & Structured Thinking\n00:27:58 Writing, Night Owls\n00:33:06 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:21 Investigating Outliers; Social Media & Smartphones\n00:40:37 Scientific Literacy, Randomized Clinical Trials \n00:45:09 Supplement & Experiment Fails; Cold Exposure & Hyperthermia\n00:50:46 Slow Carb Diet & Adherence\n01:03:35 Morning Protein Intake; Fasting\n01:08:48 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:09:53 Power of Place; Building Your Network & Volunteering\n01:21:43 Developing Skills; Examining Motivation & Good Questions; Simplicity\n01:33:32 Early Psychedelic Exploration, Depression\n01:45:38 Psychedelic Research & Mental Health Funding\n01:59:00 Saisei Foundation, Journalism Fellowship, Law & Education\n02:08:22 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Psychedelics\n02:13:28 Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, Nature \n02:18:50 Extended Nature Retreats & Integration Period; “Generative Drive”\n02:28:05 Mentors\n02:34:53 Mind & Attention Allocation, Social Media, Boredom\n02:44:12 Cockpunch\n03:00:23 Suicide & Depression, Sexual Abuse, Vulnerability \n03:14:22 Making Meaning from Suffering\n03:19:32 Role Identity, Future\n03:27:38 Parenthood, Animals & Training\n03:32:21 Podcasting, Experimentation\n03:36:52 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "The Science of MDMA & Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits & Risks | Huberman Lab Podcast",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which is also commonly known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” including how it works in the brain to cause short- and long- term-shifts in emotional processing and its clinical applications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and other substance-use addictions. I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTDS, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA Conserved Role for Serotonergic Neurotransmission in Mediating Social Behavior in Octopus: https://bit.ly/3oV8zSl\nEffects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward: https://bit.ly/3NlOYUC\nThe Effects of Acutely Administered 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Spontaneous Brain Function in Healthy Volunteers Measured with Arterial Spin Labeling and Blood Oxygen Level–Dependent Resting State Functional Connectivity: https://bit.ly/42yMEhl\nDistinct neural mechanisms for the prosocial and rewarding properties of MDMA: https://bit.ly/3NlNERM\nPlasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans: https://bit.ly/42AF6e0\nRETRACTED: Severe Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity in Primates After a Common Recreational Dose Regimen of MDMA (\"Ecstasy\"): https://bit.ly/3J9PTVU\nScience forced to retract article on “ecstasy”: https://bit.ly/3oRRpVM\nResidual neurocognitive features of long-term ecstasy users with minimal exposure to other drugs: https://bit.ly/3P93gcM\nMDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study: https://go.nature.com/3WqI2Zd\nThe effects of MDMA-assisted therapy on alcohol and substance use in a phase 3 trial for treatment of severe PTSD: https://bit.ly/42wqeNP\n\nBooks\nPIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story: https://amzn.to/45ZY80w\nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: https://amzn.to/45VdgfA\nThe Body Keeps the Score: https://amzn.to/3XgH5Dz\n\nOther Resources\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nParticipate in a MAPS trial: https://maps.org/take-action/participate-in-trial\nHuberman Lab episode on psilocybin: https://bit.ly/43yP80G\nHuberman Lab episode on psychedelics for mental health: https://bit.ly/3NqC3Rz \nHuberman Lab episode on dopamine, mindset & drive: https://bit.ly/3IqQzVb\nHuberman Lab episode on leveraging dopamine: https://bit.ly/3P3dCuD\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 MDMA “Ecstasy”\n00:04:37 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, ROKA, HVMN\n00:08:18 MDMA History & Synthesis; Legality \n00:14:45 MDMA, Methamphetamine (Meth), Dopamine & Serotonin\n00:23:30 MDMA vs Psychedelics vs Ketamine\n00:26:54 MDMA & Serotonin 1B Receptor, Subjective Feelings, Trauma \n00:33:36 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:51 Amygdala & Threat Detection, Pro-Social Behavior, MDMA Dosages\n00:45:48 Interoception, MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n00:52:36 Long-Term Effects, Threat Detection & PTSD\n00:56:14 MDMA, Social Connection & Empathy; Meth, SSRIs \n01:06:10 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:07:22 Oxytocin & MDMA\n01:16:10 Safety & Neurotoxicity; Recreational Use, Caffeine & Fentanyl\n01:26:36 Is MDMA Neurotoxic?; Poly-Pharmacology, Body Temperature\n01:37:07 Post-MDMA “Crash”, Prolactin & P 5 P\n01:43:07 PTSD & Trauma; Talk Therapy, SSRIs\n01:54:09 PTSD Treatment: Talk Therapy + MDMA\n02:02:46 MDMA & Addiction; Dissociative PTSD & Empathy\n02:09:47 Side-Effects?, MDMA Efficacy & Legality\n02:15:22 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I explain how medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse and other stimulants work to increase focus and treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nCardiovascular Effects of ADHD Therapies: JACC Review Topic of the Week: https://bit.ly/3MDbiri\nBrain alterations in children/adolescents with ADHD revisited: A neuroimaging meta-analysis of 96 structural and functional studies: https://bit.ly/3WDs0ve\nImpulsivity, Compulsivity, and Top-Down Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3MM3uUq\nDopaminergic System Dysfunction in Recreational Dexamphetamine Users: https://go.nature.com/3WDM9Bk\nModafinil enhances alerting-related brain activity in attention networks: https://bit.ly/3WLwobF\nAssociation of Intrinsic Brain Architecture With Changes in Attentional and Mood Symptoms During Development: https://bit.ly/3qhaaCl\nCognitive enhancement effects of stimulants: a randomized controlled trial testing methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine: https://bit.ly/4270EPr\nPsychostimulants and Cognition: A Continuum of Behavioral and Cognitive Activation: https://bit.ly/3MHqAv6\nNeural Correlates of Symptom Improvement Following Stimulant Treatment in Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: https://bit.ly/3ILu2DI\nLong-term effects of stimulant exposure on cerebral blood flow response to methylphenidate and behavior in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: https://bit.ly/45CQpFu\nMolecular Characterisation of the Mechanism of Action of Stimulant Drugs Lisdexamfetamine and Methylphenidate on ADHD Neurobiology: A Review: https://bit.ly/45Bsl5J\nPharmacologic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis: https://bit.ly/3J8rEaH\n\nBooks\nStahl's Essential Psychopharmacology (4th Edition): https://a.co/d/fJZekoD\n\nOther Resources\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://youtu.be/K-TW2Chpz4k\nADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://youtu.be/hFL6qRIJZ_Y\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Stimulants & Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \n00:03:21 Sponsors: Maui Nui, ROKA, HVMN \n00:06:35 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:07:22 Attention, Prefrontal Cortex & ADHD\n00:16:27 Stimulants “Sympathomimetics” \n00:21:29 Adderall, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n00:25:58 Sympathomimetics, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n00:31:05 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:20 Vyvanse is Timed-Release D-Amp\n00:36:36 Ritalin, Concerta \n00:40:10 Dopamine & “Noise Reduction”; Norepinephrine & “Signal Amplification”\n00:45:28 ADHD: Focus, Hyperactivity & Impulsivity; Drug Selection & Dose\n00:50:57 How do Stimulants ‘Calm’ ADHD?\n00:54:48 Neuroplasticity & Neuromodulators\n00:58:06 Kids, ADHD Diagnosis & Treatment; Predispose Addiction?\n01:04:02 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:05:12 ADHD Medications: Individuality, Doses, Tapering & Long-Term Use\n01:13:28 Medication & Long-Term Effects: Height, Cardiovascular Risk, Alcohol \n01:19:32 Cortisol & Hormones \n01:27:45 Psychosis & Addiction; Methamphetamine \n01:38:20 Recreational Use, Addiction & Psychosis; Habituation\n01:42:30 Drug Holidays; Ritalin & Long-Term Effects\n01:45:35 Modafinil, Armodafinil; Side-Effects\n01:53:03 Guanfacine, Alcohol \n01:58:03 ADHD Medications\n02:00:26 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health | Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris",
    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of the leading researchers studying how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and, in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition.\n\nWe discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye masks to encourage people to “go internal” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We explore microdosing versus macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also examine the current legal landscape surrounding psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for mental health disorders, but they are not without risk. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Robin Carhart-Harris\nAcademic Profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris \nPublications: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris#toc-id3 \nSupport USCF Psychedelic Research Fund: https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_GeneralGivingForm&Other=Psychedelic%20Research%20Fund%20zzz%207031398-SFFDN\nUCSF Clinical Trials Enrollment: https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/psychedelic-experiences \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris \nTEDx Talk: https://youtu.be/MZIaTaNR3gk\n\nArticles\nSelf-blinding citizen science to explore psychedelic microdosing: https://bit.ly/3IxMrUJ\nTrial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression: https://bit.ly/3Os2I11\nPivotal mental states: https://bit.ly/3ITFVYH\nIncreased global integration in the brain after psilocybin therapy for depression: https://go.nature.com/3q4Sb1z\nStructure-based discovery of nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analogs: https://bit.ly/41Svyux\nSelf-Medication for Chronic Pain Using Classic Psychedelics: A Qualitative Investigation to Inform Future Research: https://bit.ly/3Wr1q8C\nMDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study: https://go.nature.com/3WqI2Zd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris\n00:02:12 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels, HVMN \n00:05:41 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:06:31 Origin of the Word: “Psychedelics”; Pharmacology \n00:12:05 Psychedelics & Revealing the Unconscious Mind, Psychotherapy \n00:17:32 Microdosing\n00:26:08 Psilocybin vs. Magic Mushroom Doses\n00:28:28 “Psychedelic-Therapy”, Music \n00:35:12 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:26 Psychedelic Journey: “Trust, Let Go, Be Open” \n00:43:01 Negative Emotions, Fear & Psychedelics\n00:46:21 Global Functional Connectivity, Serotonin 2A Receptor; Subjective Experiences\n00:52:33 Pharmacology: Therapeutics without Psychedelic Effects; SSRIs\n00:58:45 Psilocybin & Depression; Long-Term Effects: Connectivity & Neuroplasticity \n01:09:14 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:10:26 Psilocybin Therapy & Anorexia\n01:12:56 Integration Phase & Psychedelic-Therapy; Meditation\n01:19:50 First-Time Psychedelic Use, “Entropic Brain Effect”, Neuroplasticity, Cognition\n01:30:16 Fibromyalgia & Psychedelic Treatment; MDMA Therapy & “Inner Healer”\n01:38:55 Placebo Response & Psychedelic Therapy \n01:41:39 LSD & Psychedelic-Therapy, Micro-Dose\n01:48:19 Combination Psilocybin-MDMA Therapy\n01:56:06 DMT “Rocketship” & Serotonin 2A Receptors; Ibogaine\n02:01:04 “Ego Dissolution”, Cocaine vs. Psychedelics; Relapses\n02:12:26 Psychedelics & Legal Landscape; Decriminalization\n02:17:54 MDMA, Trauma & Clinical Trials; Future Regulatory (FDA) Approval?\n02:23:25 Psilocybin & Current Clinical Trials \n02:28:41 Mental Health & Psychedelic Treatment, Safeguards, Paradigm Shift\n02:34:39 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Susanna Søberg, PhD. She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, where she researched the effects of deliberate cold and heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold exposure or sauna use can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones and decrease inflammation. Dr Søberg explains how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, which enhance energy, mood and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas and other variables. This episode provides actionable tools and answers to common questions about the use of deliberate cold and heat to improve health.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nPlunge: https://plunge.com/huberman \nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nTickets: https://hubermanlab.com/tour\nPresale code: HUBERMAN\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Susanna Søberg\nWinter Swimming: The Nordic Way Towards a Healthier and Happier Life: https://amzn.to/3MsyxW0\nThe Soeberg Institute: https://www.soeberginstitute.com \nPublications: https://www.soeberginstitute.com/research \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SusannaSberg1 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/susannasoeberg\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@resetlabpodcast \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@susanna_soeberg \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/susanna_soeberg\n\nArticles\nAltered brown fat thermoregulation and enhanced cold-induced thermogenesis in young, healthy, winter-swimming men: https://bit.ly/3MqCNWb\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nVariations in leptin and insulin levels within one swimming season in non-obese female cold water swimmers: https://bit.ly/3MpX0eF\nMapping of human brown adipose tissue in lean and obese young men: https://bit.ly/3pEd6Zg\nA role for brown adipose tissue in diet-induced thermogenesis: https://go.nature.com/3Ob03ZI\nAssociation Between Sauna Bathing and Fatal Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality Events: https://bit.ly/33P09RC\nImpact of cold exposure on life satisfaction and physical composition of soldiers: https://bit.ly/3kMxG7G\nThermal effects of whole head submersion in cold water on nonshivering humans: https://bit.ly/3I8JA4l\nThermoregulation during rest and exercise in the cold in pre- and early pubescent boys and in young men: https://bit.ly/3Ia1fsg\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Susanna Søberg\n00:03:23 Sponsors: Plunge, Maui Nui, Thesis \n00:06:49 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:07:40 Physiology in Uncomfortably Cold Environments\n00:12:05 Tool: Water Temperature, “Cold Shock” & Discomfort\n00:17:37 Cold Showers vs. Immersion in Water, Brown Fat\n00:22:11 Cold Receptors, Brown Fat & Temperature Homeostasis\n00:25:22 Shiver, “After Drop”, Healthy Stress\n00:31:08 Long-Term Health Benefits of Deliberate Cold Exposure\n00:35:48 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:37:02 Blood Pressure & Heath\n00:38:26 Brown Fat, Insulin Sensitivity & Metabolism\n00:45:07 Temperature Regulation, Brown Fat vs. White Fat\n00:52:26 Cold Resilience, Scandinavia \n00:59:07 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:00:16 Winter Swimmers & Brown Fat; Discomfort\n01:10:28 Sex differences & Brown Fat, Cold-Adapted\n01:15:21 Diving Reflex & Parasympathetic Activation \n01:18:44 Tool: Deliberate Cold & Sauna Protocol\n01:23:11 Winter Swimmers, Shiver; Circadian Rhythm & Brown Fat\n01:31:14 Tool: Minimum Threshold for Cold & Heat; Sauna & Cardiovascular Health\n01:35:19 Tool: Maintaining Stimulus when Cold-Adapted; Shorter Sessions\n01:38:09 Cold Exposure, Sleep Quality, Clothing\n01:47:37 “Brown Fat Negative” & Shiver\n01:52:13 Cold & Heat, Inflammation Reduction\n01:55:40 Tool: “Soberg Principle”: End on Cold, Metabolism\n01:59:39 Cold Exposure: Fed or Fasted?\n02:00:32 Raynaud’s Syndrome; Hand/Feet Protection in Cold\n02:05:21 Tool: Headache & Cold Exposure; Head Submersion & Head Coverings\n02:11:29 Children & Hypothermia Risk \n02:17:16 Gender Differences & Cold Exposure\n02:19:57 Tool: Brief, Repeated Temperature Changes; Circadian Rhythm & Temperature\n02:27:53 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "How Psilocybin Can Rewire Our Brain, Its Therapeutic Benefits & Its Risks",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss what psilocybin is (chemically) and how it works at the cellular and neural circuit level to trigger neuroplasticity, which is our brain’s ability to rewire itself in ways that lead to long-lasting shifts in our emotional, cognitive and behavioral patterns and abilities. I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com code: “Huberman”\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nThe neural basis of psychedelic action: https://go.nature.com/3VInMlE\nThe effects of psilocybin and MDMA on between-network resting state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers: https://bit.ly/3VW8iL7\nIncreased low-frequency brain responses to music after psilocybin therapy for depression: https://bit.ly/3LKj6XK\nQuality of Acute Psychedelic Experience Predicts Therapeutic Efficacy of Psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression: https://bit.ly/42c7y6x\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3wEvGRf\nTherapeutic use of psilocybin: Practical considerations for dosing and administration: https://bit.ly/3HPHLZM\nPsilocybin induces rapid and persistent growth of dendritic spines in frontal cortex in vivo: https://bit.ly/3HQ8J3z\nPsychedelics and Neuroplasticity: A Systematic Review Unraveling the Biological Underpinnings of Psychedelics: https://bit.ly/44Gpwjx\nSingle-Dose Psilocybin for a Treatment-Resistant Episode of Major Depression: https://bit.ly/3pjvu9N\nEffects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: https://bit.ly/3sFSGMM\nThe costs and benefits of psychedelics on cognition and mood: https://bit.ly/3NNyEwI\n\nOther Resources\nThe Physiological Sigh: https://youtu.be/rBdhqBGqiMc\nDr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelic Medicine: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-johnson-psychedelic-medicine\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Psilocybin, Legal Considerations\n00:08:32 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, ROKA, HVMN \n00:12:00 Psilocybin Becomes Psilocin in the Gut, Serotonin \n00:17:00 The Serotonin 2A Receptor, Therapeutic Outcomes SSRIs vs. Psilocybin\n00:21:40 Serotonin Receptor Expression; Visual Hallucinations & Eyes Closed\n00:27:21 Safety & Cautions for Specific Patient Populations\n00:29:13 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:30:28 Psilocybin, “Magic Mushrooms” Dosing, Micro-Dosing, “Heroic Doses”\n00:36:21 Psychedelic Journey: Set, Setting & Support\n00:43:43 Music & the Psilocybin Journey; Duration of Effects\n00:48:58 Psilocybin & the Brain: Subjective Experiences, Perception\n00:58:36 Sponsor: LMNT\n00:59:48 Brain Networks & Therapeutic Outcomes\n01:05:23 Creativity; Music, Emotionality & Psychedelic Journeys\n01:12:39 Depression & Psychedelics as Neuroplasticity “Wedge”\n01:16:53 Positive Psychedelic Journeys, Unity, “Oceanic Boundlessness”\n01:25:23 “Bad Trips”, Anxiety & Physiological Sighs\n01:32:57 Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin\n01:36:11 Neuroplasticity, Structural Brain Changes & Psilocybin\n01:48:08 Psychedelics: Therapeutic Breakthroughs & Depression \n01:56:37 Combining Psilocybin Therapy & Talk Therapy, Antidepressant Effects\n02:03:11 Psilocybin Experience & Mental Health\n02:06:42 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior | Dr. Noam Sobel",
    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the Department of Brain Sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet. Dr. Sobel’s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Noam Sobel\nLab website: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg\nLab Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/odorspaceWORG \nPublications: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg/publications \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LabWorg \n\nArticles\nThe Age of Olfactory Bulb Neurons in Humans: https://bit.ly/41NMjb6\nThe Privileged Brain Representation of First Olfactory Associations: https://bit.ly/3LGEePP\nMechanisms of scent-tracking in humans: https://go.nature.com/41Sm03w\nMeasuring and Characterizing the Human Nasal Cycle: https://bit.ly/44dqGmi\nHuman non-olfactory cognition phase-locked with inhalation: https://go.nature.com/44iPIQQ\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://bit.ly/3Lo5kK6\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://bit.ly/41TVIhq\nMHC-dependent mate preferences in humans: https://bit.ly/41SbgCc\nAn Exteroceptive Block to Pregnancy in the Mouse: https://go.nature.com/3VnxRnN\nFear-Related Chemosignals Modulate Recognition of Fear in Ambiguous Facial Expressions: https://bit.ly/3NqAPpD\nSniffing the human body volatile hexadecanal blocks aggression in men but triggers aggression in women: https://bit.ly/3oQ6NBv\nMenstrual Synchrony and Suppression: https://go.nature.com/3LRF9xf\nRegulation of ovulation by human pheromones: https://go.nature.com/44jODbt\nHuman Tears Contain a Chemosignal: https://bit.ly/41Qmkjr\nWhy Only Humans Shed Emotional Tears: https://bit.ly/41W71pl\nRevisiting the revisit: added evidence for a social chemosignal in human emotional tears: https://bit.ly/44dygNJ\nIncrease of tear volume in dogs after reunion with owners is mediated by oxytocin: https://bit.ly/41W73gX\nAn olfactory self-test effectively screens for COVID-19: https://go.nature.com/3Vj6z1S\n\nOther Resources\nJoachim Löw video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOstSv7SrRU \nOsmo: https://osmo.ai \nOdor Space: https://odorspace.weizmann.ac.il \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Noam Sobel\n00:03:46 Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep\n00:06:46 Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n00:14:49 Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n00:21:39 Brain Processing of Smell\n00:24:40 Smell & Memories\n00:27:52 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:07 Humans & Odor Tracking\n00:39:25 The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n00:48:18 Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n00:54:47 Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction \n01:00:12 Congenital Anosmia\n01:05:01 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:06:19 Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n01:15:07 Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others \n01:22:02 Odors & Romantic Attraction\n01:24:58 Vomeronasal Organ, “Bruce Effect” & Miscarriage\n01:40:20 Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n01:50:26 Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n02:03:57 Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n02:12:11 Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n02:27:46 Science Politics \n02:37:54 Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n02:45:34 Human Perception & Odorant Similarity \n02:52:12 Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n03:05:50 Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n03:10:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "Welcome to a preview of the sixth Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.\n\nThe Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\n\nSubscribe to Huberman Lab Premium at https://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AMA\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:01:53 What Are the Best Eye Exercises, Supplements, Food, Protection Practices for the Eye?\n00:33:55 Huberman Lab Premium\n\nIn the full AMA episode, we discuss:\n- Why We Yawn and Don't Yawn During Sleep\n- How to Stay Motivated and Overcome Lethargy in Learning\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I explore the science of mental visualization and its application for learning motor and cognitive skills. I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts. This episode should allow anyone to learn or teach more effectively through the use of mental visualization and training.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman  \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nStatistics of Mental Imagery: https://bit.ly/3H8NR78\nBest practice for motor imagery: a systematic literature review on motor imagery training elements in five different disciplines: https://bit.ly/3UY0RT3\nSleep and the Time Course of Motor Skill Learning: https://bit.ly/41tM9We\nMental practice modulates functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex: https://bit.ly/3H9kh1H\nMotor Imagery Combined With Physical Training Improves Response Inhibition in the Stop Signal Task: https://bit.ly/3oBlmZJ\nWhat is the relationship between Aphantasia, Synaesthesia and Autism?: https://bit.ly/3V2Tslj\nChapter 15 - Aphantasia: The science of visual imagery extremes: https://bit.ly/3V2Tqdh\nVisual mental imagery and visual perception: Structural equivalence revealed by scanning processes: https://bit.ly/3L0jvoE\nUsing motor imagery practice for improving motor performance – A review: https://bit.ly/3ApXzyi\nMotor Imagery Combined With Physical Training Improves Response Inhibition in the Stop Signal Task: https://bit.ly/3oBlmZJ\nVisual images preserve metric spatial information: Evidence from studies of image scanning.: https://bit.ly/41OMimY\nAcquisition and consolidation processes following motor imagery practice: https://go.nature.com/3L1udeK\n\nOther Resources\nMobius strip: https://www.britannica.com/science/Mobius-strip \nImpossible cube: https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Impossible_cube  \nRubin’s vase: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase \nStop-Signal Task: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/stopsignal.html (Click on “Run the Demo” in the left-hand margin.

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Matthew MacDougall, MD, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and to those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip in his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Matthew MacDougall\nClinical Practice: https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-matthew-macdougall \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmmacdougall\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/matthewmacdoug4 \nThe Institute: https://www.theinstitute.com/fellow/matthew-macdougall \n\nNeuralink\nNeuralink: https://neuralink.com \nNeuralink’s Patient Registry: https://neuralink.com/patient-registry\nJoin Neuralink: https://neuralink.com/careers\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Matthew MacDougall\n00:04:05 Sponsors: HVMN, Levels, Thesis\n00:07:38 Brain Function & Injury; Brain Tumor Treatment\n00:13:52 Frontal Lobe Filter; Sleep Deprivation\n00:19:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology & Machines\n00:22:10 Neuralink, Neural Implants & Injury, Robotics & Surgery\n00:31:05 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:32:20 Neocortex vs. Deep Brain\n00:36:45 Decoding Brain Signals\n00:42:08 “Confidence Test” & Electrical Stimulation; RFID Implants\n00:51:33 Bluetooth Headphones & Electromagnetic Fields; Heat\n00:57:43 Brain Augmentation & Paralysis\n01:00:51 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:02:09 Brain Implants & Peripheral Devices\n01:12:44 Brain Machine Interface (BMI), Neurofeedback; Video Games\n01:22:13 Improving Animal Experimentation, Pigs\n01:33:18 Skull & Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n01:39:14 Brain Health, Alcohol\n01:43:34 Neuroplasticity, Brain Lesions & Redundancy \n01:47:32 Car Accidents & Driver Alertness\n01:50:00 Future Possibilities in Brain Augmentation & BMI; Neuralink \n01:58:56 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "title": "The Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair",
    "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology of hair, hair growth, why hair growth slows and what causes hair to stop growing and/or “fall out.” I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #HairGrowth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu.berman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nMicroneedling and Its Use in Hair Loss Disorders: A Systematic Review: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13555-021-00653-2\nCaffeine and Its Pharmacological Benefits in the Management of Androgenetic Alopecia: A Review: https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/508228\nThe effectiveness of combination therapies for androgenetic alopecia: A systematic review and meta-analysis: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dth.13741\nDifferential effects of caffeine on hair shaft elongation, matrix and outer root sheath keratinocyte proliferation, and transforming growth factor‐β2/insulin‐like growth factor‐1‐mediated regulation of the hair cycle in male and female human hair follicles in vitro: https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/171/5/1031/6616284?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false\nThe structure of people’s hair: https://peerj.com/articles/619/\n\nNote: The Huberman Lab podcast has no affiliation with or financial benefit from any of the products listed below, which are provided as a useful reference only.\n\nKetoconazole Shampoos\nKeeps: https://www.keeps.com/our-products/ketoconazole \nNurx: https://www.nurx.com/topical/ketoconazole-2-shampoo/fb/ \nSiena Health: https://www.sienahealth.com/product/ketoconazole-shampoo-2 \nIntelligent: https://intelligent.shop/products/intelligent-shampoo\n\nBiotin Shampoos\nMaple Holisitics: https://www.amazon.com/Biotin-Hair-Shampoo-Thinning-Moisturizing/dp/B01ENCBOA0 \nOuai: https://theouai.com/collections/shampoo-conditioner/products/fine-hair-shampoo \nR+Co: https://www.randco.com/collections/dallas-collection/products/dallas-biotin-thickening-shampoo \n\nMicroneedling https://www.amazon.com/s?k=microneedling+hair+2mm&crid=OOD2YAB5CQXN&sprefix=microneedling+hair+2mm%2Caps%2C168&ref=nb_sb_noss \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Hair\n00:04:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, HVMN, ROKA\n00:08:04 Psychological States & Hair\n00:13:19 Hair Anatomy & Stem Cells\n00:26:05 3 Phases of Hair Growth\n00:35:40 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:55 Minoxidil & Blood Flow\n00:45:37 Increase Blood Flow: Massage, Tadalafil, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), Microneedling\n00:56:10 Microneedling, Minoxidil & “Dead Zones”\n01:00:13 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:01:25 Botox Treatments\n01:06:27 Androgens, Hair Growth & Pattern Hair Loss; Scalp vs. Beard Hair\n01:15:46 Topical Caffeine & Slowing Hair Loss\n01:21:06 IGF-1: Growth Hormone & Sermorelin; Insulin Sensitivity: Myo-Inositol\n01:25:52 Iron & Hair Growth\n01:27:04 5-Alpha Reductase & Saw Palmetto; Curcumin \n01:33:22 Ketoconazole & Offsetting Hair Loss\n01:38:46 Topical & Oral Finasteride \n01:51:00 Post- Finasteride Syndrome\n01:56:01 Dutasteride\n01:58:53 Mechanical & Chemical Stimulation for Hair Growth\n02:02:46 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Elissa Epel, Ph.D., professor and vice chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the author of a new book entitled “The Stress Prescription.” We discuss her work showing how stress impacts mood, eating behavior, mental health, physical health and aging. She explains stress intervention tools using “top-down” techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing) and body-based methods (e.g., breathwork, including the Wim Hof Method), as well as exercise, meditation, body scans and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Elissa Epel\nUCSF profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/elissa.epel \nPersonal website: https://www.elissaepel.com \nLab Website (Aging, Metabolism & Emotion Center): https://amecenter.ucsf.edu \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dr_epel \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/elissa.epel \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elissa-epel \n\nArticles\nThe geroscience agenda: Toxic stress, hormetic stress, and the rate of aging: https://bit.ly/3nAgNhD\nTHE IMPACT OF MEANINGFUL VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT IN AGING ADULTS: THE BALTIMORE EXPERIENCE CORPS TRIAL: https://bit.ly/3KpyJoa\nPotential role for adult neurogenesis in the encoding of time in new memories: https://go.nature.com/3U0gwkl\nThe mindful moms training: development of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress and overeating during pregnancy: https://bit.ly/3ZzueM3\nCan Meditation Slow Rate of Cellular Aging?

    "title": "Leverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort",
    "description": "In this episode, I explain how dopamine dynamics — meaning changes and interactions between our baseline and peak levels of dopamine drive our cravings and sense of motivation. I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\n\n#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPain modulates dopamine neurons via a spinal–parabrachial–mesencephalic circuit: https://go.nature.com/3FPaFIH\nDopamine, Updated: Reward Prediction Error and Beyond: https://bit.ly/3Gha0A7\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nEffect of tyrosine on cognitive function and blood pressure under stress: https://bit.ly/3LSSHZq\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/3LSgCZ6\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3TIWfj2\n\nOther Resources\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dopamine\n00:02:32 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, WHOOP, ROKA, Momentous\n00:06:27 Dopamine Brain Circuits \n00:14:53 Goals & Addiction\n00:17:13 Dopamine Dynamics, “Wave Pool” analogy\n00:20:28 Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n00:28:26 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:40 Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, “Scoreboard”\n00:37:40 Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n00:44:55 Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n00:50:43 Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n00:53:25 Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n01:02:08 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:26 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n01:09:38 Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n01:18:58 Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n01:23:31 Dopamine Dynamics, “Dopamine Stacking”; Intrinsic Motivation\n01:38:10 Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n01:41:49 Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n01:52:16 Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n01:57:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Peter Attia, M.D. He completed his medical and advanced training at Stanford University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Dr. Attia is host of the health and medicine podcast The Drive and the author of a new book, “Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity,” which examines disease prevention and healthy aging, including emotional health. He explains the leading causes of death worldwide and how to measure one’s risk of death and mitigate each risk factor. Dr. Attia shares how, in addition to blood-based markers of lipids and hormones, there are behavioral measures and interventions and key aspects of emotional health (i.e., relationships, emotional stability, purpose, etc.) that fundamentally impact our physical health and longevity, and how to assess and adjust our emotional health. This episode is rich with actionable information related to disease screening and biomarker testing, nutrition, exercise, behavior and prescription-based tools that are useful to all people, regardless of age, male or female, and that can significantly improve vitality, health and lifespan.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman  \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nThe Peter Attia Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \n\nArticles\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/40ccfw8\n\nBooks\nOutlive: The Science & Art of Longevity book: https://peterattiamd.com/outlive\nThe Road to Character: https://amzn.to/42nMx9H\n\nOther Resources\nWithings Blood Pressure Cuff: https://amzn.to/47TJ6tQ\nOmron Blood Pressure Cuff: https://amzn.to/41kLirQ\nPrenuvo Whole-Body MRI: https://www.prenuvo.com \nBiograph: https://www.biograph.com \nThe Fentanyl Crisis and Why Everyone Should Be Paying Attention (The Drive podcast episode): https://peterattiamd.com/anthonyhipolito\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia\n00:03:22 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, LMNT, HVMN, Momentous\n00:07:34 Lifespan vs. Healthspan\n00:10:54 “4 Horseman of Death”, Diseases of Atherosclerosis\n00:14:44 Tool: Hypertension & Stroke, Blood Pressure Testing \n00:23:14 Preventing Atherosclerosis, Smoking & Vaping, Pollution\n00:32:24 Sponsor: AG-1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:33:29 Cholesterol, ApoB\n00:42:21 Cholesterol Levels, LDL & ApoB Testing\n00:49:29 ApoB Levels & Atherosclerosis, Causality\n01:01:06 ApoB Reduction, Insulin Resistance, Statins, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 Inhibitors\n01:12:30 Monitoring ApoB\n01:17:12 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:18:30 Reducing Blood Pressure, Exercise & Sleep\n01:20:50 High Blood Pressure & Kidneys\n01:23:11 Alcohol, Sleep & Disease Risk\n01:31:21 Cancer & Cancer Risks: Genetics, Smoking & Obesity\n01:39:47 Cancer Screening & Survival\n01:44:17 Radiation Risks, CT & PET Scans\n01:48:48 Environmental Carcinogens\n01:52:11 Genetic & Whole-Body MRI Screening, Colonoscopy\n01:58:47 Neurodegenerative Diseases, Alzheimer’s Disease, ApoE\n02:08:08 Alzheimer’s Disease & Amyloid\n02:13:58 Interventions for Brain Health, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n02:21:26 Accidental Death, “Deaths of Despair”, Fentanyl Crisis\n02:31:20 Fall Risk & Stability, 4 Pillars of Strength Training\n02:41:05 Emotional Health\n02:53:45 Mortality & Preserving Relationship Quality\n03:02:20 Relationships vs. Outcomes, Deconstructing Emotions\n03:09:34 Treatment Centers, Emotional Processing & Recovery\n03:16:34 Tool: Inner Monologue & Anger, Redirecting Self-Talk\n03:27:37 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Satchin Panda, PhD, professor and director of the Regulatory Biology Laboratories at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. We discuss his lab’s discovery that time-restricted eating (TRE), also known as intermittent fasting, has beneficial effects on metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and longer fasts as well, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that roughly 50% of people engage in negatively affects their health, and he explains how simple adjustments to these factors can improve their subjective sense of wellbeing and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health, and how confining calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window can enhance physical health, mental health and longevity.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Satchin Panda\nSalk Institute: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda \nPanda Lab: https://panda.salk.edu \nPublications: https://panda.salk.edu/publications \nSupport Dr. Panda’s Research: https://panda.salk.edu/giving \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SatchinPanda\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/satchin.panda \n\nOther Resources\nMy Circadian Clock app: https://mycircadianclock.org \nOntime Health app: https://getontimehealth.com \n\nArticles\nRevival of light signalling in the postmortem mouse and human retina: https://go.nature.com/3ZWnGro\nCircadian alignment of early onset caloric restriction promotes longevity in male C57BL/6J mice: https://bit.ly/3ywruE3\nTime-restricted eating with or without low-carbohydrate diet reduces visceral fat and improves metabolic syndrome: A randomized trial: http://bit.ly/3LeBdqg\nEmbers of society: Firelight talk among the Ju/’hoansi Bushmen: https://bit.ly/3l65LzK\nCircadian Entrainment to the Natural Light-Dark Cycle across Seasons and the Weekend: http://bit.ly/3LhsWlm\nFeasibility of time-restricted eating and impacts on cardiometabolic health in 24-h shift workers: The Healthy Heroes randomized control trial: http://bit.ly/3FeR1FC\nAccess to Electric Light Is Associated with Shorter Sleep Duration in a Traditionally Hunter-Gatherer Community: https://bit.ly/3LivSyj\nDaily Eating Patterns and Their Impact on Health and Disease: https://bit.ly/3YGIHW6\n\nBooks\nThe Circadian Code: https://amzn.to/3FixpAv\nThe Circadian Diabetes Code: https://amzn.to/3FiU7Zm\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Satchin Panda\n00:03:02 Sponsors: HVMN, Eight Sleep, Thesis, Momentous\n00:07:24 Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health \n00:14:38 Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n00:21:34 Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n00:25:28 Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat \n00:32:49 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:34:04 CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n00:47:20 Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n00:52:40 Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n00:59:04 Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet \n01:03:00 Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n01:15:07 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:16:20 Circadian Rhythm, “Night Owls” & Genetics \n01:26:37 Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, “Me Time” \n01:30:08 Light Sensitivity & “Night Owls”; Puberty, Melatonin\n01:36:05 Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n01:45:43 Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction \n01:50:59 Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n02:05:18 Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n02:09:15 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n02:22:10 Meal Timing\n02:25:20 “Complete Fast”, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n02:28:12 “Fat Fasting”, Blood Glucose & Insulin \n02:31:57 Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n02:39:14 Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n02:41:36 Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n02:46:17 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss our body’s most vital and essential nutrient—water. I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.\n\nFor recommended water filters, tests and the full show notes, please visit https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-your-water-quality-and-intake-for-health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nImpact of cold exposure on life satisfaction and physical composition of soldiers: https://bit.ly/3kMxG7G\nCircadian rhythms and the kidney: https://go.nature.com/41RHUnV\nEndocrine Disruptors in Water and Their Effects on the Reproductive System: https://bit.ly/3L7rjXc\nImpact of Drinking Water Fluoride on Human Thyroid Hormones: A Case- Control Study: https://go.nature.com/3ZFoFfu\nRegulations for calcium, magnesium or hardness in drinking water in the European Union member states: https://bit.ly/3SOdnU4\nElectrolyzed-Reduced Water: Review I.

    "title": "Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations | Dr. Oded Rechavi",
    "description": "In this episode my guest is Oded Rechavi, Ph.D., professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University and expert in how genes are inherited, how experiences shape genes and, remarkably, how some memories of experiences can be passed via genes to offspring. We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Rechavi \nAcademic Profile: https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/profile/odedrech_66 \nLab Website: https://www.odedrechavilab.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OdedRechavi \nTEDx Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/oded_rechavi_transgenerational_biology?language=en  \n\nArticles\nNeuronal Small RNAs Control Behavior Transgenerationally: https://bit.ly/2HZxrzO\nTransgenerational Inheritance of an Acquired Small RNA-Based Antiviral Response in C. elegans: https://bit.ly/41xRf47\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Oded Rechavi\n00:02:08 Sponsors: ROKA, HVMN, Eight Sleep\n00:06:04 DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells\n00:14:36 Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits\n00:22:54 Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology\n00:28:52 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:30:06 James McConnell & Memory Transfer\n00:37:31 Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics \n00:45:13 Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes \n00:50:43 Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring\n00:59:06 Generational Epigenetic Inheritance \n01:09:03 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:10:20 Model Organisms, C. elegans\n01:21:50 C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs\n01:26:02 RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity\n01:34:13 RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects\n01:38:41 Response Duration & Environment\n01:47:50 Generational Memory Transmission, RNA\n01:59:36 Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues\n02:04:48 Transmission of Sexual Choice\n02:11:22 Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing\n02:17:56 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory\n02:29:26 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology of breathing (respiration), how it delivers oxygen and carbon dioxide to the cells and tissues of the body and how is best to breathe—nose versus mouth, fast versus slow, deliberately versus reflexively, etc., depending on your health and performance needs.  I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method,” Prānāyāma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why “overbreathing” is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology. Anyone interesting in improving their mental and physical health or performance in any endeavor ought to benefit from the information and tools in this episode.\n\n#HubermanLab #Breathing #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/pages/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nConcentration of carbon dioxide, interstitial pH and synaptic transmission in hippocampal formation of the rat: https://bit.ly/3k3BG3y\nEffects of voluntary hyperventilation on cortical sensory responses Electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic studies: https://bit.ly/3k9rkyS\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3KgN5rj\nBreathing Rhythm and Pattern and Their Influence on Emotion: https://bit.ly/3XRxsda\nNasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations and Modulates Cognitive Function: https://bit.ly/3EgX1gr\nEffect of breathwork on stress and mental health: A meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials: https://go.nature.com/3XMKYi7\n\nBooks\nJaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic: https://amzn.to/2UZoudJ\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Breathing\n00:05:41 Sponsors: HVMN, Thesis, WHOOP\n00:09:36 Respiration, Oxygen & Carbon Dioxide\n00:18:18 Breathing Mechanics\n00:30:08 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:31:23 Chemistry of Breathing, Hyperventilation\n00:40:35 High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing\n00:47:16 Tool: Sleep Apnea, Nasal Breathing\n00:51:50 Brain Centers & Breathing Rhythm\n00:57:23 Brain, Hyperventilation & “Over-breathing”\n01:03:53 What is Healthy Breathing?\n01:08:26 InsideTracker\n01:09:44 Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing\n01:22:39 Tool: Breathwork & Stress Reduction; Cyclic Sighing\n01:33:56 Tool: Physiological Sighing & Exercise Side Cramp\n01:39:16 Breathing & Heart Rate Variability\n01:46:21 Tool: How to Stop Hiccups\n01:51:17 Tool: Stress Management & Cyclic Hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method”\n01:57:11 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Breathing\n01:59:54 Tool: Inhales & Learning; Exhales & Movement\n02:09:15 Mouth vs. Nasal Breathing, Aesthetics\n02:16:19 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned.

    "title": "How to Stop Headaches Using Science-Based Approaches",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the causes and treatments of different types of headaches, including tension headaches, migraines, sinus and cluster headaches, as well as menstrual and other hormone-based headaches. I describe how to distinguish between the different headache types and how to select the right treatment, including prescription-based and non-prescription-based treatments, behavioral and nutrition-based approaches. I also explain the evidence and mechanisms supporting the use of omega-3 fatty acids, high dose creatine, peppermint oil, turmeric, acupuncture and more. Additionally, I touch on traumatic brain injury, the causes of photophobia, aura, and the link between spicy foods and thunderclap headaches. By the end of this episode, listeners and viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of headaches, their types and the best way to prevent and stop them.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPrevention of traumatic headache, dizziness and fatigue with creatine administration.

    "description": "This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes. Anyone wishing to improve their physical health and performance stands to benefit from the information.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Andy Galpin\nAcademic Profile: http://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/facultystaff/AndyGalpin.php\nWebsite: https://www.andygalpin.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drandygalpin\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drandygalpin\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3R2e3zYxWwIhMKV36Qhkw\n\nArticles\nExercise Snacks: A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health: http://bit.ly/3Rp7UlP\nThe Effects of Acute Exercise on Mood, Cognition, Neurophysiology, and Neurochemical Pathways: A Review:  https://bit.ly/3HniYv5\n\nOther Resources\nExercise Snacks: https://beyond.ubc.ca/exercise-snacks\nSHIFT Breathing Gears: https://youtu.be/u8kxddDHj90\nSHIFT Breathing Assessment: https://shiftadapt.com/breathwork\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Endurance: Benefits, Mechanics & Breathing \n00:07:30 Tool: “Exercise Snacks”\n00:14:21 Momentous, Levels, LMNT\n00:18:01 Endurance Categories\n00:22:16 Fat Loss & Respiration; Carbon Cycles & Storage, Metabolism\n00:33:08 Exhalation Rates, Exercise & Fat Loss; Calories \n00:41:47 Cardiovascular Adaptations, Cardiac Output & Maximum Heart Rate\n00:47:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:47:55 Excess Post-Exercise Consumption (EPOC); Exercise Intensity & Fat vs. Carbohydrate Energy Utilization\n00:59:35 Tool: Training for Fat Loss, Carbohydrate Stores, Liver Glycogen & Fatigue\n01:08:01 Metabolic Flexibility, Carbohydrates & Fat; Exercise & Flexible Fuel Utilization \n01:16:07 Muscle & Basal Metabolic Rate\n01:19:40 InsideTracker\n01:20:43 Assessing Metabolic Flexibility, Blood Glucose, Carbohydrates\n01:27:48 Caffeine, High-Carbohydrate Meals & Timing, Managing Daily Energy \n01:36:42 Cellular Energy (ATP) Production from Carbs; Lactate; Anerobic, Aerobic\n01:50:45 Lactate, Energy Production Buffer\n01:53:14 Fuel Sources & Exercise; Mitochondria, Oxygen Availability & Lactate\n02:02:50 Lactate for Exercise & Cognitive Performance\n02:04:33 Energy Production, Waste Management & Endurance Exercise; Insulin\n02:12:49 Protein & Fat Utilization for Energy; Exercise & Fat Loss\n02:21:20 Protein as Fuel Source, Fire Analogy \n02:26:39 Low-Carbohydrate Diet & Performance\n02:29:40 Muscular Endurance: Fuel Sources, Training & Capillarization\n02:37:30 Tool: Muscular Endurance & Modifiable Variables; Examples\n02:45:07 Anerobic Capacity: Fuel Sources, Training & Oxygen Utilization \n02:49:23 Tool: Cardiac Output, Heart Rate Zones & Breathing “Gear System”\n02:58:10 Tool: Anerobic Capacity & Modifiable Variables; Examples, Nasal Recovery\n03:11:45 Tool: “Sugarcane” Endurance Protocol \n03:14:02 Anerobic Capacity, Training Progression \n03:16:40 Tool: Maximum Aerobic Output, Training & Modifiable Variables\n03:21:58 Tool: Long Duration Endurance, Training, Circuits\n03:25:13 Long Duration Endurance, Capillarization, Fatigue & Breathwork, Technique\n03:29:10 Weekly Combination Training, Metabolic Flexibility & Longevity\n03:37:23 Tool: Mixed Endurance Training, Half Marathon Example\n03:47:33 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "How to Optimize Fertility in Males & Females",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the mechanisms by which human eggs and sperm are generated, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, the conception process and overall fertility in males and females. I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity in all people, regardless of age. \n\nNote: At the timestamp related to cumulative probability of pregnancy (2:01:30), I misspoke, my apologies. The data in the following graph are correct but the “120%” is not. \n\nThe appropriate equation is 1-(1-p)^n where p is the probability of getting pregnant in a given cycle and n is the cycle number. Therefore the equation for this scenario is 1-(0.8^6). \n\nUsing the equation, cumulative probability over 6 cycles is 73.8% (rounded to 3 significant figures). \n\nFor a visual representation: https://bit.ly/4dxkfPA\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nArticles\nEffects of mobile phone usage on sperm quality – No time-dependent relationship on usage: A systematic review and updated meta-analysis: https://bit.ly/3Horf39\nAcupuncture and herbal medicine for female infertility: An overview of systematic reviews: https://bit.ly/3D6QyUW\nEffect of Zinc Administration on Plasma Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, and Sperm Count: https://bit.ly/3XThteZ\nCannabis and Male Fertility: A Systematic Review: https://bit.ly/3iXAyOi\nTanner Stages: https://bit.ly/3HnYXpo\nLink Between Body Fat and the Timing of Puberty: https://bit.ly/3Wz9nH8\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Fertility, Vitality & Longevity\n00:04:24 Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n00:08:20 Eggs & Sperm, Genes, Fertilization\n00:18:28 Puberty: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), Melatonin & Leptin\n00:23:38 Onset Trends of Puberty, Odors Effects\n00:31:24 Female Puberty, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)\n00:35:25 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:34 Ovulatory & Menstrual Cycle\n00:40:36 Follicular Phase: Egg Maturation & Ovulation, FSH & Estrogen\n00:51:09 Luteal Phase: Progesterone & Estrogen, Menstruation \n00:58:14 Ovulation & Libido; Luteal Phase & Malaise; Individual Variability\n01:03:14 Inside Tracker\n01:04:18 Sex Chromosomes, Sperm\n01:11:40 Tool: Testicular Temperature & Fertility\n01:17:22 Sperm Production, Seminal Fluid, Vasectomy \n01:24:07 Sperm Cells, Mitochondria & Motility, Intercourse Frequency & Fertilization\n01:28:31 Sperm Production, GnRH, FSH, LH & Testosterone \n01:36:21 Ejaculate Quality, Sperm Counts, Fertilization, Ectopic Pregnancy\n01:44:14 Tool: Sexual Intercourse Frequency & Fertilization\n01:53:24 Tools: Tracking Ovulation, Libido, Lubricants \n01:56:42 Fecundability: Egg Quality & Woman’s Age, Cumulative Pregnancy Rate\n02:08:17 Miscarriages, Chromosomal Abnormalities\n02:11:23 Female Fertility: Age, Follicle Testing & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Testing \n02:18:51 Male Fertility: Sperm Analysis, Age\n02:24:52 Fertility & Hormone Analysis, Age\n02:29:07 Fertility Effects of Sleep, Cortisol/Stress, Cannabis/Nicotine & Alcohol \n02:42:40 Fertility, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), Viral Infection & Cystic Fibrosis\n02:47:42 Tool: Testicular Temperature & Fertility\n02:51:26 Tool: Phones & Sperm Quality \n02:58:06 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Fertility, Testicular Temperature, Cortisol/Stress\n03:05:43 Fertility, Exercise & Mitochondrial Health; Intermittent Fasting\n03:14:46 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Sperm Production; Supplements\n03:20:36 Sex Determination in Offspring, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), Sperm Fractions\n03:32:23 Postcoital Female Position & Fertilization, Sperm Quality\n03:36:57 Cannabis & Sperm Motility, Libido, Pregnancy\n03:42:33 Acupuncture, Fertility & Pregnancy\n03:49:25 Fertility Supplements: L-Carnitine & Allicin, Coenzyme Q10 \n03:56:18 Fertility Supplements: Inositol, Omega 3 Fatty Acids  \n04:02:50 Supplements for Hormones: Tongkat Ali, Shilajit, Zinc\n04:13:02 Fertility & Prescription Medications\n04:16:44 Human Reproduction & Fertility\n04:20:12 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "title": "Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast",
    "description": "In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\n\n#HubermanLab #Supplements #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEurycoma longifolia (Jack) Improves Serum Total Testosterone in Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials: https://bit.ly/3QnuCdJ\n\nResources\nExamine: https://examine.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Supplements\n00:03:38 Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n00:11:51 Momentous, LMNT, Helix Sleep\n00:15:38 Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n00:33:06 Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n00:35:59 InsideTracker\n00:36:44 Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n00:43:45 Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n00:50:52 Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n00:55:55 Melatonin Caution\n00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n01:02:45 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n01:03:53 Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root \n01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions \n01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork \n01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido \n01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine \n01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine \n01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein \n01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements\n01:55:25 A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n01:58:36 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher-order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Special Offer for Waking Up\nhttps://www.wakingup.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Sam Harris\nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMaking Sense podcast: https://www.samharris.org/podcasts \nWebsite: https://www.samharris.org \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@samharrisorg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg\n\nBooks\nWaking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion: https://amzn.to/3Z51pIb\nMaking Sense: Conversations on Consciousness, Morality, and the Future of Humanity: https://amzn.to/3CgbIQ3\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Sam Harris \n00:04:36 Levels, WHOOP, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n00:08:54 Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n00:18:07 Sense of Self in Brain & Body \n00:25:28 Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n00:28:25 Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade \n00:33:30 Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n00:40:48 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:41:57 Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n00:57:32 Sense of Self throughout Evolution \n01:07:40 Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n01:18:42 InsideTracker\n01:19:46 Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness \n01:26:27 Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n01:37:13 Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n01:43:14 Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n01:52:11 Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n02:06:44 Meditation & Concentration Practice \n02:11:58 Mindfulness, “Skylike Mind” & Thoughts\n02:15:11 States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n02:32:39 Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & “Flow” States\n02:42:58 Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n02:54:59 Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n03:05:58 Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n03:21:11 Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n03:29:48 Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n03:40:09 Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n03:54:29 Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption & Politics \n04:06:14 Social Media, Attentional Disruption & Deep Work\n04:15:39 Meditation & Sense of Self\n04:19:02 Sam Harris & Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity, and we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family and friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for detachment as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nJocko Willink\nExtreme Ownership book: https://amzn.to/3VtiUPw\nWay of the Warrior Kid book: https://amzn.to/3VwPIHC\nJocko Podcast: https://jockopodcast.com\nEchelon Front: https://echelonfront.com \nJocko's website: https://jocko.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jockowillink \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/jockowillink \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jkowillink\n\nBooks\nOn The Psychology of Military Incompetence: https://amzn.to/46PnpcR\nMastery: https://amzn.to/3RCRk3R\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Jocko Willink\n00:03:50 Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, LMNT, Momentous\n00:08:42 Sense of Self, Discovery & Autonomy\n00:19:11 Mindsets in the Military: Garrison vs. Combat\n00:25:02 Military Divisions\n00:29:34 Daily Workouts & Discipline\n00:35:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:53 Energy & Movement, Cortisol, Nutrition\n00:52:10 Exercise & Energy, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n00:59:05 Win vs. Loss Mindset, Leadership, Action & Energy \n01:12:07 InsideTracker\n01:13:11 Confidence, Generators vs. Projectors, Family\n01:24:01 Restoring Motivation: Social Connection & Play\n01:32:44 Self-Identity & Context, Alcohol, Music, Dopamine\n01:45:10 Motivation Sources & Recovering from Loss\n01:54:05 Suicide, Navy SEALs, Social Contagion\n02:09:00 Suicide, Alcohol, Positive Action \n02:15:03 Meditation, Detachment\n02:20:30 Adaptability & Opportunities, Navy SEALs \n02:30:43 Ambition & Love, Likeability, Leadership\n02:40:18 Building Teams, Detachment, Family\n02:50:20 Detachment: Problems & Perspective\n02:55:55 Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation\n03:08:31 Tool: Situational Awareness & Detachment\n03:17:49 Social Media, Personal Flaws\n03:23:01 Falling Asleep & Detachment\n03:27:02 Resilience Calibration, Navy SEAL Training & Combat\n03:39:16 Deliberate Discomfort & Mental Resilience\n03:42:21 People & Animals, Personalities\n03:51:25 Political Leadership & Military, Social Media\n04:01:38 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "title": "The Science of Creativity & How to Enhance Creative Innovation",
    "description": "In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one’s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Creativity #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nOpen monitoring meditation reduces the involvement of brain regions related to memory function: https://go.nature.com/3V6s6Jt\nThe (b)link between creativity and dopamine: Spontaneous eye blink rates predict and dissociate divergent and convergent thinking: https://bit.ly/3v3nlWG\nIncreased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness: https://bit.ly/3PJATjC\nExploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting: https://bit.ly/3FHf3Zv\nA new method for training creativity: narrative as an alternative to divergent thinking: https://bit.ly/3FH0chB\nMore creative through positive mood?

    "description": "My guest is Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health. We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise and supplementation (including tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss and prostate health and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Kyle Gillet\nDr. Gillett’s clinic: https://gilletthealth.com \nGillet Health YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@gilletthealth6738\nThe Gillet Health Podcast on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Bu13kh\nThe Gillet Health Podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3FJSCUz\nInstagram: https://www.Instagram.com/kylegillettmd\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gilletthealth \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Kyle Gillett & Male Hormone Optimization\n00:03:40 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous\n00:07:43 Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity\n00:15:14 “First” vs. “Second” Puberty\n00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work\n00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones\n00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose\n00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication\n00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire\n00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & the Dopamine “Wave Pool”\n00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen for Hormone Health\n00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)\n01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)\n01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone\n01:15:34 InsideTracker\n01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways\n01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone \n01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise \n01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens\n01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome\n01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy\n01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene\n01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature\n01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat\n02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids\n02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health\n02:21:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I explain how to use caffeine to enhance mental and physical health and performance, including the optimal dosages and intake schedules for caffeine. I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine. Since caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances (more than 90% of adults use caffeine daily!), this episode provides actionable tips for adjusting caffeine consumption to positively impact performance and health, including sleep. \n\n#HubermanLab #Caffeine #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAnti-diabetic effects of GLP1 analogs are mediated by thermogenic interleukin-6 signaling in adipocytes: https://bit.ly/3Vy58Mi\nCaffeine in Floral Nectar Enhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward: https://bit.ly/3XZ7Yf9\nConsumption of caffeinated beverages and serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones in US men: https://bit.ly/3Y94kPZ\nInverse association between caffeine intake and depressive symptoms in US adults: data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006: https://bit.ly/3XVB7I1\nCaffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across the waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels: https://bit.ly/3iAS5eH\nTime course of tolerance to the performance benefits of caffeine: https://bit.ly/3F4kGjN\nCaffeine consumption and menstrual function: https://bit.ly/3F1pBlM\nErgogenic effects of caffeine on peak aerobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle: https://bit.ly/3B819xX\nConsolidating Memories: https://bit.ly/3UEudUQ\nBlood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running: https://bit.ly/3HrqKpJ\nThe neuroprotective effects of caffeine in neurodegenerative diseases: https://bit.ly/3Ha3kER\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Caffeine\n00:02:58 Tool: GLP-1, Yerba Mate, Satiety & Weight Loss\n00:11:06 Levels, Eight Sleep, ROKA, Momentous Supplements\n00:15:23 Caffeine Benefits for Mental & Physical Performance\n00:20:23 Caffeine in Nature & Positive Reinforcement\n00:26:44 Caffeine Effects on Brain; Reward Pathways\n00:29:55 Caffeine as a Reinforcing Agent\n00:36:47 AG1 (Athletic Greens) \n00:38:01 Caffeine, Adenosine & Reduced Sleepiness \n00:45:16 Tool: Caffeine Dosage, Caffeine Adapted\n00:53:44 Tool: Delayed Caffeine Intake, Afternoon Crash & Sleep\n01:04:46 Morning Exercise & Residual Caffeine Effects\n01:07:56 Tool: Theanine & Jitteriness; Fasting, Intermittent Caffeine Use \n01:13:00 Theanine: Effects & Dosage\n01:18:41 InsideTracker\n01:19:45 Other Effects: Osteoporosis, Hormone Levels, Depression\n01:27:41 Afternoon Caffeine & Sleep\n01:31:45 Tool: Caffeine & Mental/Physical Performance; Cortisol & Caffeine Abstinence\n01:46:04 Caffeine, Performance & Menstrual Cycle\n01:47:27 Tool: Memory & Caffeine Timing; Adrenaline & Cold Exposure\n01:54:08 Caffeine & Naps\n01:56:34 Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement \n02:01:55 Dopamine Stacking\n02:06:04 Scheduling Caffeine to Maximize Its Effects\n02:08:33 Pro-Health Effects of Caffeine\n02:13:38 Tool: Sugar Cravings & Reinforcing Effects of Caffeine \n02:20:17 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

    "description": "My guest this episode is Chris Palmer, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidence-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, highlights important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and discusses the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/Huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Chris Palmer\nDr. Palmer’s website: https://www.chrispalmermd.com \nBrain Energy: A Revolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health--and Improving Treatment for Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD, and More: https://amzn.to/3XheFIV\nMedical profile: https://www.mcleanhospital.org/profile/christopher-palmer \nAcademic profile & publications: https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/70255\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChrisPalmerMD\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrispalmermd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders\n00:03:25 Thesis, Eight Sleep, ROKA\n00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health\n00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis\n00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet\n00:34:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence\n00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits\n00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment\n00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health\n00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders\n01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health\n01:15:12 InsideTracker\n01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet\n01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose\n01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria\n01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana \n01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet\n01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer’s Disease & Ketones\n02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet\n02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose \n02:10:16 Alzheimer’s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet\n02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss\n02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep\n02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility\n02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications \n03:01:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "I explain the science of happiness, including the different types of happiness and how our actions, circumstances and mindset control them. While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate “natural happiness,” including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called “synthetic happiness”). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nSpending Money on Others Promotes Happiness: http://bit.ly/3X3k71V\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/3sMP64B\nEye contact marks the rise and fall of shared attention in conversation: http://bit.ly/3hy04IF\nThe Influence of Interactions with Dogs on Affect, Anxiety, and Arousal in Children: http://bit.ly/3htjBdh\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3A9S4UY\nThe Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity―and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race: https://amzn.to/3E3Und5\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Happiness\n00:06:27 Tool: Light Exposure Timing & Brightness Timing\n00:14:14 Thesis, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:17:51 Imprecise Language for Happiness\n00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters \n00:26:32 Harvard Happiness Project \n00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group \n00:37:20 Work, Sense of Meaning & Happiness\n00:40:13 Toolkit for General Wellbeing\n00:43:06 Happiness Across the Lifespan, Does Having Children Make Us Happier?\n00:47:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness\n00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness\n00:54:23 Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident\n01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness\n01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music\n01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude\n01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness\n01:31:55 Tool: Focus, Wandering Mind & Meditation \n01:39:40 Tool: Quality Social Connection\n01:41:28 Brief Social Connection, Facial Recognition & Predictability\n01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact\n01:54:00 Physical Contact & Social Connection, Allogrooming, Pets\n02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness\n02:11:57 Happiness Toolkit\n02:22:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.\n\n#HubermanLab #Meditation #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/3sMP64B\nBrief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators: https://bit.ly/3zu83gf\nYoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep in patients with chronic insomnia: A randomized controlled trial: https://bit.ly/3zvZwtb\n\nBooks\nWherever You Go, There You Are: https://amzn.to/3TSnOFF\nThe Harvard Psychedelic Club: https://amzn.to/3NkQ2qg\nAltered Traits: https://amzn.to/3wXsKj8\n\nOther Resources\nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com\nNSDR (Virtusan / Huberman): https://youtu.be/AKGrmY8OSHM\nNSDR (Madefor): https://youtu.be/pL02HRFk2vo\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Meditation \n00:04:13 InsideTracker, Thesis, ROKA, Momentous Supplements\n00:08:25 Brief History of Meditation: Consciousness, Psychedelics, fMRI \n00:16:19 How the Brain Interprets the Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness \n00:26:07 Neuroscience of Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights\n00:32:27 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:33:41 Interoception vs. Exteroception\n00:42:20 Default Mode Network, Continuum of Interoception & Exteroception\n00:53:30 Tools: Interoceptive or Exteroceptive Bias, Meditation Challenge\n01:01:48 State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing \n01:07:35 Tool: Brief Meditations, Waking Up App\n01:10:30 “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts\n01:20:46 Meditation: Practice Types, Focal Points & Consistency \n01:24:10 Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception \n01:30:41 Tool: Meditation Breathwork, Cyclic vs. Complex Breathwork\n01:39:22 Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma\n01:47:43 Model of Interoception & Dissociation Continuum\n01:53:39 Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge \n02:00:18 Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) \n02:11:33 Choosing a Meditative Practice; Hypnosis\n02:14:53 Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB) \n02:25:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "My guest is Eddie Chang, MD, a neurosurgeon and professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering & Prostheses. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying speech, language learning and comprehension, communicating human emotion with words and hand gestures, bilingualism and language disorders such as stuttering. Dr. Chang also explains his work developing and applying state-of-the-art technology to decode speech and using that information and artificial intelligence (AI) to successfully restore communication to patients who have suffered paralyzing injuries or locked-in syndrome. We also discuss his work treating patients with epilepsy. Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://www.levelshealth.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Eddie Chang\nSupport research in the Chang Laboratory: https://changlab.ucsf.edu/support-our-work\nDr. Chang’s lab: https://changlab.ucsf.edu \nAcademic profile & publications: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/edward.chang \nUCSF clinical profile: https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/dr-edward-chang \n\nArticles\nNeuroprosthesis for Decoding Speech in a Paralyzed Person with Anarthria: https://bit.ly/3sjv5Cx\n\nArticles in the News\nTapping Into the Brain to Help a Paralyzed Man Speak: https://nyti.ms/3f0AM5c\nHow Brain-Computer Interfaces Could Restore Speech and Help Fight Depression: https://on.wsj.com/3f1iBMH\nDecoded Brain Signals Could Give Voiceless People A Way To Talk: https://n.pr/3gujhdP\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Eddie Chang, Speech & Language \n00:03:00 Levels, Eight Sleep, InsideTracker, Momentous Supplements\n00:07:19 Neuroplasticity, Learning of Speech & Environmental Sounds\n00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization\n00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language in the Brain\n00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy \n00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery \n00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy\n00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Other Seizure Types\n00:41:08 Brain Areas for Speech & Language, Broca’s & Wernicke’s Areas, New Findings\n00:53:23 Lateralization of Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes\n00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits\n01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction from Ear to Brain\n01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations\n01:17:37 Mapping Language in the Brain\n01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages \n01:25:07 Motor Patterns of Speech & Language\n01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments\n01:34:47 Evolution of Language \n01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome\n01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory \n01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, “Locked-In Syndrome” & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)\n02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation\n02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars\n02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment \n02:22:55 Tools: Practices for Maintaining Calm Under Extreme Demands\n02:31:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment. \n\n#HubermanLab #Fitness #Exercise\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA potent physiological method to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation: https://bit.ly/3yKcinr\nSkeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Exercise Training: Contrary Evidence for an Interference Effect: https://bit.ly/3VquEDL\n\nBooks\nRelax into Stretch: Instant Flexibility Through Mastering Muscle Tension: https://amzn.to/2D22cR9\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size & Endurance: https://bit.ly/3D2ifP5\nJeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools: https://bit.ly/3ELv0Pe\nDr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity: https://bit.ly/3ggkB3K\nATHLEAN-X: https://athleanx.com\nATHLEAN-X Neck Training: https://youtu.be/wjiZaCJ6tCA\nAnna Skips: https://www.instagram.com/anna.skips\n10-minute Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol: https://youtu.be/AKGrmY8OSHM\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Foundational Protocol for Fitness\n00:03:35 Huberman Lab Premium\n00:04:35 Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism\n00:14:42 InsideTracker, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous Supplements\n00:18:53 Core Principles of Fitness & Modifiable Variables\n00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout\n00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy\n00:38:09 Key Principles of Resistance Training\n00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery\n00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training\n01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives\n01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate\n01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training\n01:27:30 Flexibility of Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing\n01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs \n01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts\n01:37:18 Tool: Stress or Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR\n01:40:04 Should You Train Fasted or Fed?\n01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training\n01:47:56 Tool: Hanging from a Bar & Fitness Metric \n01:49:02 Should You Train Sick?, Ramping Training\n01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery\n01:53:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Nolan Williams, M.D., a triple-board-certified psychiatrist, neurologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He is also the director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications of brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first explore the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We then cover Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat depression, trauma, PTSD and other mood disorders. Next, we dive into the history, biology, modern use and safety margins of various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise and training to control the brain–heart rate pathways. Regardless of age, anyone interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Nolan Williams\nStanford Profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/nolan-williams\nBrain Stimulation Lab: https://bsl.stanford.edu\nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i4WyrcYAAAAJ&hl=en\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nolanrywilliams\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nolan-williams-0802a324\n\nArticles\nAdjunctive triple chronotherapy (combined total sleep deprivation, sleep phase advance, and bright light therapy) rapidly improves mood and suicidality in suicidal depressed inpatients: An open label pilot study: https://bit.ly/3CJCWiv\nDevelopment of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse: https://bit.ly/3fJPjSI\n\nBooks\nBreaking Open the Head: https://amzn.to/3fVqbIG\n\nOther Resources\nBrain Stimulation Lab – Ongoing & Upcoming Studies: https://bsl.stanford.edu/clinical-trials\nMagnus Medical: https://www.magnusmed.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n00:03:31 Huberman Lab Premium \n00:04:42 InsideTracker, Eight Sleep, ROKA\n00:08:37 Momentous Supplements \n00:09:16 Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n00:15:11 The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:39:00 Belief/Identity “Rules”, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia \n00:54:27 Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n01:03:42 SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n01:13:58 Memories & “Rule” Creation; Psilocybin & “Rule” Resolution \n01:21:00 MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n01:24:12 Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n01:30:38 Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n01:34:53 Exposure Response Prevention: “Letting Go” & Depression Treatment\n01:41:23 Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n01:45:35 Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n01:57:16 Clinical Use of Psychedelics \n02:01:59 Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n02:06:55 Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n02:14:52 Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n02:20:42 Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light \n02:28:43 Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n02:34:25 Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n02:45:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nInspired by Mary Jane?

Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders—for example, binge eating disorder, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor and dystonia. We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and its application to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore the use of this technology for other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and examine future therapeutic directions involving non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions.

    "description": "In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users — most of whom report wanting to quit — this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPredictors of smoking abstinence following a single-session restructuring intervention with self-hypnosis: https://bit.ly/3LoU0gA\nEffect of hypnotic suggestion on cognition and craving in smokers: https://bit.ly/3xtUwEn\nPharmacological Approach to Smoking Cessation: An Updated Review for Daily Clinical Practice: https://bit.ly/3eTkfiV\n\nResources\nReveri: https://www.reveri.com\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Nicotine \n00:02:47 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:41 Tool: Brief Daily Meditation & Focus \n00:05:59 The Arrow Model of Focus, Alpha GPC & Garlic Supplements\n00:10:43 Thesis, InsideTracker, ROKA \n00:14:35 Nicotine Effects vs. Methods of Delivery, Acetylcholine\n00:19:55 Where is Nicotine Found?

    "description": "My guest is David Anderson, PhD, a world expert in the science of sexual behavior, violent aggression, fear and other motivated states. Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind and body arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience and hormones and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation–induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions and sexual and/or violent behavior.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. David Anderson\nDr. David Anderson: https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu/davidanderson \nThe Nature of the Beast: https://amzn.to/3qsrdOH\nDr. David Anderson’s Lab: https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu \nDr. Anderson’s publications: https://bit.ly/3L5uGMl\n\nArticles\nTwo Different Forms of Arousal in Drosophila Are Oppositely Regulated by the Dopamine D1 Receptor Ortholog DopR via Distinct Neural Circuits: https://bit.ly/3Dmyh7b\n\nResources\nMouse switching from mating behavior to aggressive behaviors upon stimulation of VMH: https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=882 \nVMH stimulation causes mouse to display aggressive behaviors toward an inanimate object (e.g., glove): https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=689\nPicture of Periaqueductal Gray (PAG): https://neuroscientificallychallenged.com/posts/know-your-brain-periaqueductal-gray\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. David Anderson, Emotions & Aggression \n00:03:33 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:27 Levels, Helix Sleep, LMNT \n00:08:10 Emotions vs. States\n00:10:36 Dimensions of States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization\n00:14:38 Arousal & Valence \n00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression in Mice, VMH\n00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory \n00:29:20 Evolution & Development of Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear\n00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures for States & Homeostasis\n00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:39:46 Hydraulic Pressure & Aggression\n00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression\n00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone\n00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood\n00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors \n01:05:10 Neurobiology of Sexual Fetishes \n01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression\n01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior or Dominance?\n01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior\n01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear \n01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression \n01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve \n01:52:52 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I provide a list of behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based tools you can use to improve your ability to get into a focused state to do mental or physical work. I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you’ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nVirtusan: https://virtusan.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAcute Stress Improves Concentration Performance: https://bit.ly/3wVuJoh\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3ep6Z5x\nBrief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, mood, and emotional regulation in non-experienced meditators: https://bit.ly/3ai0X4D\n\nBooks\nAltered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body: https://amzn.to/3wXsKj8\n\nResources\nHuberman Lab Toolkit for Sleep: https://hubermanlab.com/toolkit-for-sleep\nBrainWave (App Store): https://apple.co/3QavGzO\nBrain Waves (Google Play): https://bit.ly/3enO8HP\nWhite, Pink vs. Brown Noise: https://youtu.be/aiyh2j-BfkQ\nMadefor NSDR: https://youtu.be/pL02HRFk2vo\nReveri: https://www.reveri.com\nAnna Park Yerba Mate: https://amzn.to/3wzvfrV\nExamine: https://examine.com\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Focus Toolkit \n00:04:25 Momentous Supplements \n00:05:38 Thesis, LMNT, Eight Sleep \n00:09:37 The “Arrow Model” of Focus: Epinephrine, Acetylcholine & Dopamine\n00:15:15 Modulation vs. Mediation, Importance of Sleep\n00:18:11 Tool: Binaural Beats to Improve Concentration \n00:20:54 Tool: White, Brown & Pink Noise, Transition to Focused State\n00:22:55 Warm-Up for Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity \n00:26:14 Tool: Ultradian Cycles: Warm-Up, Maintaining Focus & Deliberate Defocusing \n00:31:22 How Many Daily Ultradian Cycles Can One Perform? \n00:34:14 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:35 Virtusan: Mental & Physical Health Journeys \n00:36:52 Tool: Fasted vs. Fed States & Focus, Prevent an Afternoon Crash, Ketosis\n00:45:52 Tool: Foods to Improve Focus & Regulating Food Volume\n00:47:53 Tool: Caffeine & Focused Work, Dopamine Efficacy, Alertness\n00:52:55 Tool: Stress & Improved Concentration \n00:55:46 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Focus, Dopamine & Epinephrine \n01:00:39 Layer Focusing Tools & Design Your Own Protocols \n01:01:19 Tool: Short Meditation & Improved Ability to Refocus \n01:07:40 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) & Defocus Periods\n01:12:13 Tool: Hypnosis & Focus/Deep Relaxation States\n01:16:07 Optimal Time of Day to Use Specific Tools\n01:16:46 Tool: Overt Visual Focus & Deliberate Gaze \n01:20:42 Covert Visual Focus; Deliberate Gaze Warm-Up & Focused Work \n01:24:43 Tool: Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids \n01:27:28 Tool: Creatine Monohydrate \n01:29:10 Tool: Alpha-GPC & Acetylcholine, Increased Risk of Stroke? & Garlic \n01:33:52 Tool: L-Tyrosine Supplements & Food\n01:34:47 Combining & Choosing Focus Tools, Variability \n01:36:50 ADHD Prescriptions, Training Neural Circuits, Maintenance & Reduced Dosage\n01:39:19 Tool: Optimal Order Approaching Focus Tools, Prescriptions & Dependency \n01:42:56 Tool: Phenylethylamine & Dopamine\n01:44:50 Tool: Other Supplements to Enhance Dopamine, Epinephrine & Acetylcholine \n01:46:46 Behavioral, Nutrition & Supplement Tools for Focus\n01:49:12 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com",

Dr. Jarvis' research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance, and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stuttering/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone interested in the origins of human speech, language, music and culture and how newer technology, such as social media and texting, changes our brains.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman  \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu...\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Erich Jarvis\nDr. Erick Jarvis' Lab: https://www.jarvislab.net \nRockefeller University: https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/1159-erich-d-jarvis\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cI-fi9MAAAAJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/erichjarvis\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/erich_d_jarvis\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/erich-jarvis-ba73624\n\nOther Resources:\nEarth Biogenome Project: https://www.earthbiogenome.org \nGenomeArk: https://vgp.github.io/genomeark\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Erich Jarvis & Vocal Communication\n00:03:43 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:36 InsideTracker, ROKA, LMNT \n00:08:01 Speech vs. Language, Is There a Difference?  \n00:10:55 Animal Communication, Hand Gestures & Language \n00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution of Modern Language    \n00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders \n00:27:11 Innate Predisposition to Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization\n00:31:34 Genes for Speech & Language\n00:35:49 Learning New or Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes \n00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens) \n00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing\n00:47:32 Singing, Link Between Dancing & Vocal Learning \n00:52:55 Motor Theory of Vocal Learning, Dance \n00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions\n01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions\n01:09:35 Reading & Writing \n01:15:13 Writing by Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing\n01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations\n01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & the Future\n01:36:26 Movement: The Link to Cognitive Growth \n01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation\n01:48:24 Evolution of Skin & Fur Color\n01:51:22 Dr. Erich Jarvis, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals. \n\nAccess the full show notes for this episode: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-brain-health\n\nUse Ask Huberman Lab, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode: https://ai.hubermanlab.com\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Effects of Alcohol Consumption\n00:02:25 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:19 Low to Moderate Alcohol Consumption & Neurodegeneration \n00:06:52 Levels, Eight Sleep, ROKA \n00:10:46 Historical Context & Uses of Alcohol \n00:13:28 Alcohol Metabolism, “Empty Calories” \n00:18:23 Inebriation: Top-Down Inhibition, Impulsivity & Memory Formation\n00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility \n00:27:55 Food & Alcohol Absorption\n00:30:07 Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk for Alcoholism, Blackouts\n00:37:39 Predisposition for Alcoholism; Chronic Consumption, Cortisol & Stress\n00:44:53 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition for Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Too Young\n00:52:27 Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut \n00:59:46 Tool: Improving/Replenishing Gut Microbiome \n01:02:44 Reducing Alcohol Consumption & Stress \n01:04:25 Hangover: Alcohol & Sleep, Anxiety, Headache\n01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure \n01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes\n01:20:45 Types of Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners  \n01:25:25 Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance   \n01:33:36 Are There Any Positive Effects of Alcohol?, Resveratrol \n01:35:42 Alcohol & Brain Thickness \n01:37:11 Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk \n01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins \n01:46:54 Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance\n01:55:09 Negative Effects of Alcohol Consumption \n01:58:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "title": "The Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder",
    "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood. \n\n#HubermanLab #Bipolar #BipolarDisorder\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nBlinkist: https://www.blinkist.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nFull show notes & links to peer-reviewed articles: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Bipolar Disorder \n00:02:23 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:42 Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate\n00:10:23 InsideTracker, ROKA, Blinkist\n00:14:24 Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder\n00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania \n00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability \n00:33:07 Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States\n00:38:20 Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability\n00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder\n00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts \n00:53:06 History of Lithium Treatment \n01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects\n01:05:05 Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection\n01:10:10 Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity\n01:17:11 Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System\n01:22:58 Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine\n01:36:00 Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy \n01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) \n01:48:01 Psylocibin, Cannabis \n01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids \n02:03:31 Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity \n02:06:44 Mania, Creativity & Occupations \n02:15:33 Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment\n02:17:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Charles Zuker, PhD, Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience at Columbia University and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste, the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, emotions and expectation. We consider how sugar-containing and highly processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "In this episode, I explain the biological roles of the four major neuromodulators—dopamine, epinephrine (aka adrenaline), serotonin, and acetylcholine—and describe how these neuromodulators impact a wide variety of mental states and behaviors, including focus, creativity, motivation, drive, learning, alertness, mood, relationships, and feelings of well-being. Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nRapid and reversible control of human metabolism by individual sleep states: https://bit.ly/3RofUmU\nResetting the late timing of ‘night owls’ has a positive impact on mental health and performance: https://bit.ly/3uD54Qd\nSkin exposure to UVB light induces a skin-brain-gonad axis and sexual behavior: https://bit.ly/3uGvOz5\nThe Role of Gene Encoding Variation of DRD4 in the Relationship between Inattention and Seasonal Daylight: https://bit.ly/3Ob154l\nCaffeine increases striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in the human brain: https://go.nature.com/3c6AQi4\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nThe effect of Cissus quadrangularis (CQR-300) and a Cissus formulation (CORE) on obesity and obesity-induced oxidative stress: https://bit.ly/3AChHib\n\nOther Resources:\nThe Darya Rose Show: Sunscreen & Sunprotection with Dr. Brian Diffey: https://bit.ly/3IqHuf0\nHuberman Lab: Controlling Your Dopamine for Motivation Focus & Satisfaction: https://bit.ly/3IqQzVb\nHuberman Lab: ADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://bit.ly/3uDo4Oo\nHuberman Lab: Using Deliberate Cold Exposure for Health & Performance: https://bit.ly/3AFfDGi\nHuberman Lab: Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety: https://bit.ly/3AzlRay\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Optimizing Neurochemicals to Improve Health \n00:03:40 Momentous Supplements\n00:04:30 Sleep & Maintaining Healthy Metabolism \n00:09:52 Tools: How to Wake Up Earlier, Night Owls\n00:19:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, InsideTracker\n00:22:05 Nervous System Overview \n00:31:32 How Neuromodulators Work  \n00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases \n00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators\n00:52:12 The 4 Major Types of Neuromodulators \n01:01:45 Tool Kit 1: Increase Baseline Dopamine & Focus \n01:08:52 Tyrosine-rich Foods & Dopamine \n01:10:59 Dopamine Supplementation: Mucuna Pruriens, L-tyrosine & Phenylethylamine\n01:16:00 Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine \n01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips to Increase Dopamine \n01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness \n01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods \n01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine  \n01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior to Increase Focus & Acetylcholine\n01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior to Increase Serotonin & Feelings of Well-being  \n01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin\n01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol\n02:02:14 Use the Neurochemical Toolkit to Meet Individual Goals \n02:06:44 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

    "description": "In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—a prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nFull show notes & links to peer-reviewed articles: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \n00:03:01 Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, Eight Sleep \n00:08:28 What is OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?\n00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity \n00:15:10 Categories of OCD\n00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions\n00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity \n00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms of OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops\n00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD \n00:46:39 Clinical OCD Diagnosis, Y-BOCS Index \n00:51:38 OCD & Fear, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Exposure Therapy \n01:01:56 Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment \n01:10:18 CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) \n01:22:30 Considerations with SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments\n01:25:17 Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies\n01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators \n01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD \n01:39:29 Ketamine Treatment \n01:41:43 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) \n01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus \n01:47:50 Thoughts Are Not Actions \n01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA \n02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD\n02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine \n02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder \n02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions \n02:31:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors and science to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called “The Ido Portal Method.” Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also explore learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills—cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought-after teachers of movement alive today, Ido shares knowledge in this conversation that can benefit everyone—children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians, trainers and the everyday person.\n\nWatch Ido Portal lead Andrew through his movement practice: https://youtu.be/JMzThWHk4CQ\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more.

    "description": "This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.\n\nWe recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Grief\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\n\nArticles\nCraving love?

    "description": "I describe the mechanisms by which deliberate heat exposure impacts body temperature, metabolism, heart health, hormone production, exercise recovery, cognition, mood, and longevity. I detail specific protocols for deliberate heat exposure, including exposure times, temperature ranges to consider, time of day, and delivery mechanisms (sauna vs. hot bath vs. open air heat, etc.) in order to achieve different specific outcomes, including dramatic growth hormone releases, or reduction in cortisol levels. I also discuss the ability of locally applied heat to heal or otherwise improve various bodily tissues and new data on how local application of heat may induce the conversion of metabolically sluggish white fat to metabolically robust beige fat. \n\n#HubermanLab #Sauna\n  \nThank you to our sponsors\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nI am pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered with Momentous.

    "title": "Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab",
    "description": "I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual’s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates ‘hidden’ sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt’s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body’s performance.\n\n#HubermanLab #Hydration #Salt\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\n\"The preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell\": https://go.nature.com/33X9zuA\n\"Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Risk of Cardiovascular Events\": https://bit.ly/3MOJEGW\n\"Dietary sodium and health: How much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders?\": https://bit.ly/3tSP7UO\n\"Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake\": https://bit.ly/35PCPVg\n\nBook Links\n\"The Salt Fix: Why the Experts Got It All Wrong--and How Eating More Might Save Your Life\": https://amzn.to/3CD1KHi\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Role of Salt  \n00:02:18 The Brain-Body Contract \n00:02:57 Neuropod Cells, Artificial Sweeteners & ‘Hidden’ Cravings \n00:10:57 AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker \n00:15:06 Salt Regulation \n00:17:13 How the Brain Senses Salt\n00:24:15 Salt & Thirst  \n00:29:27 Blood Pressure & Thirst \n00:33:47 Kidneys & Urine Regulation\n00:39:08 Vasopressin: Roles in Libido & Urination \n00:45:46 How Much Salt Do You Need? \n00:56:45 Should You Increase Your Salt Intake? \n01:02:19 Tools: Determining Your Individual Salt Intake\n01:14:02 Iodine, Sea Salt \n01:17:13 Salt: Roles in Stress & Anxiety \n01:24:20 Other Electrolytes: Magnesium & Potassium \n01:27:57 Tools: Effects of Low-carbohydrate Diets & Caffeine \n01:32:28 General Recommendations for Salt Intake  \n01:36:34 Perception of Salt & Sugar Taste, Processed Foods \n01:47:13 Role of Sodium in Neuronal Function, Action Potentials \n01:53:13 Dehydration \n01:55:36 What Salt Intake is Best for You? \n02:00:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "My guest this episode is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and environment shape the gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of the microbiome and how the mode of delivery into the world (cesarean section, C-section, or vaginal birth) shapes the gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter the microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating with other organs, including the brain.\n\nDr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods, but not fiber, increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical of Western diets—for example, high-fat, low-fiber processed foods—can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, to optimize their gut microbiome and health.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the psychology and biology of desire, love and attachment. I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and “positive delusion.” I outline how self-awareness can shift one’s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships.  Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship. \n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Love\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\nRomantic love: an fMRI study of a neural mechanism for mate choice: https://bit.ly/34EuPWq\nRelationship-specific Encoding of Social Touch in Somatosensory and Insular Cortice: https://bit.ly/3rIambT\nInvestigating real-life emotions in romantic couples: a mobile EEG study: https://go.nature.com/3sG4ZJs\nBrain Knows Who Is on the Same Wavelength: Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility of a Female–Male Relationship: https://bit.ly/3rMP3pO\nManipulation of Self-Expansion Alters Responses to Attractive Alternative Partners: https://bit.ly/3LuTYDA\nRandomized Clinical Trial on the Use of PHYSTA Freeze-Dried Water Extract of Eurycoma longifolia for the Improvement of Quality of Life and Sexual Well-Being in Men: https://bit.ly/3gKEtJy\n\nFor additional links and resources on Maca, Tongkat Ali and Tribulus, also see links in “Human Effect Matrix” at examine.com. \n\nBook Links\nAttached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love: https://amzn.to/3HMLLZ2\nRight Brain Psychotherapy: https://amzn.to/3HJjXVs\nThe Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country’s Foremost Relationship Expert: https://amzn.to/3LzS1FN\n\nOther Links\nThe Gottman Institute Love Lab: A Research-Based Approach to Relationships: https://bit.ly/3Bkrxn3\nNew York Times - The 36 Questions that Lead to Love (1/9/2015): https://nyti.ms/3HPAnvF\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Desire, Love & Attachment \n00:02:59 Odor, Perceived Attractiveness & Birth Control\n00:08:04 Thesis, AG1 (Athletic Greens), InsideTracker \n00:14:13 Romance: Balancing Love & Desire\n00:19:00 Animal Studies, Vasopressin & Monogamy \n00:22:06 Strange Situation Task, Childhood Attachment Styles\n00:32:52 Adult Attachment Styles\n00:38:50 Secure Attachment \n00:41:23 Autonomic Arousal: The “See-Saw”\n00:50:39 Tool: Self-Awareness, Healthy Interdependence\n00:53:11 Neurobiology of Desire, Love & Attachment   \n00:58:02 Empathy & Mating & the Autonomic Nervous System\n01:10:02 Positive Delusion, Touch\n01:15:20 Relationship Stability \n01:21:22 Selecting Mates, Recognition of Autonomic Tone\n01:38:28  Neural Mechanisms of Romantic Attachment \n01:47:43 Autonomic Coordination in Relationships \n01:56:13 Infidelity & Cheating\n02:08:56 “Chemistry”, Subconscious Processes\n02:12:44 Tools: Libido & Sex Drive \n02:20:20 Maca (Maca root)   \n02:25:58 Tongkat Ali (Longjack) \n02:28:56 Tribulus terrestris \n02:33:14 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify/Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the transformative nature of play—how it changes our feelings, thoughts and actions and indeed, how it can rewire our brain to function better in all contexts. I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience #Play\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAG1 (Athletic Greens) - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\nReading on a smartphone affects sigh generation, brain activity, and comprehension - https://go.nature.com/3rycDqe\nIn search of the neurobiological substrates for social playfulness in mammalian brains - https://bit.ly/3rvDvXP\nIs chess just a game, or is it a mirror that reflects the child's inner world? - https://bit.ly/3gsUNyr\nA new structural model for the study of adult playfulness: Assessment and exploration of an understudied individual differences variable - https://bit.ly/3otwvIU\n5MinuteConsult Journal Club - https://bit.ly/3sf7H8w\n\nBook Links\nPersonal play identity and the fundamental elements in its development process - https://bit.ly/331oYtm\nSpark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain - https://amzn.to/3uLnC1B\nPlay It Away: A Workaholic’s Cure for Anxiety - https://amzn.to/3AZFUgx\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 The Power of Play \n00:02:23 Tool: Reading on Smart Phones, Sighing & Learning  \n00:09:14 AG1 (Athletic Greens), Roka, Helix Sleep \n00:13:57 Homeostatic Regulation of Play\n00:23:53 Childhood Play & Mindsets\n00:29:21 Contingency Testing  \n00:32:17 The (Power of) Playful Mindset\n00:36:13 Body Postures \n00:44:03 Rule Testing & Breaking \n00:48:24 Role Play\n00:50:39 Neurobiology of Low-stakes Play\n00:54:22 Expanding Capabilities through Tinkering \n01:00:03 Play Is THE Portal to Neuroplasticity \n01:04:44 Adulthood Play\n01:10:14 Fire Together, Wire Together \n01:18:03 Trauma & Play Deficits & Recovery\n01:23:25 Competition & Dynamic Movement\n01:27:36 Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty  \n01:32:52 Personal Play Identity \n01:37:24 Play Transforms Your Future Self  \n01:40:55 Recommendations for Play\n01:44:25 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify/Apple Reviews, YouTube, Sponsors, Patreon, Instagram, Twitter, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs, and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise and even the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes how satisfying it is to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also explains how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance. Throughout the episode, Dr. Crum shares high-quality peer-reviewed scientific findings that we can all leverage to improve health and performance in our lives.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit.

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman, Distinguished Professor of Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles and a pioneering world expert in the science of respiration (breathing). We discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. We also explore how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time and more. Additionally, we cover specific breathing protocols such as box breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing and how each of these affects the brain and body. We examine physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of master class on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "title": "The Science of Making & Breaking Habits",
    "description": "In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes. \n\nI describe two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.\n\nI also discuss \"task bracketing\" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. \n\nThe science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Habits #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - http://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - http://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - http://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nExcellent review on science of habits - https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033417\nMeta-analysis on habits - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1539449219876877\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Habits; New Programs\n00:02:30 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity\n00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits\n00:11:40 How Long It (Really) Takes to Form a Habit; Limbic-Friction\n00:16:07 Linchpin Habits \n00:18:55 Mapping Your Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence\n00:22:55 Automaticity\n00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations\n00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors\n00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum\n00:37:08 States of Mind, Not Scheduling Time Predicts Habit Strength\n00:38:16 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 1\n00:46:29 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 2\n00:55:24 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 3\n01:01:34 Habit Flexibility\n01:04:57 Should We Reward Ourselves?

    "description": "In this episode, I am joined by Dr. David Sinclair, tenured professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and an expert researcher in the field of longevity. Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To and the host of the Lifespan podcast, which launches January 5, 2022.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the process. We cover fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin and NMN. We also explore the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure and why excessive iron load is harmful. Further topics include food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells) and the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine biological versus chronological age. We look ahead to the future of longevity research and technology.\n\nThis episode includes extensive basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "This episode I discuss the science of social bonding- the process by which we form attachments. I explain the neural and hormonal basis for \"social homeostasis\" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding.

    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Berson, Professor and Chairman of Neuroscience at Brown University. Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves.\n\nHere Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see and remember, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats.\n\nWe discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just under two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the \"threat reflex\" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how \"top-down\" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine and other drug-assisted therapies and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.\n\n#fear #trauma #stress\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Fear, Trauma & Trauma \n00:02:15 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:06:49 What is Fear? \n00:11:45 Autonomic Arousal: “Alertness” vs. “Calmness”\n00:13:44 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis)\n00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits for Fear\n00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing\n00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective or Dangerous”\n00:35:58 Attaching Fear to Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory\n00:41:45 How Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA\n00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears\n00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies for Fear\n00:57:56 Repetition of Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences with Good\n01:05:28 EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing\n01:14:00 Social Connection & Isolation Are Chemically Powerful\n01:18:23 Trans-Generational Trauma\n01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin\n01:39:25 How Do You Know If You Are Traumatized? \n01:46:16 Deliberate Brief Stress Can Erase Fears & Trauma\n01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas In 5 Minutes Per Day\n01:59:42 Nutrition, Sleep, & Other General Support Erasing Fear & Trauma\n02:02:30 Supplements for Anxiety, Fear: Saffron, Inositol, Kava\n02:10:00 Synthesis \n02:11:46 Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Patreon, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "In this episode my guest is Dr. David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the founding members of the field of evolutionary psychology.\n\nDr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short- and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners.\n\nWe also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences in infidelity between men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans and what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad” — features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.\n\nThis episode is sure to interest anyone who is single or in a relationship and wants to understand how people select mates, as well as anyone interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "title": "The Science of Gratitude & How to Build a Gratitude Practice",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the science of gratitude, which has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nNeural Correlates of Gratitude (Damasio) - https://bit.ly/3oS8TNr\nReducing Inflammatory Cytokines & Fear With Gratitude - https://bit.ly/3oPsSwv\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises\n00:01:50 Controlling Heart Rate with Story\n00:04:33 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:09:11 Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice\n00:12:20 Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits \n00:17:50 Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice\n00:21:22 Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude\n00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context\n00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables\n00:34:55 Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story\n00:42:30 Theory of Mind Is Key\n00:45:50 Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration\n00:52:28 Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits \n00:56:15 You Can’t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving\n00:59:55 How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation\n01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day \n01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude\n01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin \n01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces\n01:18:50 The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol\n01:24:25 Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements (Thorne)\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Time Perception, Note on Fasting & Supplements\n00:05:12 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker\n00:09:25 Entrainment, Circannual Entrainment, Melatonin\n00:13:20 Seasonal Oscillations in Testosterone & Estrogen, Tool 1\n00:16:06 Circadian Timing, Tools 1, 2, 3 (for Circadian Entrainment)\n00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window\n00:23:00 When Circadian Entrainment is Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers\n00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus\n00:31:42 Our Sense of the Passage of Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective\n00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead to Time Overestimation; Frame Rate \n00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate\n00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across the Day; Tool 7: When to Do Rigid vs. Creative Work\n00:42:38 Example of Tool 7\n00:43:38 How Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance\n00:44:38 Trauma, “Over-clocking” & Memories; Adjusting Rates of Experience\n00:50:04 Why Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal\n00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8\n00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate in Discomfort\n00:56:30 Fun “Feels Fast” BUT Is Remembered as Slow; Boring Stuff “Feels Slow,” Recall As Fast\n01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding with Places & People\n01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets the Start of Each Time Bin on Our Experience\n01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units of Each Day)\n01:11:58 Synthesis & Book Suggestion (Your Brain Is a Time Machine by D.

    "description": "In this episode, I talk to Dr. Duncan French, Ph.D., the Vice President of Performance at the UFC Performance Institute and a world-class performance specialist. We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced catecholamines can increase or decrease testosterone depending on duration and mindset. We discuss specific cold and heat therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, promoting heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally. This episode is intended for anyone interested in athletic and mental performance: athletes, students and recreational exercisers, and includes both science and many practical tools people can apply in their own training.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "In this episode I host Dr. Samer Hattar, Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep–wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight saving time leads to outsized effects on our biology because our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. He offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jet lag, shift work and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "This episode I describe science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and for nervous system health generally.\n\nI describe 10 tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which make up the \"structural fat\" of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.\n\nThen I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,  in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.\n\n#HubermanLab #Diet #Brain\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nRETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning Featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman:\nhttps://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview on Anthocyanins & Cognition - https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/23/4255\nReview on Creatine & Brain Health Studies - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/586\nReview on \"Rethinking Food Reward\" - www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011643\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Food & Brain Function Introduction\n00:02:08 Summary: Critical Aspects of Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting\n00:04:19 Sponsors: Roka, Athletic Greens, Headspace\n00:08:24 Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (Zero-Cost Tools) Online\n00:09:22 Eating to Enhance Brain Function & Foundational Aspects of Brain Health \n00:13:00 Eating Fats for Brain Health, EFAs Phospholipids (Tool 1: 1-3g EPA Omega-3/day) \n00:20:35 Phosphatidylserine (Tool 2: 300mg/day)\n00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold)\n00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4)\n00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week)\n00:32:22 Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day) \n00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries) \n00:41:19 L-Glutamine (Tool: 1-10g/day) & Offsetting Apnea & Inflammation\n00:49:23 Neural Basis of Food Preference, Yum, Yuck, Meh; Taste, Guts, & Beliefs\n00:55:25 Taste is 100% In your Head\n00:59:50 Gut Neurons Controlling Food Preference: Neuropod Cells; (Tool 7: Fermented Foods) \n01:06:14 Capsule Probiotics, Brain Fog \n01:07:16 Learning to Like Specific Tastes: Sweetness & Brain Metabolism\n01:12:11 Hard-Wiring & Soft-Wiring\n01:13:25 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners: Safe or Harmful Depends on (Glucose) Context\n01:18:15 Non-Caloric Sweetener & Insulin; (Tool 8: Don’t Have w/Glucose Elevating Foods)\n01:22:17 Beliefs & Thoughts; The Insula; (Tool 9: Pairing-Based Reshaping Food Preferences) \n01:30:42 Liking Neuro-Healthy Foods & Bettering Brain Metabolism (Tool 10); Food Wars\n01:36:05 Food Reward & Diabetes, Obesity; Important Review Article (See Caption)\n01:38:28 Synthesis, Zero-Cost Support, Future Topic Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "title": "Effects of Fasting & Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss & Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #41",
    "description": "This episode I discuss the science and practice of fasting also called time-restricted feeding. I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how \"fasted\" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.\n\n#HubermanLab #Fasting #FatLoss\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nRETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning Featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman\nhttps://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nComprehensive Review On Fasting In Humans: https://bit.ly/3BwIyd7\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction, Blood Glucose & Mortality, Mice Vs.

    "description": "In this episode, I am joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and world expert on the science of temperature regulation. We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how almost everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and, in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run farther and faster as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs! Our conversation includes many practical tools and mechanistic science.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "This episode serves as a sort of “Dopamine Masterclass”. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine. \n\n#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nLogitech Event - Rethink Education: The Biology of Learning\nhttps://info.logitech.com/ReThink-Education.html\n\nSupport Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview on Dopamine: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00455-7\nCold Exposure & Dopamine: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004210050065\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction & Tool 1 to Induce Lasting Dopamine\n00:04:48 Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace\n00:09:10 Upcoming (Zero-Cost) Neuroplasticity Seminar for Educators\n00:09:58 What Dopamine (Really) Does\n00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits for Dopamine \n00:18:14 How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly\n00:22:03 Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine\n00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate\n00:28:00 Your Dopamine History Really Matters \n00:30:30 Parkinson’s & Drugs That Kill Dopamine Neurons.

    "description": "In this episode I discuss medical research on psychedelic compounds with Dr. Matthew Johnson, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We explore the biology and medical clinical trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT and LSD.\n\nDr. Johnson shares what the clinical trials in his lab reveal about the potential these compounds hold for treating depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD and other disorders of the mind. He describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory from start to finish, including the conditions that support optimal clinical outcomes. He also outlines potential hazards along with common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine.\n\nDr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks certain people and age groups face when using psychedelics, and the ever-evolving legal and pharmaceutical landscape surrounding these substances. He discusses how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to shape the future trajectory of psychiatric medicine.\n\nAs one of a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds, Dr. Johnson offers unprecedented insight into how they can be woven into other psychiatric treatments, changing one’s sense of self and reality.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional \"blinks\" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD). \n\nThe role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss what drives hunger and satiety, and the role our brain, stomach,  fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.\n\nThen I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the \"perfectionist\" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks.\n\nI review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD.

    "description": "In this episode, I interview Dr. Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., Professor of Biology, Neurology & Neurosurgery at Stanford University. We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress-mitigation techniques, including exercise, determines health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone—how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior but does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He further explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. We also discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will and whether we have any, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "This episode, I explain what major depression is at the biological and psychological level and the various treatments that peer-reviewed studies have revealed can help prevent and treat depression. I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.\n\nFor an updated list of our current sponsors, please visit our website as previous sponsors mentioned in this podcast episode may no longer be affiliated with us: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\n\nLinks\nReview of EPAs for the Treatment of Depression - https://bit.ly/2Wl15ti\nReview of Creatine for the Treatment of Depression - https://www.mdpi.com/520864\nRecent Study on the Clinical Use of Psilocybin for Treatment of Depression - https://bit.ly/3sFSGMM\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Mood Disorders & Maintaining Mental Health (Protocol 1)\n00:07:10 Sponsors\n00:11:15 Major Depression\n00:18:40 “Anti-Self” Confabulation\n00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression\n00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin\n00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving, Serotonin/Emotions\n00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P\n00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol \n00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress \n00:50:50 Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills\n00:52:50 Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)\n00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.\n00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*\n01:02:50 How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid\n01:05:25 Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression \n01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*\n01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function\n01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin*\n01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n01:54:50 Summary of Protocols Covered\n02:00:10 Support & Additional Resources\n\n#Depression #HubermanLab #Dopamine\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "In this episode I interview Dr. Anna Lembke, MD, Chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist and expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, medication etc. She is also an expert in the opioid crisis and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.\n\nWe discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our “dopamine balance” plays in creating addiction. We also explore the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying, and she explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in daily life—adjusts dopamine levels in our brains.\n\nThis episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.\n\nFor an up-to-date list of our current sponsors, please visit our website: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors.

    "description": "This episode I discuss our sense of pain and pleasure: where and how they each arise in our mind and body and various ways to control their intensity. I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain \"syndromes\" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.\n\nNote: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc..

    "description": "This episode I describe how the organs of the body influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.\n\n#HubermanLab #Brain #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code: huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nSonnenburg, Cell Press Study - https://bit.ly/SonnenburgCellPress\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Your Sense of Self: Interoception\n00:01:25 Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation \n00:03:30 Attributions\n00:08:22 Main Drivers of Feelings & Performance\n00:11:45 Brain-Body: A Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue \n00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue  \n00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing\n00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors\n00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood\n00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert While Calm\n00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex\n00:42:47 Gut Volume & The Desire to Open Your Mouth \n00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting \n00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar\n00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients \n00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)\n01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome \n01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented \n01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods\n01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine\n01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin\n01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog\n01:21:45 Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema\n01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.\n01:30:40 Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT\n01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly\n01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress\n01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions\n01:45:00 Sensing Other People’s Emotions via the Body\n01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat \n01:50:40 Conclusions & Resources\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "This episode I describe how we see, meaning how our eyes focus, convert  light information into electricity the rest of the brain can understand and how our brain  creates the incredible thing we experience as “sight”. I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand-- it is for anyone that values their brain and their eyesight, whether young, adult-age or advanced age. \n\nSome Huberman Lab podcast sponsors may have changed, so please visit our website for the current list: https://www.hubermanlab.com/sponsors\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLink to eye exercise videos for smooth pursuit, amblyopia, etc. \n(Numbering of videos does correspond to numbers in episode caption.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/VisualExercises/videos\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:04:51 Protocol: Concurrent Training For Endurance, Strength, Hypertrophy \n00:07:24 The Senses, Vision, Seeing & What We Should All Do To See Better  \n00:10:35 Our Eyes: What They Really Do, & How They Work \n00:14:30 Converting Light Into Electricity Language: Photoreceptors, Retinal Ganglion Cells   \n00:17:00 We Don’t See Anything Directly: It Is All A Comparison Of Reflected Light \n00:19:35 Dogs, Cats, Snakes, Squirrels, Shrimps, Diving Birds, & You(r View Of The World) \n00:24:05 Everything You See Is A Best Guess, Blind Spots \n00:25:50 Depth Perception \n00:28:00 Subconscious Vision: Light, Mood, Metabolism, Dopamine; Frog’s Skin In Your Eyes \n00:32:00 Blue-Yellow Light, Sunlight; & Protocol 1 For Better Biology & Psychology;  \n00:35:00 Protocol 2: Prevent & Offset Near-Sightedness (Myopia): Outdoors 2 Hours Per Day \n00:42:00 Improving Focus: Visual & Mental; Accommodation, Your Pupils & Your Bendy Lens \n00:48:50 Protocol 3: Distance Viewing For 20min For Every 90 Minutes of “Close Viewing” \n00:52:20 Protocol 4: Self-Generated Optic Flow; Move Yourself Through Space Daily \n00:54:26 Protocol 5: Be More Alert; Eyelids, Eye Size, Chin Position, Looking Up Versus Down \n00:59:21 Protocol 6: Sleep In A Very Dark Room To Prevent Myopia (Nearsightedness) \n01:02:55 Color Vision, Colorblindness, Use Magentas Not Reds,  \n01:04:32 Protocol 7: Keeping Your Vision Sharp With Distance Viewing Every Day \n01:06:05 Protocol 8: Smooth Pursuit \n01:08:48 Protocol 9: Near-Far Visual Training 2-3 Minutes 3-4 Times a Week \n01:13:33 Protocol 10: Red Light, Emerging Protocol To Improve Photoreceptors & Vision \n01:16:20 Dry Eyes; Blinking, Protocol 11  \n01:18:40 Lazy Eye, Binocular Vision, Amblyopia; Triggering Rapid Brain Plasticity; Protocol 12 \n01:24:48 Protocol 12: Determine Your Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training  \n01:27:57 Visual Hallucinations: The Consequence of An Under-Active Visual Brain\n01:29:47 Protocol 13: Snellen Chart: A Simple, Cost-Free Way To Test & Maintain Vision  \n01:33:00 Vitamin A, Lutein, Idebenone, Zeaxanthine, Astaxanthin, Blood Flow \n01:44:20 Summary of Protocols, Vital Point About Blood & Oxygen For Vision\n01:46:00 Episode Length, Captions, Zero-Cost Support, Instagram, Searching Topics\n\n#HubermanLab #EyeSight #Vision\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

    "description": "This episode I discuss endurance: our ability to perform effort over extended amounts of time. I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the \"extra gear\" we all can leverage for effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us to access untapped energetic resources. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code: huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nMechanistic review of training adaptations:\nhttp://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/8/6/a029769.full.pdf\n\nProtocols: \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/how-to-build-endurance-in-your-brain-and-body/\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:45 Why Everyone Should Train Endurance\n00:09:49 All Episodes Now Searchable at hubermanlab.com & The Neural Network\n00:11:28 How To Maintain Muscle \n00:12:56 Endurance: It’s Not What You Think, Crossover With Brain Function\n00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths To ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones\n00:18:00 The Vital Need For Oxygen: But Why?\n00:19:00 What Allows Us To Endure (Anything)?\n00:20:46 The 5 Things That Allow Us To Persist/Endure & What Causes Quitting\n00:22:50 Why You Quit: It IS All In Your Mind\n00:27:19 The “90% Mental” Myth\n00:28:10 The Critical Need For Carbohydrates & Electrolytes (& Sometimes Ketones)\n00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Is Key\n00:31:36 Using Your Blood, Heart, & Lungs To Go Longer, Further, With More Intensity\n00:35:40 An Excellent Review on the Science of Training Adaptations (See Caption On YouTube)\n00:37:15 The 4 Kinds of Endurance \n00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful for Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience\n00:41:50 Protocol For Building Muscular Endurance.

    "title": "How to Lose Fat with Science-Based Tools",
    "description": "This episode I describe the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. I explain how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day-- a practice is rarely discussed but very well supported by the science literature. I also discuss an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. I discuss if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.\n\n#HubermanLab #FatLoss #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - http://insidetracker.com/huberman\nExpressVPN - http://expressvpn.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - http://athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nCold Protocols via The Cold Plunge:\nhttps://thecoldplunge.com/pages/protocols\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab/\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:06:00 Fat Loss: The Key Role of Neurons \n00:08:44 The First Law of Fat Loss \n00:11:00 Neurons Connect To Fat!

I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more.

    "title": "Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling",
    "description": "This episode I explain the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation-- and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise.

I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks.

    "description": "This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite-- and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone CCK, and more. \n\nNote: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I misspoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said “P-M-O-C” but should have said “POMC”. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: \"proopiomelanocortin\".\n\n#HubermanLab #Hunger #Hormones\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): httpS://athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Lustig’s Lecture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxyxcTZccsE \nPaper In Cell Metabolism On Processed Food Effects - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008  \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:06:59 Hunger: Neural & Hormonal Control  \n00:08:32 Chewing & Hunger  \n00:11:05 Siamese Rats Reveal the Importance of Hormones In Hunger \n00:13:08 Neurons That Powerfully Control Hunger by Releasing Specific Hormones \n00:16:28 Anorexia & Extreme Overeating\n00:16:57 Why Sunlight Suppresses Hunger: a-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (a -MSH) \n00:20:03 Blue-blockers, Injecting a-MSH: Instant Tan & Priapism \n00:22:30 Ghrelin: A Hormone That Determines When You Get Hungry, & That You Can Control \n00:24:40 Meal Timing Determines Hunger, Not the Other Way Around \n00:27:20 Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting \n00:29:35 How To Rationally Adjust Meal Schedules: The 45min Per Day Rule \n00:33:02 CCK (Cholecystokinin): A Hormone In Your Gut That Says “No Mas!” \n00:34:55 Eating For Amino Acids, Fatty Acids & Sugar  \n00:39:05 L-Glutamine: Stimulates the Immune System & Reduces Sugar Cravings \n00:43:42 Things To Avoid: Emulsifiers; Alter Gut Mucosa & Nutrient Sensing \n00:49:32 “A Calorie Is NOT A Calorie” After All \n00:52:36 Insulin & Glucose: Hyperglycemia, Euglycemia, & Hypogylcemia  \n00:56:12 The Order Your Eat Foods Matters: Managing Your Blood Glucose & Glucagon \n01:02:40 Movement, Exercise & GLUT-4 \n01:04:50 Why Sugar Stimulates Your Appetite  \n01:05:40 Keeping Blood Sugar Stable With Specific Exercises, The Power Of Insulin Sensitivity \n01:07:55 High-Intensity Exercise, Glycogen & Metabolism \n01:10:28 Cholesterol, HDL, LDL & Glucose Management: Ovaries, Testes, Liver, Adrenals \n01:15:00 Prescription Compounds That Reduce Blood Glucose: Metformin  \n01:16:45 Berberine: A Potent Glucose Buffer That Also Adjusts Cholesterol Levels, Canker Sores \n01:22:05 Chromium, L-Carnitine, Ginseng, Caffeine, Magnesium, Stevia, Vitamin B3, & Zinc \n01:24:34 Acids: Vinegar, Lemons & Limes & False Alkalinity  \n01:26:40 Ketogenic Diets (In Brief): Effects On Blood Glucose, Thyroid Hormones \n01:28:10 Diabetes, Filtering Blood, Sweet Urine \n01:31:08 The Power of GLP-1 & Yerba Mate For Controlling Appetite, Electrolytes \n01:35:19 Summary & Notes About Thyroid, Estrogen, Testosterone \n01:37:20 Zero Cost & Sponsor-Based Ways To Support The Huberman Lab Podcast \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "This episode I discuss the hormones testosterone and estrogen and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior at ages after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed.\n\n**Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery.\n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Estrogen \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nFour Sigmatic - https://foursigmatic.com/huberman \nBlinkist - https://blinkist.com/huberman \nTheragun - https://theragun.com/huberman \n\nBloodwork sponsor\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nReferences:\nExamine: https://examine.com\n“Behavioral Endocrinology” by Nelson and Kriegsfeld 5th Ed.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:50 Hormone Optimization  \n00:07:00 Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health \n00:10:03 Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels & Ratios  \n00:15:46 The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine\n00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation \n00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males \n00:23:10 How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence \n00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding \n00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios  \n00:28:45 Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin \n00:31:24 How Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6 \n00:33:20 How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?  \n00:34:18 Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, & Mate Recognition \n00:43:33 Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen & Testosterone \n00:47:44 Mouth vs. Nose Breathing & Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects \n00:51:11 How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios \n00:53:49 02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise \n00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns & Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH \n00:57:44 Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency \n01:04:39 Specificity of Hormone Effects \n01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads \n01:14:10 How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing \n01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)

    "title": "How Hormones Shape Sexual Development",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss how hormones such as testosterone and estrogen and their derivatives impact the early development of the brain and body and their maturation. I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Estrogene\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nMood Meter: https://moodmeterapp.com/ \nNSDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo \nCell Phones & Hormones: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138021/ \nFinger Length Ratios & Hormones/Sexual Orientation: \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/35006555 \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940503/ \nLeVay Study in Science Magazine on Sexual Orientation Brain Dimorphism: \nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/253/5023/1034\n\nTimestamps below.\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:06:47 Announcement: Mood Meter App Works Again\n00:08:00 Maximizing Learning from the Podcast\n00:10:00 New Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol, Spanish Subtitles \n00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior \n00:14:15 Hormones Basics \n00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex,  \n00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition of Feminization  \n00:19:00 Placenta Is An Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone \n00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex \n00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn On Genes \n00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization \n00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development  \n00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics \n00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces  \n00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes The Brain  \n00:33:15 Breast Development In Males: Aromatase; Puberty, & Steroids in Athletes \n00:34:50 Estrogen Powerfully Controls Brain Development In All Individuals \n00:35:19 Avoiding Hormonal Disruption In Children & Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc.  \n00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline \n00:44:20 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS\n00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes “Masculine” Brain Circuits, Testosterone \n00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: In Babies, Puberty & Adults \n00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects On Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles \n01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around the World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase  \n01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss  \n01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates By Pubertal Rates \n01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Hypertrophied Clitorises: Androstenedione \n01:14:26 Intersex Moles \n01:15:40 Marijuana Plants, Pollens: Plant-To-Animal “Warfare” \n01:20:08 Finger Length Ratios, Prenatal Hormone Exposure & Sexual Orientation \n01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms with Sexual Orientation \n01:32:00 “Older Brother Effects”: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent Brothers \n01:35:06 The Path Forward & A Warning\n01:35:55 Support & Your Questions \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shapes our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.\n\n#HubermanLab #Emotions #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nExpressVPN - http://expressvpn.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - http://magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nLinks:\nNSDR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo\nMood Meter App - https://moodmeterapp.com/\nAdolescence and The Brain - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770\nVagus and Depression - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/lighting-the-brain\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:10 Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link \n00:07:40 Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable  \n00:10:53 To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty  \n00:15:21 Your First Feeling Was Anxiety \n00:17:36 What Are “Healthy Emotions”?  \n00:19:03 Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App \n00:21:08 The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself \n00:24:00 You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions \n00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment  \n00:32:40 “Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written) \n00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic \n00:37:50 An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias \n00:42:19 Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture  \n00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive \n00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection \n00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage  \n00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent \n00:58:26 Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds \n01:00:25 Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal \n01:07:48 Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet \n01:11:05 “Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies  \n01:14:18 Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness \n01:16:15 How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody \n01:18:32 Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States \n01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior  \n01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy \n01:27:00 Ways To Increase Oxytocin \n01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities \n01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body \n01:35:18 A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience \n01:30:43 MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework \n01:38:54 Roundup, Various Forms of Support \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

    "description": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast. I am Dr. Andrew Huberman. \n\nMy plan in creating this podcast is to discuss neuroscience: how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body controls our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. I will also discuss tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.\n\nUpcoming episodes will cover: sleep and how to get better at sleeping, learning, dreaming, as well as motivation and focus and how to access more focus. We will also cover neuroplasticity, fear, and stress.\n\nAlong the way, I will discuss behavioral tools (\"do's and don'ts\"), and the role of nutrition, exercise, supplements, prescription drugs and electronic devices for measuring and changing the way our nervous systems work.\n\nTo suggest additional topics, please enter them in the comment section below. Also, be sure to \"like\" any comments suggesting topics you're interested in. I will shape the content of future podcasts accordingly.\n\nThank you for your interest in science!\n\n-Andrew\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter",
