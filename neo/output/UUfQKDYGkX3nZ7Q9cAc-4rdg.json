    "description": "In the 5th century, St. Cyril of Alexandria arose as one of the foremost defenders of orthodox Christology. Today, he's primarily remembered for his debates against Nestorius, but for St. Cyril, Christology was not just an isolated piece of theology. It was deeply interconnected to soteriology. In other words, having a correct view of who Christ is leads to a correct view of how we're saved. \n\nThrough his insights into Christology, I came across his beautiful vision of what Jesus's famous words, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" mean. That's what we'll be covering in this video, and as you'll see, it has important ramifications for how we understand the atonement. \n\nRead the book: https://amzn.to/4pQAqNm \n\nSupport the Channel:\nGive monthly: https://patreon.com/gospelsimplicity    \nMake a one-time donation: https://paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nBook a meeting: https://calendly.com/gospelsimplicity/meet-with-austin\nRead my writings: https://austinsuggs.substack.com\n\n00:00 Atonement Theories\n02:49 What's at Stake\n04:44 Background on St. Cyril of Alexandria\n06:13 St. Cyril's Teaching\n09:25 Conclusion\n10:11 Post-script",

And, if change at least can be good in some instances, how do we tell the good from the bad? \n\nTo answer those questions, theologians turn to a concept known as \"doctrinal development.\" St. John Henry Newman, a Catholic, is the figure most commonly associated with this idea, but he is by no means the only person to take up these questions. At the same time that Newman was writing, a Swiss-born, German-educated Reformed minister teaching in America, Philip Schaff, was also writing about this. But he took a different approach.

    "description": "We are finite and God is infinite -- how than can we speak intelligently of God? Is theology a hopeless endeavor? \n\nThroughout the Christian tradition, theologians have wrestled with this question. On the one hand, Christians believe that God has revealed himself in the person of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, Christians maintain that human words and concepts inevitably fall short when trying to articulate the essence of God. So, where does that leave us? \n\nIn this video, I look at two ways Christians have sought to approach this: apophatic theology and the principle of analogy. \n\nApophatic theology is an approach to theology in which we say what God is not, rather than what God is. The principle of analogy, or, \"analogical predication,\" is the idea that we can say what God is like, but not what God is. \n\nBy examining these two approaches, we're led to recognize a need for theological humility while simultaneously not despairing that we can't know anything at all about God. \n\nChurch Fathers Resources: https://churchwritings.com/\nDionysius: https://ccel.org/ccel/rolt/dionysius/dionysius.v.html#fna_v-p6.3\n@ThomisticInstitute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY_GA6mbCSg\n\nSupport the Channel:\nGive monthly: https://patreon.com/gospelsimplicity    \nMake a one-time donation: https://paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nBook a meeting: https://calendly.com/gospelsimplicity/meet-with-austin\nRead my writings: https://austinsuggs.substack.com\n\n00:00 What Is Theology?\n02:20 Apophatic Theology\n04:28 Analogy\n06:48 Why This Matters",

The animating cause of the debate was whether it's right to call Mary the Mother of God. \n\nOver the years, the nuances of Nestorius's and Cyril's thoughts have often been lost. Let me be clear: this video is not a historical reconstruction of Nestorius's position. This video is a look at St. Cyril's Christology, and even more so, an examination of what he felt was at stake in getting the incarnation right and why mystery plays such an important role in that. \n\nIn the course of the video, I talk about how the incarnation affects our soteriology, epistemology, and anthropology. \n\nBook: https://amzn.to/4hAV6FX\n\nVideos like these are some of the most difficult for me to make.

    "description": "For the first time in history, the Archbishop of Canterbury is a woman. What does that mean for Anglicans?\n\nIn this video, I try to walk carefully through the theological controversies surrounding this appointment. To do so, I talk about the nature of the church, the requirements for a true eucharist, an Anglican understanding of Apostolic Succession, and finally, whether women can be priests. As part of this, I offer what I think is the strongest argument against women's ordination and the corresponding strongest defense (neither of which are original to me). \n\nAlong the way, I engage with Pope John Paul II, Sean Luke of Anglican Aesthetics, Rowan Williams, and Sarah Coakley, to name a few. \n\nAs I mention in this video, this is not a comprehensive case for women's ordination. Nor is it a video meant to convince non-Anglicans. My chief argument is that, on Anglican principles, this need not be cause for doom and gloom. \n\nWant to support the channel?

I filmed it, edited it, and scheduled it for the end of the week.\n\nThen Charlie Kirk was assassinated. \n\nSuddenly, the video felt both more necessary, but also potentially tone deaf. In the end, I decided to keep the video, but add onto it to address this tragic news.\n\nI didn't know Charlie Kirk, nor would we agree on everything, but I am deeply troubled by rising rates of political violence from all sides in this country. Additionally, I'm worried about how we respond. \n\nIt seems to me that we find ourselves as a church and a culture at a pivotal crossroads. Already, the way of anger has been seen as the most effective way of reaching people for either the gospel or our political ideologies. The thing about that, is anger and violence only seem to breed more of the same. And that really concerns me. \n\nThis video is about those concerns. \n\nWant to support the channel?

It was there that Papal Infallibility was proclaimed as dogma, and the Christian world is still feeling the reverberations of that declaration. \n\nAnd yet, even for most well-informed Christians, this is all they know about the council. But the full story reveals much more. Yes, Vatican 1 declared papal infallibility as dogma, but it also had important things to say about faith, reason, and dogma in general. More than that though, understanding the council takes more than reading the documents--you need to peel back the layers and see the story that shaped the council. It's one where vibrant characters worked hard to push competing visions of what the church is and how it should address the problems of the modern world. \n\nBooks mentioned: https://amzn.to/485d28W\n\nWant to support the channel?

Why is that? \n\nIn this video, I dive into a few reasons why, at least at the level of YouTube apologetics, Protestants are lagging behind Catholics. \n\nThis isn't a video about who's right and who's wrong. It's a video about the reality of the dynamics involved in this space. As I mention in the video, I'm not too fond of the language of winning and losing. I think we're on the same team in the grand scheme of things. But it's true, Catholics are producing more content and to greater effect in this space. That's not to say more people are becoming Catholic than Protestant (the inverse is true), but I'd wager that, among those making their decision based on YouTube apologetics, more people are becoming Catholic than Protestant. \n\nWant to support the channel?

Ben shares the fascinating story of how liberals and conservatives have both opposed the 39 articles, whether \"via media\" is a good way to describe Anglicanism, and why being more Protestant makes Anglicans more Anglican.

Both in his own lifetime and well after his death, people have been puzzled by why he didn't become Catholic, despite being good friends with JRR Tolkien and respecting the Catholic Church. \n\nIn this video, I dive into a fairly unknown essay of his that sheds some light on this, as well as a letter from his wife and another of his own letters. Put together, we begin to see why C.S. Lewis chose to be a Protestant. \n\nRead his essay: https://apilgriminnarnia.com/2017/02/06/c-s-lewis-on-christian-reunion/\n\nWant to support the channel?

Because of this, when Protestants first encounter church history, it can often be a rather jarring experience. What's interesting, though, is that people can look at the same data and come to radically different conclusions. \n\nIn this video, I present 5 models of how Protestants engage church history and what they can lead to. Obviously, these are not exhaustive and people's personal decision-making is often quite complex. However, I think this taxonomy is helpful for us to see why people respond the way they do. \n\nWant to support the channel?

He explores how Maximus's understanding of creation as incarnation challenges traditional views of time and the nature of the incarnation itself. Wood argues that the incarnation is not merely a historical event but the very logic of creation, revealing a deeper connection between God and humanity. He emphasizes the importance of scripture and personal experience in shaping Maximus's theological insights, ultimately presenting a vision of a God who desires to be in relationship with creation. In this conversation, JDW explores the implications of viewing creation as an incarnation, addressing concerns about pantheism and secularism. He discusses the ethical responsibilities that arise from this perspective, particularly in relation to how we treat the poor and the environment. The dialogue also delves into the theological implications of animals in heaven, drawing on the thoughts of Maximus. Furthermore, JDW reflects on the historical reception of Maximus's ideas and the dynamic nature of tradition in theology, emphasizing the importance of engaging with both historical and contemporary theological insights.\n\nCheck out his book: https://amzn.to/4dpkFI8\nCheck out his Substack: https://substack.com/@jordandanielwood1\n\nRead my writings: https://austinsuggs.substack.com/\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction to Maximus and Universalism\n06:20 Maximus's Vision of Creation as Incarnation\n12:46 Theological Implications of Time and Incarnation\n22:28 Plan A vs. Plan B: The Nature of the Incarnation\n25:54 Maximus's Approach to Theology: Scripture and Experience\n33:17 The Ethical Implications of Creation as Incarnation\n39:20 The Nature of God and Creation\n46:45 Theological Reflections on Animals in Heaven\n52:37 Maximus and the Reception of Tradition\n01:01:01 Tradition and the Dynamic Nature of Theology",

Gorman shares insights on how Aquinas' works have influenced modern thought and the challenges students face when approaching his writings. \n\nThe discussion also delves into the concepts of substance, accidents, actuality, and potentiality in Aquinas' philosophy, providing a comprehensive overview of his metaphysical framework. In this conversation, Michael Gorman discusses the philosophical concepts of actuality and potentiality as articulated by Aquinas, contrasting them with Aristotle's views. He explains how Aquinas radicalizes these ideas, particularly in relation to God's nature as pure act, and explores the implications for understanding causation and the doctrine of transubstantiation. Gorman emphasizes the importance of patience and persistence when engaging with Aquinas' complex ideas, encouraging listeners to appreciate the depth of the ongoing philosophical conversation.\n\nFor a more thorough introduction, check out his excellent book, A Contemporary Introduction to Thomistic Metaphysics: https://amzn.to/4ls15Pe\n\nSupport the channel:\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nPayPal: https://paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\n\n00:00 - Introduction to Dr. Michael Gorman\n02:40 - The Interplay of Philosophy and Theology\n06:38 - Understanding St. Thomas Aquinas\n10:22 - Aquinas and Aristotle: A Complex Relationship\n15:24 - The Lasting Influence of Aquinas\n20:59 - Exploring Aquinas' Metaphysics\n25:30 - Substance and Accidents in Aquinas' Thought\n28:26 - Aquinas on Actuality and Potentiality\n33:16 - Understanding God as Pure Act\n37:44 - The Nature of Causation in Aquinas\n43:01 - Transubstantiation: Aquinas' Unique Perspective\n51:21 - Advice for Engaging with Aquinas",

    "description": "“The only real sadness, the only real failure, the only great tragedy in life, is not to become a saint” - Léon Bloy.\nGrowing up, I often thought the goal of the Christian life was going to heaven and getting as many other people there too. That's not a bad goal, but it's incomplete - not to mention we can twist our theology into a knot when all God asks us is to save us from him.\nAs I've gone along in my journey, I've learned to see things differently. The goal of the Christian life is to become a saint.\nBut what does that mean?\nFor most, the word saint brings up pictures of cloistered nuns or long-bearded monks living in caves. And let me be clear, it can look like that. But it doesn't always, or even most of the time.\nBecoming a saint is about being joined to Jesus and participating in his cosmic redemption. His work of making all things new.\nThat's not just a religious thing. It's an all of life thing. Jesus is in the business of transforming everything from the ground we walk on to the hearts that beat in our chest. Nothing is too large or too small. The saint is the one that says, \"may it happen here. In my life. In my neighborhood. In my plot of land. May Jesus be all in all.\"",

Jesus is taking a seemingly straightforward command and ratcheting it up by looking at the intent of the law. In doing so, he reveals an area we can all work on.  \n\nWant to read the Desert Fathers with me? Join my book club!

However, we spend relatively little time asking a more basic question: what is the church? \n\nIn this video, I evaluate five conceptions of the church: Institution, Mystical Communion, Sacrament, Herald, and Servant. In so doing, I ask what the model conveys, what binds the members together, who benefits from it, and what is its goal. I also explore strengths and weaknesses before weighing in at the end regarding my preferred model. \n\nThis video is, in large part, a summary of the great work, Models of the Church, by the Catholic theologian Avery Cardinal Dulles. \n\nRead the book: https://amzn.to/3QBUBz7\n\nWant to read the Desert Fathers with me?

    "description": "Ever noticed how people start getting interested in traditional Christianity and before you know it they've found themselves up to their necks in culture wars and conspiracy theories? Things can get weird fast. \n\nIn this video, I explore the iceberg of traditional Christianity, with a focus on how we can avoid defining ourselves by what we're against and instead by what we find good, true, and beautiful. \n\nIt's worth noting that I don't think this is an inevitable slippery slope, nor does it mean that everything on here is bad. I merely want to point out a trend that I'm seeing and bring it up for discussion with you all.

He ended up rejecting the claims of the Catholic church. However, he did not stop there. He realized that the nature of his disagreements with Roman Catholicism extended beyond the institution of the church centered in Rome. These disagreements went to the core of catholic Christianity as a whole - in other words, the majority of historical Christianity. This has led to his rejection of traditionalism, hierarchy, the Trinity, and the incarnation - all of which he has written on extensively. \n\nIn this video, we discuss what Liberal Protestantism is, my objections to it, whether it can be called Christianity, and Dr. Nemes' views on the future of liberal theology. \n\nYou can find his books, including his debut novel, All the Suns Go Out, at https://stevennemes.com/\n\nSupport the channel:\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nPayPal: https://paypal.me/gospelsimplicity",

For years, I put off reading it because it's long, and I thought I basically understood it. This was a mistake. It's one I hope you don't make either. \n\nIn this video, I give an overview of the book and focus on two of Newman's key criteria for determining valid development of doctrine. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon:  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity  \nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://shop.gospelsimplicity.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook:  \n https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity  \nInstagram:  \n https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity  \n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

He emphasizes that Protestantism is not a rejection of other Christian traditions, but a reform and renewal effort based on the authority of Scripture. He also addresses the issue of institutional exclusivism and highlights the Protestant emphasis on the catholicity of the Church. Additionally, he explains his concerns with dogmas around the veneration of icons and the bodily assumption of Mary. The conversation explores the concepts of infallibility and authority within Protestantism, and the importance of abiding in Christ for assurance. The discussion concludes with a reflection on denominational identity and the need for Protestants to rediscover their rich historical roots. \n\nCheck out Gavin's work:\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/truthunites\nHis new book:https://amzn.to/3AlTcYe\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:19 - Protestantism as a Renewal Movement within the Church\n06:27 - The Catholicity of the Church and Institutional Exclusivism\n10:45 - Infallibility and Authority in Protestantism\n19:18 - Assurance through the Ministry of the Holy Spirit\n36:02 - Denominational Identity and Rediscovering Protestant Roots\n39:25 - Finding a Joyful Protestant Identity\n56:04 - Understanding Accretions in the Church\n01:00:50 - Exploring Apostolic Succession\n01:07:04 - Evaluating Scholarly Claims\n01:11:18 - Distinguishing Valid and Necessary Offices\n01:18:00 - The Role of Divine Guidance in Doctrinal Development\n01:23:00 - Icon Veneration\n01:35:00 - The Bodily Assumption of Mary\n01:52:57 - The Strengths of Protestantism\n01:55:18 - The Emphasis on Sola Scriptura",

    "description": "Recently, the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity released a study document titled, \"The Bishop of Rome.\" In it, they discuss the last century of ecumenical dialogue's and the last two millennia of agreement and disagreement on the role of the bishop of Rome. \n\nIn this video, I highlight a few key parts of the new document and share my thoughts on how the divided churches can continue to make progress on this difficult doctrine of the primacy of the pope and what an amenable explanation and exercise of this office might look like. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon:  \nhttps://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity  \nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://shop.gospelsimplicity.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook:  \n https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity  \nInstagram:  \n https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity  \n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "title": "Mission: A missing piece of the conversation",
    "description": "When it comes to Protestant dialogue with Catholics and Orthodox online, often the conversation centers on doctrine. And this makes sense since there are real doctrinal differences and doctrine really does matter. But in my own experience and the experiences of others, there's often another factor that goes into the consideration of leaving Evangelicalism: mission. Put simply, Evangelicals see the great work happening in their churches and wonder how they could leave that behind. That's what I explore in this video. \n\nI also cover the question of whether it would be better if all Protestants became Catholic or Orthodox. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon:  \n\n https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity  \nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://shop.gospelsimplicity.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook:  \n https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity  \nInstagram:  \n https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity  \n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "title": "Five Protestant Books to Read Before Becoming Catholic/Orthodox (all under 200 pages)",
    "description": "In my time on YouTube, I've seen a lot of Protestants become Catholic or Orthodox. Along those journeys, one of the most common features is the prominence of books. People read the finest theologians from Catholic or Orthodox traditions -- as they should -- and find great wisdom there. However, they often then compare the greats from these traditions with Protestants of much smaller stature.

In this passage, Paul says that women should remain silent in church, and then states that women will be saved through childbearing. This statement has long puzzled interpreters of Paul, but some have found answers in a possible allusion to Artemis of the Ephesians and her fertility cult. \n\nIn this interview, I chat with Dr. Sandra Glahn about her new book, Nobody's Mother, to uncover what Paul meant not only in 1 Timothy 2, but in his teaching about women more broadly. \n\nDr. Sandra Glahn (PhD, University of Texas at Dallas) is a multi-published author of both fiction and non-fiction, a journalist, and a speaker who advocates for thinking that transforms, especially on topics relating to art, gender, sexual intimacy in marriage, and first-century backgrounds as they relate to gender.

However, just as quick was his rise to prominence as his fall from grace. After dying in battle, many of his contemporaries distanced themselves from him, and despite being contemporary with Luther, he receives only a small fraction of the attention other Reformers do in current studies of the Reformation. \n\nDr. Bruce Gordon, Titus Street Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Yale University, joins me in this episode to discuss the life and legacy of Ulrich Zwingli, which he outlines in more detail in his groundbreaking work God's Armed Prophet.

The arguments are:\n1. Reading fiction is a de-centering act that helps us become more just\n2. Reading fiction gives us practice seeing from more perspectives\n3. Reading fiction is a celebration of the goodness of human talent\n\nBooks mentioned: \nLaurus - https://amzn.to/3MpzuxY\nIndependent People - https://amzn.to/3Mn2DtI\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://shop.gospelsimplicity.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "title": "An Orthodox Priest and Catholic Apologist Talk about the Papacy",
    "description": "In this video, Orthodox priest, Fr. Laurent Cleenewerck, and Catholic Apologist, Erick Ybarra, discuss the papacy. However, this isn't your usual battle of proof texts. Instead, we dive deep into questions of ecclesiology which get to the root of the disagreement between Catholics and Orthodox. Throughout the course of the discussion, Fr. Laurent and Erick tackle questions like:\n1. Did Catholics and Orthodox EVER agree on the papacy? \n2. What does Roman primacy mean?\n3. What can we learn from the Council of Serdica?\n4. When does papal primacy turn into papal supremacy?\n5. What's the nature of the Church?\n\nFr Laurent Cleenewerck is an Orthodox priest serving as rector of St Innocent Orthodox Church in Eureka, California, in the Orthodox Church in America diocese of the West. He is among other things a graduate of the St Sergius Institute in Paris and current teaches theology for the Ukrainian Catholic University and for Euclid University. He is the author of His Broken Body: Understanding and Healing the Schism between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the editor of the Eastern/Greek Orthodox New Testament.\n\nYou can find Fr. Laurent's book here: https://amzn.to/3sFWBNK\n\nErick Ybarra is a revert to the Catholic faith from Protestantism and has spent over a decade studying the doctrinal nature of divisions that exist within Christendom particularly between Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, as well as Protestantism. He is the author of the recent book, Melchizedek and the Last Supper. He is a speaker that has appeared on various social media outlets but is known most especially for his contribution as a co-host of YouTube’s Reason and Theology and his own channel, Classical Christian Thought. He is also a blogger at ErickYbarra.org. \n\nYou can find Erick's book at: https://amzn.to/3nYh6mL\nYou can find Erick online at: https://www.youtube.com/@UCoxp-YBmYzALO_egQ8bN6Bw \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://shop.gospelsimplicity.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nThere has been no shortage of debate over how the NT canon was formed. Was it an organic process, finished by the mid-second century? Was it an ecclesial process, formalized at 4th century councils? Or was it a conspiracy of power hungry bishops seeking to quell rival Christianities (shoutout to Barth Ehrman)?\n\nIn this interview, Dr. Benjamin Laird gives us a deep dive on how the canon came to be. But he goes much deeper than usual conversations. We dive into first century writing practices to shed new light on questions ranging from intended audiences to \"original manuscripts.\" \n\nFind his book: https://amzn.to/3rP8GQx\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

The medieval period is home to some of the greatest Christian literature of all time, and in this video, I offer an easy entry point to medieval theology if you're brand new: Spiritual Friendship by St. Aelred of Rievaulx.\n\nWhile it's far from the most famous or most influential, it's an exceedingly accessible and practical place to start. Read it, and you won't be disappointed. Furthermore, it's something that people from across the Christian tradition can embrace.",

However, I'm convinced much of this comes down to different understandings of what ecumenism actually is. \n\nIn this video, I lay out four principles to guide faithful ecumenism:\n1. Ecumenism doesn't ignore doctrinal distinctiveness but highlights it\n2. Ecumenism articulates doctrine, it doesn't develop it. \n3. Ecumenism is bi-directional, proceeding top-down and bottom-up\n4. Ecumenism is born of charity and seeks unity\n5. Ecumenism is meaningful even outside institutional unification",

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nThe Nicene Creed has been the central proclamation of Christianity for nearly 1700 years. In recent times, the Nicene creed, and all creeds, have been labeled relics of a dogmatic past that we should evolve beyond. Whether to be \"relevant\" or to move outside orthodoxy, many churches have dropped the creed from services. In other parts of the church, the creed lives on, but for many it's repetition is empty. \n\nDr. Phillip Cary seeks to revive our hearts and enrich our minds with the Nicene Creed and its expression of the gospel. In this video, we explore the context and content of the Nicene creed. \n\nCheck out Dr. Cary's book: https://amzn.to/3MDt2Tn\nCheck out Dr. Cary's lectures: https://www.thegreatcourses.com/professors/phillip-cary\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

As Dr. Geleris notes in his book Money and Salvation, one of the results of this discomfort is that the importance of money often goes unspoken in churches. Of the three pillars of Orthodox spirituality, prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, it's the final that gets the least emphasis. \n\nIn this video, Dr. Andrew Geleris places a spotlight on the importance of generosity, showing that how we use our money is intimately tied to our life in Christ. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a more generous life or a primer on Orthodox views on giving, this is a great video for you. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

As such, no matter where you find yourself in the Christian tradition, developing a better understanding of the papacy will help you interact with others better and deepen your understanding of the church. \n\nIn this video, I'm joined by Erick Ybarra to discuss his book, The Papacy: Revisiting the Debates between Catholics and Orthodox. The book is a significant achievement and spans centuries of history, presenting some of the challenges to both Catholics and Orthodox (as well as a bit to Protestants) that the papacy poses. We cover topics like:\n- Heretical Popes\n- Eastern Fathers accepting the papacy\n- Pre-Nicaea evidence\n- and much more. \n\nYou can find Erick's book at: https://amzn.to/3nYh6mL\nYou can find Erick online at: https://www.youtube.com/@UCoxp-YBmYzALO_egQ8bN6Bw \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

From debates over contemporary worship versus hymns or vernacular versus Latin, everyone seems to have an opinion on what a worship service/mass/liturgy should look like. But in this video we get to the heart of the matter, exploring what the Bible says about worship, and how that shaped early Christian liturgies and ultimately the Orthodox Divine Liturgy of today. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nDr. Edith Humphrey's website: https://edithmhumphrey.com/\nBuy Grand Entrance: https://amzn.to/3ZnNlZI\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

Neither? If you're wondering what Anglo-Catholicism is, you're not alone. In this video, I'm joined by Fr. Wesley Walker to bring you all an introduction to Anglo-Catholicism. We discuss the Protestant and Catholic influences of Anglo-Catholicism, the history and devotional practices of the Anglo-Catholic Church, and much more. Of special interest for those discerning a church tradition. Fr. Wesley describes why he wouldn't necessarily talk a Catholic into being Anglo-Catholic but why he as a non-denominational Protestant found it to be a compelling place to call home. \n\nYou can find Fr.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nIn the non-denominational, evangelical setting I grew up in, rituals were things to be avoided. They would deaden your faith and are symbolic of so much of what is wrong with mainline churches, or so I was told. In this video, I explore how my thoughts have completely changed on rituals. More than that, I lay out a framework for understanding the nature and function of rituals as well as give practical advice on how to make the most out of rituals. \n\nThis video arose not only from my journey of investigating the history of the church, but also from teaching a recent series on rituals at my local church.

Rarely is \"African American Spirituality\" on the list. That's why, when I heard of Fr. Paul Abernathy's book, The Prayer of a Broken Heart: An Orthodox Christian Reflection on African American Spirituality, I was instantly intrigued. In this video, Fr. Paul and I discuss everything from the history of African American spirituality to St. Moses the Black to the overlaps between Orthodoxy and African American Spirituality.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 35. In 2021, 32.8% of American adults experienced heightened depression (Galea, 2021). To engage in vast understatement, mental health is a massive problem facing people from all backgrounds today. The month of May has been designated Mental Health Awareness month, and in this video, I'm sitting down with lawyer, priest, and licensed psycho-therapist Ryan Casey Waller to discuss mental health.

For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nFew things grind against the manic pace, consumerism, and commitment wariness of Western culture like the rhythmic, ascetic, and vowed life of monks. In this video, I'm spending a day in the life of a Catholic monk at St. Anselm's Abbey in Washington D.C. As politicians and businessman whirl through the city just outside their doors, the monks live each day much like the last, praying the psalms in community and living out the rule of St. Benedict. During my time, I experienced everything from the 5am wake up call (filmed in real time) to communal meals and the beauty of unhurried walks through nature. It was a throughly moving experience for me, allowing me to be exposed to what I see as perhaps the most beautiful part of the ancient Christian tradition: monasticism. If you've been following my journey, you know that I've been trying to make sense of church history for over a year now, and this has led me not only to interview expert theologians, but also to experience the liturgical rhythms of various traditions.

    "description": "In this #shorts, we're discussing St. Catherine of Siena, and one key theme from her magnum opus, The Dialogue: self-knowledge. For Catherine, the path to union with God begins with self-knowledge. This self-knowledge must always be \"seasoned with knowledge of God\" and thus it is two-fold: one the one hand, we see ourselves and our own sinfulness, causing contempt for our sensual passions, and on the other hand, we see God's love for us and his surpassing goodness. Together these produce a profound humility which leads to prayer and a desire to love God with the love that he has given to us. However, God loves us with no expectation of reciprocity, and we can't love God in this same way because we depend on him for existence. What's the answer? God has given us neighbors so that we can give them the love that we owe to God. In so doing, we unite our wills to God and experience true union with God which is the ultimate goal of the Christian life.",

This channel is, at least in one sense, a documentary of my investigation of that question of whether or not I should do the same. However, while there are many Catholic and Orthodox apologists making great content about church history and how it relates to what church people should join today, there are relatively fewer Protestants engaged in these conversations. In this video, I'm joined by Matthew E. Ferris, author Evangelicals Adrift: Supplanting Scripture with Sacramentalism, to discus a few reasons why Protestants might put the breaks on their journeys to Rome or Constantinople.

    "title": "How the Church can Lead with Vulnerability and Authenticity (w/ Carl Kuhl)",
    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAuthenticity and vulnerability aren't words that people often associate with the church, especially in the age of celebrity pastors and their seemingly inevitable scandals. Evangelicals have especially been the target of critiques regarding inauthenticity. In some ways, perhaps these are well needed critiques. In this video, I'm sitting down with Pastor Carl Kuhl of Mosaic Christian Church to discuss what the Evangelical church can and should be, how it can lead with vulnerability, and help people experience real transformation. In doing so, Carl critiques what he calls the new \"Emotional Prosperity\" gospel and calls for real vulnerability and honesty in the church. \n\nCheck out Carl's New Book, Blood Stained Pews: https://amzn.to/37oSImn\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nSometimes familiarity can be the enemy of understanding. So it is, often times, with the crucifixion of Jesus. For so many of us, we've grown up hearing the story of Jesus' death on the cross, and we have an answer in our back pocket from Sunday school about why Jesus needed to die on the cross, but beyond that, we may not really understand all that much about what led to Jesus' death, what crucifixion entailed, and perhaps most importantly, the true meaning of the cross. In this video, I'm joined by Orthodox biblical scholar Dr. Eugenia Constantinou to discuss the crucifixion in context. We cover the Jewish and Roman trials, the parallels with the binding of Isaac, the physicality of crucifixion, and ultimately, the meaning of it all. \n\nCheck out Dr. Constantinou's Newest Book, The Crucifixion of the King of Glory: https://amzn.to/3xo0WWu\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

In this interview, Fr. Gregory Pine talks about the connection between meaning, happiness, and virtue. In doing so, we cover questions such as \"how to be more confident\" and \"how to be more decisive\" as well as more theoretical questions, such as the role prudence plays in aligning all the other virtues. Whether you're looking for practical advice on living a life of virtue or you want to know the importance of the overlooked virtue of prudence, this video is for you. And, of course, since this is Fr. Pine, we talk about everything from the gestation period of whales to Homer. So, yeah, there's something for everyone. \n\nTo Get Fr.

Our TV screens and news feeds are filled with horrifying images of senseless violence, leaving many of us wondering, \"how could this happen?\" Furthermore, I have been seeking answers to the question \"what is motivating Putin?\" In this video, I sit down with Archimandrite Dr. Cyril Hovorun, a Ukrainian Orthodox Priest and Scholar to discuss the politicization and weaponization of Orthodoxy in Russia. In so doing, Dr. Hovorun shares his vision for the \"De-Putinization\" of Orthodoxy in Russia: a process of separating theology and ideology, especially the concept of the \"Russian World.\" \n\nI bring this video with recognition of the severity of the issues at hand. As a Christian, I call for peace, and as an individual with political opinions, I thoroughly side with the people of Ukraine. I welcome discussion and disagreement in the comments. I ask that in all conversations on this topic we remember the human beings, on all sides, losing their lives in this conflict. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicitiy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nFew topics have created more strife in the church in recent years than views on race, racism, and what should be done to address issues of racism, past and present, in the church. This week, I'm joined by sociologist and author Dr. George Yancey to discuss his new book, Beyond Racial Divisions, which offers a third way to healing racial divisions: mutual accountability. Dr. Yancey offers strident criticisms of two prevailing approaches to dealing with racism: color blindness and anti-racism and shows that what we need is a collaborative, long term solution. No matter your views on the topic, this video is likely to challenge you. If you ask me, that's a good thing. Learning requires growth and challenge. \n\nGet Dr. Yancey's book: https://amzn.to/3N0wwyM\n\nSign up for Christ Centered Capital and your first month free by using the promo code \"C3AUSTIN\": https://christcenteredcapital.com/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/christcenteredcapital/?hl=en\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/christcenteredcapital\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjsroNqVsp_9u6adPaiZuHQ\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAs I've looked into Orthodoxy over the past year, one thing has consistently plagued my thoughts: I'm simply not Eastern. Therefore, even contemplating becoming Orthodox at any level seemed disingenuous. However, when I shared these thoughts in a video, many of you suggested that I sit down for a conversation with Fr. Patrick Cardine to discuss the Western Rite in Orthodoxy. To be honest, this wasn't something I had much familiarity with at all, but I was deeply intrigued. In this video, Fr. Patrick and I discuss the history and need for the Western Rite. In so doing, we discuss common misunderstandings and caricatures of the West within Orthodoxy, specifically in its apologetic material. \n\nTo Learn More about Fr.

    "description": "At the time of filming, war in Ukraine continues, and for many of us, our heads are spinning as we try to make sense of this violence. While many news reports have seen this as an isolated whim by an unhinged political leader, Fr. John Strickland, Orthodox priest and Russian Historian, urges us to look at the historical background as we try to make sense of this. Specifically, in order to understand the war in Ukraine, we must understand the religious history of Russia and Ukraine. \n\nThis video covers a very sensitive topic. As Fr. John and I both stress, this isn't a matter for detached academic speculation. Christians are called to respond with love and pray for peace. As with all current events, conclusive interpretations will likely only be seen after time passes. In the meantime, we do our best to understand what is happening and pray for those affected. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicitiy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

And if so, how? Questions like this have not only divided Protestants and Catholics, but they have divided Protestants from the very beginning of the Reformation. In this video, Dr. Gavin Ortlund and Dr. Brett Salkeld engage in a dialogue on the Eucharist, focusing on questions of Christ's presence, the nature and circumstances of this, and the question of Eucharistic sacrifice.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nFor many in the West, the church consists of Protestants, Catholics, and a large category of \"other.\" As people learn more, they begin to think of Protestants, Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox as the three main branches of the church. However, even this overlooks a large and ancient segment of the church: the Oriental Orthodox Churches. In this video, I sit down with Fr. Anthony Mourad, a Coptic Orthodox priest to discuss the history, theology, and spirituality of the Coptic Orthodox church. In so doing, we discuss important aspects of the Coptic Orthodox church such as Coptic christology and the Council of Chalcedon, Coptic liturgy, and the spirituality of a church that has endured a great amount of persecution. \n\nCheck out Fr.

In today's video, you get to see Eliza's reactions as a Protestant going to her first ever Orthodox Divine Liturgy. In doing so, she compares her thoughts on Orthodoxy vs. Catholicism as well as Orthodoxy vs. Protestantism. We talk about icons, reverence, liturgy, and so much more.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nThe somewhat ironically titled \"Great Schism\" is one of the great tragedies of the Christian Church, resulting in one of the largest and most long-lasting divisions the Church has ever endured. The mutual excommunications between the bishop of Rome and the bishop of Constantinople in 1054 did not happen overnight. Tensions had grown to a boiling point, and in this video, Erick Ybarra joins me to help walk us through what some of the key reasons behind the great schism were. In doing so, my hope is that it will help you understand some of the deep seated divisions between Catholics and Orthodox, and maybe, just maybe, help heal old wounds. Specifically, we look at four contributing factors to the schism: leavened vs. unleavened bread, the insertion of the filioque, the theology of the filioque, and the jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome. These issues continue to divide Orthodox and Catholics, so if you're like me, trying to sort through these divisions, I think this video will be of great help to you. \n\nGet Erick's Book on the Lord's Supper: https://amzn.to/3pgJv5l\n\nSign up for Christ Centered Capital and your first month free by using the promo code \"C3AUSTIN\": https://christcenteredcapital.com/\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicitiy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

This has set me on a collision course with the claims of Catholicism and Orthodoxy. To investigate these claims, I've set out to interview the smartest people I can find and ask them the most pressing questions of church history. However, I've tried to make this investigation more than just an academic pursuit. Instead, I've sought to also get to know the heartbeat of the Catholic and Orthodox church, understanding their liturgical life by visiting some of their churches and attending their liturgies. In this video, I'm exploring a facet of Catholicism that has always interested me academically, but that I've never explored experientially: monasticism. Thanks to the kindness of Prior Peter and the monks of the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Chicago, I was able to to tour this wonderful monastery and ask questions about Benedictine Catholic monasticism from how much of the day is spent in silence to prayer and much more.

A celebrated scholar and Oxford Don, Lewis spent most of his life researching medieval texts and lecturing students on the importance of honing their Latin. In this interview, I'm joined by Dr. Jason Baxter to discuss the Medieval Mind of CS Lewis, and in doing so, we talk about the importance of learning in our fast-paced, soundbite culture. We explore the writers and theologians who most impacted Lewis and discuss how we might imitate his love for learning. \n\nGet a signed copy of Dr. Baxter's Book: https://www.jasonmbaxter.com\n\nSign up for Christ Centered Capital and your first month free by using the promo code \"C3AUSTIN\": https://christcenteredcapital.com/\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttps://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicitiy\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

However, there seems to be no consensus on the source of this decline. Some point to the Reformation as the beginning of the end. Others look to the Renaissance and beyond. However, Fr. John Strickland takes us back further pointing to the Great Schism (the divide between Catholics and Orthodox) as the source of the West's ills. Specifically, Fr. John demonstrates how the West began to lose its sense of paradise, the in-breaking of the Kingdom of God on Earth. \n\nCheck out his book: https://amzn.to/32Tz674\n\nSign up for Christ Centered Capital and get $6 off your first month: https://christcenteredcapital.com/\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttp://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

Furthermore, I grew up being taught that the Middle Ages was a time when we saw that Catholic church \"worshipping\" Mary like a goddess. Well, in this video we tie these ideas together by talking about Medieval Marian Devotion, and how the Little Office of the Virgin Mary helped Medieval Christians see Mary EVERYWHERE in Scripture. Furthermore, Dr. Brown shares how this is not a late, pagan development, but rather that Marian devotion has ALWAYS been a part of Christian belief and practice. \n\nCheck out her book: https://amzn.to/318PTCs\n\nDownload Catena Bible on Apple or Android: http://onelink.to/jn7rm9\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttp://www.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

In this video, I offer something of a 1 year update, offering my thoughts on Orthodoxy at this current time.\n\nDownload Catena Bible on Apple or Android: http://onelink.to/jn7rm9\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: http://www.gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttp://www.zola.com/registry/elizaand...\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

This first video is another installment in our series, \"Christians You Should Know,\" and in it I'm joined by Jon Sweeney, author of over 40 books, including a recent book on Nicholas Black Elk. By examining the life of Nicholas Black Elk, we're able to explore questions about the legacy of Christian interaction with Native Americans as well as what contextualization looks like. Bishop Robert Barron has referred to Nicholas Black Elk as an example par excellence of what a catechist should be. In his life, we see someone who is fully Native American and fully Catholic at the same time. Stick around until the end for a discussion on Nicholas Black Elk's cause for canonization in the Catholic Church.  \n\nBuy Jon's book: https://amzn.to/30k1Q7S\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nhttp://www.zola.com/registry/elizaand...\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

That desire to learn more about the subject gave rise to this interview with Dr. Thomas Ryan, an expert on Medieval Biblical interpretation and one of the editors of the Bible in Medieval Tradition commentary series.

On the one hand, we see Christians promoting the common good, building hospitals, and transforming Roman society. On the other hand, we see far too many stories of power being abused and things being done in the name of Jesus that none of us want to defend. So, what's the answer? Do we hide the bad parts and pretend like they don't exist? Do we run from the church because of the bad parts?

For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nSr. Theresa Aletheia Noble is a former atheist turned religious sister who is best known for promoting the ancient practice of memento mori in which Christians reflect on their deaths to live more fully for Jesus in the present. There's something about death that reminds us of our priorities, and in light of the fleeting nature of life, we're able to see what truly matters. The problem is, far too few of us actually take the time to think about death. Instead, we like to pretend like it doesn't exist. In this video, Sr. Theresa gives you practical tips on how to incorporate this ancient practice into your life. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring\n\nAustin and Eliza's Wedding Registry:\nwww.zola.com/registry/elizaandaustin2022\nWe in no way expect you all to get us anything, but the generosity of this community always exceeds my expectations, so if you'd like to support us as we start our life together, you're welcome to look at this list. \n\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

The problem, we struggle to get clarity on what exactly that means and would look like in real life. Something that exacerbates this problem is that many of us are unfamiliar with Second Temple Judaism; that is, we don't know much about the world from which the Early Church emerged. In this video, I sit down with the Reverend Dr. Stephen De Young to discuss his new book, The Religion of the Apostles, and explore the world of Second Temple Judaism, the Early Church, and why he thinks that Orthodox Christianity represents the fullness of the Christian faith. \n\nYou can buy Fr.

In this video, I'm joined by Dr. Phillip Cary, author of the fantastic book, The Meaning of Protestant Theology: Luther, Augustine, and the Gospel that Gives Us Christ. In it he dives deeply into the theology of Martin Luther, St. Augustine, and their philosophical influences. In doing so, he shows how the heart of Protestant theology, for Luther at least, is union with Christ. Personally, union with Christ is one of my favorite theological topics, so I'm delighted to be sharing this with you. \n\nDr. Cary's book: https://amzn.to/3yFOnD9\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout our sponsor:\nKINDRED exists to encourage more acts of faith.

We also explore some of Jonathan's personal story, how he got into iconography, and what led him to the Orthodox church. Of course, we also talked about patterns and how to read the Bible while paying attention to patterns as well as seeing patterns in the world.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nWhat does the Catholic church teach when it comes to the topic of Justification? If you're familiar with a bit of church history, you know that justification, and specifically the doctrine of justification by faith alone, sola fide, was at the heart of the Reformation. Churches have split, anathemas have been pronounced, and no small amount of ink has been shed on the topic of Justification. Since the Second Vatican Council, Protestants and Catholics have been participating in dialogues to see if perhaps they can come together on this doctrine. Most famously, in 1999 the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification was signed between the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation. However, despite this progress, Catholics and Protestants remain divided, and many Protestants wonder what it is that Catholics teach about Justification. Do Catholics believe that we're justified by works? Can Catholics agree to the doctrine of justification by faith alone and what does all this talk about \"merit\" mean? In this interview, we tackle these questions and more as Jimmy Akin carefully guides us through a Catholic understanding of the doctrine of Justification. \n\nJimmy Akin is a Senior Apologist at Catholic Answers.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nWhat do Protestants and Catholics have in common when it comes to Transubstantiation? Well, for starters, most of each group tends to not fully understand what it means, even if they think it's really important. In this video, Dr. Brett Salkeld dives into the the true meaning of transubstantiation as well as the history of the doctrine with the hope of showing what problem the doctrine is trying to solve. In doing this, Dr. Salkeld shows that, despite their different formulations, Calvin and Luther were trying to solve the same problem as Aquinas and other Catholic theologians who helped articulate the doctrine of transubstantiation. While holding firmly to Catholic dogma, Dr. Salkeld seeks to help transubstantiation be a source of unity, rather than division for the church moving forward. If you want to know the differences between Catholics and Protestants on the eucharist, or to know what the Catholic church teaches about transubstantiation, this video is for you. \n\nBuy Dr. Salkeld's Book: https://bakerbookhouse.com/products/41652\nListen to his podcast: https://thinkingfaith.libsyn.com/\nCheck out Dr. Salkeld's Interview w/ Dr. Jonathan Armstrong: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haMqO8ntLKk\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nOne Time Donation: https://www.paypal.me/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout our sponsor:\nKINDRED exists to encourage more acts of faith.

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nWhat did Paul mean when he talked about \"works of the law?\" This question has divided interpreters for centuries, specifically in the Protestant discussion of sola fide. When Paul talks about being saved apart from works of the law, does he mean apart from ANY works, or apart from ceremonial works? This question not only caused division in the Reformation, but it has sparked debates between what has become known as the Old and New Perspectives on Paul. While this fight has been primarily exegetical, Dr. Matthew J. Thomas in his landmark work shifts the conversation to ask how did the earliest Christians understand works of the law. His answers are quite revealing, and if you're interested in Pauline studies, patristics, or just want to know what works of the law means, this is for you. \n\nBuy Dr. Thomas' Book: https://amzn.to/3ihCXAq\n\nAll things Gospel Simplicity: http://www.gospelsimplicity.com\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spri...\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout our sponsor:\nKINDRED exists to encourage more acts of faith.

In this interview, I talk with Dr. Ed Siecienski, a leading expert on the history of the filioque to discuss the history of the controversy between Catholics and Orthodox on the procession of the Holy Spirit. Does the Spirit proceed from the Father or the Father AND the Son, and at the end of the day, does this even matter?

    "description": "This video is sponsored by Faithful Counseling. For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gos...\n\nWhat is Orthodox Ecclesiology? For outsiders, it may seem that the Orthodox Church is structured the same way as the Catholic Church, just without a pope. However, in this video, Fr. Laurent Cleenewerck, author of His Broken Body, walks us through the Eucharistic Ecclesiology of the Orthodox Church. He contrasts this with the more institutional model of the Catholic Church, as well as exploring what this means for ecumenical work between Catholics and Orthodox. It's a fascinating conversation, and we talk about topics like what it would take for Catholics and Orthodox to reunite and whether or not the Orthodox need a pope for their church structure to work. If your interested in Orthodoxy, ecumenism, or ecclesiology in general, I think you'll really enjoy this. \n\nFr.

    "description": "Through my YouTube channel, I've been going on a deep dive into Catholicism, and that's led Eliza, my fiancée, to ask some questions of her own about church history, Catholicism, and more. Recently I decided to take her to her first mass, and in this video she shares her thoughts on a Catholic mass as a Protestant. In this video we compare a traditional Catholic mass to the Protestant megachurch she's used to as well as the Lutheran church she grew up in. We also talk about how my investigation into Catholicism has impacted her and much more. For those that are curious, we attended mass at St. John Cantius in Chicago, IL. The mass was in the Ordinary Form, celebrated ad orientum. Finally, please give a big thank you to Eliza for stepping outside of her comfort zone, not only to go to mass, but then to share her thoughts on camera. I was super proud of her, and I hope you enjoy it!\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com/\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity​\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...​\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

Maybe it's nothing more than mindless repetition. In this video, I talk with Dr. Wesley Hill about what we can learn from the Lord's Prayer, and how we might begin to love the Lord's Prayer again if we've become bored with it.

Here's the thing: nowhere does the Bible describe demons like that. Furthermore, we often talk of demons as fallen angels, but (spoiler alert), you're going to be hard-pressed to find that idea in the Bible as well. The truth is, a lot of what we believe about demons doesn't come from the Bible, and some of it flatly contradicts the Bible. This is what Dr. Michael Heiser and I discuss in this interview. So, what does the Bible teach about demons? Moreover, how should we allow belief in demons to affect our lives?

In this video, Orthodox convert and writer Frederica Mathewes-Green shares what the Jesus Prayer is, where the Jesus Prayer comes from, and how you can incorporate the Jesus Prayer into your life in such a way that it transforms your relationship with God, leading to the prayer of the heart. \n\nFrederica Mathewes-Green:\nJesus Prayer Book: https://amzn.to/38R23AM\nBlog: https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/frederica/\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com/\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity​\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...​\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

In this clip, I sit down with Tim Mackie, co-founder of Bible Project to ask what does he mean when he refers to the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus, and what does Bible Project believe about the nature of the Bible.

In this video I walk you through the steps of Lectio Divina and introduce you to a Bible that's designed for this very purpose: the Kindred Gospel of Luke.

For 10% off your first month, use the link, http://www.faithfulcounseling.com/gospelsimplicity. \n\nIn this video, we continue our series on prayer by diving into a classic Catholic prayer: the Ignatian Prayer of Examen. It's one thing to investigate Christian traditions on a theological level, but I think it's equally important to look into the spiritual practices of Christian groups. After all, there's a link between how we pray and how we believe: lex orandi, lex credendi. That's why I'm so excited to bring you this video on the prayer of Examen. This is a super accessible, ancient prayer that will help you be more mindful and grow in your relationship with God. Prayer can be boring, confusing, intimidating, etc. It's my goal that this video would enrich your prayer life, helping you have more meaningful time with God through prayer. \n\nFr.

    "title": "Don't Just Read the Bible, PRAY the Bible (w/ Dr. Don Whitney)",
    "description": "You know prayer is a good thing. You wish you prayed more, and you wish your prayer life was deeper and more meaningful, but you're struggling. Been there? There now? Yup. Most of us have. In this video, Dr. Don Whitney shares insights from years of teaching biblical spirituality about how you can have a more meaningful prayer life through praying the Bible. You read that right. Reading the Bible is great, but have you ever prayed the Bible? After seeing this transform his own prayer life and the lives of countless students at seminary, Dr. Don Whitney decided it was time to write a book on this spiritual discipline to share it with the world. In this interview, we discuss how you can have a deeper and more meaningful prayer life through praying the Bible. You'll find practical tips to get more out of your prayer life as well as how to start praying the Bible. At the end, Dr. Whitney challenges you to try this for just seven minutes. I hope you will. It just might change your life. \n\nDr. Donald Whitney:\nBook: https://amzn.to/3q202Hu\nWebsite: https://www.biblicalspirituality.org\nFive Psalms: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/five-psalms/id1104746125\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com/\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity​\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...​\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "title": "Defining and DEFENDING Sola Scriptura (w/ Dr. Kevin Vanhoozer)",
    "description": "At the heart of the Protestant Reformation is the conviction that Scripture alone is the infallible source for the Christian faith. Perhaps no doctrine is more fundamental to the divide between Protestants and Catholics/Orthodox than sola scriptura. No small amount of ink has been used, not to mention the blood shed, in the debate over this Protestant principle. In this episode, I'm joined by prolific Evangelical scholar Dr. Kevin Vanhoozer who is well known for his influential works on hermeneutics and Scripture. We talk about his book, Biblical Authority After Babel, and ask questions like, \"what does it mean for the Bible to have authority?\" and \"what did the Reformers mean by sola scriptura?\" We sought to clarify misunderstandings, and of particular interest, Dr. Vanhoozer responds to some of the most common objections to sola scriptura. It was an incredibly enjoyable conversation, and I hope you enjoy it. \n\nDr. Vanhoozer:\nBiblical Authority After Babel: https://amzn.to/3dHLB94\nA Reforming Catholic Confession: https://reformingcatholicconfession.com/\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com/\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity​\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...​\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "title": "Why the Essence-Energies Distinction is CRUCIAL to Orthodox Theology (w/ Dr. David Bradshaw)",
    "description": "The first time I heard about the debate between Absolute Divine Simplicity and the Essence-Energies distinction, I must confess, it all seemed a bit like something that only theologians with WAY too much time on their hands debate. I figured I'd leave the philosophical theology to the scholastics and be on my merry way. However, the more I learned, the more I thought I should at least have a cursory understanding of the issue. Then I sat down with Dr. Bradshaw. In this interview, he showed just how important the Essence-Energies distinction is, and how this affects a whole host of other doctrines. In this video he demonstrates how our view of divine simplicity can effect how we view salvation, how we view the glory of God, and much more. I was blown away, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bradshaw's work:\nAristotle East and West: https://amzn.to/3qsV5c9\nMedieval Philosophy: https://amzn.to/3aZWccD\nAcademia: https://uky.academia.edu/DBradshaw\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​​\nMerch: http://www.teespring.com/stores/gospe...​\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplic...​\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...​\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "description": "Priestly celibacy is a hotly debated discipline of the Catholic Church (in the Roman Rite, that is). For centuries now the Catholic Church has had a celibate priesthood, yet many today are calling for reform. Some cite scandals as need for reform, while others point to the history of married priests in the early church or the existence of married priests in Eastern rites. In this clip, Fr. Dwight Longenecker, a married Catholic priest, shares his thoughts on whether or not there will be more married Catholic priests in the future. \n\nWatch the full interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEIBhea0aig\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity​\nMerch: https://gospelsimplicity.creator-spring.com/\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity​\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimpli...​\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity​\n\nAbout Gospel Simplicity:\nGospel Simplicity began as a YouTube channel in a Moody Bible Institute dorm.

    "description": "For many people, \"married Catholic priest\" is going to sound like a bit of an oxymoron. After all, don't Catholic priests have to take a vow of celibacy? In this video, I talk with Fr. Dwight Longenecker, a former Anglican who converted to Roman Catholicism and was ordained into the Roman Catholic priesthood, all while being a husband and father. In this video we explore why the Catholic church allows some married priests, whether the Catholic church will ever reverse their discipline of celibate priesthood, and what it's like to be a married priest. We had a great time, and I hope you enjoy this. I'd love to know in the comments, should the Catholic church allow more married priests, or should priests have to be celibate? \n\nLearn more about Fr.

Allison of SBTS discusses what still divides Catholics and Protestants 500 years after the Reformation. What are the core issues that Protestants and Catholics disagree about? Rather than taking an atomistic approach, Dr. Allison offers insights into key dynamics that fundamentally divide Catholics and Protestants like the Grace/Nature interdependence and the Christ/Church interconnection. It's a fascinating conversation, and in it Dr. Allison also shares his thoughts on why so many high profile Evangelicals have become Catholic. \n\nBuy Dr. Allison's Books on Catholicism:\nhttps://amzn.to/3qDmI1E\nhttps://amzn.to/3sJ2aGX\n\nAbout our Sponsor:\nKINDRED exists to encourage more acts of faith.

    "description": "When it comes to issues that divide Protestants and Catholics, Mariology is a big one. To Catholics, it seems Protestants are disrespecting the Mother of God, and to Protestants, it seems like Catholics might be nearing the edge, if not going over the edge, of idolatry. Because of this tense dynamic, honest, open conversations between Catholics and Protestants on Mary can be hard to come by. In this episode, I talk with William Albrecht and Fr. Christiaan Kappes about Mary. In this conversation, we focus on what the Bible has to say about Mary. Often times, conversations on Mary center around tradition, and while that's a worthwhile conversation, if Protestants and Catholics want to find common ground on Mary, it's essential that we look to the Bible and see what Scripture teaches about Mary. Is it enough to merit the Marian dogmas? Are the Marian dogmas Biblical or are they all blown way out of proportion? After all, what does the Bible even say about Mary? These are all questions that we tackle head on in this conversation. \n\nBuy their book: https://amzn.to/3bTWxje\nWilliam's Website: https://www.patristicpillars.com\nReason and Theology YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Z-xXb0tzX2FSCSDEnNJ8w\nStudy with Fr.

In my investigation of Orthodoxy, I've struggled to find a clear answer on objective criteria for determining the validity of an ecumenical council, so I was very excited to sit down with Fr.

    "description": "In this interview, Fr. Peter Heers shares his insights into the foundations of Eastern Orthodoxy. We talked about pressing issues like the role of Scripture in the Orthodox Church, what is tradition, why are councils so important, and how do we determine what makes an ecumenical council. If you're interested in Eastern Orthodoxy, this video will let you go deep into what they believe and why they believe it, getting to the core of Orthodox theology. This is my most comprehensive video on Orthodoxy to date, and I hope it helps you better understand Eastern Orthodoxy. \n\nKeep up with Fr.

Because of the huge role that his work has played on my journey, I was thrilled to get to interview him. In this video we talk about his testimony, how he started Pints with Aquinas, and much more. Matt explains why he thinks so many people are converting to Catholicism, gives sage advice on navigating YouTube growth, and speaks out against the issue of pornography.

In this episode, I'm joined by Justin Khoe, a Christian YouTuber who is known for making videos with people from all walks of life. He frequently hosts explicit discussions around hot button issues including abortion, homosexuality, atheism, and much more. He does so with great charity, and I was so excited to chat with him about how we as Christians can love across the lines and engage with people who are different than them. \n\nCheck out Justin's Work:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/godhasgiventruly\nVideo with his Barber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vWDSMfhWwM\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: http://www.teespring.com/stores/gospelsimplicity\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "Why is Retaining Tradition so Important for Orthodox Christians? (w/ Fr. John Baker)",
    "description": "\"Tradition\" is an interesting thing. For some, it conjures up warm feelings of retaining the best of the past, and for others it's a bit of a dirty word representing things that need to be left in the past. Of course, many fall somewhere in between. This tension around the word \"tradition\" is perhaps nowhere more pronounced than in Christianity. Some, like the Orthodox, have a very high value for tradition, while others, like the churches I grew up in, think it's nothing but stagnation and gets in the way of a personal relationship with Jesus. In my own life, I've been on a bit of a journey learning about the Christian tradition and trying to understand how I ought to relate to it. In this video, Fr. John Baker of Christ the Savior Orthodox Church shares an Orthodox perspective on the importance of tradition. \n\nFull video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw45OChdnJ4&t=2s\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: http://www.teespring.com/stores/gospelsimplicity\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

The first is \"I am the door\" which relates to the idea that Jesus is the only way to the Father and his eternal life. The second is \"I am the good shepherd\" which is one of the most famous lines of the gospel, and we unpack and explore what all that means. Finally we examine the immense significance of the statement, \"I and the Father are one.\" Hope you enjoy!",

In this video we discuss whether the papacy is a solid foundation for the Catholic church or simply creates a house of cards. In addition, Trent provides biblical and historical arguments for the papacy, walking through questions like \"was Peter the first pope?\" \"is there early evidence for papal infallibility?\" and much more.

    "description": "Was the Reformation justified or did Luther make a big mistake? In this episode with Dr. Jordan B. Cooper, a Lutheran pastor and scholar, we discuss the history of the Reformation, the differences between the reformers, as well as the famous \"solas\" and why they matter. What do we lose if we deny sola scriptura, sola gratia, or sola fide? Dr. Cooper gives a historical defense of Protestantism and the Protestant reformers as well as his reasons for why he's a Lutheran and despite all the ensuing schism, he believes the Reformation is a net positive. I had so much fun chatting with him and learning from his great insight. \n\nFollow Dr. Cooper:\nWebsite: http://www.justandsinner.org\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/SemperReformanda1517\n\nRead Luther:\nConcerning Christian Liberty: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1911/1911-h/1911-h.htm\nLarge Catechism: https://www.peacebeavercreek.org/uploads/pdf/luther's-large-catechism.pdf?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: http://www.teespring.com/stores/gospelsimplicity\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Want to learn more about Eastern Orthodoxy? In this video Fr. Josiah Trenham shares his story of converting to the Orthodox Church including why he thinks Protestantism and Catholicism fall short of the fullness of the faith. Additionally, Fr. Josiah shares an Orthodox perspective on Scripture, Tradition, Salvation, and much more. Fr. Josiah talks about the \"achilles heal\" of Protestantism, the gap between official Catholic teaching and everyday practice, as well as the problems of papal infallibility as well as the Filioque. Of particular interest for Catholics and Orthodox alike might be his discussion of what it would take for the Orthodox and Catholic churches to unite. For Protestants, of particular interest might be Fr. Josiah's appraisal of the Reformation, its pros and cons, and what he calls \"the heresy of Sola Scriptura.\" \n\nFather Josiah Trenham's Work:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz72pwrQRTXibU14NmHep8w\nWebsite: https://patristicnectar.org/\nRock and Sand Book: https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Sand-Appraisal-Protestant-Reformers/dp/1939028507/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1604007897&sr=8-1\nLecture on Catholicism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6zXs_cUSjQ\nInterview on Rock and Sand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piVdrtgo7Xw&t=4220s\nReason and Theology Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXWMIqSZfU&t=637s\n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nMerch: http://www.teespring.com/stores/gospelsimplicity\n\nFollow Gospel Simplicity on Social Media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/gospelsimplicity\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gospelsimplicity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gsplsimplicity\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

At this incredibly populated festival Jesus begins to teach in the temple, and he does so with unexpected authority. Then, at the climax of the festival, he begins to talk about how anyone who believes in him will have rivers of living water springing forth from him.

    "description": "One of the most significant passages that separates Christians is John 6. Catholics and Protestants have been fighting over it for years, and interpretations of the Lord's Supper are what initially split the Protestant Reformers apart. For many, John 6 is crystal clear: we must eat the flesh and drink the blood of Jesus. The way we do this is through communion. Thus, we have the doctrines of Real Presence and Transubstantiation. However, many Protestants, following in the footsteps of Swiss Reformer Ulrich Zwingli have claimed that Jesus the bread and wine in communion are mere symbols and that Jesus is speaking metaphorically when he says that we must eat his flesh and drink his blood. This is a long lasting debate that isn't likely to end soon. However, in this video I do my best to parse through the teachings of John 6 and see what the implications are for our doctrine of the Lord's Supper. This is much longer than usual, but I hope you'll find it helpful.

One thing that I was altogether unclear on, and I think some of my fellow Protestants might share this question, is, \"what can the Catholic Church Be Wrong About?\" So often debates flare over papal infallibility and the authority of Tradition and the Magisterium, but I wanted to know not only what the Catholic Church claims they know infallibly, but also, what are the limitations on this? Is anything the Pope says automatically true? What does the authority of the Catholic Church look like practically? Hopefully this will help answer some of those questions for you.

    "title": "The Authority of Scripture as Historically Understood by Protestants",
    "description": "What makes the Bible authoritative? This question, and others like it, often come up in Protestant vs. Catholic debates. On the one hand, it would seem that the church, in compiling the canon, has authority over the Bible. This is repeated often by Catholic Apologists, and many Protestants struggle to answer this question. However, for Protestants, the Bible is intrinsically authoritative because of its nature as theopneustos, or, \"inspired.\" So, who's right about the Bible, Catholics or Protestants?\n\nIn this video, I give a 4 point overview of John Calvin's case for the authority of the Bible as intrinsic, rather than conferred by the Church. The reason for pulling from Calvin is that many Protestants have lost their historic moorings, and Calvin is really the headwater from which Protestant theology flows. Whether Catholic or Protestant, you might not agree with this case, but my goal is that by the end of the video you would have a better understanding of the historic Protestant case for the authority of the Bible. \n\nThe argument can be laid out as follows:\n1) Scripture is inherently authoritative by nature of its status as inspired by God. \n2) Scripture is self-attesting to its authority, given the work of the Holy Spirit. \n3) Any external criteria for authority placed upon the Bible diminishes the Bible's authority. \n4) The Church does not give the Bible authority but merely recognizes the authority of the Bible. \n\nReferences:\nInstitutes of the Christian Religion by John Calvin\n\nSupport this Channel:\nBecome a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nBuy Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/my-store-10049253\nSend me books:\n820 N.

    "description": "Welcome back to Life in the Word, and this week we're exploring John 2, where we find Jesus performing the greatest party trick of all time then crashing a party rather dramatically. Of course, by these events I'm referring to Jesus turning water into wine and clearing the temple. In this video we dive into the first century background of Galilee and Jewish Weddings, as well as the symbolic significance of Jesus' first miracle and his clearing of the temple. In all of these, we seek to discover how John is using these events to support his thesis that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that we can have life in his name. I hope this video helps you learn what John 2 is saying, what it means for your life, and how you can study the Bible for yourself. \n\nSupport this Channel:\nBecome a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nBuy Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/my-store-10049253\n\nReferences:\nDictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible\nThe IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament\nHolman Illustrated Bible Dictionary\nMoody Bible Commentary\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Have you noticed that people are constantly trying to show that they're a good person, seeking to be justified by themselves and others? Today we live in an age where we're constantly seeking validation, and in this video we explore what that craving says about us. At the heart of virtue signaling and cancel culture we find the dark truth that when we are not justified by God, we find ourselves trying to find justification in others. It so often leaves us unsure, and wanting more. We tear down others and prop up ourselves so that we can salvage some self-worth, but soon it comes crashing down. \n\nThrough looking at the teaching of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount and in Calvin's conceptions of sensus divinitatus and semen religionis, we talk about the importance of seeking justification only in Christ. \n\nSupport Gospel Simplicity on patreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\n\nCheck out Gospel Simplicity Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/my-store-10049253\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "It's an exciting day for Life in the Word! Today we are starting a new book, and it is by far our longest that we've explored to date: the Gospel according to John. The Gospel of John is one of the most beloved books in the Bible for many, and I'm not sure if this is allowed, so don't tell anyone, but it's my favorite book of the Bible. Just between us, ok? \n\nIn this first video we did a deep dive on the historical/cultural and literary context of the book of John. My goal in these videos is not only teach you what the text is saying, but to also teach you how to read the Bible faithfully on your own. In this video we talk about the necessity of understanding context, and then we see how the context shapes the meaning of this chapter.\n\nThis first chapter serves to elucidate the central claim of Christian theology: Jesus is God. The deity of Christ is perhaps the most important thing that any Christian could learn about, and the book of John is a masterclass for understanding the deity of Jesus. \n\nIn this chapter alone we'll see that John makes the case for the deity of Christ by attributing divine honor, names, and attributes to Jesus. \n\nReferences:\nDictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible\nThe IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament\nHolman Illustrated Bible Dictionary\nMoody Bible Commentary\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "Protestant Compares Going to Latin Mass and Novus Ordo",
    "description": "Recently I attended a Latin Mass for the first time, and many of you responded that I should really try a Novus Ordo because it would be easier to understand. Additionally, many of you pointed out that Low Latin Masses are very different than High Latin Masses, and if I wanted to really get the full experience, I should try a High Mass. Well, I did both of these things!\n\nOn Sunday, August 30th, I attended the Latin Mass (Extraordinary Form, High) at the beautiful St. John of Cantius Church in Chicago, Illinois. Thanks to the incredible hospitality of many people in the church who had watched my videos, I was provided with a missal and a tour guide who kindly explained the parts of the mass as well as the significance of every part of the church. It was truly an incredible experience, and I hope to share some more of that with you soon. \n\nAdditionally, on that same evening, I attended a Novus Ordo mass at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois. This was my first time going to a Novus Ordo mass, and as a Protestant it felt much more familiar. \n\nIn this video I compare and contrast the two mass types through Protestant eyes and share my thoughts on mass. One thing I learned is that the mass is saturated in Scripture, and there is intentionality in every detail. My hope is that this video will inspire fruitful, healthy dialogue between Protestants and Catholics so that we can work with one another rather than fighting against one another. \n\nSupport this Channel:\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nBuy Merch: http://teespring.com/stores/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "Class Disparity, Enduring Oppression, and the Centrality of Prayer // James 5",
    "description": "In this week's installment of Life in the Word, we're looking at the last chapter of the book of James. In this chapter we find a prophetic call to repentance for the rich who are profiting off the oppression of the poor. James speaks powerfully about class and wealth disparity, something that is incredibly relevant to our times. Stemming from this, we discuss how Christians should be mindful of implicitly supporting oppressive economic systems, and how we should make sense of our disproportionate wealth as Christians. Next, we looked at how Christians can patiently endure suffering by keeping our eyes on Jesus. Finally we talked about the centrality of prayer in the life of the Christian and the Christian community.\n\n\nAbout Life in the Word:\nLife in the Word is a weekly Bible Study where we go through one chapter at a time of a book of the Bible. The goal is that it would be a place where your love for the Bible grows, and that scholarly insights meet real world application. This isn't about using fancy words and sounding smart, it's about the beautiful simplicity of opening up the Bible and learning what we can from it. Stay tuned as new episodes drop every Saturday.\n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "title": "My Experience Going to Catholic Mass as a Protestant",
    "description": "Something I'm incredibly passionate about is dialoguing with those I disagree with and doing my best to learn from them despite our differences. When it comes to branches of Christianity that I disagree with, my passion is even more increased. I simply love learning from Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. While we don't see eye to eye on everything, there is so much that we do agree on that can form the basis of great unity between Catholics, Protestants, and Eastern Orthodox. \n\nA little over a year ago I attended a Catholic men’s group for several months, and recently I made a video describing some of the things I learned with the goal of promoting healthier and more productive dialogue between Protestants and Catholics. It has quickly become my most popular video to date, and I’ve absolutely loved many of the conversations that it has sparked. It has over 1,000 comments so far, and one of the most common pieces of feedback I received, aside from enough book recommendations to fill a library and more than a small army of people encouraging me to subscribe to Lizzie Answers, was that I should go to a Catholic Mass. I love trying and learning new things, and it seemed like good advice given the kind of videos I make, so I decided to do it. Plus, I’m so grateful for all the encouragement you all have given me from that video, so taking a piece of your advice as a gesture of goodwill felt like the least I could do. \n\nThe first matter was figuring out where to go. I live in downtown Chicago, so there’s really no shortage of options. Initially, I wanted to check out an Eastern Catholic Church because I find them particularly interesting, in no small part due to the fact that two of my favorite Catholic YouTubers, Matt Fradd and Trent Horn, are of that persuasion. After a quick Google search, I came across St. John of Cantius Church which Google tried to tell me was Eastern Catholic, though it turns out they’re Roman Rite. Anyway, I decided that on account of it being both beautiful and close by, I’d go with that one. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the final decision I had to make. Because of COVID-19, I had to RSVP for a service, and then I realized that they had different kinds, which forced me to google what on Earth Extraordinary vs Ordinary Form was. After some more googling, I felt like I had it vaguely figured out, and it worked out that on Saturdays they only had Extraordinary form in the morning, so that eased my decision making. I’m sure some people will tell me that I picked the wrong church or service or both, and that’s totally fine, but you have to start somewhere, right?\n\nI'm truly so grateful for all of your support for this channel, and I hope that this video can continue to promote healthy and productive dialogue between Christians of various branches. May we all strive for unity in Jesus. \n\nSupport the Channel:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/gospelsimplicity\nBuy Merch: https://www.teespring.com/stores/gospelsimplicity\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Welcome back to another week of Life in the Word! This week we found ourselves in James chapter 4, exploring two key concepts: how Christians can combat the war within themselves and how our planning is often futile. In the middle of this crazy year, I think we can all relate to the latter point. Chances are, you had plans for this year, and they got radically changed. James gives us insight into how little control we truly have, an uncomfortable idea, yet we can find hope and purpose in the midst of this. In fact, you might even find it liberating. In the first half of James, we explore how often times we struggle between our old self and our new self, between worldliness and the kingdom of God, and we find that in the midst of our struggles and sin, God has MORE grace. \n\nWhether you're new to studying the Bible or have been doing it for years, Life in the Word provides you with opportunities to learn more about what the Bible is saying in context and how that can help shape the way you see the world and live your every day life.",

Today, I wanted to share with you my story of trusting Jesus and how that has brought me to Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, IL, ministry, YouTube, and so much more. So many of you have been supporting this channel, and I wanted to take a moment to share with you a bit more about myself and how I've ended up where I am. My hope is that this video will encourage you as well as provide meaningful background to who I am as you watch my other videos. My story has deeply shaped how I see the world and my relationship with God. The truth is, none of us come to God as blank slates. Our personal stories and experiences shape our faith, and God meets us in the messy middle of it all. If you're wondering how to keep your faith when you grow up in the church, maybe my story will help. In this video I share how I nearly walked away from the faith and the church, and what ultimately kept me coming back. This is a story of great weakness and greater grace. I hope it inspires you to take your next step in your journey of following Jesus.",

    "description": "One of my great convictions is that we're called to love those who we disagree with. A little over a year ago, in preparation for teaching a series on different faiths, I found myself sitting across the table from a group of Muslims at a local mosque. During my time at the mosque I was able to hear from these people about what it's like to be a Muslim in the United States, how they experience prejudice, and so much more. Most importantly, we talked about how Christians and Muslims can work together to build a better world. \n\nThis wasn't about glossing over our differences. This was about bringing them to the light and loving one another in the midst of them. The love Jesus calls his followers to isn't simply a love of those who look like you, think like you, and believe like you. The love Jesus calls us to is a radical love that sees everyone as neighbor and calls us to love across the lines that we draw in the sand between us. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "Is Sola Fide Biblical?",
    "description": "Justification by faith alone is a pillar of Protestant theology. Next to sola scriptura, sola fide might be the most famous of the reformation \"sola's.\" As one might expect, this has been a MAJOR point of contention between Protestants and Catholics over the years. In this video, we're looking at James chapter 2, one of the most difficult passages of Scripture for Protestants because James explicitly says that we are saved by WORKS. However, it's not like we Protestants just weren't aware of this. So, can sola fide stand up against James 2? Who's right when it comes to justification, Catholics or Protestants?\n\nEvery week in our Life in the Word videos we seek to unpack the Bible one chapter at a time. This week is much heavier on theology than most weeks, but I hope you enjoy it. In the first have, we discuss the radical nature of class relations in Christianity, then we pivot to the controversy over justification by faith alone. \n\nAfter looking at the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Council of Trent, a quote from Pope Benedict, a quote from Calvin, Luther's background, and of course, the text itself, I came to a conclusion that might equally offend Catholics and Protestants.... sorry. Perhaps it's naive, but I just really don't think Catholics and Protestants are that far off when it comes to justification. In fact, with some semantic nuance, I think we can find common ground. \n\nTIME STAMPS:\n00:00 - Intro\n04:31 - Class Relations in Christianity (James 1:1-13)\n08:07 - Sola Fide \n21:46 - Conclusion",

    "description": "Last year I sat down with an Eastern Orthodox priest to learn more about Eastern Orthodoxy. As a lifelong Protestant, I knew next to nothing about Eastern Orthodoxy. It didn't take long for me to realize that I was way in over my head. This priest, Father Mastakas, could cite councils, creeds, and church fathers fluently, and I was left with my head spinning. Luckily, I admitted that growing up in a Protestant church, we never talked about this stuff. I told him that I was lost, and I was going to need him to explain some things to me... preferably like I was a child. Kindly, he obliged, and it was in this meeting with an Orthodox priest that my interest in the Church Fathers and Patristics was ignited. Ever since, I have been fascinated by church history and all there is to learn from the Church Fathers. If I had never left my Protestant bubble, I might not have learned all of this. While I'm not a convert to Orthodoxy and don't plan on becoming one, I recognize that there is so much that Protestants like me can learn from our Orthodox brothers and sisters in Christ. In this video I want to tell invite you into my journey of expanding my theological horizons and learning to engage with people I disagree with. \n\nChurch I went to: Saint Peter and Paul Greek Orthodox Church, Frederick, MD. \n\nA huge thank you to Father George Mastakas.

Famously, Martin Luther once called it an \"Epistle of Straw\" and long before that, it was one of the \"disputed books\" of the New Testament Canon. So, what's it all about? What is there in the book of James that we can learn from? In this video we do a deep dive on the background of the book of James and its original context. Then, we explore three key ideas from the first chapter. We're looking at how to consider trials joy, how to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry, and we're exploring the importance of not just knowing stuff about God, but actually following Jesus. There's a lot to learn here, and I hope you enjoy!",

    "description": "How do we trust God when our life is falling apart? What do we do when everything is going wrong? In the book of Habakkuk we read about a man receiving the worst news, and in the midst of it, he chooses to trust God. In this week's episode of Life in the Word we're wrapping up our series on the book of Habakkuk. In this series we've done a deep dive on how to read biblical prophecy in context. This book shows us a fascinating dialogue between Habakkuk the prophet and God concerning injustice and making sense of God's actions. I hope that by reading this book you gain confidence in God and increase your faith so that you can weather any storm that comes to you. \n\nAbout Life in the Word:\nLife in the Word is a weekly Bible Study where we go through one chapter at a time of a book of the Bible.

    "description": "Last week we left the book of Habakkuk on a cliff-hanger. Habakkuk cried out to God over injustice, and then God responded in a way that he didn't expect. God told him that he was going to raise up the Chaldeans to strike Jerusalem. Not exactly the deliverance Habakkuk was hoping for. Habakkuk protests to God that this is unfair, and we finished last week waiting for the response.\n\nIn this week's video we explore God's response to Habakkuk in chapter 2, and we find out that God is well aware of the Babylonian's sins, and he assures Habakkuk that this won't go unpunished and that He is in control. In this chapter we find important lessons on waiting on God, living by faith, and trusting in God's sovereignty. \n\nAbout Life in the Word:\nLife in the Word is a weekly Bible Study where we go through one chapter at a time of a book of the Bible.

In today's video, I'm going to walk you through my simple yet effective approach to Christian meditation. In this video we'll explore the biblical basis for meditation as well as how to meditate well. This form of Christian meditation, while original, is also indebted to the ancient practice of breath prayers. Breath prayers are a form of praying that focuses on repetition of phrases as you inhale and exhale. After watching this video you'll be able to start your own Christian meditation routine and understand the biblical foundation for such a practice. \n\nChristian meditation is a great way to combat stress and anxiety while helping you memorize Scripture and grow in your faith.

    "title": "A Primer on Reading Biblical Prophecy in Context // Habakkuk 1",
    "description": "What do we do when we don't understand God's actions? That was the question racing through Old Testament prophet Habakkuk's mind as he took his complaint before God. In this week's episode of Life in the Word, we're exploring the book of Habakkuk and in so doing, we're looking at how to read biblical prophecy in context. \n\nThe Minor Prophets are some of the most neglected books of the Bible. Whether it's personal Bible study or preaching, these books are often looked over in favor of \"easier\" books, like Paul's letters, the Gospels, or Old Testament narrative. This is understandable. Reading the prophets is hard. Written thousands of years ago in Hebrew poetry, these books force us to flex our exegetical muscles and really work hard. However, it's worth the work. Reading the biblical prophets can be incredibly rewarding, but we must do so carefully. Nothing is more misinterpreted in Scripture than prophecy. My goal for this week's video is two-fold: explain the context and content of Habakkuk, and teach you how to read prophecy wisely. \n\nOT Dates PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DsGVv8BP5dr5TE_I2X0ocNowcUZ013-y/view?usp=sharing\n\nAbout Life in the Word:\nLife in the Word is a weekly Bible Study where we go through one chapter at a time of a book of the Bible.

    "title": "My Summer Reading List (So far) // Church History, Theology, and Fiction",
    "description": "If you know me, you know that I LOVE to read. A couple months ago I posted my Quarantine reading list, and several of you have requested that I make an updated video on what I'm reading, so here it is! *Time Stamps Below*\n\nYou'll notice that this list contains a lot more fiction than the last one. That's intentional. For the past few years I've been reading almost exclusively non-fiction, primarily about theology, and a little leadership mixed in. I love these books. However, I realized that I was missing fiction, so I've slowly started reintroducing it into my reading routine. I hope you'll find some books in this list that you might enjoy!\n\nBooks Mentioned: \nThe Chronicles of Narnia Series by CS Lewis (01:47) - These books were SO fun to read! Walking away from reading these I was reminded of the fact that your never too old for children's books, and that CS Lewis is truly a master of fiction and non-fiction, a rare talent. One of my favorite things was Lewis' reflections on how Aslan (God) is not tame. We can't put God in a box. Yet, Lewis also shows how this truth can be twisted and weaponized. There's so much more to say, but if you haven't read them, read them.\n\nThe Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead (03:48) - What. a. book. This fictional deep dive into America's dark history is a stunning read. Whitehead brilliantly reimagines the Underground Railroad as an actual railroad, and though this is fictional, it will deeply move you to reckon with the horrors of American slavery. If you're looking for a fictional read that can educate you on the history of race in America, look no further. Well deserving of the Pulitzer. \n\nGentle and Lowly by Dane Ortlund (05:03) - I loved this one! Ortlund delves into the depths of Christ's heart, showing it to be gentle and lowly, a heart for sinners and sufferers like you and me. I've read many devotional books that leave you feeling the warmth of Christ's love. However, no other book explores Christ's love in such a warm and yet theological way. Ortlund explores what it means for Jesus to be gentle and lowly in heart through Scripture and the writings of the Puritans. Ortlund introduced me to a whole new world of Puritan writers, and I can't wait to explore more. \n\nThe Lost World of Genesis One by John Walton (06:59) - Walton is a master historian of the Ancient Near East, and he uses this knowledge to shed new light on the biblical origin account in Genesis One. The debate over the origin of man is a fierce one, and Walton wades into this with precision and keen intellect. Showing that the ancient Israelites would've viewed creation accounts through a functional ontology rather than material ontology breaks open a new world of interpretive possibilities in which one doesn't have to decide between faith and science. \n\nThe Lost World of the Torah by John Walton and J. Harvey Walton (08:56) - This book shared many, but not all, of the strengths of The Lost World of Genesis One. Once again, Walton sets this biblical text in its ANE background and in so doing sheds new light on the text. Many of Walton's conclusions I agree with, such as the fact that it's not hermeneutically tenable to divide the Torah between moral and ceremonial law. He also masterfully shows that law functioned much differently in the ANE, and that our interpretations don't usually give justice to that. However, several of his conclusions I couldn't quite get on board with. \n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins (11:07) - This was just plain fun. I called it in the video a guilty pleasure, but honestly, I feel no guilt over enjoying this. Reading this prequel brought back so many Hunger Games memories, and I thought Collins did a wonderful job with this. \n\nThe Story of Christianity by Justo L. Gonzalez (12:39) - This is a great introduction to church history. I've read both volume 1 (pre-reformation) and volume 2 (post-reformation), and I must say, I prefer the former, though they're both excellent. If you want to learn more about Church History, which I would recommend, this is a great place to start. Very accessible and easy to follow. \n\nDominion by Tom Holland (13:53) - Holland is a masterful writer of history, and in this retelling of the growth of Christianity and its profound impact on the world, he weaves together the story in an eminently readable fashion. This is not a textbook listing facts and dates. This is the story of people in the globe-spanning story of Christianity. This is history being told at its finest. \n\nSocial:\nInstagram: @gospelsimplicity\nFacebook: Gospel Simplicity\n\nVideo Stuff:\nCamera: Canon 80d\nLens: Sigma 17-50 F2.8\nEdited in FCPX\n\nMusic:\nBowmans Root - Isaac Joel\nFade Out - Basketcase",

I hope that in this video you can learn what Philippians 4:13 means IN CONTEXT (spoiler alert: it has to do with contentment, not Football games). I hope that in our meditation section you can learn about the foundation of Christian meditation and how you can harness the power of biblical positive thinking.

    "description": "We live in a time where opinions abound and understanding is nowhere to be found. With shorter than ever attention spans, its becoming more and more rare to be truly listened to, and wisdom sometimes feels frighteningly absent. In this video I want to advocate in minimalism in speech (thanks, John Mark Comer). What I mean by that is I want us to talk less, listen more, and in so doing, we will gain wisdom. There is no wisdom where there is no listening, and there is no listening, when we won't cease to talk. One of the greatest gifts you can give people is your full attention because to listen is to love and to love is to listen. We've all been told to think before we talk, what if we actually tried it. In this video, we explore these concepts through the advice of the biblical book of Proverbs, and I hope you walk away equipped to have better conversations, be a better listener, and be able to say things that are actually meaningful. If you want to be a person that people listen to when you're talking, try listening first and gaining wisdom. \n\nTime Stamps:\nIntro: (00:00)\nTalk Less: (02:52)\nListen More: (04:54)\nGain Wisdom: (07:18)\nConclusion: (09:24)\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "In this week's episode of Life in the Word, we're exploring Philippians chapter 3 where Paul explores, righteousness by faith, the relationship of faith and works, our heavenly citizenship, and more! As in all of our Life in the Word videos, we start with some background to the text, this week exploring the life of Paul and how that plays into this chapter. Specifically we look at three ideas:\n1) Paul was Jewish\n2) Paul was a Pharisee\n3) Paul was a Roman citizen\nAll of these aspects play into who he was and how he wrote. Then, we explore three key ideas:\n1) Righteousness by faith and how that interacts with works\n2) How we're all a work in progress\n3) How our allegiance is to Jesus and our citizenship is in his kingdom.\nI hope through all of these things you're given practical application for your every day life, including the realization that it's not what you do that defines you, you don't have to earn your salvation, there's grace for you as a work in progress, and you are to live as a heavenly citizen. \n\nAbout Life in the Word:\nLife in the Word is a weekly Bible Study where we go through one chapter at a time of a book of the Bible.

    "description": "Growing up as a Protestant I had a certain perspective on Catholicism. All that was challenged when I went to a Catholic Bible study for a few months and got to see firsthand what being a practicing Catholic looks like. In this video I share with you my experience as an Evangelical Protestant going to a Catholic Bible study and what I learned from that. During this time I learned that there's a big difference between nominal Catholics and practicing Catholics, a difference many Protestants don't always pick up on. Often times Protestants judge Catholicism based on unfair caricatures. Despite my assumptions, I learned that Catholics do in fact read the Bible, and that a Catholic Bible Study isn't an oxymoron. I also realized that I'm still quite comfortable being a Protestant, despite the fact that Catholicism isn't nearly as weird as I thought. My challenge to you is to engage in conversations with Catholics and realize the biases and false narratives you have about Catholicism. By attending a Catholic Bible study and meeting sincere, practicing Catholics, my view of Catholicism changed. I learned a lot about Catholicism, and maybe even more about myself and my own false beliefs about Catholicism. This isn't the end of the conversation about Catholicism. What we need is more healthy dialogue between Catholics and Protestants, not just arguments based on half-baked caricatures. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction. \n\nChurch I went to: St Michael's Catholic Church in Mt. Airy, MD.\nStudy I did: That Man Is You by Paradisus Dei\n\nA huge thank you goes out to some of the awesome Catholics I met while at St. Michael's.

    "description": "In this week's episode of Life in the Word we're exploring the fascinating and puzzling chapter of Philippians 2. In our study we'll cover Paul's vision for unity in the Church and how he links that to humility, we'll talk about the much debated \"Kenosis passage\" which is a pre-Pauline hymn from the early church talking about Jesus emptying himself and not considering equality with God something to be grasped, and finally we'll explore how our work and God's work go together in salvation. It's a lot of ground to cover, but I hope you find it all both accessible and actionable. It's a wonderful chapter, so let's dive in! \n\nAbout Life in the Word:\nLife in the Word is a weekly Bible Study where we go through one chapter at a time of a book of the Bible. The goal is that it would be a place where your love for the Bible grows, and that scholarly insights meet real world application. This isn't about using fancy words and sounding smart, it's about the beautiful simplicity of opening up the Bible and learning what we can from it. Stay tuned as new episodes drop every Thursday. \n\nTime Stamps for Your Convenience:\nBackground (01:15)\nPhilippians 2:1-4 \"Unity through Humility\" (02:20)\nPhilippians 2:5-11 - The \"Kenosis\" Passage (05:45)\nPhilippians 2:12-13 \"I work, God Works\" (12:00)\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "What Does the Bible Say About Race and Racism?",
    "description": "Much needed conversations on race and racism are now being had in homes, churches, streets, and every other space. For far too long, our churches and communities have been silent as our minority brothers and sisters have suffered the atrocity of racism. As we navigate these overdue conversations on race and racism, we as followers of Christ would do well to ask the question: what does the Bible say about race and racism? That's what we do in this video. In this Christian response to racism, we're doing two things. First we are exploring a biblical theology of race which is grounded in Genesis 1, informed by the message of Jesus, and culminates in the vision of the kingdom of God being a multi-ethnic people group consisting of people from every nation, tribe, and tongue. Second, we are looking at how Christians should respond to racism. I hope this conversation helps you to gain a better understanding of how to think about race biblically, how to handle privilege, and how to respond to racism. Key to this conversation is the idea of eschatology. If you didn't think eschatology and race went together, think again. If you have to google \"eschatology\" no judgement. \n\nIncluded below are timestamps for your convenience:\nSection 1 - Biblical Theology of Race\nThe foundation of Race in the Bible: Genesis 1 (03:31)\nHow Union with Christ Supersedes Race: Galatians 3 (04:57)\nRace in the Kingdom of God: Revelation 7 (07:30)\nSummary (08:31)\n\nSection 2 - How Do We Respond\nIntro (09:42)\n1) Live into Reality (12:27)\n2) Celebrate Diversity (13:15)\n3) Recognize Privilege is Not For the Sake of the Privileged (13:38)\nExhortation (14:52)\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Philippians is an incredible book, and this week we’re jumping into chapter 1, exploring a few things, not least of which is Paul’s famous claim, “to live is Christ and to die is gain.” In this series, Life in the Word, my goal is to allow us to have time to simply open up the Bible together and learn from it, seeing how it applies to our lives. This stems from the conviction that the Bible is an overarching redemptive narrative that leads to Jesus and propels forth into the present with transformative power for our lives. As a Bible nerd, I love sharing whatever I can with you to help you grow. In this video in particular, we explore three concepts:\n1) How God’s sovereignty is at work in our lives, even in difficult circumstances.\n2) How Paul connects love and wisdom, painting a holistic picture of Christian faith.\n3) How Paul could claim (and you can too) that to live is Christ and to die is gain. \nMy hope is that you walk away from this video not only having learned some new ideas but feeling empowered to live a life that more closely conforms to the life of Jesus and that you have increased confidence in how to read the Bible and apply it to your life. If you’re looking for an accessible, practical Bible study, Life in the Word is for you!\n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "title": "Hawk Nelson Frontman, Jonathan Steingard, Has Left the Faith // How to Respond to Deconversions",
    "description": "It seems that Christian culture is seeing one deconversion story after another, and the most recent story is that of Jonathan Steingard, the frontman of the band Hawk Nelson, who recently announced that he no longer believes in God. In this video, we explore how Christians can respond to apostasy, or in other terms, how Christians can respond to people leaving the faith. It's a sad thing when people leave the faith, but Christians need to respond in love, showing people who walk away that they are loved unconditionally by God and by the Christian community. Likewise, as Christians we need to create safe spaces for people to doubt and ask questions, as well as being more rigorous in learning answers to difficult questions like, if God is good, why is there evil? Or, is the Bible really true? Why is God so violent in the Old Testament? None of these questions are new, and neither are there answers. It's on us to put in the time to make sense of how to answer these questions. In the meantime, we never forget that love is often much more powerful than reason, though we need both. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "title": "A Christian Response to the Death of George Floyd and Police Brutality",
    "description": "On Monday, May 25, 2020, George Floyd died as the result of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck for minutes. As Christians, we cannot turn a blind eye to injustice. However, for many Christians, conversations around \"social justice\" have become taboo. Social justice has been determined by some to be too left-wing (apparently Jesus was a Republican.... *sarcasm*), too worldly, a distraction to the gospel, etc. For others, social justice is the gospel. In this video, I walk you through a biblical theology of justice, exploring how Christians should think about injustices and what we should do. This is not meant to be a definitive video. There are so many things I couldn't get into without making this video too long. This is not a polemic against police officers. This is not white-shaming. This is not even really a video about politics. This is a video about how Christians are called to love God and love our neighbor, and that loving our neighbor looks like standing up for the marginalized, the oppressed, and the downtrodden, even when it's difficult or unpopular. When it comes to cases like this, we should all be concerned about the pattern of black men being killed at the hands of police officers. This is deeply troubling. I think this would trouble Jesus, and therefore it should trouble us. If you're willing to be a little uncomfortable and explore what the Bible has to say about injustice, this video is for you. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "We've made it to the end of Ruth! In this week's episode of Life in the Word we're exploring Ruth chapter 4, and we center our discussion around 3 key ideas. The first idea is that we need to trust God over our fears. In this story, we see how the unnamed kinsman-redeemer backs out of redeeming Ruth because he's scared of what this will do to his inheritance. If only he had trusted God,  he could've been part of God's incredible plans for Ruth. We too must choose faith over fear and step into what God is calling us to. The second idea we explore is that we need to adopt a long view, recognizing that present difficulties don't mean God has abandoned us. We must trust God in the process. Persevere through times of difficulty with the hope that you have in Christ. The final point we explore is that there is no small act of obedience. Through Ruth, Boaz, and Naomi's \"small\" acts of obedience, God brings about GREAT things, specifically through the birth of King David. We all must realize that there is no small act of obedience, and God has plans for your faithfulness. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "description": "I love ministry. I've worked in ministry full-time and part-time, and I can hardly remember a time when I wasn't volunteering at a church. I love seeing the local church grow, and I'm passionate about creating churches that are impactful. I love ministry. However, my hope is, I love God more. I hope the same is true for you. \n\nSomething I've noticed recently is that it is so easy to find ourselves slowly becoming more interested in doing things for God rather than loving God. In other words, often times we love ministry more than God. We love growing churches more than we love God. We spend more time studying celebrity pastors and big churches than God's Word. It's not a good place to be. My goal in this video isn't to create a false dichotomy between God and ministry. I am not anti-ministry. Far from it. However, we should be doing ministry out of the overflow of our love for God. Ministry is a great servant and a lousy master. It can become easy to worship ministry, to idolize ministry, but when we do we burnout. Given the current state of affairs, it's not surprising that ministry burnout is so high. I hope that by tracing the story of Gideon and the Golden Ephod in Judges 8, we'll be able to see the danger of loving ministry more than God as well as be able to see a way forward. \n\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "We live in an age of worry. Anxiety seems to plague nearly everyone in some way or another. The breath prayer, an ancient Christian form of prayer, could be a tool in your arsenal for fighting anxiety and stress. Breath prayers are a simple way of praying where you inhale, saying or thinking one line of Scripture, and exhale, saying the following line. Breath prayers are most commonly associated with the Jesus Prayer, a famous prayer out of the Eastern Orthodox tradition where people inhale, saying \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God\" then exhale saying, \"have mercy on me, a sinner.\" However, this form of praying, breath prayers, can be adapted for more than just the Jesus Prayer. It's great for praying Scripture of all kinds. Additionally, it is a contemplative form of prayer that is incredibly peaceful, helping you focus your mind, heart, and soul on God. Also, breath prayers allow you to meditate on Scripture and work towards praying continually. If you're looking for a way to grow in your faith and want to find new ways to pray this could be for you.\n\nIn this video, we cover what breath prayers are, the history of breath prayers, why you should try breath prayers, and how you can implement them. Plus, at the end there is time for a guided breath prayer/christian meditation. I think you'll really enjoy it. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "In this week's episode of Life in the Word we're looking at Ruth chapter 2. In this chapter we find God's radical social vision taking care of the poor, and we also see the power of reputation. A few things that we cover in this video are the background of reaping in Ruth, specifically looking at the Old Testament vision of taking care of the poor. Additionally we cover the background of Levirate marriage and how that works in Ruth 2. Then, I give you two key takeaways from this chapter, specifically God's care for the poor and the power of reputation. Just as God cares for the poor, Christians too are called to be mindful of the poor and bless them out of the blessings we've received. When it comes to reputation, we look at how our reputation arises out of our private lives. What we do in private determines who we become in public. Our private faithfulness often results in public blessing, just as it does here in Ruth. With all of this, we see that Ruth 2 is a jam-packed chapter filled with practical insights for your life and interesting background into the Old Testament social vision.\n\nVerses about the poor: home.snu.edu/~hculbert/poor.htm \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

This is a series I hope to continue for years to come as we explore books of the Bible on an in-depth level. As much as I love doing topical videos, in-depth Bible study will always have a special place in my heart, and that is why I'm so excited for this new series: Life in the Word. This series is going to be all about diving into the Bible and doing good old fashion Bible study. We're going to be going through entire books of the Bible, and we're starting with the book of Ruth. In this video you'll get to hear some background to the book of Ruth, learn some fun facts about the history behind Ruth, and we'll zero in on verses 6-18, examining how Ruth displays unselfish loyalty in an inspiring way. Additionally, I hope these videos will help you get a glimpse into how I do Bible study, and how you can study the Bible for yourself!\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "The Chosen Review: Does it add too much that's not in the Bible?",
    "description": "Should Christians watch the chosen? Is The Chosen biblically accurate? The Chosen is a new T.V. series by Dallas Jenkins about the life of Jesus, and the disciples. It is a crowdfunded project that seeks to bring the story of Jesus to life through film. Recently the first season launched on YouTube, and it has received glowing reviews. However, in the midst of that, some people are worried that it goes too far in adding details that simply aren't found in the Bible. For some, it crosses the line and deviates too far from the gospel accounts. It's true, there's a lot in The Chosen that's not in the Bible. While this is the greatest weakness to some, it's also the greatest strength of the show. The Chosen does a great job of bringing the characters to life in a way that is biblically faithful, even though not explicitly in the gospels. Let me explain. The Chosen is not a word for word retelling of the gospels. It's not trying to be. The Chosen is taking the Bible stories and creatively filling in details that are not intended to be infallibly correct, but are historically, culturally, and biblically informed. The series allows us to imagine what could have been not merely, what we already know is true (though it shows that as well). As long as you're not trying to replace the Bible with this show and counting on it to be infallible, inerrant, inspired, etc., then I think you'll love this show and get a lot out of it. \n\nCheck out The Chosen here: https://studios.vidangel.com/the-chosen\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "Overcoming Temptations, Grey Areas, and Living a Christian Life",
    "description": "Often times we find ourselves torn between what we know we should do, and what we want to do. This is especially true in what we call \"grey areas.\" We often feel that if the Bible doesn't specifically say we can't or shouldn't do something, then we're good to go. However, often times in these grey areas there's this feeling that we probably shouldn't do this. The fact is, when it comes to temptation for Christians and knowing what to do, it's actually quite simple. It's not easy, but it's simple. The problem is, we often think in terms of how close we can get to the line without sinning. We think we know what's best, so we try to go as far as we can with what we want to do without sinning and upsetting God. The thing is, that betrays a completely wrong way of viewing sin. Sin is not just breaking God's commands and doing what he says not to do, though it is certainly that. A wholistic, biblical view of sin is actually much bigger. Sin, in the biblical sense, is \"missing the mark.\" In this case, everything that falls short of God's design for our lives is sin. Rather than tip-toeing through temptation, we ought to be running towards righteousness. Rather than asking if something is a sin, we should ask if it glorifies God. If it doesn't, don't do it. It's simple. It's not easy, but it's simple.\n\nResources for going deeper: \nWestminster Shorter Catechism\nRomans 6:3-4\n2 Corinthians 5:17\nGalatians 2:20\nJohn 10:10\nBible Project: Sin\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "My Experience Reading Calvin as an Arminian",
    "description": "In the church I grew up in, \"Calvinism\" was a bad word. My basic understanding of Calvinism was that it made God to be a moral monster, it made humans robots, and overall it was just bad and not to be messed with. That was more or less the extent of my interaction with Calvinism growing up, and even as I learned a little more, I always had a sense it should be kept at an arm's length. Then I went to Bible College. In Bible college (Moody Bible Institute) I started meeting Calvinists and realizing that for the most part, they're not crazy, believe in a loving God, and are generally nothing like what I was told to believe. The biggest challenge to my Arminianism and my childhood views of Calvinism was actually reading Calvin's Institutes for myself. In this video, my goal is not to debate Calvinism vs Arminianism (I know, some of you might be disappointed now, but if you've read the description this far, the least you can do is watch the video). Rather, my goal is to promote honest conversation between Arminians and Calvinists. No matter which side of the debate you fall on, I think we can all learn from the other side, and hopefully in so doing realize that this really isn't about sides. We're all on the same team, disagreements and all. My challenge to you is twofold: first, be more faithful to Scripture than your theological system and second, engage with the other side at the source. If you're a Calvinist, read Wesley and Arminius. If you're an Arminian, read Calvin. There's a lot to be learned from both Calvinists and Arminians, if we're humble enough to learn. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "description": "As Churches and Christians in general adapt to life in quarantine and the world of online church, many ministries are innovating in exciting ways, yet most people are neglecting one of the biggest opportunities for ministry growth and personal growth in this season. You see, while we work ourselves into the ground making online church happen and trying to make the most out of this season, many people are missing the blessing in disguise during COVID-19: the opportunity to grow deep roots, to seek personal time with God, and focus on our faith. The truth is many of us have fallen more in love with ministry than God himself. We're obsessed with doing things for God, but we neglect spending intentional time with God. This is a dangerous trend and inevitably leads toward ministry burnout and burnout in our faith. During coronavirus quarantine, the opportunity we all should be taking advantage of is sitting at the feet of Jesus and deepening our love for him. This is what will bring real results and real growth. We must be willing to do the deep, personal work rather than seeking fast results in our faith and ministry. This is the way of slow, but significant growth. In this video we talk about all these things, and then we filter them through the story of Mary and Martha in Luke 10 where we see that sometimes only one thing is necessary: sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Many of us can spend hours and hours on our phones scrolling through social media, yet we struggle to spend even 15 minutes reading our Bibles or praying. In this video I give you a challenge at three different levels of spending more time in your quiet time than on screen time. The first level of the challenge is to spend more time in your quiet time than you do reading/watching the news. In this time, it's easy to be filled with anxiety over watching the news, and taking on this challenge will really help you find peace. The second level of the challenge is to spend more time in your quiet time than reading/watching the news and social media combined. Surely we can all agree that reading the Bible is more productive than scrolling through Instagram, yet we spend much more time on social media than reading the Bible/doing our quiet time. This might be challenging, but I think you'll really enjoy it. The final level of the challenge is the most difficult, and that is to spend more time in your quiet time than all of your screen time. If you need to make exception for work/school, go ahead, but the point is to really pay attention to how we're spending our time during quarantine and make adjustments. Don't waste your time that you have during quarantine. Use this time of quarantine to grow in your faith and deepen your relationship with God. You'll be glad you did it. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "What is Maundy Thursday? If you're like me, it's not a holiday you grew up hearing much about. Liturgical holidays weren't really a part of the evangelical tradition I grew up in. Maybe that's the case for you too. However, Maundy Thursday has much to teach us. Maundy Thursday shows us what it means to love and serve as a Christian because it points us back to the example of Jesus. Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter commemorates the night that Jesus shared the Last Supper with his disciples, washed the disciples feet, and gave his famous mandate to love one another as he had loved them. In this video, I give you a very brief explanation of Maundy Thursday (from an Evangelical Protestant perspective) as well as encourage you to reflect on this day and embody what we see Jesus doing. All Christians are called to service. All Christians are called to love. However, that is still a bit vague. Maundy Thursday helps clarify what Christian love and service really look like. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "description": "This is the day that the Lord has made. We may not understand why we are where we are, but this is the day the Lord has made, so we are called to rejoice in the midst of it. With coronavirus still spreading rampantly, it can be difficult to find joy in our daily, quarantined realities, but as Christians, we always have reason to hope and find joy. In this video we look at both Psalm 118:24 and 1 Thessalonians 5:18 to see what the Bible has to say about finding joy in all circumstances. Being joyful doesn't mean that we ignore the difficult parts of life. It doesn't even mean that we don't experience sadness. Being joyful means we are consciously grateful for the ways God is blessing us, no matter what our circumstances look like. I hope this video encourages you in these times.

    "title": "Christians, Stop Reflecting on the Coronavirus for a Moment",
    "description": "I'll admit, my default is to reflect, deconstruct, analyze, and theologize rather than feel, experience, and live through a moment. We need reflection on the Coronavirus. We need to think theologically about Coronavirus. These are all good things. But we also need to feel. We need to lament. We need to cry out to God about Coronavirus. It's ok to be upset with God. It's ok to even be angry with God. In this video, I wanted to take a brief pause from reflecting on the coronavirus and give you permission and space to lament, to feel all that you're feeling. We must remember that we do not work out our salvation and live as Christians in a disembodied thought-world. We are not Gnostics. We are not brains on a stick. We are human BEINGS. And there is a time to mourn. These are heavy times. We are in this together.",

    "title": "I Read the Entire Bible in 90 Days... and You Can Too (30 Minutes a day)",
    "description": "Last semester I read the ENTIRE Bible in just 90 days, and I found out it's not as hard as you might think. In this video I give you three things I learned from reading the Bible in 90 days plus tips on how you can read the entire Bible in just 90 days as well. Sometimes you want to go slow when reading the Bible. That's what I had always been taught, and for the most part it's good advice, but sometimes reading the Bible quickly actually helps us pick up on things we would've missed, like how the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. Reading the Bible quickly will help you see how all of the Bible points to Jesus, and it's a really cool thing once you see that for yourself. I also learned from this experience the value of listening to the Bible. For much of history, people learned the Bible by hearing it read aloud, and there's something powerful in hearing the Bible audibly read. Most importantly I learned that you absolutely can read the entire Bible, even in a time as short as 90 days. The crazy thing is it only takes about 30 minutes a day. Last of all, shoutout to Dr. Steven Sanchez at Moody Bible Institute for encouraging... well, requiring, me to do this. \n\nHere's a Reading Guide: https://csbible.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CSB90-DayReadingPlan.pdf\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Right now many of us find ourselves in uncertain, unforeseen situations. These times can be unsettling. They also happen to be the kind of times God often uses to grow us and prepare us for the call that he has placed on our lives. In times like these, many people will simply check out, veg out, and binge Netflix all day. That's an option. However, what if you took this time and decided to lean into your faith, to depend on God, and to pursue him in new and deeper ways. That's my hope and my challenge for you. My prayer is that amidst the crazy times we live in with COVID-19/Coronavirus disrupting our lives, you would draw near to God and grow in your faith. Just like James says, trials produce perseverance and mature our faith, but we have to face them and choose growth, not stagnation. This time of Coronavirus Quarantine could be a defining moment in your faith, let it be for good. Make the most out of quarantine by making it a time of Spiritual Growth. Your future self will be better off because of it and you will be preparing in this season for what God has for you in the next.\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "What Coronavirus is Teaching me about Our Plans and God's Control",
    "description": "The phrase, \"Lord Willing\" which often gets added as an asterisk to statements always seemed a bit like empty Christianese, a cliche that's a relic of the past. However, as I began hearing all of my professors at Moody Bible Institute say it, I began to feel that maybe this saying actually had something to it. Then Coronavirus struck. Seemingly everyone's plans were abruptly changed, and we were giving a jarring reminder that God, not our plans, is in control. Suddenly, I became aware that this phrase, rather than being meaningless, actually portrayed a deep humility by recognizing that God is in control and we must hold our plans loosely. This caused me to dig back into James 4:13-16 where we are instructed not to say with confidence what we will do tomorrow, next month, or next year, but rather to recognize that we will only do that which the Lord wills. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, we all need to reflect on the fact that we are not in control. And for what it's worth, that's actually a really good thing. My hope is this video will inspire you to adopt this little phrase into your vocabulary and allow it to shape you, humbling you to recognize God's sovereignty over all things. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Here's the truth: if you spend more time reading Corona Virus headlines than you do with God, fear will reign in your heart. It's really that simple. In this video we explore that idea plus give you some practical tips on avoiding panic over the corona virus. These tips include setting aside only specific times to check the news, turning off news notifications (you don't need that anxiety), and removing the news widget from your phone. Right now, many people are panicking over the Corona Virus, but as Christians we should fix our eyes on Jesus, the Prince of Peace. When we do this, we as Christians will find peace instead of panic, faith instead of fear. How we respond as Christians to the Corona Virus will say a lot about our faith, and we're living in a moment that can be seen as an opportunity to grow in our trust, or as something that will take our eyes off of Jesus. \n\nVerse Read:\nIsaiah 26:3\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "What we truly believe isn't found in our doctrinal statement written in ivory towers, it's not found in what we preach, but truly, if you want to know what someone believes, watch how they live, especially when they're afraid. The world has its eyes on the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) as it spreads across the globe, and many people right now are full of fear, wondering if this pandemic will reach their doorstep. However, how should Christians respond to the Coronavirus? Do our religious beliefs have anything to do with our reaction to a disease? In this video, I share with you my thoughts on how we as Christians should respond to the Coronavirus, encouraging you to think about three main things:\n1) Prayer Instead of Panic\n2) Choosing Faith Over Fear\n3) Speaking and Living Truth\nThrough these main points we talk about how we view prayer in times of trouble reveals our true thoughts on prayer and God. We also talk about the fact that we as Christians do not live in fear of death, but rather we have hope in Jesus. Finally, we talk about the importance of shining brightly as a city set on a hill amidst these dark times.

    "description": "In one way or another, all of us desire to be great. In fact, each of us are subtly orienting our lives around our vision of greatness. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be great. However, there are serious consequences to how we choose to define greatness. Biblically speaking, greatness isn't about being at the top of the ladder in wealth, power, prestige, or in fact, any category. Biblically speaking, Christian greatness looks like service that is saturated with humility. Jesus said in Matthew 20:26 that whoever wants to be great must be a servant, and Paul in Philippians 2 urges us to imitate Christ's humility. By all means, I want all of us to be great, but let us strive for this upside-down, paradoxical greatness that is found in humble service to others for the glory of God. For Christians, being great isn't about financial success, achieving your goals, or self-actualizing, as many prosperity gospel messages might want you to think. For Christians, greatness is imitating Christ's humble service. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "description": "Burnout is a major problem in the life of the church. Maybe you once were excited about serving in the church but before long you found yourself completely burned out. Maybe you're scared that you're on the edge of burnout. In any case, this video is for you! In this video we explore how to avoid and overcome church/ministry burnout. Specifically, we explore three main tips that will hopefully lead you to be maximally effective in your ministry for the long haul. \n\nTip One (02:55) - Recognize that burnout often stems from how you use your time outside of ministry. In this tip we explore a bit of the theology of sleep and how recognizing our limitations is actually a profoundly spiritual action. We also talk about taking a sabbath, prioritizing your life so that you seek first the kingdom of God, and how your \"no's\" strengthen your \"yes's.\"\n \nTip Two (06:46) - Remember your why. In this tip we talked about how remembering why you're in ministry will help you continue in ministry. We also talked about the importance of recognizing that we don't serve FOR God's approval but FROM God's approval. Additionally, we talked about the fact that in Christ we are a new creation, and it is in our very nature to be servants.\n\nTip Three (08:12) - Strive for sustainability in ministry, not balance. Our culture has become obsessed with the idea of balance, and somehow we've tried to baptize this into a Christian ideal. As Christians we're not called to a balanced life. Instead, we should be looking for sustainability. However, we don't seek sustainability on our own power, but rather we recognize Christ as our sustainer. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "HOT TAKE: The Saying \"Christianity is a Relationship Not a Religion\" is Actually Not Helpful",
    "description": "Chances are you've heard this catch phrase repeated ad nauseam by friends, pastors, and maybe yourself. Perhaps you're even quite a big fan of it. In today's video I want to explore why the saying \"Christianity is a Relationship Not a Religion\" is actually not true/helpful and where it falls short. Far from condemning people who use this (trust me I have said it many times) I want to challenge you to think critically about it and see where it falls short. It's absolutely true that we as Christians have a relationship with God, in fact all of us have SOME type of relationship with God, but to say that this relationship is inherently opposed to religion is simply misguided. Additionally, this phrase can lead us to become too casual in our relationship with God, treating God like a friend or an equal, rather than recognizing God as Lord. I hope this video challenges you and helps you as you continue your journey of following Jesus. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 21 year old guy with a passion for people.

    "description": "For many, church has become little more than attendance at a live speaking engagement with music. Or a concert with a little inspiration sprinkled in. They come in, they go out, mentally rating the service, and that's it. It's no surprise that even many Christians are feeling like church is optional. However, the biblical vision of being a part of the local church is about much more than consuming ideas and inspiration, it's about contributing to the life of the church and the community through service. Today there is a desperate need for Christians to recognize that church isn't a mere spectator sport, but it is something we're called to be actively involved in, getting our hands dirty and devoting ourselves to the life of the church. \n\nVerses used in this video:\nPhilippians 2:6-7\nMark 10:45\nMatthew 20:31\nMatthew 16:18\n1 Peter 4:10\nRomans 12:11\n\nBook Referenced: The Cost of Discipleship by Dietrich Bonhoeffer\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Most of us are fond of feeling fiercely independent and entirely self-sufficient. The problem is, not only do we lack real control, but that attitude is opposed to the gospel. The truth is we are in desperate need of God. God is our help and our deliverer, our place of refuge, and our source of strength. Recently as I've been going through the Psalms, I've been convicted of our deep need for God and how our desire to be self-sufficient actually runs contrary to the message of the gospel. In this video, we focus in on Psalm 40:17 which reminds us of how we are poor and needy, yet God takes thought for us. I hope this video reminds you that you don't have to try to take control of everything in your life. God is in control, and humbling as it may be, it's for our good that we aren't the captains of our own destiny. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "It's no secret that the church has problems. People inside and outside of the church are quite fond of pointing that out. The question for those in the church is, \"what are you going to do to help?\" It's tempting to spend our days criticizing the church, pointing out all its flaws, and calling it a day. Sometimes we even feel our rampant deconstructionism is a service to the church. In this video, I want to challenge you with the idea that deconstruction is only helpful when it is seen as a means to the end of reconstruction. We can point out the flaws of the church, but if it's not followed by offering solutions, then we're actually choosing to be part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. Far from being a video calling you to leave your church and start something new and \"better,\" I want to challenge you to live into the mess of your church, get your hands dirty, and work to see the church be all that it can be.

    "description": "So often Christians grow up going to church, and then they get to college, and even though they still care about their faith, church simply isn't a priority. Maybe the idea of finding a church is intimidating, or maybe you feel like you don't have time. Whatever the case, it's essential to push past these excuses and get plugged in at a local church during college. Attending church isn't an optional part of the christian life. The church is the bride of Christ, and if Jesus was willing to give up his life for the church, we should be able to give up a few hours of sleep for the church. If you're in college or getting ready to go to college and you are wondering how church fits into your college life, this video is for you. \n\nScripture References:\nHebrews 10:24-25\nEphesians 5:25\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

If you're being honest, your prayers are far from honest. Sound familiar? Maybe you can relate, maybe you can't, but my goal with this video is that by introducing you to the rich genre of lament psalms you could realize that it's ok to express your frustrations to God, to be angry with God and let him know. When life gets hard, we need to run to God in prayer with raw honesty, rather than simply praying empty prayers that our hearts aren't really in or simply ignoring God altogether. Again, I want to be sure you hear me that I'm not saying we should be irreverent, but I am saying God invites us to be honest with him and express our pain, our doubts, and our frustration. \n\nChurch referenced: mosaicchristian.org.

    "description": "When God calls us to do something, often we respond with all the reasons we can't or are unworthy, just as Moses did in Exodus 3-4. At first glance, this insecurity may seem like humility, yet underneath the surface there it is actually pride not humility. When we focus on what we can't do, we're neglecting all that God can do. More important than our individual gifts, talents, and abilities is God's infinite ability to work in and through us. In fact, this paradigm of our inability and God's ability is at the core of this gospel. In this video, by exploring Exodus chapter 3, we're going to look at how we can step into our calling with confidence, not in what we can do, but what God can do through us, learning that true humility, as C.S. Lewis put it, is not in thinking less of ourselves, but thinking of ourselves less.

    "description": "Our habits play a huge role in who we become. As Christians, it's our responsibility to develop healthy habits so that we can grow in our faith. Too often, spiritual disciplines are viewed as empty rituals and \"going through the motions\" but what I want to explore in this video is the way that spiritual disciplines can help you grow in your faith and mature as a Christian. As 2 Peter 3:18 says, we should be growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus. Christians should never be stagnant, but far too many Christians are frustrated with the fact that they're not growing in their faith. If you want to grow in your faith, the first thing to think about is developing habits that will form you into the you that you were created to be. \n\nIn the video I mentioned Dallas Willard, his book Spirit of the Disciplines, and an article going over some of them.

    "description": "If you're like me, persecution hasn't played a large role in your life, but for many Christians all over the world, persecution is a daily reality. According to Open Doors USA (https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/stories/christian-persecution-by-the-numbers/) 11 people are killed each day for their faith in Jesus. While I feel entirely inadequate to talk about persecution given my lack of experience, I felt that this was a conversation that needs to be had. While I thank God, truly, for the religious freedoms we have, they have also allowed us to become comfortable with \"casual Christianity\" as though following Jesus was an insignificant choice. In reality, the call to follow Jesus is a radical, life-altering call. Being a Christian means giving our ultimate allegiance to King Jesus and placing Jesus above everything, even our very life. \n\nThis video was inspired by my experience reading the book \"Safely Home\" by Randy Alcorn, and subsequently the documentary \"Sheep Among Wolves\" which you can watch for free on YouTube.

    "title": "How to Experience True Rest // The Lie We Tell Ourselves about Doing More and Being Busy",
    "description": "Often we find ourselves running ourselves ragged trying to do and be more, but the truth is, nothing we DO defines us. In the long run, it's about what God has already DONE. The key to experiencing true rest is understanding this pivotal idea. We must no longer receive our value from what we do and what we accomplish. Only then will we be able to experience true rest, the kind of rest God desires us to have. In our relationship with God, we don't work harder to earn God's love, we simply love because he first loved us. That is what I call \"The Great Reversal\" because in most of our relationships we try to do things to earn God's love, but with God he loves us before we do anything. I hope this video helps you experience true peace and rest and in God. Sometimes slowing down is exactly what we need to be reminded of the love and faithfulness of God. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Alright, so we know we should pray, but what should we pray for? Should we pray big, bold prayers, or simple, small prayers? That's what we're looking at in this video, but the spoiler is, the answer is yes. We should pray for all kinds of things, big and small. This is demonstrated in the Lord's Prayer, when Jesus tells us to pray both for the Kingdom to come on Earth and for our daily bread. The key to understanding what to pray for is recognizing that all good and perfect gifts come from God, so we should pray for anything, big or small. My hope with this video is that it will help you feel more comfortable praying and grow closer in your relationship with God. \n\nCredit to where it's due: This series was inspired by Pete Greig's book, How to Pray: A Simple Guide for Normal People. \n\nVerses Used:\nJames 1:17\nMatthew 6:25-34\n1 John 5:14\nLuke 11:1-3\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "How an Ancient Form of Prayer Has Helped My Prayer Life // Learning to Pray: Practical Tips",
    "description": "The Prayer of Examen is an ancient form of prayer developed by St. Ignatius Loyola that focuses on reviewing your day and examining your emotions. In this video I share with you how I implement this form of prayer in a modified version in my own prayer life. The basic outline I present for a prayer of examen in this video is from Pete Greig's book, How to Pray: A Simple Guide for Normal People. Check out that book for more information. For many of us, prayer is hard and a bit unnatural, but this simple form of prayer will help you develop a consistent habit of praying and will allow you to pray longer without even noticing. \n\nThe basic outline I follow is:\nReplay - Go back over your day in detail, including the emotions you felt throughout the day. \nRejoice - Thank God for all He did for you that day. \nRepent - Take note of the sin in your life that day, big and small, and repent before God.\nReboot - Prepare yourself for sleep and the day to come. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

Today, as I finished out the first semester, I wanted to reflect on this past semester and express my gratitude to God and to all the people that have made my Moody experience so special.

    "title": "Should You Talk to God Like a Friend? // Learning to Pray: Balancing Reverence and Intimacy",
    "description": "So how exactly should we talk to God in prayer? Should we talk to God casually? Should we be fearful when praying? These are all very important questions to consider when figuring out how to pray. The thing is, most of us feel we should pray, yet we struggle to actually do it, or we do pray, but we feel our prayer lives are empty. In this video we're going to explore the healthy tension that should exist in our prayer life between reverence and intimacy. On one hand, we're approaching God who is an all-consuming fire and ruler of the cosmos, yet at the same time, he invites us to relate to him as children to a father. I think this balance is demonstrated in the most famous prayer, The Lord's Prayer, as you'll see in the video. This video is the start of a new series, \"Learning to Pray,\" and it's my hope that it would help you find new vitality in your prayer life, turning prayer into a joy rather than an obligation.

    "description": "Welcome back to verses of the week, a weekly segment where we explore some of the verses that stood out to me from my week's Bible study. My hope is that these videos provide you not only with insight into the teaching of the Bible, but that they would also inspire you to pick up your Bible and make Bible study a consistent habit in your life. This week we explored the book of 2 Peter, a letter written by the Apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest followers. We got a little nerdy with this one, talking about key verses for Bibliology (aka the pretentious way to say verses that talk about the nature of the Bible) specifically 2 Peter 1:20-21 and 2 Peter 3:15-16. I challenged you to ask \"what is the Bible?\" as we explore the interplay of the Holy Spirit and the human authors. We also look at how Paul was considered on par with Scripture. Additionally, we mined the wonderful mystery of what it means to be partakers of the divine nature, being supplied with all we need for life and godliness, as seen in 2 Peter 1:3-8. Finally, we also discuss the Second Coming of Christ, and God's patience shown through that. I hope you enjoy this video, and as always, please reach out with any questions you might have. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 20 year old guy with a passion for people.

These include: praying when you're stressed, surrounding yourself with friends, maintaining an eternal perspective, and simply doing the little things like eating, drinking, and getting rest. Whether you're stressed about finals, sports, work, family, or any number of things, my hope is that this video will help you find peace amidst the stress of life through Jesus. \n\nVerses Mentioned:\n1 Peter 5:7 \"Cast your cares upon the Lord...\"\nPhilippians 4:4-7 \"Don't be anxious about anything...\"\nColossians 3:2 \"Set your mind on things above...\"\nJames 4:14 \"Your life is a mist\"\n1 Kings 19 - Elijah Story\nOthers were loosely pulled from or alluded to as well. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Growing up, I never listened to hymns. In fact, I've spent 20 years in church, and until recently, I knew hardly any hymns. However, that's beginning to change, and as that changes the way I see worship is changing as well. The truth is, if we can only engage in worship with a specific genre, we might be worshipping that particular expression of worship more than God himself. True worship is about God, not the style of music. Another thing I've found is that hymns which I once thought were boring and lifeless, have some truly beautiful lyrics that communicate rich truths about God. My hope is that through this video you will not only see the beauty of hymns, but more so that you'll realize that worship is less about a particular genre and more about God himself and the posture of our heart towards him.\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

Maybe you grew up in a Christian home, or maybe coming to faith just didn't seem that spectacular for you. Often times we assume that since no one would want to make a movie out of our story, that we therefore have a boring testimony and it can't really be used by God. Maybe you wouldn't say the last part, but you probably live like it's true. In this video I want to encourage you that is so far from the truth.

    "title": "Your Weakness and God's Power // A few thoughts on 2 Corinthians 12:1-10",
    "description": "\"Your weakness is the canvas upon which God paints his masterpiece called grace\" - these are the words that came to mind when I heard my professor speaking on 2 Corinthians 12. Often times we seek to have everything under control, be the master of our own destiny, and triumph over anything that comes our way through our own power. Because of this, we effectively tell God that we have no need for his grace and his power. However, in 2 Corinthians 12, through the story of the thorn in his flesh, Paul reveals this insight: God's power is made perfect in our weakness. In essence, God's power is seen in our life when we recognize our own weakness and our dependence upon him. \n\nAbout me:\nHey! My name is Austin, and I'm a 20 year old guy with a passion for people.

Oswald Sanders, \"Spirit of the Disciplines\" by Dallas Willard, \"You Are What You Love\" by James K. A. Smith, and a bonus quote from Martin Luther. \n\nQuotes include:\n\"It's in the worship of the Triune God that we are restored by being restoried\" - James K. A. Smith\n\"If you want to experience the flow of love as never before, the next time you are in a competitive situation, pray that the others around you will be more outstanding, more praised, and more used of God than yourself. Really pull for them and rejoice for their successes. If Christians were universally to do this for each other, the Earth would soon be filled with the knowledge of God's glory.\" - Dallas Willard\n\"It's inconsistent to profess that we love God while withholding love from those he came to serve.\" - Bob Kauflin\n\"We are all beggars living on the bounty of God.\" - Martin Luther\n\"The disciple's love for Christ is to be supreme over self-love.\" - J.

    "title": "Should Christians Try to Convert People of Other Religions? // Biblical discussion + practical tips",
    "description": "Should Christians proselytize, trying to convert people from one faith system to Christianity? If you asked American culture at large, the answer would be no. According to Barna Research Group, even if you asked practicing Christians, specifically Millennials, the answer still might be no. Among Practicing Millennial Christians, nearly half think it is wrong to share your faith with people of other religions with the goal of converting them, even though this same group overwhelmingly believes that accepting Jesus is the best thing that could happen in someone's life. So what are we supposed to make of this dissonance? \n\nEven though it may be unpopular, Christians must recognize that the Bible leaves little room for Universalism, and because of that, it's no surprise that Christians are clearly called to convert people of other religions. It's uncomfortable, I know. However, if we are to follow Jesus fully and faithfully, we must recognize that we need to share the Gospel with people who believe differently than us. \n\nVerses Referenced:\nMatthew 28:19-20\nJohn 14:6\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Check out my new favorite Bible! Interleaved Bibles are great for taking notes and journaling as they have one full page of notes for every one page of text. If you're looking to get more out of your Bible reading, one of the best things to do is to start taking notes when you read, but often times it can be cumbersome to have a journal and a Bible, but there's not enough space in your Bible for notes. That's where this Bible really comes in handy. Plus, you'll be in good company as the likes of D.L. Moody and Jonathan Edwards were users of interleaved Bibles. If you're looking for a new Bible, this is definitely my favorite. \n\nHere's a link to get one (I don't get anything out of this): https://www.christianbook.com/esv-journaling-interleaved-edition-imitation-multicolor/9781433553349/pd/553341?event=ESRCG\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "You Can't Lose When Sharing Your Faith (unless you're a jerk)",
    "description": "None of us like being rejected, and when it comes to sharing our faith, this is what most of us fear. What if I told you that when it comes to evangelism you can't lose? When you share your faith three things could happen: they could accept Christ (win!), you could plant a seed (win!), or you could get rejected (win!). Wait, rejection as a win? Yes! In this video we explore how even when you're rejected sharing your faith, you are blessed by God because he blesses those who are hated and insulted because of him. You really can't lose! Well, unless you're a jerk, but we'll talk about that at the end. \n\nYou see, we live in a time when far too many Christians (preaching to myself here) are content to stay in our comfort zone, drawing a very small radius of faith around us. This isn't how it should be! We should be boldly sharing our faith, spreading the good news, and bringing people to Christ. This series, Real Talk About Evangelism, is all about equipping and inspiring you to live a bold life for Jesus. \n\nVerses mentioned: \nColossians 4:5-6\n1 Corinthians 3:6\nLuke 6:22-23\nAnd many others paraphrased or drawn from.\n\n*This video was greatly influenced by Mark Cahill's book, One Thing You Can't Do in Heaven.\"\nYou can find it at: https://markcahill.org/product/one-thing-you-cant-do-in-heaven/\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "title": "Don't Put Jesus First...",
    "description": "Putting Jesus first might sound like a good idea, but in reality, it implies that there are a hierarchy of things to do, some excluding Jesus. Rather putting Jesus first we should strive to put Jesus at the center of our lives. As Christians, we are new creations, and we are called to live out of this new, fully transformed identity. Everything we do, big or small, should be impacted by who we are in Christ and done in recognition of the fact that Jesus is all around us, inside of us, and empowering us. The truth is, we can do nothing apart from Jesus, and everything we do should be done for the glory of God. There is no task too small or ordinary that can't be done to bring glory to God if we are abiding in him as we are instructed to do in John 15. To abide in Jesus is to recognize his proximity to you, his all encompassing nature, his supremacy, and so much more. My challenge to you is to not see your life and your to-do list divided into \"spiritual\" and \"ordinary\" but to do everything for the glory of God, with him at the center. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Chances are you've heard about \"evangelism\" and maybe you already have some opinions on it, but what is it after all, and why does it matter? In our second installment in the \"Real Talk About Evangelism\" series, we're exploring what evangelism is, and why it matters. In this video I challenge you to see evangelism as the natural outflow of a love of God, or put this way, the Great Commission is the natural consequence of the Great Commandments. Jesus commands us to go into all the world to make disciples because that's what you do when you love God and love people. Evangelism matters because people matter, and it's a matter of life or death, and evangelism is the call of all Christians - it's not optional. \n\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Are you living to bring glory to your name, or to God's? Today I see more and more that people fall into the danger of seeing the church as a platform and Christianity as a means to grow their influence, brand, etc. and while it might not always be a conscious realization, it is a dangerous road to travel down as we seek the glory that God alone deserves. In this video we explore an incredibly powerful quote by Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf who said \"Preach the Gospel, die, and be forgotten.\" This quote, while it might not make you feel light and fluffy, should inspire you to examine your true motivations, and forces you to ask yourself, if no one took note of what I was doing for God, would I still do it?\n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Hundreds of thousands of people die each day who don't know Jesus. Do you care? Of course you do. Do you care enough to do something? ...  *crickets* ... This question was posed to me the other day, and it convicted me about my preference of comfort over evangelism, and made me wonder what possible excuse do I have for not sharing my faith more. The truth is evangelism is hard. Evangelism is uncomfortable, but as Christians, we have to get out of our comfort zones and share the Gospel, even when it's hard. In this series we're going to be taking a journey towards evangelizing more often and in healthier, more productive ways.

    "title": "Would You Be a Christian Even if Heaven Didn't Exist?",
    "description": "Christianity without heaven? Would you still follow Jesus if heaven didn't exist? While it may seem like an odd question, it's one worth exploring because your answer will reveal your primary motivation for following Jesus. Is being a Christian just about going to heaven, or is it about something more than that? In this video I challenge you that there are three primary motivations for following Jesus: Bribery (I'm just in it for what I get out of it), Fear (I'm just in it to avoid punishment), and Love (I'm in this because I think it is worthy of my devotion). If you as a Christian are motivated by fear or by external rewards (bribery), you are going to struggle to experience authentic character growth and development. However, if you are motivated out of a love of God and a love of God's will, you will find yourself growing in your faith much faster and more effectively. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "Religion and Politics often mix as well as mentos and coke, matches and dynamite, oil and water... you get the point. However, is this how it has to be? How should Christians approach politics? This video is all about how our faith as Christians should impact our political views, if at all. You see as Christians, we don't see our faith as one part of our life, but rather as something that transforms us holistically into a new creation, so it's only natural that our faith affects all areas of our life including politics. In this video we explore three main ideas: \n1) How our faith should impact our politics\n2) Jesus saves, not politics\n3) Remember your citizenship is ultimately in heaven\n\nBy looking at verses like Romans 12:1, Romans 12:2, Colossians 3:2, Hebrews 12:2, 1 Corinthians 10:31, and Philippians 3:20 we get an overarching view of what the Bible has to say about this topic. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

    "description": "There is perhaps no greater asset someone can have than a secure sense of value. It is out of our striving for a sense that we are enough, that we matter, that we have value that we run in circles and constantly try to do more and be better just to feel like we are enough. We spend day after day and year after year trying to convince ourselves and others that we are worthy of love, and that we are enough. Yet for many of us, this hunger proves to be insatiable. No matter how hard we try, we never feel like we're quite good enough. It's no wonder that insecurity seems to be pervasive in our society because we're constantly trying to find our value in things that were never meant to hold that weight. The only source of value that will ever satisfy our souls is found in the unconditional love of God for us. It is only in the love of a perfectly heavenly Father that we can find what we've always been searching for: the true knowledge that we are ok, that we are worthy of love just as we are, that we matter, that we are enough. When we have found our sense of security, our sense of value, we no longer need to live our lives searching for the approval of others, and for the first time we can focus on simply being who we were created to be and doing what we were created to do. \n\nAbout Rough Draft Poems:\nRough draft poems is a series dedicated to putting out poems that aren't perfect, but they are honest and raw.

    "description": "Abortion is an extremely emotionally charged issue, and this video is not about picking sides. However, among passionate pro-life Christians, I sometimes see people who fight so zealously for the unborn child, while neglecting the terrified mother, or worse yet, villainizing those that disagree with them or have had abortions in the past. This video is here to say, if you're going to be pro-life, and I think that's great, make sure to be pro-life not just for the unborn child, but for the mother as well. Let's make sure that our passion doesn't carry us away and allow us to miss the point of this all, which is to show love to all those involved. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

Insecurity is not a girl's issue, it's a people issue, and guys just as much as anyone crave to feel that they are enough, just as they are. However, for many of us, there's a nagging feeling that we're not okay just as we are, so we are forced to put on masks, try harder, do more, compare, and much more, all in an attempt to try to make ourselves feel as though we are enough. The truth is, our value shouldn't come from any source other than the unconditional love of God for us. \n\nAll throughout this \"Dear Guys\" series, we've been talking about issues that we as guys need to own up to and overcome so that we can move towards the brighter future that we all want, and if we are to create that future, we'll need to do it uninhibited from our insecurities, running our race, not trying to beat everyone else at theirs.

All throughout the New Testament this idea can be found, and what we're left with is the knowledge that a life well-lived is marked by a mindset of \"you first not me.\" Dying to yourself means that you're putting the needs of others above your own selfish desires. Dying to yourself means that you live as a new creation, putting off your old self. It is in dying to yourself that we find the abundant life that Jesus set out for us, a life of purpose, passion, and meaning that is more fulfilling than anything else.

    "description": "When it comes to engaging with people we disagree with, we all have a tendency to be pretty bad listeners. Our first step is often to begin criticizing others and thinking of our response before someone is even done speaking. However, if we want to become better listeners and get better at engaging with people who are different than us, we need to adopt a mindset of curiosity over criticism. When you meet someone who you don't understand, what if you saw it as an opportunity to be curious and learn, rather than being critical and divisive? \n\nThis content comes from a message given to high school students at FCF Church in a series called Love Across the Lines: Engaging with People Who Are Different than You. If you'd like to catch this clip in context, be sure to check out the full message. \n\nWhether you identify as a Christian or not, I think we can all learn from the wisdom found in James 1:19 where we are instructed to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

With over 63,000 new visitors to Pornhub every minute, chances are you've found yourself caught up in porn before, are currently, or will be one day. As Christians how should we handle the giant temptation that is porn? Is porn bad? Is it ok for Christians to watch porn? How can Christians stop watching porn? Why is watching porn a sin? If you've asked these questions or similar ones, this video is for you. \n\nThis is the second installment in our dear guys series, a series where we're calling guys to own up to and overcome problems that are facing all of us. This video isn't here to shame you about your porn problem, but it is here to remind you that you can overcome it. In this video we explore not just the fact that porn is fueling lust, but the subconscious narratives that porn causes to manifest in our minds and how porn reshapes our view of women and sex, placing unrealistic expectations on women and equating their value with their appearance and ability to sexually perform.",

    "description": "For far too long, the weight of responsibility when it comes to guys' struggles with lust has been placed on girls to wear longer skirts, higher shirts, and make sure their brothers in Christ don't stumble. There's nothing wrong with modesty, but there is a problem with shaming girls for what they're wearing in the name of modesty, and an even bigger problem with teaching guys that they're incapable of self-control. In an effort to promote purity, so much emphasis has been placed on modesty, and not enough emphasis placed on self-control. However, when Jesus addressed lust, he placed the responsibility where it should be, on the guys (see Matthew 5:29). If you're a guy, and you're struggling with lust, you're not alone. You're also not a victim to your feelings of lost. You can be a victor. You can overcome your struggles with lust, but it starts with owning your own growth, taking personal responsibility, and recognizing that you're in control, you're not at the mercies of what everyone around you wears. It's time to address this mistake in the purity movement and call guys to a higher standard so that the question is never again asked, \"what was she wearing?\" when a girl is the victim of sexual violence. \n\nAbout me:\nHey!

In this video I'll dive into guilt, where it comes from, why it happens, and how it doesn't fit in the Christian worldview. To be fair, I do believe that conviction still has a large role to play in the lives of Christians, but there is a subtle, yet incredibly important distinction between guilt and conviction. If you'd like to see a full video on that distinction, let me know!

So, if you're struggling in your Christian walk and feel like you're not experiencing the life change that you expected, I'd encourage you to hear me out on this one and see if it applies to you.

Often times Christians have very strong feelings that everyone else is wrong about God, the Bible, etc. except for them. You can see it from the pulpit (do churches still have those?) to the comment section of YouTube videos. Perhaps even this one. In this video I challenge you not to consider the truth to be entirely subjective and meaningless, but rather to approach theology with a bit more humility and grace.

This message came on the heels of Revive 2019, an annual youth retreat, on which many of the students went and many made significant life decisions regarding their faith journey. My goal was that this message would encourage them to not dwell on their failures that they have experienced and will experience in regards to their commitments they had made as well as calling them to persevere. All the best things in life come on the other side of significant challenges, and this is certainly true in following Jesus. \n\nWhether you were on Revive 2019 or not, whether you're a student, adult, or not quite sure either category fits you - no matter who you are, I hope this message inspires you live fully, love deeply, and move towards the life that God is calling you to.",

Whether you're facing the horrors of bullying and peer pressure, or you're simply trying to maximize these four years of your life, I think this video is for you. \n\nVideo Equipment:\nMain Camera: Canon 80d\nSecond Camera: Sony a6300\nLenses Used: Sigma 17-55 F2.8 and Sony 35mm F1.8\nMicrophone: Blue Yeti\n\nMusic Credits: Don't Look Back by Jonny Easton\n\nAbout me: I'm just a guy who is utterly fascinated with Jesus of Nazareth and his teachings of love for all people.",

    "description": "Love your enemies. These three words spoken by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount are perhaps three of the most subversive yet profoundly impactful words he ever spoke. This week I want to challenge you to think about what it might look like for you to truly love your enemies. It's a hard teaching, but it could change everything. Whether you're a Christian, or not sure about all of this, I think you can agree that a world in which we learn to love our enemies is a better world, a world we all want. \n\nScripture Referenced: \nMatthew 5\n\nVideo Stuff:\nCanon 80d\nRode Video Mic Pro\nEdited with FCPX\n\nMy name is Austin, and I'm just a guy who is utterly fascinated with Jesus of Nazareth and desires to share his message of love and reconciliation to anyone gracious enough to listen.",
