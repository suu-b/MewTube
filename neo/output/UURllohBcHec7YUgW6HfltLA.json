    "title": "Over the Garden Wall cover in Ancient Greek, \"Into the Unknown\" | Εἰς τὸ ἄγνωστον",
    "description": "Ancient Greek cover of the song \"Into the Unknown,\" the theme song to the beautiful miniseries \"Over The Garden Wall\" (2014) which celebrates autumn's serenity and fearsomeness, exploring themes of death, resurrection, and hope.  See the original theme song here, whose imagery (which is highly symbolic — go watch the show! it's amazing) has been imitated in this video: https://youtu.be/WJeeA_O88Zw\n\n🕊️ Εἰρήνηι γέγραφα φθινόπωρον ἄγᾱν ἀγαπώσηι\n   ἥ μοι ἐδήλωσεν  κάλλος τῆς ὥρᾱς.\r 🍂\n\nΥΠΕΡ ΤΟΥ ΠΑΡΑΔΕΙΣΟΥ ΤΕΙΧΟΣ\nOVER THE GARDEN WALL\n\n« Εἰς τὸ ἄγνωστον »\n\" Into the Unknown \"\n\nμετενηνεγμένον καὶ ἀναπεπλασμένον ὑπὸ Λουκίου Θεοφίλου Ῥᾱνιηρίου\ntranslated and performed by Luke Amadeus Ranieri\n\nLyrics (with literal English translation):\n\nἈ̄έρα γ’ ἀμφὶ γαλακτοφαῆ \nRound the milklighted mist\nκεκαλυμμένα πάντ’ ἐφάνη.\nall that has been hidden is revealed.\nΠάλαι χαλεπὴ λήθη τε μνήμη \nLong ago burdensome forgetfulness and memory\nποῖ φέρεται;   Ὅποι τὰ τέλη;\nwhere will they be carried off to?  To what point the end?\nΕἰ μὴ καθ’ ὕπαρ, πῶς δ’ οὐ κατ’ ὄναρ;\nIf not in reality, why not in dreams?\n\nΟὐρίωι ἐγὼ\nBorn on a fair\nεὔρωι δ’ ἠχθεὶς   \neastern wind \nδιὰ ποικίλων φύλλων\nthrough many-colored leaves\nχορεύω στροφῆι,\nI dance in a swirl,\nχρῡσεῖ μνήμηι,\ngolden memory,\nγλυκύτατα ψευδῆ πλάσσων.\nsculpting the loveliest lies.\n\nCommentary\nThis translation seeks to match long and short syllables (meter) to the long and short notes of the original song; additionally — and I believe this is the first time anyone has attempted this since antiquity — the pitch accent also corresponds to the pitches of the melody.  See here how Ancient Greek sheet music's melodies follow the natural pitches of the lyrics:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_accent#Evidence_from_music\n\nThis is how we know that pitch accent is a part of the Ancient Greek lanugage until about the 4th century AD.\n\nἀ̄έρα \"air/mist\" — in Homer this more often means mist.\nγαλακτοφαῆ \"milklighted\" — imagine my delight to have found this work which so closely matches the original lyric!\nἐφάνη \"is revealed / appears\" — gnomic aorist.\nλήθη \"forgetfullness\" — in Greek mythology, the dead would drink of the River Lethe to forget their living existence.\nοὐρίωι...εὔρωι \"the fair east wind\" — the east wind, associated with autumn, is *not* fair and gentle, hence the deliberate contrast here; nevertheless the east wind drives one to the west, towards the setting sun (given the themes of Over the Garden Wall, I think you can see what I was getting at).\n\nThe pronunciation used is that of Classical Attic, or the best I could manage while also trying to sing this song — as I'm not a trained singer, this was the best compromise I could muster.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!  I hope it inspires you to learn Ancient Greek (and also to watch Over the Garden Wall if you haven't seen it yet!), and to write your own translations, covers, and poetry in Ancient Greek that make full use of phonemic syllable length, meter, and pitch accent.\n\n(did you spot the turtle?)\n\nPatrons have access to the downloadable audio file: https://www.patreon.com/posts/142501595\n\n🦂  Support my work on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🏛  Ancient Greek in Action · Free Greek Lessons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n☕️ Support my work with PayPal:\nhttps://paypal.me/lukeranieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\nJoin the channel to support it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRllohBcHec7YUgW6HfltLA/join\n\n🌅  ScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\n🦁 Legio XIII Latin Language Podcast:\nhttps://youtube.com/LegioXIII\n\n🎙 Hundres of hours of Latin & Greek audio:\nhttps://lukeranieri.com/audio\n\n👕 Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\n🦂  https://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\n🦅  https://www.LukeRanieri.com",

    "title": "Camillus, Columbus Rōmānus, Cap.2: Frātrēs et Sorōrēs",
    "description": "This is the first draft of a new introductory Latin reader called CAMILLVS · COLVMBVS ROMANVS, a story about the odyssey of a pigeon in Ancient Rome whose exploits carry him from the Eternal City to the edges of the Empire.  This book will serve as an introduction to the Latin language as well as Roman history, culture, literature, and society.\n\n🎙 The audio has been made available for download to all my Patreon supporters: https://www.patreon.com/posts/123604218\n\n📕 The PDF, exercises, additional audio, and grammatical notes are available to Patreon supporters at a higher tier: https://www.patreon.com/posts/camillus-pdfs-123618459\n\n🕊️ Irene La Preziosa (  @irenelapreziosa  ) and I lend our voices to this chapter.\n\nThe approach of CAMILLVS is much inspired by Colin Gorrie's Ōsweald Bera: An Introduction to Old English ( https://youtu.be/1IFyYozfM38 ), where the focus is put on the story most of all, and the vocabulary and grammar used is for the purpose of telling that story.  This approach seems to be more effective at imparting key vocabulary and grammar into long-term memory than traditional readers that build a story around a grammatical progression and chapters on thematic vocabulary.  Yet more credit is due to my colleague Logan Kilpelä, who, in an as-yet unpublished work, has pioneered not only a story-focused approach, but also the use of extensive images and deictic boxes.  For this reason, I call this approach Kilpelätion (as explained in the introduction to my Kilpeläted edition of Thrasymachus called Thrasymachus' Catabasis: https://bit.ly/thrasymachuscatabasis ).  Further thanks are due to Raphael Turrigiano, who in collaboration with Logan Kilpelä has offered great insights to the paedagogical utility of these techniques, and whose guidance has as a result been of great value in the present work.\n\nThis video presents a draft of the reader, which will eventually be made available as a printed book.\n\nThe character of Camillus is inspired by a real-life pigeon that Irene La Preziosa and I rescued in Rome whom we named Camillo, recounted here in Ancient Greek on my podcast Legio XIII:  https://youtu.be/7VwgLu1WtOM\n\n🦂  Support my work on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🤠  Take my course LATIN UNCOVERED on StoryLearning, including my original Latin adventure novella \"Vir Petasātus\"\nhttps://learn.storylearning.com/lu-promo?affiliate_id=3932873\n\n🦂 Sign up for my Latin Pronunciation & Conversation series on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/54058196\n\n🏛  Ancient Greek in Action · Free Greek Lessons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n☕️ Support my work with PayPal:\nhttps://paypal.me/lukeranieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\nJoin the channel to support it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRllohBcHec7YUgW6HfltLA/join\n\n🌅  ScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\n🦁 Legio XIII Latin Language Podcast:\nhttps://youtube.com/LegioXIII\n\n🎙 Hundres of hours of Latin & Greek audio:\nhttps://lukeranieri.com/audio\n\n👕 Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\n🦂  https://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\n🦅  https://www.LukeRanieri.com",

    "title": "Camillus, Columbus Rōmānus, Cap.1: Ōvum et Columba",
    "description": "This is the first draft of a new introductory Latin reader called CAMILLVS · COLVMBVS ROMANVS, a story about the odyssey of a pigeon in Ancient Rome whose exploits carry him from the Eternal City to the edges of the Empire.  This book will serve as an introduction to the Latin language as well as Roman history, culture, literature, and society.\n\n🎙 The audio has been made available for download to all my Patreon supporters: https://www.patreon.com/posts/123604218\n\n📕 The PDF, exercises, additional audio, and grammatical notes are available to Patreon supporters at a higher tier: https://www.patreon.com/posts/123618459\n\n🕊️ Irene La Preziosa (  @irenelapreziosa  ) and I lend our voices to this chapter.\n\nThe approach of CAMILLVS is much inspired by Colin Gorrie's Ōsweald Bera: An Introduction to Old English ( https://youtu.be/1IFyYozfM38 ), where the focus is put on the story most of all, and the vocabulary and grammar used is for the purpose of telling that story.  This approach seems to be more effective at imparting key vocabulary and grammar into long-term memory than traditional readers that build a story around a grammatical progression and chapters on thematic vocabulary.  Yet more credit is due to my colleague Logan Kilpelä, who, in an as-yet unpublished work, has pioneered not only a story-focused approach, but also the use of extensive images and deictic boxes.  For this reason, I call this approach Kilpelätion (as explained in the introduction to my Kilpeläted edition of Thrasymachus called Thrasymachus' Catabasis: https://bit.ly/thrasymachuscatabasis ).  Further thanks are due to Raphael Turrigiano, who in collaboration with Logan Kilpelä has offered great insights to the paedagogical utility of these techniques, and whose guidance has as a result been of great value in the present work.\n\nThis video presents a draft of the reader, which will eventually be made available as a printed book.\n\nThe character of Camillus is inspired by a real-life pigeon that Irene La Preziosa and I rescued in Rome whom we named Camillo, recounted here in Ancient Greek on my podcast Legio XIII:  https://youtu.be/7VwgLu1WtOM\n\n🦂  Support my work on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🤠  Take my course LATIN UNCOVERED on StoryLearning, including my original Latin adventure novella \"Vir Petasātus\"\nhttps://learn.storylearning.com/lu-promo?affiliate_id=3932873\n\n🦂 Sign up for my Latin Pronunciation & Conversation series on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/54058196\n\n🏛  Ancient Greek in Action · Free Greek Lessons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n☕️ Support my work with PayPal:\nhttps://paypal.me/lukeranieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\nJoin the channel to support it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRllohBcHec7YUgW6HfltLA/join\n\n🌅  ScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\n🦁 Legio XIII Latin Language Podcast:\nhttps://youtube.com/LegioXIII\n\n🎙 Hundres of hours of Latin & Greek audio:\nhttps://lukeranieri.com/audio\n\n👕 Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\n🦂  https://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\n🦅  https://www.LukeRanieri.com",

    "title": "Reading Greek with Luke, An Ephesian Tale 1.3",
    "description": "Welcome to Reading Greek with Luke, in which I read to you in Ancient Greek, and ask you questions about the reading, much as a teacher in a classroom.  This video will help train your listening and reading comprehension, as well as your speaking proficiency.\n\nLet's read *An Ephesian Tale* ! one of the earliest surviving Ancient Greek novels, by Xenophon of Ephesus who lived in the 1st or 2nd century AD.  This novel involves romance, action, and adventure, and is thought to have been an inspiration to Shakespeare among others.\n\n*How you might use this video lesson:*\n1. Click or tap on the part of the reading in the timeline (labeled μέρος αʹ (part 1), μέρος βʹ (part 2), μέρος γʹ (part 3), etc.) and listen to the recitation *without* looking at the text.  Before I start asking questions about the reading, go back to the beginning of that part of the reading, and listen once again without seeing the text.\n2. Listen to that part of the reading a third time, but now do so while reading along with the text.\n3. Pause the video and recite the text aloud on your own.\n4. Listen to my questions, and attempt to answer them aloud in Ancient Greek by finding the answer in the text.  (You may pause the video if you need more time to answer.)\n\nYou may add or skip steps as is appropriate for your level.  The reason not to look at the text, but only listen two times in a row, is to help your brain isolate key words.  For people not used to hearing Ancient Greek spoken to them without immediate reference to the written word, this will be challenging!  But that's the idea: it challenges your brain to understand exclusively through auditory input.  Then, when you hear the same part of the text a second time, you'll get much more.  It'll surprise you!  By the end of the video, you'll understand what you're hearing far better than when you started.  \n\nNo matter what your current level in Ancient Greek, this will likely present some challenge: not only do you have to get used to receiving auditory-only input (which is rare for anyone who works with an ancient language), but you will have to get used to the story, my manner of reading, and also the Classical Attic Pronunciation (discussed here: https://youtu.be/dQBpwKWnZAo ).\n\nThe result of this exercise will be much improved reading comprehension in Ancient Greek that you can utilize with any text you encounter.  You may even learn to speak a little too!\n\nThe printed book I am using may be found on Amazon here (purchasing via this affiliated link brings a very small commision to support the channel): https://amzn.to/4f0QA1b\nThis edition by C. T. Hadavas is exceptional because it has every new word calqued in English on the same page as the main text (I don't show you those parts of the pages).\n\nHowever, the original text that you see in the video, written by Xenophon of Ephesus, is available for free and can be found online, such as at Perseus: https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0649\n\nMy inspiration for this video series comes in part from my colleague Adrian Hundhausen, author of the Pharos Thematic Guide to Ancient Greek Vocabulary ( https://amzn.to/3A5iVV5 ) who teaches Ancient Greek in this fashion.

    "description": "Welcome to Reading Latin with Luke, in which I read to you in Latin, and ask you questions about the reading, much as a teacher in a classroom.  This video will help train your listening and reading comprehension, as well as your speaking proficiency.\n\nLet's read *Eighteen Roman Letters*, edited by Theodore Horn in 1937, which contains selected letters by Cicero, Seneca, Pliny, and others.  These letters were selected by Horn to elucidate to the reader important historical events, characters, and the lives of the Ancient Romans.\n\n*How you might use this video lesson:*\n1. Click or tap on the part of the reading in the timeline (labeled pars i, pars ii, pars iii, etc.) and listen to the recitation *without* looking at the text.  Before I start asking questions about the reading, go back to the beginning of that part of the reading, and listen once again without seeing the text.\n2. Listen to that part of the reading a third time, but now do so while reading along with the text.\n3. Pause the video and recite the text aloud on your own.\n4. Listen to my questions, and attempt to answer them aloud in Latin by finding the answer in the text.  (You may pause the video if you need more time to answer.)\n\nYou may add or skip steps as is appropriate for your level.  The reason not to look at the text, but only listen two times in a row, is to help your brain isolate key words.  For people not used to hearing Latin spoken to them without immediate reference to the written word, this will be challenging!  But that's the idea: it challenges your brain to understand exclusively through auditory input.  Then, when you hear the same part of the text a second time, you'll get much more.  It'll surprise you!  By the end of the video, you'll understand what you're hearing far better than when you started.  \n\nNo matter what your current level in Latin, this will likely present some challenge: not only do you have to get used to receiving auditory-only input (which is rare for anyone who works with an ancient language), but you will have to get used to the characters and events, my manner of reading, and also the Classical Latin Pronunciation if you are unfamiliar with it.\n\nThe result of this exercise will be much improved reading comprehension in Latin that you can utilize with any text you encounter.

Many have often asked what an Ancient Roman accent would sound like English.  The accent I gave Rufus was a combination of a few ideas:\n\nItalian:\nThe foundation is essentially a highly stereotypical Italian accent.  This includes some intonational characteristics, or how I say “okay,” and a few other factors.  Indeed, when I speak Latin, I try to employ Italian-like intonation and oral posture — but it’s important to say that I fall well short of my intended goal in my actual production of spoken Latin, especially in an uncontrolled environment like the streets of New York.\n\nClassical Latin phonology:\nI reverted the Italian base to Classical Latin wherever in made sense: v is /w/, final /i/ /o/ /u/ are frequently lengthened, s is retracted [s̠], and th is [tʰ], for example “very nice to meet you” [ˈwɛ.riː na͡e̯s̠ tuː miːt juː] or “thanks I do to you” (calqued from Latin grātiās tibi agō) [tʰɛːŋks̠ a͡e̯ duː tuː juː], as if they were written phonetically in Classical Latin orthography “verī naes tū mīt jū,” “thēnx ae dū tū jū.”  Latin also permits final consonants -s, -n, -t, -nt, unlike Italian (where there is an audible schwa vowel following in stereotypical Italian accents), but not final -m, hence “I am strong” (valeō) [a͡e̯ ã strɔn] or [a͡e̯ ẽ strɔn].\n\nLatin idiom and syntax:\nRufus tends not to use articles in English, as articles are not part of the Latin language. I also calqued many Latin idioms into English, such as “thanks I do to you” from grātiās tibi agō, “what is name to you?” quid est tibi nōmen?, “beautifully!” pulchrē!, “the most beautifully!” pulcherrimē!, “optimally!” optimē!, “minimally” minimē; or randomly inserting Latin grammar into the English, such as the dative case in “to the dominae.”  I also attempted to spontaneously not “know” how to say things in English, trying my best to imagine the challenges that a native Latin speaker would undergo.\n\nThe result is an accent that sounds like a strange mix of Italian (the intonation), Slavic (inconsistent use of articles), Spanish (not as many schwas after final consonants), and Greek (retracted s).\n\nOver the course of the day before we went to New York to film, I spent a few hours speaking this way, practicing the accent with my wonderful fiancée — who did such an amazing job recording this whole video — and she generously laughed at each one of my silly jokes or weird ways of speaking.  If I had spent more time practicing the accent, I bet it would have been a lot more consistent and a much more “authentic” representation of how Ancient Romans might have sounded in Modern English.  But I’m happy with the result, and it’s great that so many of you have found it entertaining as well.",

    "description": "Interview with the Legionary PART 3: Upon hearing of Legionary Dec. Helvidius Rufus' story about Emperor Trajan, he asks if Rufus would be interesting in talking about it in front of other people. Their conversation is suddenly interrupted, however, by a local with a chip on his shoulder. The story then takes a turn for the unexpected. \n\n💬 Subtitles available in English & Latin! 🇬🇧 🦅 🇮🇹  \n\nLEGIONARIVS\nWritten & Performed by Luke Amadeus Ranieri. Directed by Irene La Preziosa @irenelapreziosa \n\nThe ancient Germanic character is speaking Gothic (and Latin with a reconstructed Gothic accent according to ancient Gothic's phonotactic limitations), Gothic being the oldest attested and complete Germanic language from antiquity. His lines were taken from words and phrases in the Gothic Bible and rearranged for the dialogue in the video. He speaks in the reconstruction Gothic pronunciation of the time of Ulfilas. While Gothic like this would have be heard readily more to the east and a couple centuries later than these LEGIONARIVS scenes (which take place in the early 2nd century AD in Germania Inferior), its existence a bit earlier is plausible, it is at least representative of an ancient Germanic voice, which is what the scene called for.\n\n#Latin #Legionary #RomanSoldier\n\n🦂  Support my work on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🤠  Take my course LATIN UNCOVERED on StoryLearning, including my original Latin adventure novella \"Vir Petasātus\"\nhttps://learn.storylearning.com/lu-promo?affiliate_id=3932873\n\nSupport the channel by joining it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRllohBcHec7YUgW6HfltLA/join\n\n🏛  Ancient Greek in Action · Free Greek Lessons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n☕️ Support my work with PayPal:\nhttps://paypal.me/lukeranieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🌅  ScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\n🦁 Legio XIII Latin Language Podcast:\nhttps://youtube.com/LegioXIII\n\n🎙 Hundres of hours of Latin & Greek audio:\nhttps://lukeranieri.com/audio\n\n👕 Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\n🦂  https://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\n🦅  https://www.LukeRanieri.com\n\n00:00 In Germania Inferior...\n03:10 Outtake",

Αυτή η συμβατική προφορά ονομάζεται η ‘Λουκιανή Προφορά’.  Είναι διαφορετική προφορά από αυτή που έχετε συνηθίσει.  Η Λουκιανή Προφορά είναι μια ιστορική αναδημιουργία του ήχου των Αρχαίων Ελλήνων κατά τη Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία.

The term \"Ancient Greek\" applies primarily to the language of those who wrote the literature of the Greek language from approximately 800 BC to 600 AD.

    "title": "Sally's Song in Latin, Nightmare Before Christmas 🎃 (lyrics: Stefano Vittori)",
    "description": "The Nightmare Before Christmas in Latin! Incubus Ante Nātālem. \nSALLY'S SONG · REGILLAE CARMEN\nlyrical translation by Stefano RVMAK Vittori 🐌 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKsXlPwvq17rQ2tIcixwRZw\nperformed by Aurora Van Bel 🌅 \nMusic design by Chris PERNOX Davis 🌚\nhttps://www.youtube.com/pernox\nEdited by Luke SCORPIO Ranieri 🦂 \nhttps://youtube.com/ScorpioMartianus\n\nThis unique and fascinating performance of the beloved song from Danny Elfman and Tim Burton's 1993 \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" incorporates *both* Ecclesiastical and Classical Pronunciations. \n\nIn this performance Aurora Van Bel uses a Late Latin pronunciation similar to the one heard at the end of Luke's performance of \"Jack's Lament\" ( https://youtu.be/iQleLmFkZAo ), which is a transitional stage between Classical and Ecclesiastical Latin. This is to emphasize Jack's discontent with either the Halloween or Christmas world, and ultimately to signify that the unique, the special melody of existence he seeks is in the very voice of Sally. Sally is what he longs for, and she for him.\n\nThe text has been rendered masterfully by Stefano Vittori in true Ancient Roman poetic meter, the very soul of Latin, so well as to surpass the power of even the original lyrics.\n\n🎃  See our songs from The Nightmare Before Christmas in Latin! at this playist of my videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SiwuGR1H6ZRhLvusm1iQN7ay\n\nThank you so much for *sharing* this video with as many people and in as many places as you can! 👻 ☃️\n\nTo fully appreciate the incredible music of the original movie, see this video by @Sideways https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0GQlIOSi60 🧛‍♂️ \n\nTranslated by Stefano Vittori\n\nSpīrante in ventō sēnsibus\nquiddam servātum in nōs venit.\nEt, quamvīs esse ūnā volō,\nnōn solvō cor praesāgiō:\nad portam stat; mātūruit.\n\nId lentus sentīs,\nquod nōs adfēcit?\nAt tū nescīs,\nquid nōbīs ipse sīs,\net lentus praeterīs.\n\nMī cārum pignus quō ruit?\nQuō multōs ūnus corripit?\nFautrīcem sī fautrīcibus\ncōnfundō vōcem vōcibus,\nvēcors paeān obmūtuit.\n\nAt cum nōn nōlēs,\ncandēscent sōlēs.\nAt tū nōn vīs.\net tū nūmquam volēs.\nAt tū nōn noster es.\n\nComment:\n\nNow Rēgilla is alone, far from society, which doesn't understand her: they're multī, without a true critical personality, and follow their ūnus. They're victims of this latter's foolish dream inspired by some deus nōn bene advocātus, who filled their voices with a vēcors paeān. She's also far from his beloved one. She's the sole who truly loves him, prō quō eī sunt magna bella pugnāta, but he is a Narcissist who loves himself and because of that he prefers the superficial admiration of the masses. He's also lentus, something Ovid's Penelope says of Ulixes. He doesn't come to her and doesn't come back to her, who pertains to him since the very beginning of time. The song is full of Catullus of Ovid's spirit. Metrically speaking, the syllables are all long but the penultimate, which is like a breath break after a doubt. Even among the simple vowels there's a high amount of long ones: the song has few verses but the time is suspended. A brief, yet everlasting, desperate, heart breaking cry of love.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRllohBcHec7YUgW6HfltLA/join\n\n🏛  Ancient Greek in Action · Free Greek Lessons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n🦂  Support my work on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\n☕️ Support my work with PayPal:\nhttps://paypal.me/lukeranieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🌅  ScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\n🦁 Legio XIII Latin Language Podcast:\nhttps://youtube.com/LegioXIII\n\n🎙 Hundres of hours of Latin & Greek audio:\nhttps://lukeranieri.com/audio\n\n👕 Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\n🦂  https://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\n🦅  https://www.LukeRanieri.com",

Alexius is also a very impressive Modern Latin poet who has composed hundreds of poems in Latin with, in my opinion, the skill of Ovid and the creativity of Horace.\n\n00:00:00 Skip to 2min13 (no sound in beginning)\n00:02:13 Start here!

The twelve AGIA episodes from 2020-2021 are still useful for that purpose, and also helpful in learning a suite of important grammar and vocabulary.  However, I decided in the rebooted series to craft a course with improved paedagogical methods, taking fuller advantage of the audiovisual medium, and not related to another course or book.  I also now use Classical Attic Pronunciation as my preferred pronunciation for paedagogical reasons, rather than the Samosatene Lucian Pronunciation you hear in the original run of AGIA.  All of these, however, are useful pronunciations, tools, and approaches.\n\n************\n\nLearn Ancient Greek through comprehensible input!

Alexius is also a very impressive Modern Latin poet who has composed hundreds of poems in Latin with, in my opinion, the skill of Ovid and the creativity of Horace.\n\nSubscribe to Alexius's channel where he uploads new content in Latin almost every day, including really interesting vlogs about any topic imaginable:\n➡️ https://youtube.com/alexiuscosanus\n\nAlexius's poetry in Latin can be found here: \n📚  https://facebook.com/AlexiusCosanus\n\n🖊  And even more of his poems can be found here:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/cosanusaeger/home/carmina/carmina-mensis-selecta/i\n\nIn our chat, the three us will discuss (in Latin!) the challenges and rewards of teaching Latin in full immersion, and also talk about Alexius' poetry and what this might mean for the continued rivival of the Latin language in the modern era.\n\n🦂  Support on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\n📚  Luke Ranieri Audiobooks:\nhttps://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com\n\n🏛  Ancient Greek in Action · Free Greek Lessons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n👨‍🏫  My Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata playlist · Free Latin Lessons:\nhttps://youtu.be/j7hd799IznU\n\n🌅 polýMATHY on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\n🦁 Legio XIII Latin Language Podcast:\nhttps://youtube.com/LegioXIII\n\n🎙 Hundreds of hours of Latin & Greek audio:\nhttps://lukeranieri.com/audio\n\n👕 Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\n🦂   https://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\n🦅  https://www.LukeRanieri.com\n\n📖 My book Ranieri Reverse Recall on Amazon:\nhttp://amzn.to/2nVUfqd",

The dual will therefore rarely be used again in this series, but the memory of it from the earliest videos, anchored forever in the mind with kittens and turtles and birdies, will allow the student to recognise the dual instantly and effortlessly in any text in the future. The peculiar behavior of the plural neuter, which uses singular verbs, is also explained entirely in context. The words for \"why,\" \"because,\" \"do you understand\" and \"I understand\" are taught.\n\nSubtitles are only placed where they are necessary for the desired level of comprehension, which is primarily *auditory*; nevertheless, if you are interested in seeing the transcript: the entire book for this series can be found here:\n📖  https://bit.ly/ancientgreekinactionbook\n\n🗣  PRONUNCIATION NOTES\n⬇️ Download the Ancient Greek Pronunciation Guide \nhttps://expert-experimenter-2558.ck.page/abae340f49  📄\n\n🇬🇷 For Modern Greek speakers (see below for English*): Έλληνες φίλοι, σε αυτό το βίντεο δεν χρησιμοποιώ την παραδοσιακή σχολική προφορά της Αρχαίας Ελληνικής, εκείνη που χρησιμοποιείτε και γνωρίζετε στην Ελλάδα σήμερα.

    "title": "OLD SERIES | Ancient Greek Commands | Ancient Greek in Action! ep.7",
    "description": "Update October 2025: The Ancient Greek in Action series has been rebooted, and you can see the first epsiode here: https://youtu.be/wYxRQv_qZiA\n\nThe original run of AGIA (Ancient Greek in Action) was designed as a way to prepare the viewer for Chapter 1 of the Athenaze graded reader.  The twelve AGIA episodes from 2020-2021 are still useful for that purpose, and also helpful in learning a suite of important grammar and vocabulary.  However, I decided in the rebooted series to craft a course with improved paedagogical methods, taking fuller advantage of the audiovisual medium, and not related to another course or book.  I also now use Classical Attic Pronunciation as my preferred pronunciation for paedagogical reasons, rather than the Samosatene Lucian Pronunciation you hear in the original run of AGIA.  All of these, however, are useful pronunciations, tools, and approaches.\n\n************\n\nLearn Ancient Greek through comprehensible input! By watching every video in this series in order, you should be able to understand everything after watching a video two or three times. In this way, you will build a strong foundation in Ancient Greek. Ancient Greek includes both Classical Attic Greek and Biblical Koine Greek.\n\nThis lesson is taken from the Polis method by Christophe Rico, and you can find his book \"Polis\" on Amazon here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9657698006/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lukeranieri-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=9657698006&linkId=5e409cb66b3d12bef18d0ba0ec7dd826\n\n🐢 ANCIENT GREEK IN ACTION 🏛 \nby Luke Amadeus Ranieri 🦂 Λούκιος ̣Θεόφιλος Ῥᾱνιήριος  \n\n🏺  Complete Ancient Greek in Action playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n🦁 LESSON NOTES\nWe now learn commands and the accusative case of nouns, using Total Physical Response Sequential (TPRS) as pioneered for Ancient Greek by Dr. Christophe Rico at his Polis Institute and in his book Polis.\n\nSubtitles are only placed where they are necessary for the desired level of comprehension, which is primarily *auditory*; nevertheless, if you are interested in seeing the transcript: the entire book for this series can be found here:\n📖  https://bit.ly/ancientgreekinactionbook\n\n🗣  PRONUNCIATION NOTES\n⬇️ Download the Ancient Greek Pronunciation Guide \nhttps://expert-experimenter-2558.ck.page/abae340f49  📄\n\n🇬🇷 For Modern Greek speakers (see below for English*): Έλληνες φίλοι, σε αυτό το βίντεο δεν χρησιμοποιώ την παραδοσιακή σχολική προφορά της Αρχαίας Ελληνικής, εκείνη που χρησιμοποιείτε και γνωρίζετε στην Ελλάδα σήμερα.  Αυτή η συμβατική προφορά ονομάζεται η ‘Λουκιανή Προφορά’.  Είναι διαφορετική προφορά από αυτή που έχετε συνηθίσει.  Η Λουκιανή Προφορά είναι μια (υποθετική) ιστορική αναδημιουργία του ήχου των Αρχαίων Ελλήνων κατά τη Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία.  Σας ευχαριστώ για την υπομονή και την κατανόησή σας. 🇬🇷 😊 \n\n*Pronunciation notes: This video uses the Lucian Pronunciation of Ancient Greek, which is a reconstruction of the historical sound of Greek during the first centuries of the Roman Empire.

Ancient Greek includes both Classical Attic Greek and Biblical Koine Greek.\n\n🐢 ANCIENT GREEK IN ACTION 🏛 \nby Luke Amadeus Ranieri 🦂 Λούκιος ̣Θεόφιλος Ῥᾱνιήριος  \n\n🏺  Complete Ancient Greek in Action playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixsonRdfNNv-CPNq8xUwgam\n\n🦁 LESSON NOTES\nThis lessons builds on the foundation carefully laid by the previous 5 lessons. Since we are familiar with nouns in all genders, numbers, and declensions, we are at last free to explore sentences in context! And of course, what could be beter than following the model of the first chapter of LLPSI Familia Romana which so expertly teaches Latin (for which see: https://youtu.be/UQCo7_YAn_M ).\n\nIn this lesson we learn the the verb \"to be\" in singular (ἐστὶ), dual (ἐστὸν), and plural (εἰσὶ), and while doing so we review from the previous lessons how to answer \"how many\" (πόσοι), and are introduced to the question words \"where?\" (ποῦ) and \"what?\" (τί). Yes/no interrogatives ἆρα and ἆρα μὴ are taught in context. We also learn \"but\" (ὰλλὰ) and how it compares with the uniquely Ancient Greek pairing μὲν...δὲ which roughly equates to \"on the one hand...on the other hand.\" We also learn locative with the dative case, how to say many and few (ὀλίγοι, πολλοὶ), and lean the difference between a land and a Roman province.\n\nThe Dual is *not* a mandatory form in Ancient Greek, since the regular Plural may be used in place of the Dual even for two of a thing. Thus τὼ ποταμὼ may be rendered as οἱ ποταμοὶ even for two rivers. This overlap will be clarified in later lessons. The Dual form is used with increasing rarity through the centuries of Ancient Greek (roughly 9th century BC to 6th century AD).\n\nIf you are interested in seeing the transcript: the entire book for this series can be found here:\n📖  https://bit.ly/ancientgreekinactionbook\n\n🗣  PRONUNCIATION NOTES\n⬇️ Download the Ancient Greek Pronunciation Guide \nhttps://expert-experimenter-2558.ck.page/abae340f49  📄\n\n🇬🇷 For Modern Greek speakers (see below for English*): Έλληνες φίλοι, σε αυτό το βίντεο δεν χρησιμοποιώ την παραδοσιακή σχολική προφορά της Αρχαίας Ελληνικής, εκείνη που χρησιμοποιείτε και γνωρίζετε στην Ελλάδα σήμερα.

Like the First and Second Declensions, Third Declension nouns may be masculine, feminine, or neuter. The key to understanding Ancient Greek gender and number is, as always, tied to the article, which always tells us exactly what gender and number a noun is. \nThe Dual is not a mandatory form in Ancient Greek, since the regular Plural may be used in place of the Dual even for two of a thing. Thus τὼ λέοντε may be rendered as οἱ λέοντες even for two lions. This overlap will be clarified in later lessons.

    "description": "Update October 2025: The Ancient Greek in Action series has been rebooted, and you can see the first epsiode here: https://youtu.be/wYxRQv_qZiA\n\nThe original run of AGIA (Ancient Greek in Action) was designed as a way to prepare the viewer for Chapter 1 of the Athenaze graded reader.  The twelve AGIA episodes from 2020-2021 are still useful for that purpose, and also helpful in learning a suite of important grammar and vocabulary.  However, I decided in the rebooted series to craft a course with improved paedagogical methods, taking fuller advantage of the audiovisual medium, and not related to another course or book.  I also now use Classical Attic Pronunciation as my preferred pronunciation for paedagogical reasons, rather than the Samosatene Lucian Pronunciation you hear in the original run of AGIA.  All of these, however, are useful pronunciations, tools, and approaches.\n\n************\n\nLearn Ancient Greek through comprehensible input! By watching every video in this series in order, you should be able to understand everything after watching a video two or three times. In this way, you will build a strong foundation in Ancient Greek. Ancient Greek includes both Classical Attic Greek and Biblical Koine Greek. 🏺 \n\n🐢 ANCIENT GREEK IN ACTION 🏛 \nby Luke Amadeus Ranieri 🦂 Λούκιος Θεόφιλος Ρᾱνιήριος  \n\nPronunciation notes (see below for English*): Έλληνες φίλοι, σε αυτό το βίντεο δεν χρησιμοποιώ την παραδοσιακή σχολική προφορά της Αρχαίας Ελληνικής, εκείνη που χρησιμοποιείτε και γνωρίζετε στην Ελλάδα σήμερα.  Αυτή η συμβατική προφορά ονομάζεται η ‘Λουκιανή Προφορά’.  Είναι διαφορετική προφορά από αυτή που έχετε συνηθίσει.  Η Λουκιανή Προφορά είναι μια (υποθετική) ιστορική αναδημιουργία του ήχου των Αρχαίων Ελλήνων κατά τη Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία.  Σας ευχαριστώ για την υπομονή και την κατανόησή σας. 🇬🇷 😊 \n\nPreliminary Lesson on the Ancient Greek Alphabet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr1laRMrw64\n\nLesson 1 introduces feminine nouns in a group called the First Declension. The Singular and Plural forms are introduced, as well as the Dual form.\n\n📖  https://bit.ly/ancientgreekinactionbook Ancient Greek in Action Book\n\nThe Dual is not a mandatory form in Ancient Greek, since the regular Plural may be used in place of the Dual even for two of a thing. Thus τὼ χελώνᾱ may be rendered as αἱ χελῶναι even for two turtles. This overlap will be clarified in later lessons. The Dual form is used with increasing rarity through the centuries of Ancient Greek (roughly 9th century BC to 6th century AD).\n\n*Pronunciation notes: This video uses the Lucian Pronunciation of Ancient Greek, which is a reconstruction of the historical sound of Greek during the first centuries of the Roman Empire.

Η Λουκιανή Προφορά είναι μια (υποθετική) ιστορική αναδημιουργία του ήχου των Αρχαίων Ελλήνων κατά τη Ρωμαϊκή Αυτοκρατορία.

Master each stage before proceeding to the next. Mastery of Stage 4 is required; mastery of Stage 5 is encouraged.\n\nStages explained\nStage 1: monotone (purpose: to divorce the verse from native language interference, permitting concentration on the language's most important building blocks: long and short syllables)\n - determine the correct syllable scansion of a given text from poetry by underlining the  long syllables with straight lines and the short syllables with curved lines\n - tap out the rhythm\n - produce the rhythm vocally in monotone with a singing syllable such as \"la\" or \"ba\"\n - sing the line of poetry in monotone, maintaining precise rhythm; a metronome may help \nStage 2: ditonic inflexion (purpose: to reintroduce the second most important lexical feature of Latin, namely the stressed syllables, but using pitch instead of loudness; this helps the practitioner to further divorce the long syllables from the emphasized/stressed/accented syllables)\n - add acute accent marks to the stressed syllables of the text\n - as in stage 1, sing the line of poetry, but on the accented syllables raise the pitch by  some interval (such as a third, but any will do that is comfortable)\nStage 3: polytonal spoken inflexion over ditonic base (purpose: to reintroduce the natural prosody of speech while still artificially raising the pitch on every accented syllable)\n - as in stage 2, raise the pitch on the accented syllables, but allow the melody of the voice  to flow as natural speech between highs and lows\n - remember always to maintain strict long and short syllable rhythm; nothing is more  important\nStage 4: pseudo-spoken inflexion (purpose: to recite each line with normal spoken melody)\n - instead of raising the pitch on every accented syllable, allow normal lexical stress (which is not necessarily based on pitch, but is instead an increase in loudness) to take over\n - maintain correct syllable quantity at all times, with robotic adherence to the rhythm\n - each line should sound more or less like normal speech, expect that all natural pauses,  either based on punctuation, or interpretation by the practitioner, will be ignored\nStage 5: recitation for performance (purpose: to perform the piece for an audience)\n - rather than reciting each line of poetry as a strict rhythmical unit, break the text into  phrases according to the natural pauses of narrative\n - ensure each phrase is rhythmically correct\n - techniques include pauses at punctuation, and no pause at the end of a line if the phrase  continues semantically into the next line\n\nThe Verse Scanning Exercise is to be utilized for all poetry until Stage 4 can be attained at sight for any poem.",

Thus my reconstruction of the Vulgate is meant to be the way that anyone would, more or less, have prononuced these sentences.\n\nTo that end, the historical reconstructions are best guesses based on the evidence I have available at this time.

The structure of the song consists of a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The strophe and the antistrophe are each composed of two distichs, where the first verse is made of two anapaestic feet (two short and one long syllable) followed by an Ionic ā minōre (two short and two long syllables) and the second verse is made of three anapaestic feet - so it's basically the same metre of the first one, in a catalectic form. The rhyme scheme for each of them is ABAB. \n\nThis is also the scheme of the recitative strophe of the introduction. The epode is composed of three strophes: \n\n1) a distich identical to the preceding ones, with rhyme scheme AB, \n\n2) a strophe made of four verses consisting of an anapaestic foot followed by an Ionic ā minōre, with rhyme scheme AABB, \n\n3) a strophe made of five verses, the first two with the same metre as the preceding strophe, the second two with the same metre as the even verses of the distichs of the strophe and antistrophe, and the last consisting of a unique anapaest, with rhyme scheme AABCC. This structure is repeated twice, the two iterations being separated by a recitative prosastic part. In the original English version, the structure is the same but with amphibrachys (a foot less popular in Latin) instead of anapaests (except for the distich in the epode, which has anapaests and Ionics as well).\n\nScar's Latin is of an educated, archaizing type echoing the register of the original English. Traits of this register are: the fall of final /s/ after short vowels before words with consonantal onset (\"hebentibu'\" - a popular trait, hence shared by hyaenas' \"optimu'\"), obsolete nominal and verbal inflected forms (\"fameī\", \"faxō\"), elevated Hellenisms (\"dogmata\", \"logos\" - in contrast with hyaenas' more trivial Hellenisms \"euge\", \"sophōs\").\n\nAs an anti-Augustan, Scar also wants to appear as an \"optimus princeps\" (a term typical of the Augustan propaganda) and cites in the distichs of the epode the most important Author of that propaganda, Vergil, in particular the most propagandistic piece, Eclogae IV (\"redeunt Sāturnia rēgna / (oritur)(et) nova prōgeniēs\", vv. 6-7; \"aderit jam tempus(:) honōr(um)(ēs)\", v. 48, as well as \"bona turba, favēte mihī\", where \"favēte\" echoes \"casta favē, Lūcīna\", v. 10). \"Duce mē/tē\" itself echoes \"tē duce\" of v. 13. \"Per tempora dūrō\" echoes Catullus' \"obstinātā mente perfer, obdūrā\" (8,10).\n\nHowever, Scar's deepest nature is Epicurean. Hence, his true favorite poet is not Vergil, whom he uses only for political purposes, but Lucretius, as it's clear from his use of some of this poet's favorite terms, like \"retinentia\", and the S decidua itself.\n_____\n\nMerch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus",

    "title": "Quirites: a name for Latin & Ancient Greek speakers",
    "description": "Quirīs, gen. Quirītis • Κυρῑς, γεν. Κυρῖτος 🕊 \n\nSymbolism in this video:\n\n1) Thumbnail\n- The Greek version Κυρῖτες is blue, a color of peace, to give homage to the flag of Greece. « Κυρῖτες » is placed above the Latin version in deference to the Ancient Greeks who were annexed to the Roman Republic.\n- Green also suggests peace. The dove carries an olive branch (two symbols of peace), and the fronds astride the words may be an olive or laurel wreath, both of which symbolize peace, & letters.\n- « quirItés » has taller letter « I » and « é » with apex, in the ancient Roman style of indicating long vowels (see: https://youtu.be/D3bmLi1bKI0 ).\n- The dove is flying in the position of the circumflex accent in Κυρῖτες. \n\n2) Music\n- \"Venus, Bringer of Peace\" by Gustav Holst. The normal ending theme of ScorpiōMārtiānus is \"Mars, Bringer of War\" by Holst.\n- Since my channel's name invokes the God of War, and because I am a soldier in real-life, I find a fitting irony that ScorpiōMārtiānus is the purveyor of this message of harmony.\n\n3) The Power of the Peace-bearing Feminine\n- The fundamental theme of the entire video is the transformation of war into peace, bad into good, symbolized by the feminine. (This is meant to contrast with some ancient negative depictions, such as Helen of Troy or of the Biblical Eve.) Naturally men and women are equally capable of good and evil; the message is that a better future is created with both female and male together.\n- The power of the Sabine women to stop a war, not with arms, but with the relative fragility of their bodies and the very flesh of their children, is a testament to the bravery and wisdom of women to bring these particular men to their senses. Animals in conflict would not have been moved. But those human men, with hearts and minds, *were* moved. The pursuit of wisdom is therefore a journey that men and women take together, hand in hand. A great historical example of this is John Adams' reliance of his wife Abigail, who was his greatest friend and advisor his whole life.\n\n4) The Admission of Past Evil, and its Basis for Present Good\n- We freely admit, and must acknowledge, the wickedness of the past of nearly all societies, not least of which the Ancient Romans and Greeks, who partook in slavery, kidnapping, looting, even genocide.\n- It is tempting to discard the greatness of these cultures, their languages and art and philosophy, based on these facts alone. The message of this video is not to do so; peace and goodness can rise from horrible deeds. The plant will grow from the dirt, if we cultivate it.\n\n5) The Importance of Women to Modern Humanism\n- Even in recent memory, women were found less frequently in circles of Latin and Ancient Greek scholars, and girls were more seldom taught these languages than boys. While there are plenty of historical examples of great women who were exceedingly well educated in the classics, such as Abigail Adams and Heloïse d'Argenteuil, the vast majority of post Roman scholars and ancient authors has been male. While this has been a wrong of the past versions of our societies, it in no way precludes our rectifying the situation now, and growing from this past while appreciating it at the same time.\n- This video in no way seeks to elevate women at the expense of men, historical or present, but rather seeks to invite their participation in modern Classics and humanism, for I believe a freely achieved balance will improve our studies and mutual goals.\n\n6) Faces\n- Faces of great authors and figures in the early part of the video are of men. But after the Sabine women stop the war, female images are the focus in the same way as the prior male figures: the goddess Εἰρήνη or Pāx, the caryatids on the Acropolis, which is also a temple to a goddess, women and men and their children on the Āra Pācis, followed by a relief of a mother, and finally the so-called \"Sappho\" painting from Pompeii, whom I emphasize as the face of the future of half of all Latinists and Hellenists.\n- Petrach, the \"first humanist,\" is pictured early in the video. Near the end of the video appears the image of Laura de Noves ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_de_Noves ), who was the inspiration for Petrach's courtly love and perhaps greatest work, the Canzoniere. This reiterates the importance of the balance of the masculine and feminine.\n\n_____\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nLegio XIII Podcast:\nhttps://legioxiii.podomatic.com/\n\nFind ScorpioMartianus and Legio XIII merchandise here:\nHīc mercēs \"ScorpioMartianus\" et \"LEG·XIII\" īnscrīpta vēneunt: \nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and share!\nHuic canālī subscrībite, favēte, eumque cum aliīs partiminī, obsecrō!\n\nhttp://www.ScorpioMartianus.com",

    "title": "How to Tell Time in Latin! Quota hōra est? · Latin Time Expressions",
    "description": "In this introduction to telling time in Latin, I explain the Roman duodecimal system of twelfth parts and show how we use them to count every five minutes of the hour.  Enormous thanks to Justin Mansfield for teaching me these words and their usefulness to telling time!\n\n11/12 deūnx            1/12 uncia \n10/12 dēxtāns         2/12 sextāns \n9/12 dōdrāns          3/12 quādrāns\n8/12 bes                   4/12 triēns\n7/12 septūnx           5/12 quīncūnx\n                    6/12 sēmis\n\nThere are many ways to express time in Latin, and this is just one way. I find the duodecimal system of twelfth parts is exceedingly useful for two reasons:\n\n1) When we ask the time, the response will overwhelmingly be \"it's ten twenty\" not \"it's ten twenty one,\" or \"it's six fifty-five\" and not \"it's six fifty-three.\" We naturally round to the nearest 5-minute mark, or twelfth part of the hour. Therefore, if the time is 8:35, we can say \"hōra est octāva cum septunce\" instead of the much longer and clumsier \"hōra est octāva et trīgintā quīnque minūtae.\" Therefore the brevity and clarity has a practical purpose.\n2) The reason to exercise speaking Latin, even at a very elementary level, is to allow the fundamental nature of the language to become part of who we are, so that when confronted with the literature we can more quickly, more fluently, more easily understand the text. And these words having to do with twelfth parts are infrequent enough that we don't usually every try to learn them outright, and yet common enough to add to our stumbling blocks when exploring a text. Thus, it is useful to become familiar with these words in a context that we use frequently on a daily basis, namely telling time.\n\nPDF of the slides in this video available for download at https://www.patreon.com/posts/29261259\n\n_____\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nLegio XIII Podcast:\nhttps://legioxiii.podomatic.com/\n\nfind ScorpioMartianus and Legio XIII merchandise here:\nhic indusia \"ScorpioMartianus\" et \"LEG·XIII\" inscripta veneunt: \nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and share!\nHuic canali subscribite, eumque diligite, partimini, quaeso!\n\nhttp://www.ScorpioMartianus.com",

It represents my best attempt at the pronunciation of Classical Attic Greek (roughly 500 B.C. to 400 B.C.).\n\nWhen using these videos, pause after each phrase, and repeat after me.  Try to emulate what I do as exactly as possible: clearly pronounce the long and short vowels, the long and short syllables, and follow the rhythm and the melody of the phrase just like music.  Note the elision or mixing of vowels between words, including the shortening of final long vowels and diphthongs into short versions, a vital part of the pronunciation of Ancient Greek, as well as Latin and all the Romance languages.\n_____\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/scorpiomartianus/\n\nScorpiomartianus apud Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ScorpioMartian\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nLegio XIII Podcast:\nhttps://legioxiii.podomatic.com/\n\nfind ScorpioMartianus and Legio XIII merchandise here:\nhic indusia \"ScorpioMartianus\" et \"LEG·XIII\" inscripta veneunt: \nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and share!\nHuic canali subscribite, eumque diligite, partimini, quaeso!\n\nhttp://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\nSpectācula in Linguā Latīnā τε καὶ τῇ ἑλληνικῇ γλώττῃ",

The epitaph has been variously dated, but seems to be either from the 1st or the 2nd century AD. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the ancient Greek musical notation, was found engraved on a tombstone (a stele) from the Hellenistic town Tralles near present-day Aydın, Turkey, not far from Ephesus. It is a Hellenistic Ionic song in either the Phrygian octave species or Iastian tonos. While older music with notation exists (for example the Hurrian songs), all of it is in fragments; the Seikilos epitaph is unique in that it is a complete, though short, composition.\" - Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikilos_epitaph\n\n_____\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nLegio XIII Podcast:\nhttps://legioxiii.podomatic.com/\n\nfind ScorpioMartianus and Legio XIII merchandise here:\nhic indusia \"ScorpioMartianus\" et \"LEG·XIII\" inscripta veneunt: \nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and share!\nHuic canali subscribite, eumque diligite, partimini, quaeso!\n\nhttp://www.ScorpioMartianus.com",

    "description": "My patrons can download this audio file on Patreon! 🦂🤠🌵 \nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/30050204\n\nAthenaze playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU1WuLg45SixrxviQiHOlkdkT-XPvyrgv\n\nPurchase Athenaze (Italian, Ørberg-style version) at Amazon.com at this link :\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8895611071/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=8895611071&linkCode=as2&tag=lukeranieri-20&linkId=ee642016063b524b55056fb89f365d9c\n\nThe Athenaze series can also be purchased directly from Vivarium Novum: https://vivariumnovum.it/catalogo/athinaze-athenaze\n\nThis recording is unique in that it preserves all long and short vowels and syllables, as well as the correct scansion and rhythm of the phrase, as encountered in Ancient Greek poetry, and even a reasonably plausible interpretation of the Ancient Greek pitch accent system (very different from the stress accent system of English, Italian, Latin, and others).  It represents my best attempt at the pronunciation of Classical Attic Greek (roughly 500 B.C. to 400 B.C.).\n\nWhen using these videos, pause after each phrase, and repeat after me.  Try to emulate what I do as exactly as possible: clearly pronounce the long and short vowels, the long and short syllables, and follow the rhythm and the melody of the phrase just like music.  Note the elision or mixing of vowels between words, including the shortening of final long vowels and diphthongs into short versions, a vital part of the pronunciation of Ancient Greek, as well as Latin and all the Romance languages.\n_____\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nLegio XIII Podcast:\nhttps://legioxiii.podomatic.com/\n\nfind ScorpioMartianus and Legio XIII merchandise here:\nhic indusia \"ScorpioMartianus\" et \"LEG·XIII\" inscripta veneunt: \nhttps://teespring.com/stores/scorpiomartianus\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and share!\nHuic canali subscribite, eumque diligite, partimini, quaeso!\n\nhttp://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\nLatin Language Blog • Logos Telaris Latinus (τε καὶ ἑλληνικός)",

In order to give the thumbnail a more inscriptional appearance. Other languages also adopted the apex from the Romans to mark long vowels, including Czech, Old Norse, and Icelandic; the \"accent\" marks written on words in these languages are not actually marking accent or stress, but are marking a vowel that has a long duration as opposed to a short duration. J.R.R. Tolkien also used apices instead of macrons to mark long vowels in the languages of Middle Earth, such as Elvish.\n***\n\nI hope you enjoyed it!

    "title": "Lord of the Rings in LATIN \"You shall not pass!\" Fellowship of the Ring - Dominus Ānulōrum",
    "description": "Lord of the Rings in Latin! The Fellowship of the Ring\nDominus Ānulōrum LATINE Societās Ānulī\n\nNotes on the translation:\n\nYou cannot pass!\nTibi nōn licet trānsmeāre!\n- I chose \"trānsmeāre\" because of the open mouth of the 'a' vowel to match the \"pass\" of the original English.\n\nI am the servant of the secret fire,\nWielder of the Flame of Arnor.\nMinister sēcrētī fulgōris,\nsum Flammifer ipse Arnōris.\n- By wonderful coincidence, \"fulgōris\" and \"Arnōris\" rhyme! which would have pleased Tolkien, I imagine.  Many synonyms for \"fire\" and \"flame\" are used in this translation for the sake of variety and as a teaching tool for students on the various possible words.  The word \"sēcrētus fulgor\" is used here for \"secret fire\" because the fire that Gandalf bears in the light of \"Arnor\" which is the Sun, a bright flashing fire, or a White Fire, as opposed to the Dark Fire used by evil.\n\nThe Dark Fire will not avail you,\nFlame of Udûn!\nĀter ignis nōn tibī subveniet,\nĀrdor Udūnī!\n- The word \"tibī\" may optionally have a long vowel, and I liked the rhythm better here.  The verb \"subvenīre\" was chosen over \"prōdesse\" because the Balrog is about to fall into the chasm, and Gandalf assures him in my Latin that no power will \"come beneath\" him to help him.\n- The word \"Ārdor\" was chosen because it is another nice synonym to teach, and also because \"ārdēre\" metaphorically refers to fires of passion, both of love (or better *lust*) and hate, which is meant to contrast with the white fire of \"fulgor.\"\n\nGo back to the shadow!\nRedī in tenebrās!\n- This is a rephrasing of Catullus 3: \nquī nunc it per iter *tenebricōsum*\nillūc, unde negant *redīre* quemquam.\nat vōbīs male sit, malae *tenebrae*\nOrcī, quae omnia bella dēvorātis\n- Additionally, my reading of the word let's the stress fall thus: \"tenébrās\" because this is how Catullus arranged it in his poem, though \"ténebrās\" is an acceptable variant pronunciation.\n\nYou shall not pass!\nTū nōn meābis!\n- In favor of other verbs, \"meāre\" was chosen because it doubles the mouth movements well.\n\nFugite, fatuī!\n- Literally \"Flee, silly ones!\" this was chosen for the identical alliteration in the English, and to double the mouth movements of Gandalf.\n\n***\nThe accent-like marks (´) you see in the thumbnail of the video are actually apices: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_(diacritic)#Details\n\nWhich are used to mark the long vowels. In order to give the thumbnail a more inscriptional appearance. Other languages also adopted the apex from the Romans to mark long vowels, including Czech, Old Norse, and Icelandic; the \"accent\" marks written on words in these languages are not actually marking accent or stress, but are marking a vowel that has a long duration as opposed to a short duration. J.R.R. Tolkien also used apices instead of macrons to mark long vowels in the languages of Middle Earth, such as Elvish.\n***\n\nI hope you enjoyed it!

    "description": "Bottom line: the Ecclesiastical from of Latin is not divorced from properly observed syllable quantity — long and short vowels and long and short syllables are to be enunciated distinctly and rehearsed assiduously in all forms of spoken Latin.\n\nWhile I most enjoy the true Classical Pronunciation of Latin, I am fond of the softer phonemes found in the traditional Italian Pronunciation of Latin (a.k.a. the Ecclesiastical Pronunciation of Latin), and as you can see from this video, I don't have too much trouble communicating with that pronunciation scheme (although I do lapse into the Classical Pronunciation once or twice in this recording!). \n\nThe differences between Ecclesiastical and Classical schemes are superficial: what *all* speakers of Latin must do, especially those who purport to adhere to the Classical/Restored pronunciation but also those who use the Ecclesiastical/Italian pronunciation, is maintain clear phonemic syllable length distinctions.  Why? Because our Latin is a literary, erudite tongue, meant to allow us access to literature, to ideas, to philosophy, to orations, to poetry, and in the Roman era as well as the Renaissance, syllable length is precisely part of the meter and flawlessly observed. Any doctrine that ignores that most vital fact is an obstacle to acquiring Latin properly.\n\n_____\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nhttps://www.LukeRanieri.com\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nScorpioMartianus shirts and mugs now available at the merch store!

Small and weak, primitive humans ventured from the forest into the open plains, took risks, and through that danger persevered to foster all our race.

Farrago, p. 236 ; Ep. viii. 47 ; C. 136 (159). \nErasmus to Ammonius. \n\nI called more than once at your house for the purpose \nof bidding a final farewell to the sweetest of all my friends, \nand of enjoying to the last possible moment an association \nwhich has been one of the greatest pleasures I have had in \nmy life. \n\nWe had a fair passage, though it was an anxious one for \nme. The sea was calm, the wind favourable, the weather \nfine, the hour most convenient, for we set sail about seven \no'clock. But those sea-robbers had carried off a mail filled \nwith my writings to some other ship. This is a thing they \ndo on purpose, in order to steal something, if occasion \nserves, or, if not, to extort some money by selling you what \nis your own. Accordingly, believing the labours of so \nmany years to be gone for ever, I felt for the time as much \ngrief as any parent for the death of his offspring. In all other \nmatters these fellows treat foreigners just in the same way, \nso that it would be better to fall into the hands of any \nTurks than into theirs. I often wonder that such scoundrels \nare tolerated by the English Government to the great \nannoyance of those who visit the country, and the greatest \ndiscredit of the whole island, as every traveller carries home \nthe story of the inhuman reception he has met with, and \nother people form an estimate of the nation by the acts of \nthese robbers. \n\nI do not know whether I have told you, that I paid my \nrespects in person to the King's Majesty, who received me \nwith quite a friendly air. Then the bishop of Lincoln bade \nme be of the best and surest hope. He said nothing about \nany present, nor did I venture to hint at it for fear of \nseeming importunate. The bishop of Durham, as I took \nleave, gave me six angels, and that of his own accord, and \nif I am not mistaken, for the fourth time. The archbishop \ntook some pains to find an opportunity of adding a like \namount ; and the bishop of Rochester gave me a royal. \nThis is the sum total of what I carry away ; and I wished \nyou to know it, that it may not be thought I have collected \na great amount of money under the pretext of leave-taking. \n\nI am now at the castle of Hammes, where I am to spend \na very few days with my lord Mount] oy ; and shall then go \non to Germany, visiting some friends on the way. If Fortune \nanswers to my wishes and to the promises of others, we \nshall soon return to England. If not, we shall be advised \nby circumstances. God grant that I may return in safety, \nand find my Ammonius not only safe, but enriched with \nthe choicests gifts of Fortune. If any opportunity should \narise for promoting the interests of your Erasmus, I have \nno doubt that you will be the same good friend in his \nabsence as you have always hitherto been to him, whether \nabsent or present. Farewell, my best of friends.",

S. Kline follows\n(http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidI.php#anchor_Toc535054289)\n\n\nSo he speaks, and swifter than his speech, he calms the swollen sea,\n\nscatters the gathered cloud, and brings back the sun.\n\nCymothoë and Triton, working together, thrust the ships\n\nfrom the sharp reef: Neptune himself raises them with his trident,\n\nparts the vast quicksand, tempers the flood,\n\nand glides on weightless wheels, over the tops of the waves.\n\nAs often, when rebellion breaks out in a great nation,\n\nand the common rabble rage with passion, and soon stones\n\nand fiery torches fly (frenzy supplying weapons),\n\nif they then see a man of great virtue, and weighty service,\n\nthey are silent, and stand there listening attentively:\n\nhe sways their passions with his words and soothes their hearts:\n\nso all the uproar of the ocean died, as soon as their father,\n\ngazing over the water, carried through the clear sky, wheeled\n\nhis horses, and gave them their head, flying behind in his chariot.\n\nBkI:157-222 Shelter on the Libyan Coast\nThe weary followers of Aeneas made efforts to set a course\n\nfor the nearest land, and tacked towards the Libyan coast.\n\nThere is a place there in a deep inlet: an island forms a harbour\n\nwith the barrier of its bulk, on which every wave from the deep\n\nbreaks, and divides into diminishing ripples.\n\nOn this side and that, vast cliffs and twin crags loom in the sky,\n\nunder whose summits the whole sea is calm, far and wide:\n\nthen, above that, is a scene of glittering woods,\n\nand a dark grove overhangs the water, with leafy shade:\n\nunder the headland opposite is a cave, curtained with rock,\n\ninside it, fresh water, and seats of natural stone,\n\nthe home of Nymphs. No hawsers moor the weary ships\n\nhere, no anchor, with its hooked flukes, fastens them.\n\nAeneas takes shelter here with seven ships gathered\n\nfrom the fleet, and the Trojans, with a passion for dry land,\n\ndisembarking, take possession of the sands they longed for,\n\nand stretch their brine-caked bodies on the shore.\n\nAt once Achates strikes a spark from his flint,\n\ncatches the fire in the leaves, places dry fuel round it,\n\nand quickly has flames among the kindling.\n\nThen, wearied by events, they take out wheat, damaged\n\nby the sea, and implements of Ceres, and prepare to parch\n\nthe grain over the flames, and grind it on stone.\n\nAeneas climbs a crag meanwhile, and searches the whole prospect\n\nfar and wide over the sea, looking if he can see anything\n\nof Antheus and his storm-tossed Phrygian galleys,\n\nor Capys, or Caicus’s arms blazoned on a high stern.\n\nThere’s no ship in sight: he sees three stags wandering\n\non the shore: whole herds of deer follow at their back,\n\nand graze in long lines along the valley.\n\nHe halts at this, and grasps in his hand his bow\n\nand swift arrows, shafts that loyal Achates carries,\n\nand first he shoots the leaders themselves, their heads,\n\nwith branching antlers, held high, then the mass, with his shafts,\n\nand drives the whole crowd in confusion among the leaves:\n\nThe conqueror does not stop until he’s scattered seven huge\n\ncarcasses on the ground, equal in number to his ships.\n\nThen he seeks the harbour, and divides them among all his friends.\n\nNext he shares out the wine that the good Acestes had stowed\n\nin jars, on the Trinacrian coast, and that hero had given them\n\non leaving: and speaking to them, calmed their sad hearts:\n\n‘O friends (well, we were not unknown to trouble before)\n\nO you who’ve endured worse, the god will grant an end to this too.\n\nYou’ve faced rabid Scylla, and her deep-sounding cliffs:\n\nand you’ve experienced the Cyclopes’s rocks:\n\nremember your courage and chase away gloomy fears:\n\nperhaps one day you’ll even delight in remembering this.\n\nThrough all these misfortunes, these dangerous times,\n\nwe head for Latium, where the fates hold peaceful lives\n\nfor us: there Troy’s kingdom can rise again. Endure,\n\nand preserve yourselves for happier days.’",

You can persuade me into almost anything now, for I was recently persuaded to travel by water. We cast off when the sea was lazily smooth; the sky, to be sure, was heavy with nasty clouds, such as usually break into rain or squalls. Still, I thought that the few miles between Puteoli and your dear Parthenope[1] might be run off in quick time, despite the uncertain and lowering sky. So, in order to get away more quickly, I made straight out to sea for Nesis,[2] with the purpose of cutting across all the inlets. 2. But when we were so far out that it made little difference to me whether I returned or kept on, the calm weather, which had enticed me, came to naught. The storm had not yet begun, but the ground-swell was on, and the waves kept steadily coming faster. I began to ask the pilot to put me ashore somewhere; he replied that the coast was rough and a bad place to land, and that in a storm he feared a lee shore more than anything else. 3. But I was suffering too grievously to think of the danger, since a sluggish seasickness which brought no relief was racking me, the sort that upsets the liver without clearing it. Therefore I laid down the law to my pilot, forcing him to make for the shore, willy-nilly. When we drew near, I did not wait for things to be done in accordance with Vergil's orders, until\n\n...

O Diomede, son of Tydeus\n\nbravest of Greeks! Why could I not have fallen, at your hand,\n\nin the fields of Ilium, and poured out my spirit,\n\nwhere fierce Hector lies, beneath Achilles’s spear,\n\nand mighty Sarpedon: where Simois rolls, and sweeps away\n\nso many shields, helmets, brave bodies, of men, in its waves!’\n\nHurling these words out, a howling blast from the north,\n\nstrikes square on the sail, and lifts the seas to heaven:\n\nthe oars break: then the prow swings round and offers\n\nthe beam to the waves: a steep mountain of water follows in a mass.\n\nSome ships hang on the breaker’s crest: to others the yawning deep\n\nshows land between the waves: the surge rages with sand.\n\nThe south wind catches three, and whirls them onto hidden rocks\n\n(rocks the Italians call the Altars, in mid-ocean,\n\na vast reef on the surface of the sea) three the east wind drives\n\nfrom the deep, to the shallows and quick-sands (a pitiful sight),\n\ndashes them against the bottom, covers them with a gravel mound.\n\nA huge wave, toppling, strikes one astern, in front of his very eyes,\n\none carrying faithful Orontes and the Lycians.\n\nThe steersman’s thrown out and hurled headlong, face down:\n\nbut the sea turns the ship three times, driving her round,\n\nin place, and the swift vortex swallows her in the deep.\n\nSwimmers appear here and there in the vast waste,\n\nmen’s weapons, planking, Trojan treasure in the waves.\n\nNow the storm conquers Iloneus’s tough ship, now Achates,\n\nnow that in which Abas sailed, and old Aletes’s:\n\ntheir timbers sprung in their sides, all the ships\n\nlet in the hostile tide, and split open at the seams.\n\nNeptune, meanwhile, greatly troubled, saw that the sea\n\nwas churned with vast murmur, and the storm was loose\n\nand the still waters welled from their deepest levels:\n\nhe raised his calm face from the waves, gazing over the deep.\n\nHe sees Aeneas’s fleet scattered all over the ocean,\n\nthe Trojans crushed by the breakers, and the plummeting sky.\n\nAnd Juno’s anger, and her stratagems, do not escape her brother.\n\nHe calls the East and West winds to him, and then says:\n\n‘Does confidence in your birth fill you so? Winds, do you dare,\n\nwithout my intent, to mix earth with sky, and cause such trouble,\n\nnow? You whom I – ! But it’s better to calm the running waves:\n\nyou’ll answer to me later for this misfortune, with a different punishment.\n\nHurry, fly now, and say this to your king:\n\ncontrol of the ocean, and the fierce trident, were given to me,\n\nby lot, and not to him. He owns the wild rocks, home to you,\n\nand yours, East Wind: let Aeolus officiate in his palace,\n\nand be king in the closed prison of the winds.’",

    "description": "Christophe Rico teaches Ancient Greek exclusively by means of Ancient Greek at the Secondo Seminario di GRECOLATINOVIVO in Didattica delle Lingue Classiche in Naples, Italy, March 2-3, 2018.\n\nhttp://www.polisjerusalem.org/\nhttp://www.grecolatinovivo.it/\n\nIn this amazing presentation, Christophe Rico teaches two people ancient Greek who have never learned Greek before, using his Polis method involving TPR (Total Physical Response).  The presentation represents the first lesson in Greek in his course.  He has also applied these methods to Latin in his course called \"Forum,\" but I think it's an even more dramatic thing to see in Greek!\n\nIn the beginning of the video, Christophe Rico is saying in Greek that Giampiero Marchi didn't think he should give a presentation in Greek at the Seminar — only Latin or Italian would be acceptable in Naples — and Christophe Rico teases him about this, given that the Seminar is for *Greco*LatinoVivo, attended by *Greek* teachers, in a city called Νεάπολις founded by the Greeks!  Christophe Rico elegantly proves in his presentation that even a language as difficult as ancient Greek can be made simple and understandable with the right methods and techniques.\n_____\nScorpioMartianus apud Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/scorpiomartianus/\n\nScorpiomartianus apud Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ScorpioMartian\n\nScorpioMartianus apud Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lukeranieri/\n\nSupport at Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/LukeRanieri\n\nPlease subscribe, like, and share!\nHuic canali subscribite, diligite, partimini, quaeso!\n\nhttp://www.ScorpioMartianus.com\nLatin Language Blog • Logos Telaris Latinus",

S. Kline follows\n(http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidI.php#anchor_Toc535054289)\n\n\nBkI:1-11 Invocation to the Muse\n\nI sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate,\n\nfirst came from the coast of Troy to Italy, and to\n\nLavinian shores – hurled about endlessly by land and sea,\n\nby the will of the gods, by cruel Juno’s remorseless anger,\n\nlong suffering also in war, until he founded a city\n\nand brought his gods to Latium: from that the Latin people\n\ncame, the lords of Alba Longa, the walls of noble Rome.\n\nMuse, tell me the cause: how was she offended in her divinity,\n\nhow was she grieved, the Queen of Heaven, to drive a man,\n\nnoted for virtue, to endure such dangers, to face so many\n\ntrials? Can there be such anger in the minds of the gods?\n\n\nBkI:12-49 The Anger of Juno\n\nThere was an ancient city, Carthage (held by colonists from Tyre),\n\nopposite Italy, and the far-off mouths of the Tiber,\n\nrich in wealth, and very savage in pursuit of war.\n\nThey say Juno loved this one land above all others,\n\neven neglecting Samos: here were her weapons\n\nand her chariot, even then the goddess worked at,\n\nand cherished, the idea that it should have supremacy\n\nover the nations, if only the fates allowed.\n\nYet she’d heard of offspring, derived from Trojan blood,\n\nthat would one day overthrow the Tyrian stronghold:\n\nthat from them a people would come, wide-ruling,\n\nand proud in war, to Libya’s ruin: so the Fates ordained.\n\nFearing this, and remembering the ancient war\n\nshe had fought before, at Troy, for her dear Argos,\n\n(and the cause of her anger and bitter sorrows\n\nhad not yet passed from her mind: the distant judgement\n\nof Paris stayed deep in her heart, the injury to her scorned beauty,\n\nher hatred of the race, and abducted Ganymede’s honours)\n\nthe daughter of Saturn, incited further by this,\n\nhurled the Trojans, the Greeks and pitiless Achilles had left,\n\nround the whole ocean, keeping them far from Latium:\n\nthey wandered for many years, driven by fate over all the seas.\n\nSuch an effort it was to found the Roman people.\n\nThey were hardly out of sight of Sicily’s isle, in deeper water,\n\njoyfully spreading sail, bronze keel ploughing the brine,\n\nwhen Juno, nursing the eternal wound in her breast,\n\nspoke to herself: ‘Am I to abandon my purpose, conquered,\n\nunable to turn the Teucrian king away from Italy!\n\nWhy, the fates forbid it. Wasn’t Pallas able to burn\n\nthe Argive fleet, to sink it in the sea, because of the guilt\n\nand madness of one single man, Ajax, son of Oileus?\n\nShe herself hurled Jupiter’s swift fire from the clouds,\n\nscattered the ships, and made the sea boil with storms:\n\nShe caught him up in a water-spout, as he breathed flame\n\nfrom his pierced chest, and pinned him to a sharp rock:\n\nyet I, who walk about as queen of the gods, wife\n\nand sister of Jove, wage war on a whole race, for so many years.\n\nIndeed, will anyone worship Juno’s power from now on,\n\nor place offerings, humbly, on her altars?’\n\n\nBkI:50-80 Juno Asks Aeolus for Help\n\nSo debating with herself, her heart inflamed, the goddess\n\ncame to Aeolia, to the country of storms, the place\n\nof wild gales. Here in his vast cave, King Aeolus,\n\nkeeps the writhing winds, and the roaring tempests,\n\nunder control, curbs them with chains and imprisonment.\n\nThey moan angrily at the doors, with a mountain’s vast murmurs:\n\nAeolus sits, holding his sceptre, in his high stronghold,\n\nsoftening their passions, tempering their rage:",

Ministra Europaea rerum exterarum Catharina Ashton, quae Russos jam antea admonuerat ut dimicationibus finem imponerent copiasque a se missas reducerent, omnes ministros rerum exterarum rettulit sollicitos esse ob aggressionem contra Ucrainam, quae petierat ut in coetum Europaeum admitteretur; praeses Lituanus Dalia Grybauskaite ‘Ita agendum est,’  inquit, ‘velut si Russia bellum Europae toti intulerit.’ ”\n\nNuntiorum Latinorum Finnicorum Tuomo Pekkanen nuntiat ‘John Kerry, minister a rebus exteris Americanorum, velle, ut orbis terrarum duce USA contra ordinem ISIS viribus unitis pugnet.’ “ISIS operatur in Syria et Iraquia, in quibus magnas regiones occupavit ... Jihadistae sive concertatores ordinis purgationes religiosas et ethnicas in Iraquia effecerunt. ISIS et socii ejus cotidie jura humana dire violant, cum homines regionum, quas occupaverunt, occidunt, vi et violentia adhibita convertunt, rapiunt, stuprant, in servitutem redigunt atque loca sacra eorum delent.”\n\nNuntiis relatis, ego L.

Et mirabile dictu, modo hodie vesperi, nuntiatur Kim Jong-Il indulsisse Eunae Li et Laurae Ling, quae jamjam liberatae sunt et in aeroplano rursus Angelopolin nunc redeunt.  Familiae Ling et Li sententiam emiserunt, 'se pergavisas esse ... sescentasque gratias agere Clintoni et marito et uxori, necnon praesidenti Americano et Alberto Gore.'\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDuae naves submergibiles Russicae apud oram Americanam orientalem nunc circumeunt, quae classem Unitorum Statuum perturbaverunt.  Primum est Russiam naves submergibiles apud utram oram Americanam mandasse abhinc quindecim annos.  Eorum consilium agendi nondum perspicuum est.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nHubble telescopium in orbita telluris situm imagines Jovis planetae recens excepit, quibus cicatrix atra videtur quae, ut suspicantur investigatores, facta est a cometa aut asteroide mense praeterito.\r\n\r\nPrimum est Hubble imagines facere post resarsus qui telescopio instructi sunt mense Maio.  Quattuordecim annis abhinc cometa nomine Shoemaker-Levy in Jovem cecidit atque exploditur clarissime in Jovis facie; Hubble etiam illo tempore adhibitum est ut talis perrarus eventus exciperetur.  Mirantur investigatores, qui decennibus praeteritis usi sunt exploratoriis vehiculis roboticis, ut Voyager, ut imagines hujusmodi caperenter, sed nunc etiam ab orbita terrestri ab Hubble capi possunt.  Juppiter planeta ut custos systematis solaris conversatur, qui cometas et asteroidas, quae aliter nostro planetae minentur, attrahit et consumit propter maximam suam gravitatem.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMense Junio nuntiavi Manuelem Zelayam expulsum esse praesidentatu Hondurarum a Judicio Supremo illius patriae.  Qua de causa duces mundi legem et constitutionem Honduranam non sustinerent illo tempore non intellexi, et vos spectatores interrogavi de consilio horum ducum.\r\n\r\nHonduranus quidam nomine J.R. respondit, dicens, \"Volumus ut mundus intellegat Zelayam violasse Constitutionem ... transitio praesidentatus omnino legitime peracta est.\"  Neque hodie ulla est patria quae pro re publica Hondurana, ut nunc est, stat.  Duces et Americani et Europaei et alii Zelayam rursus praesidentem creatum esse omnino procant.  Ecquid habetis quod huic argumento addatis?

Sunt enim homines natura curiosi, et quamlibet nuda rerum cognitione capiuntur, ut qui sermunculis etiam fabellisque ducantur. Me vero ad hoc studium impellit domesticum quoque exemplum. 5 Avunculus meus idemque per adoptionem pater historias et quidem religiosissime scripsit. Invenio autem apud sapientes honestissimum esse maiorum vestigia sequi, si modo recto itinere praecesserint. Cur ergo cunctor? 6 Egi magnas et graves causas. Has, etiamsi mihi tenuis ex iis spes, destino retractare, ne tantus ille labor meus, nisi hoc quod reliquum est studii addidero, mecum pariter intercidat. 7 Nam si rationem posteritatis habeas, quidquid non est peractum, pro non incohato est. Dices: 'Potes simul et rescribere actiones et componere historiam.' Utinam! sed utrumque tam magnum est, ut abunde sit alterum efficere. 8 Unodevicensimo aetatis anno dicere in foro coepi, et nunc demum quid praestare debeat orator, adhuc tamen per caliginem video. 9 Quid si huic oneri novum accesserit? Habet quidem oratio et historia multa communia, sed plura diversa in his ipsis, quae communia videntur. Narrat illa narrat haec, sed aliter: huic pleraque humilia et sordida et ex medio petita, illi omnia recondita splendida excelsa conveniunt; 10 hanc saepius ossa musculi nervi, illam tori quidam et quasi iubae decent; haec vel maxime vi amaritudine instantia, illa tractu et suavitate atque etiam dulcedine placet; postremo alia verba alius sonus alia constructio. 11 Nam plurimum refert, ut Thucydides ait, 'ktêma' sit an 'agônisma'; quorum alterum oratio, alterum historia est. His ex causis non adducor ut duo dissimilia et hoc ipso diversa, quo maxima, confundam misceamque, ne tanta quasi colluvione turbatus ibi faciam quod hic debeo; ideoque interim veniam, ut ne a meis verbis recedam, advocandi peto. 12 Tu tamen iam nunc cogita quae potissimum tempora aggrediar. Vetera et scripta aliis? Parata inquisitio, sed onerosa collatio. Intacta et nova? Graves offensae levis gratia. 13 Nam praeter id, quod in tantis vitiis hominum plura culpanda sunt quam laudanda, tum si laudaveris parcus, si culpaveris nimius fuisse dicaris, quamvis illud plenissime, hoc restrictissime feceris. 14 Sed haec me non retardant; est enim mihi pro fide satis animi: illud peto praesternas ad quod hortaris, eligasque materiam, ne mihi iam scribere parato alia rursus cunctationis et morae iusta ratio nascatur.

Missio Lunaris Recognitionis Orbitatri est Lunam subtiliter et singulatim chartographare, ut numquam prius.  Data scientifica quam primum devehi possint subito ad GoogleMoon transferentur, ut totus mundus chartarum singula novissimarum gaudeat.  Dicit projecti princeps curatrix Caterina Peddie, etiamsi familiaris, \"multum est de Luna quod omnino nescimus ... LRO nos adjuvabit ut satellitem nostrum melius cognoscamus.\"\r\n\r\nLCROSS vero non orbitabit, sed impactabit Lunam.  In verticibus Lunae sunt crateres quae semptinerne in umbra sunt.  Ibi detectatur praesentia glaciei.  LCROSS projectile in talem craterem prolaturus est, ex quo pulvis glaciei erumpatur; LCROSS per hanc nubem pulveris volabit, atque data rursus ad Terram transmittet.  Deinde LCROSS ipse in aliam partem ejusdem crateris percutit, ut nubes altera fiat, cujus informatio a Terra observabitur.\r\n\r\nInquit Doctrix Kimberly Ennico, \"Si praesentia glaciei confirmatur, coloniae humanae multo facilius in superficie Lunari construi possunt.\"\r\n\r\nPraenuntii sunt hae missiones ante Constellationem Programma, quod homines rursus ad Lunam allaturum est.\r\n\r\nCoreanos Septentrionales missile jactus longi elaturos esse mense Julio, nuntiat Associated Press.\r\n\r\nDepartimentum Defensionis Japoniae censet missile typi Taepodong-2 fore, jactus plus quam sex milium khiliometrorum.

Mars putatur aquam liquidam, atmosphaeram plenam, atque etiam oceanos et maria habuisse ante 3.7 billiones annorum, sed hic lacus, nomine Shalbatana, exstitit abhinc modo 3.4 billiones annorum.\r\n\r\nProtestationes pergunt valide in Irania hodie.  In praeterito programmate interrogavi, quomodo responderent nationes liberae ad protestationes in Irania.  Baracus Obama Praesidens Americanus dixit 'se habere sollicitudines profundas de comitiis' : \"Cum violentiam video contra protestatores pacificos,\" inquit, \"cum dissentionem pacificam video dimitti, ubique hoc accidit, sollicitat me ac populum Americanum.\"\r\n\r\nGalliae vero Praesidens Nicolas Sarkozy vehementer condemnavit \"fraudem\" ac responsum \"horrendum\" et \"immane\" regiminis Iraniani. Inquit, \"Haec comitia sunt atrocitas ... Si Ahmadinejad talem progressum fecerit ab electione praeterita, si revera duas tertias suffragiorum vicit, cur talis violentia?\"\r\n\r\nMirabile dictu, et Josephus Biden Americanus Vicepraesidens et Hilaria Clinton Secretaria Civitatis dixerunt hodie Baracum Obamam nimis remisse locutum esse, quod voce fortiori protestores alendum est praesidenti.\r\n\r\nA spectatore Josepho Amadìo nobis scriptum est: \"Quod ad Persarum seu Iranorum tumultus pertinet totum consensum meum ad populum et ad optimates rerum novarum cupidos sincere dirigo, sed praesidibus liberarum nationum prudentissime agendum est: perraro enim democratia copiis exteris condi potest.\"\r\n\r\nSuper elatu hodie missionis novae lunaris: dicam explorationem spatii conatum esse grandissimum humanum.  Ego puto homini cordi esse explorare, discere, crescere.\r\n\r\nSed haec modo mea opinio unius assis.  Vosmet ipsi consentitis?  Quid putatis?

Marg bar diktator cantant -- \"Mors dictatori.\"\r\n\r\nFatum custodis nescitur.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nPraesidens Obama irrisus est heri Chicagi a grege medicorum apud Associetatem Medicalem Americanam.\r\n\r\nDominus Obama Chicagum profectus est ut nationis medicos convincat de \"necessitudine gravi\" imponendi systematis salutarii foederalis.  At cum praesidens negavit possibilitatem litigationum contra medicos diminuendorum — quibus litigationibus medici Americani centenos billiones dollarorum quotannis solvere debent aut petoribus aut securitati — quidam multitudinis irati eum inrident.\r\n\r\nPraesidens novus magna popularitate fructus est usque ab sua electione; primum est eum opprobium hujusmodi opponentium tam vocalium in audientia invenire orationem habentem.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIn ossibus dinosaurorum quorundam, caro praeservata inventa est, nuntiat ScienceDaily.\r\n\r\nAnno praeterito in femore Tyrannosauri regis caro reperta est non fossiliata, sed optime praeservata, proteina habens structurasque intactas ut, mirabile dictu, cellas venasque.  Hoc in anno inventio similis est facta in osse hadrosauri cujusdam, quibus proteinis analysatis chemicaliter confirmatur connexio biologica inter dinosauros et aves.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nNunc pro mea opinio de rebus gestis in Irania: \r\n\r\nMea sententia, est actum fortitudinis maximum aperte rebellare contra comitia fucosa necnon regimen opprimens.  \r\n\r\nPopulus Iranianus, qui auxilium mundi liberi nunc petit, magna voce plane locutus est, loquiturque etiam nunc.  Quomodo respondebunt nationes liberae?  Etiam plane, spero.\r\n\r\nSed haec modo mea opinio unius assis.\r\n\r\nCommentaria vestra in pagina YouTube ponatis, aut scribite ad ScorpioMartianus@gmail.com\r\n\r\n**\r\nIta fine facto programmatis, ego L. Amadeus Ranierius valere dicens pro ScorpioneMartiano.",
