The disciples lived in an oral culture skilled at memorization, Jesus deliberately taught in memorable ways, and His followers were deeply motivated to preserve His words. Add to that the role of controlled oral tradition, the possibility of early written notes, and Jesus’ promise of the Spirit’s help, and the case for reliable Gospels gets much stronger.\n\nSo, are Jesus’ words trustworthy today, even in our English translations?

    "description": "Are tattoos sinful? Do they defile your body, dishonor God, or break Old Testament laws? In this video, I respond to a conversation between two well-meaning Christians who argue that tattoos are a sin. Along the way, I break down four common arguments against tattoos—including claims about body mutilation, Leviticus 19, pagan origins, and health risks.

    "description": "Wow. Over half a million people thought this was a clever takedown.\nIt wasn’t—and here’s why.\nThe atheist in this video is making an argument from analogy. That’s when you point to similarities between two things to argue that what’s true of one must also be true of the other.\nIn this case: If a husband says to his wife, ‘Love me or I’ll set you on fire,’ we should all agree he’s unloving.\nSo if God says, ‘Love me or go to Hell,’ … we should all agree He must be unloving too. \nSee how this works? It sounds powerful—but it fails badly. Why? Because for an argument from analogy to work, the similarities must be meaningful and the differences must be superficial. However, if there are significant differences, then it’s a false analogy, and the whole argument falls apart. \nAnd that’s exactly what happens here.

    "description": "There is a lot misinformation being thrown around here. Yes, there is a long ending of Mark. But the long ending of Mark is not 21 verses. It’s 12 verses. Specifically, Mark 16:9-20.\nAnd, yes, in those verses, we have a description of Jesus appearing to his followers (like Mary Magdalene, two disciples on the road, likely to Emmaus, and the eleven disciples). However, we DO have Jesus’ resurrection in the earliest manuscripts of Mark (before the so-called long ending).\nIn fact, look at the verses they just highlighted in their video. It says, “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has been rised! He is not here.” \nWhat verse is that? Verse 6. That’s not part of the long ending. \nSo, while telling us Mark’s Gospel doesn’t contains Jesus’ resurrection, the video literally highlights for us where Mark’s Gospel explicitly says Jesus has been raised. \nAgain, this doesn’t give the full story. While the earliest surviving manuscript with the long ending, Codex Alexandrinus comes from the 5th century, the long ending was not invented in the fifth century. Irenaeus in the second century refers to the longer ending of Mark, suggesting that by his time, the long ending was in circulation.\nIt’s ironic that a video trying to expose the most blatant misconception of Christianity gives us a blatant misconception of Christianity. \n\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "title": "Pastor FINDS Christmas Trees in the Bible",
    "description": "Does the Bible condemn Christmas trees? Some think so. And they cite Jeremiah 10:1-4 as proof. But here’s three reasons why that won’t work.\n\nFirst, the context of Jeremiah 10 makes it clear that this is about carved idols, not Christmas trees. When you read the entire chapter (which you should do, right now!), it becomes obvious that Jeremiah is contrasting pagan idols—false gods—made by the craftsman and the goldsmith (v. 3, 9, 14) and Yahweh—the true God—who made the heavens and the earth (v. 12, 16). \n\nFolks, context matters. The only way to find a Christmas tree in Jeremiah 10 is to read it into the text and completely ignore the context. That’s not good Bible study.\n\nSecond, the description in Jeremiah 10 fits a handcrafted idol, not a Christmas tree. After the tree is cut down, it is “worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman (v. 3). Notice the wood is being carved into something, which is exactly how an idol gets made. \n\nLater in verse 8, Jeremiah says these idols “are both stupid and foolish; the instruction of idols is but wood!” In verse 5, the idol is compared to a scarecrow, which has a mouth and legs but cannot talk or walk. Again, this fits a description of an impotent idol that may have human features like a mouth or legs, but can’t actually do anything. This is certainly not the description of a Christmas tree.\n\nThird, reading a Christmas tree into Jeremiah 10 is anachronistic. An anachronism is attributing a custom, event, or object to a time period where it doesn’t belong. There is no evidence that Christmas trees date back to a pagan ritual in Jeremiah’s day. The best evidence we have traces Christmas trees back to the Middle Ages. So, reading Christmas trees into the time of the prophet Jeremiah won’t work.\n\nJeremiah 10 is not talking about Christmas trees.\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "title": "Does JESUS Have a God? Responding to a Common Muslim Objection",
    "description": "In today’s video, we’re responding to a talking Bible and Quran. Isn’t the Internet awesome? Actually, we’re responding to the claim that Jesus cannot be God because He refers to God as “My God.” \n\nFor example, after his resurrection, Jesus tells Mary, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” (John 20:17). There. Case-closed. Rest in peace, Christianity. \n\nWell, not so fast.\n\nI’ve said it before but I will say it again: If you’re going to challenge Christian theology, then you should try to understand Christian theology. This argument ignores two core Christian beliefs—the Trinity and the incarnation. \n\nFirst, Christians believe in one God, who exists as three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each is fully God, sharing the same divine essence, but each is a distinct Person. So the Father is God. The Son is God. And the Holy Spirit is God. \n\nSecond, Christians hold that the Son, who is God, took on a human nature without ceasing to be God. He is fully human and fully divine. \n\nOkay, why is all this theology important? Because it helps understand how Jesus can pray and refer to God and, yet, still be God. When Jesus said “My God,” he is referring to the Father. And the reason it’s entirely appropriate for Jesus to speak of God the Father as “My God” is because Jesus is fully human. In his humanity, Jesus is a perfect man, who honors, obeys, and prays to God the Father. \n\nSo, Jesus’ reference to “My God” doesn’t deny His own divinity. Instead, it reflects His humanity. Remember, in the incarnation, the Son sets aside His independent authority and heavenly glory. Philippians 2 tells us that Jesus, though in nature God, humbled Himself, taking on the form of a servant. But this voluntary humility doesn’t negate His divinity.\n\nWell, doesn’t the Bible and the Quran both call Jesus a prophet?\n\nWhile it’s true that Jesus is called a prophet in both the Bible and the Quran, the Bible says a lot more than that! The Bible also teaches that Jesus fulfills many roles: prophet, priest, Messiah, king, and Savior. True, John 20:17 records Jesus saying to the Father, “My God.” But, in John 20:28, just 11 verses later, Thomas calls Jesus, “My Lord and my God.” Or, in John 8:58, Jesus says, “Before Abraham was, I am,” claiming the divine name for Himself. My point is, this video sets up a false dilemma: either Jesus is God, or He’s just a prophet. But, in reality, He’s both.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you find this argument compelling? Let me know.\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

Just as some people prefer chocolate, while others prefer vanilla.

    "description": "Why do Christians seem to follow some of the commands in the Old Testament, but not others? This video makes it appear like Christians are arbitrarily (or maybe nefariously) picking and choosing the commandments they like while just ignoring the ones they don’t.\n\nSo, for example, Christians seem fine with the law against homosexual behaviour in Leviticus 18:22, but then seem to ignore the command against wearing clothes with two different fabrics in the next chapter in Leviticus). How convenient! \n\nThe problem with characterization is it doesn’t accurately represent Christianity—it’s a straw man. If you actually want to understand why Christians believe homosexuality is sinful, but wearing two different fabrics isn’t, you need to understand the covenants.\n\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "description": "This video lays out a challenge for Christians who believe in both Hell and an all-knowing, all-loving, and all-powerful God. Here’s the gist:   \n\nIf an all-knowing God creates people that He knows will go to Hell, then those people don’t have free will. And if they don’t have free will, then God is sending them to Hell for no fault of their own. Since that is incompatible with a good God, then, therefore, Hell is incompatible with an all-knowing and all-good God.\n\nAt the heart of this challenge is a fundamental error in thinking. More specifically, this challenge has a mistaken understanding of how God’s foreknowledge works. It assumes God’s foreknowledge somehow causes my actions. And if it causes my actions, then I’m not free.\n\nBut God’s foreknowledge doesn’t cause what will happen. Rather, it reports what will happen. That’s a really important difference. It’s not God’s knowledge of my future actions that cause my future actions. Rather, it’s my actions that ground God’s knowledge.\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "title": "Did this Muslim DEBUNK the Trinity in 30 Seconds?",
    "description": "The Muslim in this video clearly thinks this was a “Gotcha!” moment. In fact, the video is titled Trinity debunked in 30 seconds. Wow! That’s a pretty big claim. So, let’s pull out the Red Pen and see if it works.\n\nIt’s not surprising why this argument is so appealing. After all, it seems to show how Christians affirm two contradictory ideas. On the one hand, if we say that Jesus is God, then he must also believe God can die because Jesus died. On the other hand, if we say that God can’t die, then Jesus can’t be God because Jesus died.\n\nSo, what’s wrong with this argument? This reasoning relies on an equivocation of the word ‘die.’ An equivocation, for you logic nerds, is the fallacy of using a word in two different senses in an argument. \n\nIn this case, the word ‘die’ is being used in two different senses. Webster’s dictionary defines die as ‘pass from physical life.’ But it also defines die as ‘pass out of existence.’ \n\nIf this Muslim asked me, “Can God die?” I would reply, “It depends on what you mean by ‘die’ and it depends on what you mean by ‘God.’” You see, when terms are not clearly defined, people can end up talking in circles. (This video is case in point).\n\nSo, can God die? Well, God cannot cease to exist. In that sense, God cannot die. What about that other sense? Can God die physically? Well, a non-physical God can’t die physically. Since Christians believe God the Father and God the Spirit are not physical, they cannot die in that sense either. \n\nHowever, Christians hold that God the Son took on flesh and dwelt among us (as John says). The one divine Person of Jesus has two distinct natures: a fully human nature and a fully divine nature. This is called the hypostatic union. And, it’s because of the hypostatic union, that everything experienced in the two natures of Christ must be said to be experienced by the one, divine Person. So, the divine Person of Christ, for example, learned to walk and talk since he is the subject of everything experienced through his two natures.\n\nOkay, so can God die? Well, if we’re talking about God the Son incarnate and if we’re talking about physical death (not ceasing to exist), then, yes, in that sense, God can and did die! \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "description": "Alex O’Connor is one of the most interesting and thoughtful atheists on the Internet. I always enjoy watching his stuff. While I’ve learned a lot from watching his videos, I think there are two significant problems in what he says. \n\nFirst, the idea that resurrection appearances are merely the product of mythological development over time is significantly undermined by an early creed found in First Corinthians 15. While First Corinthians was written early 50’s (which pre-dates Mark’s Gospel), it contains an early oral creed that likely goes back to within 5 years of the death of Jesus. Granted, these appearances read more like a shopping list than elaborate stories. My point is, there are five different appearances (plus Paul) recorded before Mark writes his Gospel. This historical fact does not fit well with the idea that resurrection appearances are the result of mythological development over time as you move further away from the source.\n\nSo, that’s the first problem. Here's the second problem. Alex is wrong about the moral lesson in John’s Gospel. Alex says John’s Gospel culminates with the story of Doubting Thomas to communicate the moral lesson to believe without evidence.\n\nHowever, that’s not what the account is about. This account isn’t against evidence for faith. In fact, this account is part of the evidence for faith. It’s ironic that people pick the story of doubting Thomas to show that evidence and belief are at odds since John includes the story for one simple reason: to provide evidence for belief. As John says, “These are written so you would believe.”\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "description": "A meme circulating on social media presents a dilemma: Either Jesus is trans, or Mary is intersex. It suggests that if Jesus inherited all his human DNA from Mary, he would have had to inherit an XX chromosome pattern, implying that he was trans. Conversely, if Mary was XY but still able to bear a child, it would suggest she was intersex.\n\nIn this video, we explore why this meme's claim is not just a humorous take but a flawed argument. We delve into the assumption that Jesus had to inherit all his DNA from Mary, dismissing the miraculous aspect of the incarnation. If God can create the universe from nothing, it’s not a stretch to believe He could create a Y-chromosome or a male zygote without relying solely on Mary's genetic material.\n\nJoin us as we examine the theological implications of this meme and explain why viewing the incarnation as a miracle negates this dilemma. We also discuss the broader implications of understanding God as Creator and the importance of recognizing the divine nature of Jesus's birth.\n\nWhether you're interested in debunking popular misconceptions or simply curious about the theology behind the incarnation, this video will offer you insights and a deeper understanding of the biblical perspective.

In other words, they had to know what the Greek (and Hebrew) texts said to then decide what English words would best convey that meaning. Choices needed to be made, and this process wasn’t perfect.\n\n#RedPenLogic  #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— MY BOOK —————\n\nThe Deconstruction of Christianity: https://a.co/d/3S1mg1o\n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

In defense of his claim that human rights are fiction, Harari says, “Take a human being, cut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won’t find any rights.”\n\nI want you to notice what’s going on here. Harari simply assumes materialism. Cutting someone open to find a human right only makes sense if human rights are material objects located somewhere in the human body. But just because human rights aren’t made of matter, like mountains and molecules, doesn’t mean they aren’t real.\n\n#RedPenLogic #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "description": "While these deconstructionists accurately describe deconstruction, they highlight one of the fundamental flaws in the process. Deconstruction has no right way to do it and no right destination. This assumes there is no objective truth when it comes to religious beliefs.\n\nHowever, Jesus disagrees. In his famous Sermon on the Mount, He says, “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it” (Matt. 7:13–14).\n\nFirst, notice Jesus mentions two ways. There is a narrow way and a broad way, a right way and a wrong way. Second, notice Jesus mentions two destinations. The right way leads to a good destination: life. The wrong way leads to a bad destination: Jesus calls it destruction. According to Jesus, there is absolutely a right place to land, and Jesus tells us how to get there.\n\n#RedPenLogic #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "title": "Ex-Christian Musician REWRITES Famous Hymn \"Amazing Grace\"",
    "description": "Singer-songwriter Michael Gungor, who deconstructed his faith a few years ago, is now doing the church a favor (or so he thinks) by rewriting John Newton’s famous hymn “Amazing Grace.”\n\nGungor recently posted some of his revised lyrics on Instagram, adding the comment: “A Wretch like me?? No thanks.”\n\nI guess Gungor didn’t like that part. And I can see why. It offends our modern sensibilities and flies in the face of the current cultural mantra: You are enough.\n\nWhen John Newton calls himself a “wretch,” this isn’t meant to be an insult. It’s meant to be an accurate description of reality.\n\nIn Romans 7:24, Paul uses the word when he says, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?”\n\nJesus uses the same word in Revelation 3:17. He tells the Church in Laodicea, “So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.”\n\nNotice Jesus calls the lukewarm people in Laodicea “wretched” to describe their spiritual state. Now, we may say, “No thanks,” like Gungor, or we can say we don’t like it. But that doesn’t mean it’s not true.\n\nNEW BOOK: https://alisachilders.com/the-deconstruction-of-christianity/\n\n#RedPenLogic #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

Here’s why. \n\nFor this to be a genuine contradiction, the reader must assume two things. \nFirst, they assume silence about an event is a denial of an event. But this is a textbook example of an argument from silence: trying to reason from what a source does not say to the conclusion that something did not happen.\n\nSecond, the reader assumes Luke’s describing immediate, consecutive events.\n\nLuke does say that Mary, Joseph, and Jesus returned to Nazareth, and he says it was after making sacrifices for ritual purification in Jerusalem. But was it immediately after, or eventually after? \n\nSo, can these two accounts be reconciled? Yes. And I don’t think it’s terribly hard to see how. \n\nMary and Joseph travel to Bethlehem, Jesus is born and the shepherds visit. Forty days after Jesus was born, they go to the Temple in Jerusalem to fulfill the Law. Then, they return to their home in Bethlehem. They meet the magi. Then, after being warned in a dream about Herod’s plot, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus flee to Egypt to escape. When Herod is dead, they begin traveling back to Judea, but after being warned in another dream, they go to Nazareth instead.\n\n#RedPenLogic #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "title": "Responding to Someone Who WANTS to Go to Hell",
    "description": "How should Christians respond to someone who says they want to go to Hell? Here are some quick thoughts.\n\nFirst, it’s completely appropriate for Christians to warn people of the coming judgment. After all, Jesus did. In fact, Jesus uses some pretty graphic imagery when he tells people it’s better to pluck out your eye or cut off your hand if they cause you to sin than to be cast into Hell. \n\nThink of it this way. Just as any decent person would warn someone of the dangers of taking cocaine, any decent Christian, who believes in a real coming judgment, should warn others of the dangers of sin.\n\nThis raises a question, when do we give up on warning people? This leads to my second point: Christian, it’s not your job to save people. Warn people? Yes. Correct people? Sure. Share the gospel? Absolutely. But there comes a time when you’ve done or said all you can. You can’t force someone to follow Jesus.\n\nThird, if you’re going to respond to someone’s public posts, remember to speak truth with grace. In other words, don’t be a jerk. Let me do my best to model that with a response to her first challenge.\n\n#RedPenLogic #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

    "title": "Ex-Christian Musician CHALLENGES How Jesus Can be the ONLY WAY to God",
    "description": "If you’re going to critique a view, it’s important to accurately represent the view. In this video, former Christian music artist Michael Gungor offers an analogy that he thinks describes Christian exclusivism—the idea that faith in Jesus is the only way of salvation. \n\nUnfortunately, Gungor’s water bottle analogy is fundamentally flawed in at least two ways. First, his analogy assumes all religions are fundamentally the same. Notice how while one water bottle has a superficial difference—a pink bow—they each contains the exact same thing—water. So, if you were thirsty, it wouldn’t really matter which bottle you drank from. In fact, it would be absurd for someone to demand you drink from the one with a pink bow. Ironically, this analogy more accurately describes religious pluralism—the view that all religions are equally valid—than exclusivism.\n\nThis leads to the second fundamental flaw. The water bottle analogy fails to account for why Jesus is the only way of salvation. After all, there’s no good justification for why someone needs to drink from the water bottle with the pink bow.\n\n#RedPenLogic #Christianity #Apologetics \n\n————— FIND MORE FREE TRAINING —————\n\nWebsite: https://www.str.org/\nStand to Reason University: https://training.str.org\nStand to Reason Apps: https://www.str.org/apps \n\n————— CONNECT —————\n\nRPL TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@original_mrb\nRPL Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic\nRPL Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic/\nSTR YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos\nSTR Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreason93\nSTR Twitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\nSTR Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/standtoreason\nSTR LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/stand-to-reason\n\n————— GIVE —————\n\nSupport RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\nSupport Stand to Reason: https://www.str.org/donate",

Lewis called this “bulverism.” And it’s rampant today.\n\nImagine I said to you, “The Earth is round.” And you replied, “You’re just saying that because . . . you’re a Western, white man.”\n\nNotice this response doesn’t refute my claim. Rather, it assumes I’m wrong and moves on to trying to explain why I made the claim.\n\nHere’s the problem with this thinking: Before you explain why someone is wrong, you must show that they are wrong.\n\nOnce you understand the “bulverism” fallacy, you’re going to start to see it everywhere.\n\n#shorts",

    "description": "The Richard Dawkins Foundation wants to disqualify religious people from enshrining their beliefs in law. But this fails for two reasons. First, you can’t prohibit someone from legislating their moral beliefs since all laws legislate someone’s moral beliefs. That’s how the legislative process works. \n\nSecond, not all beliefs held by religious people are strictly religious beliefs. This distinction is really important since some want to simply label a belief as “religious” just so they can reject it. As it turns out, no one is trying to legislate strictly religious beliefs. And the examples typically given as religious beliefs are held with equal confidence by non-religious people. \n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL: https://www.str.org/redpen\n\n-------------------------------- SOCIALS --------------------------------\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/​​​ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic​​​\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideo... \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso​​​... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets​​",

    "description": "In today’s tweet, Joel Osteen offers a familiar slogan. He says, \"God will not give you more than you can handle. If you have a big challenge today, that means you have a big destiny.\"\n\nFirst, Osteen’s catchphrase creates confusion. It sounds like God won’t let terrible circumstances befall you. But that’s not true. God never promises we will escape the difficulties of life. Jesus promises just the opposite—tribulation.\n\nSecond, even though our circumstances may feel overwhelming, God is still good. Because He has not left us, we can rely on him. In fact, he has promised to work all things together for good for those called according to his purpose.\n\nThird, some might be thinking, what about 1 Corinthians 10:13? Two quick thoughts. First, this second passage is about temptations, not trials. When we look at the context, Paul warns the Church not to fall for the same temptations the Israelites fell for. They engaged in idolatry (v. 7), sexual immorality (v. 8), and grumbling (v. 10). \n\nPaul’s point in 1 Cor. 10 is clear. We experience temptation just like the Israelites did. But with every temptation, God faithfully provides a way of escape from the temptation so we’ll able to endure it. In other words, God has given us the ability to beat the temptation with the help of the Spirit. \n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen​​​\n\n-------------------------------- SOCIALS --------------------------------\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/​​​ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic​​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic​​​\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos​​​ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso​​​... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets​​",

Rather than trying to get the meaning out of the text, Robertson reads his own uncharitable meaning into it.\n\nRobertson misses the point completely. On his view, Jesus was a prejudiced, biased, bigoted sinner who needed to repent. But the text teaches just the opposite. Jesus countered the prejudices and bigoted attitudes of his day by responding the same way he always did to every Gentile who put his trust in him—with grace and mercy. Maybe Reverend Robertson’s Jesus is racist, but that is not the Jesus of history. That is not the Jesus of the New Testament. That is not the Jesus of reality. \n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen​​\n\n-------------------------------- SOCIALS --------------------------------\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/​​ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic​​\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos​​ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso​​... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets​​\n\n#redpenlogic​​ #apologetics​​ #trinity",

    "description": "According to godFreeWorld, Christianity not only had nothing to do with laying the foundations of modern science, faith is actually toxic to science. Christianity, then, takes credit for something it didn’t do…kinda like your high school lab partner, who lets you do all the work then takes credit for it. \n\nThis is a serious accusation. Now let’s see where the evidence points.\n\nFirst, godFreeWorld is just plain wrong about the facts. It turns out that most of the fathers of modern science—you know, the guys with laws named after them—were Christians.\n\nSecond, the Christian convictions of the founders of modern science led to the birth of modern science because these Christians saw the world in a very particular way. First, they believed there was an orderly creation because there is a God of order who made it. \n\nSecond, to do science you need smart people using their rational minds to study the world. Where did rational minds come from? A rational God. They were convinced they were “thinking God’s thoughts after him” (Kepler said that). So, not only is the world governed by rational laws, we can discover the world’s rational laws with our rational minds.\n\nFinally, they believed that studying the acts of creation was actually an act of worship. Kepler wrote, “I had the intention of becoming a theologian...but now see how God is, by my endeavors, also glorified in astronomy.” \n\nSo, godfreeWorld got his facts wrong. It’s simply not a “Christian myth” that Christianity led to science. Ironically, the idea that Christian faith is toxic to science is the real myth. Some atheists claim Christianity is a science stopper. The facts of history show the opposite. Christianity was the modern science starter. \n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen​\n\n-------------------------------- SOCIALS --------------------------------\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/​ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic​\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos​ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso​... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets​\n\n#redpenlogic​ #apologetics​ #trinity",

    "title": "Worst Pro-Choice Argument I've EVER Seen",
    "description": "K Hole Adventurer uses an analogy to show that the pro-life position is silly—that it’s kind of like arguing for the rights of a worm. Now, an argument from analogy is a special kind of inductive argument. Basically, it reasons that because two things are similar, what is true of the first is also true of the second. \n\nOf course, no analogy is perfect—there will always be differences. But for an argument from analogy to work, the similarities have to be significant and the differences have to be superficial. But if the opposite is true—if the differences are significant and the similarities are superficial—well, then, we have a problem.\n\nUnfortunately for K Hole, this is a false analogy. The argument doesn’t work because tapeworms and humans are really different. The similarities are superficial, but the difference is a big deal. And you already know what it is. It’s the difference between the value of worms and the value of humans. Killing a worm is not the same as killing a human being.\n\nBut there’s a second problem. The analogy misunderstands the pro-life argument. We are not saying that anything inside your body with a heartbeat that feels pain has a right to life. We are not pro-life because something has a heartbeat, or feels pain, or is inside your body. We are pro-life because abortion kills a human being inside her own mother’s body. Our argument is that human beings at any stage of development have intrinsic value and should not be killed. \n\nSo, the tweet uses a faulty analogy to argue there’s an inconsistency in the pro-life view. But there is nothing inconsistent about pro-lifers being against killing human beings who are intrinsically valuable and being for killing tapeworms because they’re just worms. Get it?\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen\n\n-------------------------------- SOCIALS --------------------------------\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\n\n#redpenlogic #apologetics #logicalfallacies",

    "description": "You may be surprised to hear that some people think Jesus never existed. They believe Jesus is a mere myth with no historical evidence to back him up. Here’s the problem. First, the claim that we have no documentation for Jesus’ existence outside the Bible is just plain false. Authors like Tacitus, Josephus, and Lucian and others all make reference to Jesus—a historical person. \n\nSecond, even if we didn’t have any extra-biblical evidence, so what? We still have reliable historical documentation from early witnesses collected together in the book we now call the Bible. Only a blind-eyed bias against the Bible would dismiss this early evidence for Jesus. \n\nThough popular on the Internet, the idea that Jesus never existed completely ignores the facts. In the introduction of Bart Ehrman’s book Did Jesus Exist?, he says, \n\n“I am not a Christian, and I have no interest in promoting a Christian cause or a Christian agenda. I am an agnostic with atheist leanings . . . But as a historian I think evidence matters. And the past matters. And for anyone to whom both evidence and the past matter, a dispassionate consideration of the case makes it quite plain: Jesus did exist.”\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen\n\n-------------------------------- SOCIALS --------------------------------\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets\n\n#jesusmythicism #redpenlogic #apologetics #christianity",

    "description": "John Fugelsang attempts to show a contradiction between what the pro-life Christian believes (“life begins at conception”) and what he thinks the Bible teaches (“life begins at first breath”). There’s a problem, though. It does not say life begins at “first breath.” It says God breathed into Adam after forming him from dust, and he came to life. Genesis 2 is describing a special act involving a special couple. It’s not teaching when every human being comes to life. \n\nThere’s a second problem. The Bible clearly recognizes personal human life before first breath. The clear example is how Luke describes Jesus and John the Baptist before either took their first breath.\n\nBut, even if the Bible didn’t explicitly state when life begins, so what? The science of embryology is clear: human life begins at conception. And this is perfectly consistent with Scripture. \n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets",

Some ideas sound good in theory but don’t work in practice. \n\nIn this video, we show that Vicky Osterweil’s book self-destructs in three ways. One, it argues against other people’s property rights while using copyright law to protect the author’s property rights. Two, it rejects property rights because they support racism while appealing to intellectual property rights, thus promoting racism. Three, it condemns capitalism—“We would be able to live without a wage if we freely shared the products of society [16]”—but then affirms capitalism in practice since the book is not “freely shared with society” but rather sells for a tidy little profit at the easy-to-find capitalist mega-monster….Amazon! \n\nOver and over, Osterweil undermines the Marxist case by doing the very things the book says shouldn’t be done.

    "description": "It has become increasingly common—especially on the Internet—to hear atheists say, “Christians are atheists too. They’re just atheists of one less god than me.” The “one less god” he’s referring to is, of course, Yahweh. In other words, the Christian is an atheist who believes in one God.\n\nIf that sounds weird, it should. First, it just makes no sense to call a Christian an atheist of any kind. That’s a misuse of the word. It's akin to calling a married man, like me, a bachelor with one wife.\n\nSecond, pointing out that Christians and atheists both reject a pantheon of gods is a clever move, but tells us nothing about the existence of the Christian God. Christians reject the pantheon for the same reason atheists do: no evidence. And they accept the God of Christianity because there is good evidence. It’s that simple! \n\nThird, the next time you hear some say “You’re an atheist of one less god than me” move towards the objection, not away from it. That is, just agree with them, then point out its irrelevance. Say something like, “You’re right, I am an atheist regarding every other god. Now what?” This neutralizes their rhetorical move, and directs the discussion where it belongs: on the evidence for the Christian God. \n\nClass dismissed.\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets",

    "description": "In today’s example, pro-choice proponent Pam Keith tries to correct pro-life Christians by appealing to something Jesus (supposedly) did not say. Here’s her logic: If Jesus didn’t mention the unborn, then they didn’t matter to Him. And if they didn’t matter to Him, they shouldn’t matter to us.\n\nThere are actually three fatal flaws in this approach. First, even if it is true that Jesus didn’t say anything about the unborn (and we don’t actually know that), nothing logically follows from it. We certainly cannot conclude—as Pam Keith implies—that the unborn didn’t matter to Jesus. That’s a textbook example of a fallacious argument from silence.\n\nSecond, Jesus clearly did say a lot about the authority of the Old Testament. And the Old Testament affirms the value and dignity of human beings before they are born. Therefore it's reasonable to think Jesus would affirm their dignity and value, too.\n\nThird, in the New Testament, even Jesus and John are treated as themselves—genuine, complete, valuable human beings—while they are still in utero.\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets",

The tweet reads: \"Can God create a stone that cannot be lifted? If yes, then he is not all powerful since he Himself cannot lift it. If he cannot create a stone that cannot be lifted, then he is not all powerful. Either way, God is not all powerful.\"\n\nThis challenge is plagued with problems. First, omnipotence is not the power to do anything. Rather, it’s the ability to do anything power can do. Even infinite power cannot do what is contradictory or absurd. This isn’t a limit on God’s power. It’s a limit on the kinds of questions we should be asking about God’s power. \n\nSecond, it’s an illogical question. That’s because it subtly smuggles in a contradiction by asking if God’s omnipotence can defeat His omnipotence. It’s like asking, “Can God win in arm wrestling match against Himself?” It’s nonsense. \n\nIronically, in his attempt to show the incoherence of an omnipotent Creator, this atheist relies on an incoherent question.\n\nSUPPORT THE WORK OF RPL:  https://www.str.org/redpen\n\nFollow Red Pen Logic with Mr. B: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/redpenlogic/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/redpenlogic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/redpenlogic\n\nFollow Stand to Reason: \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/STRvideos \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/standtoreaso... \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/STRtweets",
