The running metaphor throughout is borrowed from Marx; his description of circulation as an alchemical retort which transforms everything into the money crystal.\n\nIts begins with the philosophical battle between thinkers like David Graeber and Friedrich Nietzsche who tried to determine the nature of buying and selling. This is followed by a detailed look at Graeber's claims regarding the egalitarian nature of the Inuit, arguing that the evidence is in Nietzsche's favour. \n\nAfter a short summary of the parallels between capitalist exploitation and the function of our bodies, the rest of the essay looks at the so-called 'human crystal' retort, which is often offered as a stark contrast to capitalism, but which has similar logic and pitfalls. \n \n𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀\n_________\n0:00 Introduction\n5:47 The Moneyed Mind\n12:28 None Too Human\n17:10 Molecular Capitalism\n19:01 Overcoming Humanity",

    "description": "𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭: \n\nhttps://andreigeorgescu.ca/healthy-modern-art-and-degenerate-nihilism/\n\n𝐀𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭\n\nThis essay outlines a vision of healthy modern art at by looking at symptoms of illness and signs of recovery. It begins with the prevailing view—Ugly Duckling Aesthetic Philosophy (UDAP). UDAP can be summarised by the Disney cartoon of its namesake, which teaches that an ugly duckling in one perspective is a beautiful swan to another—all art is valid expression. Nature tends to disagree, e.g., infanticide of baby swans (cygnets) that can’t keep up. This kind of brutality is reserved for bullies and fascists—consider Nazi Germany and their attack on modern art in their Degenerate Art Exhibit. A positive aesthetic philosophy is sketched out by pointing to the Greco-Roman Spirit. A great example of this spirit is the Laocoön group, reminiscent of Nietzsche’s concept of the Olympian divine order of joy growing out of the Titanic divine order of terror.\n\nThere are indications that mental illness is pervasive—some surveys find major depressive disorders spiking among our youth. Here, Max Nordau is useful to make sense of cultural degeneracy. Although Nordau criticizes Nietzsche’s approach in Zarathustra, Nietzsche’s observation on the death of God and the spread of nihilism closely matches the observation of Nordau. By examining the politics and philosophy behind a new public sculpture in Toronto, we can more clearly see the decline and illness of modern art.\n\nTo offer more context, this essay talks about the Degenerate Art exhibit and the philosophy behind it. First we see an example of Paul Klee and someone institutionalized with schizophrenia, along with Max Beckmann’s work which shows despair and mental degeneration. This is the kind of disturbance that the Nazis tried to eradicate, and their general brutality has led to generations of punishment for anyone associated—the art museum built by the Nazis has had a row of trees planted to obscure its portico.\n\nThis kind of vengeance is challenged by looking at one of its casualties, namely Arno Breker. His work has been described as ranking among the greatest of the 20th century, although most of his art has been destroyed and suppressed. The moral panic surrounding Nazi art is fleshed out by looking at critiques from art historians like Elizabeth Berkowitz. The 1993 documentary Degenerate Art which features Robert Hughes is also looked at critically along with a review of Breker’s aesthetic philosophy. I argue that Breker demonstrates the sort of healthy-minded aesthetic philosophy that satisfies both Zionists like Max Nordau and vicious anti-Semites like Adolph Hitler. Such bipartisan agreement is looked at in more detail, by quoting from Nordau’s book The Conventional Lies of Civilization and Adolph Hitler’s Mein Kampf.\n\nAs an example of the greatest living modern artist, this essay looks to Cristiano Ronaldo, whose photos fulfill both Zionist and Nazi ideals of beauty—consider the Reich Association of Large Families and their criteria for ‘artistically exemplary representations of genetically healthy families with many children‘. Finally, I look at forbidden modern art and the controversy surrounding ‘computer generated art’, followed by an explanation of what constitutes degenerate art and how it can be fought.\n\n𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬\n\n0:00 1.

    "description": "This essay seeks to answer the question: can a ‘wageslave’ be happy? \n\nIt begins with an introduction to the antiwork movement and its corollary tensions in ancient thought; the infamous Jesse Watters video interview is discussed alongside Aristophanes and his caricature of philosophers. After tying in Nietzsche’s reflections on work in The Greek State, there’s an extended analysis of Aristotle’s views on slavery, along with the perspective of former American slaves like Frederick Douglass and contemporary business magnates like Kevin O’Leary. \n\nAristotle, Theognis and Socrates offer their perspective on the physiognomy of slaves, which are compared to contemporary examples of physiognomic discrimination. The work of Italian Renaissance artist Domenico Ghirlandaio is examined as a hopeful cultural icon, and Nietzsche’s concept of the ‘great spirit’ is introduced, with King Philip II offered as an example. Modern research on popular psychology is covered and contrasted with Nietzsche's claims about workers, and the case is made that wageslaves can, on the whole, find many opportunities for happiness—though it requires certain difficult sacrifices. The essay concludes with reflections on modern thinkers like Jordan Peterson and the role of Christianity in the modern worker’s life.\n\nFull text: https://andreigeorgescu.ca/the-happy-wageslave/\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Introduction\n6:38 Dirty Work\n12:10 Natural Wageslaves\n21:15 The Body of a Wageslave\n29:42 The Anti-Christian Worker\n42:46 The Worker’s Future",

    "description": "The thesis of this video is that an audience is, functionally speaking, a god—a sense of physiological & psychological vitality projected onto an external symbol that provides meaning in life. Nietzsche makes the observation that gods serve as a necessary spectator; the Christians sublimate suffering by seeing it as a path to salvation in the eyes of an 'honor-craving' all-seeing eye, while the pagans see the human drama as a heroic, theatrical spectacle for the divine. After looking at the etymology of the term, this video looks at the link between at the most important role of gods in human life—to make sense of senseless suffering. The Christian amelioration of suffering is analyzed through The Martyrdom of St. Erasmus by Dierc Bouts, followed by practical examples of the belief in a spectator god. The importance of ritual and behaviour—the functional dimension of belief—is discussed alongside its disavowal. Finally, a historic example that corroborates this perspective is reviewed, specifically the ancient Celts.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:10 Suffering, Meaning and the Gods\n6:01 The World's Immanent Audience\n11:03 The Inverted Early Christian\n14:10 Virtue and the Audience\n18:11 Audience Atheism\n21:56 Conclusion",

    "description": "The thesis of this video is that objectifying people is a necessary and fundamental feature of life. It begins with a critique of the Kantian position, followed by a close look at the etymological roots of object & subject. Nietzsche's speculations on the origin of responsibility and its cruel nature is explored, along with the theory of language as a weapon proposed in the Dialogue of the Dogs by Cervantes. \n\n'The Deceitful Marriage' is also summarized and put forward as more unflattering but realistic depiction of objectification. The vindictive and sadistic elements of life is looked at through the lens of feminist thinkers like Simone de Beauvoir and Nancy Bauer, with a critical perspective on modern 'empowerment' narratives that center around female objectification. Then, Nietzsche's theory on forgetfulness is analyzed to shed light on his idea that autonomy and morality are mutually exclusive. \n\nFinally, the work of YouTuber Kevin Samuels is explored as an honest perspective on objectification, followed by concluding remarks that look at the life-projects of thinkers like Nietzsche and Machiavelli. \n\n\nChapters:\n__________ \n\n0:00 Objectifying People and the Kantian view\n5:03 Etymological Analysis of Object/Subject\n11:36 Nietzsche on Social responsibility\n17:41 Cervantes: Language as a Weapon\n19:59 Cervantes: the Deceitful Marriage\n29:17 Lady Gaga and Self-Objectification\n32:47 Autonomy and Morality\n40:09 Kevin Samuels & Honest Objectification\n48:10 Biology and Instrumentality\n52:56 Machiavelli and Nietzsche's Life\n\n\nFurther watching/reading:\n__________________________\n\nMladen Dolar - \"Gossip, Rumors, and Philosophy\" \nhttps://youtu.be/NHZf4V8Bs2c\n\nKevin Samuels - How Much Does Your Submission Cost?\nhttps://youtu.be/P1MnZrxhJ1s?t=4310\n\nNietzsche's Genealogy of Morality\nhttps://philosophy.ucsc.edu/news-events/colloquia-conferences/GeneologyofMorals.pdf\n\nCervantes - The Deceitful Marriage & The Dialogue of the Dogs\nhttps://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Cervantes_Marriage_Dogs.pdf\n\nSimone de Beauvoir - Why I’m a Feminist\nhttps://youtu.be/g6eDMaDWquI\n\nAdam Curtis - Can't Get You Out of My Head (great documentary that includes stuff about Jiang Qing a.k.a Madame Mao)\nhttps://thoughtmaybe.com/cant-get-you-out-of-my-head/\n\nNancy Bauer - Lady Power\nhttps://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/lady-power/",

    "description": "Full text: https://andreigeorgescu.ca/nietzsche-and-the-black-panthers/\n\nAbstract: This video explores the influence Nietzsche had on Huey Newton, the co-founder of The Black Panther Party. Newton was particularly inspired by The Genealogy of Morals, which he used as practical advice to instigate a form of psychological warfare to support his socialist political project. Newton's choice of the group's name is analyzed through the lens of Hans Kruuk's concept of 'surplus killing'. This approach helps explain §349 of The Gay Science, where Nietzsche elucidates his critique of the framing of evolutionary theory and offers an enticing attitude towards life. This is followed by a discussion of Newton's use of Christianity as a model for his Marxist-Leninist project, along with Nietzsche's perspective of Christianity and an explanation of the master/slave morality in Genealogy. The idea is extended further by looking at modern correlates of the 'knightly aristocratic masters', and by looking at the modern anthropological research of Richard Wrangham and Christopher Boehm that demonstrates the self-domestication of the human species. I claim that understanding this broader picture gives us great insight into modern culture and morality, which Nietzsche described as the Christianization of humankind. \n\nTips: https://ko-fi.com/georgescu\n\nTimestamps:\n\n\n0:00 Surplus Killing and the Panther\n13:58 Whites, Cops and Psychological Warfare\n20:56 Nietzsche's Lion King \n24:30 Utility and the Creation of Slaves\n30:08 Self-Domestication\n33:50 Murderous Good Guys\n40:47 Conclusion",

    "description": "Keegan Kjeldsen is an author, philosopher and musician who runs the Nietzsche Podcast and makes music with Destroyer of Light. I invited him on the podcast to talk about what it means to have a Nietzschean community,\nand more broadly what is involved in building community, what role we can expect to play in society. I find it appropriate that out of all the people to lead the public understanding of Nietzsche through a podcast, it's a musician; he has an understanding of how important it is to *feel* meaning as something that throttles your body, rather than a set of ideas. There's a musical element to Nietzsche, in the sense that he gets under your skin and enchants with his words, he creates compelling characters, images, stories, turns of phrases, ironic jokes, rather than stuff like: hello I am Nietzsche this is what I believe and it is correct.\n\nIt didn't go exactly the direction I wanted but it's tricky because as a topic it's so vast; Nietzsche's thought is already so complicated and varied that it takes a lot to unpack. We spent God knows how long just discussing §40 in The Gay Science, which I wanted to bring up because it's tied to Keegan's attempt at building a secular community that sought dignity for the disdvantaged members of society.\n\nAnyway, after smashing that like and subscribe button, and leaving a hateful, deranged comment, check out Keegan's podcast here:\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-nietzsche-podcast/id1573808070\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nHis book Unconscious Correspondences:\n\nhttps://app.thebookpatch.com/BookStore/unconscious-correspondences/3fe82dc3-d4ac-4d61-81c3-9ce9a7abe483\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nAnd his song Into the Smoke here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aAj8TZhOOZU\n\nand his band here:\n\nhttps://destroyeroflight.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/destroyeroflight\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nThe Nietzsche subreddit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n \nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:50 The Church of Nietzsche\n3:40 Nietzsche and St. Paul\n7:52 Arguing with Jordan Peterson\n13:44 Peterson on church and therapy\n16:37 Integrating into society\n21:44 Most people need a preacher\n26:32 On the lack of noble manners\n38:42 The beam in the proletariat eye\n43:13 Oligarchical Collectivism\n48:13 The West Virgina Mine Wars\n56:49 Building a community\n1:02:17 Activism through art\n1:10:34 Political goals; distributism\n1:17:23 Plebeian secession\n1:19:10 Chilling online\n1:21:33 The religious origin of art\n1:26:50 Resonance of feelings \n1:32:45 Growing as an artist\n1:36:06 Destroyer of Light-New releases\n1:39:31 A Nietzschean attitude\n1:42:18 Nietzsche Podcast and new tour\n1:45:40 Outro",

    "description": "No, you didn’t ask to be born—you were not so polite. \n\nRather, you demanded it in the shape of a shall, your gavel beating the command into bronze.\n\nYou harnessed two slaves to build the palace of your body, though not before you did your due diligence.\n\nYou lurked and hunted the best you could catch! You were a choosy one indeed; you scouted for the greatest harmony of oculo-facio-skeletal proportions, the plumpest thoughts and bank accounts, the most delectable buttocks, jaws, hips, chests, and feet.\n\nYou dissolved the thoughts of your slaves into the acid bath of lust, that most radioactive glow of delight! That substance which swallows all questions and answers into its depth, and makes grumbling victims evince mile-wide smiles.\n\nYou affixed yourself to your female slave as if a lamprey, siphoning off nourishment which you commanded from far-off lands; tuna from Thailand, potatoes from Poland, mangoes from Mexico. By air, sea or land you delighted in the armies of servants whose labour was sacrificed for your palace. Once your majestic structure was sturdy enough, you began to explore more land and demand more construction, greater chapels and oratories, greater sacrifices of flora and fauna.\n\nYou screamed unintelligibly at your slaves twixt midnight and mid-day, but they understood your meaning—more! more! Thus were enlisted indentured servants of all kind at your behest; jesters, cooks, confectioners, tailors, plumbers, nannies, tutors, all for your amusement and nourishment!\n\nThough as your kingdom ages, it seems amnesia has plagued your land. Now, you cloak yourself in a foreign shroud of purity: ‘I never asked to be born!’ you lament as if a lamb tending its wounds. You forget your bloodied scepter, Your Majesty! You spin yarns; you claim that it was, after all, your slaves who diabolically imprisoned you, that you were an innocent bystander, kidnapped from your slumber!\n\nFear not, dear king! I remember, we remember: as Nietzsche put it, life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, the conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation. So rejoice in your palace, dear friend! Enjoy its infinite luster, for it came at an awesome price.\n\nhttps://andreigeorgescu.ca/birth-paean/\n\nBackground music by xander.\nhttps://lofirecords.com/blogs/releases/cabin-fever",
