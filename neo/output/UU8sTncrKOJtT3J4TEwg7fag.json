Is it a reliable history of the early church and the life of the apostle Paul? Or is it a rather late, largely fictional retelling of these events? It is safe to say that modern New Testament scholarship strongly favors this latter option. But what if there is compelling evidence telling in favor of the historical reliability of Acts? And if so, what are the ramifications of this evidence for the Christian faith and Christian apologetics? This video will explore these questions arguing that there is excellent evidence for the reliability of the book of Acts and that this fact serves an critical role in making the case for the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:05 - Authorship of Luke-Acts\n07:12 - Date of Composition of Luke-Acts\n08:09 - Does Luke-Acts Know Josephus?\n15:47 - Is Luke-Acts Never Quoted Before 150 AD?\n20:36 - When Was Papias Writing?\n24:29 - Was Acts Written Before 70 AD?\n31:01 - Internal Evidence of Reliability\n31:30 - Names, Titles, and Places\n35:39 - Correlations with the Pauline Corpus\n36:28 - Undesigned Coincidences\n38:07 - Conclusion\n\nSources:\n\nCynic Sage or Son of God? - Gregory A.

David Hume famously argued that it is not. But despite over 200 years of steady criticism, there remain a number of philosophers who defend Hume's argument.

I’ve been pondering this issue on and off for the past several years and my perspectives are, in many regards, unique. I hold to an indeterministic conception of free will which would probably be considered libertarian by many although I have developed some reservations about using that term. The plan for this video is as follows: First, I will offer a brief overview of the contemporary options in the free will debate and get some working definitions on the table. I will then present what I take to be the most plausible account of free will, namely an agent-causal account. I will present an original, although not decisive, argument for why we should think that this account is true. Finally I shall address the two most common objections to agent-causal indeterminism. I will explore and reject the idea that this account of free will is incoherent and reduces to random chance. Then I shall critique the notion that scientific developments in neuroscience has shown that our decisions are predetermined.\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:02:40 - A Brief Survey of the Landscape\n00:10:27 - Event-Causation vs. Agent-Causation\n00:14:13 - Defending Agent-Causation\n00:23:25 - Simple Indeterminism\n00:29:12 - A Modest Argument For Indeterminism\n00:32:28 - Defining Determinism and Indeterminism\n00:35:45 - Abductive Reasoning 101\n00:39:12 - The Phenomenology of Deliberation\n00:42:25 - Determinism Entails Additional Complexity\n00:46:45 - Objections and Replies\n00:51:02 - The Randomness Objection\n00:54:23 - The Extended Randomness Objection\n01:00:28 - Has Science Disproved Free Will?\n01:15:38 - Conclusion\n\nSources:\n\nFour Views on Free Will - John Martin Fischer, Robert Kane, Derk Pereboom, and Manuel Vagas\n\n Living Without Free Will - Derk Pereboom\n\nExcusing Sinners and Blaming God - Guillaume Bignon\n\nFree Will: Sourcehood and its Alternatives - Kevin Timpe\n\nFreedom and Neurobiology -  John R.

Is determinism somehow epistemically self-defeating? And if so, then does this provide us with some reason to think that God exists? An apologist by the name of Tim Stratton strong believes so.

In particular, such objections can be found among Christian presuppositional apologists. They argue that the traditional method of apologetics dishonors Scripture by not giving it the respect it is due. The concern is that offering evidence for the truth of Scripture gives evidence a greater weight of authority than Scripture. In this video, I hope to show that the traditional apologist can answer this type of argument in a two-fold fashion. Once we firmly grasp what it means to say that Scripture is one’s highest authority, it will become clear that this belief is not in conflict with presenting evidence for the truth of Scripture. In short, traditional, evidence-based, apologetics is harmonious with the affirmation that Scripture is the Christian’s highest authority.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Introduction\n03:19 - Two Different Types of Authority\n05:04 - Scripture as an Epistemic Authority\n07:39 - The Need for Reasons to Believe Putative Authorities\n09:44 - Scripture as a Highest Epistemic Authority\n11:06 - Evidence is Not an Type of Authority\n12:40 - The Underlying Concern\n14:56 - Can Evidence be Greater than God?\n16:25 - Conclusion\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQKjUzotw_Y&t=0s\n\n“The Sufficiency of Scripture in Apologetics,” TMSJ 12/1 (Spring 2001) - Michael J.

These include the accuracy of the Gospel authors with respect to geographical locations and names, as well as local customs, and cultural references. Then there are undesigned coincidences, unnecessary details, unexplained allusions, and unified personalities throughout the Gospels. All of these arguments have in common the idea that certain details within the Gospels are unlikely to have been fabricated because they are difficult to engineer, and correspond to the known characteristics of reliable testimony. Together, they form a powerful abductive argument for the historical reliability of the Gospels. Most of these arguments have already received attention both in writing and in videos. However, there is a further argument which I would add to this repertoire of arguments which has not hitherto been developed in any detail, at least not to my knowledge. I call this the argument from forced-fulfilled prophecy.\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:29 - The Reality of Forced-Fulfillment\n06:05 - A Distinctive Feature of Matthew's Gospel\n07:10 - Midrash\n09:38 - An Argument For Historical Reliability\n13:33 - New Moses Typology?\n16:27 - Historicity: The Best Explanation\n17:18 - Conclusion\n\nSources:\n\nJesus and the Gospels - Craig L.

The most sophisticated attempt at providing such an argument comes from James N. Anderson and Greg Welty in their 2011 paper “The Lord of Non-Contradiction: An Argument for God from Logic”. I am actually on-board with most of the premises of this argument. However, I think that the chief flaw emerges in a subtle and unjustified inference from necessary truth to necessary existence.

Lydia McGrew served to revive the argument within contemporary apologetics with the publication of her 2017 book Hidden in Plain View. The argument has, of course, sparked a reaction from many skeptics. I would have liked to make a video defending the argument from undesigned coincidences from the criticisms which it has faced. However, after seeing how badly almost all criticisms of the argument misunderstand it, I thought I would try doing something a bit different. In this video, rather than defend the argument from the extremely misguided criticisms which it has faced heretofore, I will instead sketch a strategy for what a successful refutation of this argument would actually look like. The title of this video is somewhat misleading. I am personally persuaded that the argument from undesigned coincidences is a good argument for the historical reliability of the Gospels. As such, I do not think that the response to the argument which I will sketch here can actually be successfully completed. But I am offering it to skeptics in the hopes that, by seeing what it would take to successfully invalidate the argument from undesigned coincidences, they will better understand the argument from undesigned coincidences.\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n02:28 - The Logic Behind the Argument\n05:20 - Defining and Identifying Undesigned Coincidences\n08:25 - Examples of Undesigned Coincidences\n13:55 - The Larger Whole Behind the Texts\n19:31 - Inference to the Best Explanation\n22:15 - The \"Divide and Conquer\" Strategy\n32:45 - A Shortcoming in the Strategy\n33:15 - Conclusion\n\nSources:\n\nHidden in Plain View - Lydia McGrew\n\nCan We Trust the Gospels? - Peter J.

Some of the rules and regulations just seem arbitrary such as the well-known dietary laws prohibiting foods like pork and shellfish, or laws prohibiting the mixing of different types of fabric. Some of these seem very cruel such as commands to stone disobedient children to death and to cut off the hand of a woman who touches a man’s genitals. Some of these passages are actually disturbing such as verses which describe the proper treatment of slaves, and implicitly endorse the acceptability of capturing enemies and turning them into slaves. More troubling still are verses which seemingly approve of capturing enemy women and forcing them to marry Israelite soldiers. And of course, most troubling of all are the commands from God to wipe out the Canaanites including non-combatants like women, children, and even infants. This video will explore these issues and how Christians have responded to the challenges posed by these texts. I will caution against various extremes before proposing what I see as being the most promising way to understand them.\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:40 - A Brief Autobiography\n04:05 - Some \"Solutions\" Which Don't Work\n12:07 - The Redemptive Movement Hermeneutic\n21:29 - Forced Marriages and War R@pe\n25:54 - The Canaanite Genocide\n33:35 - Slavery in the Old Testament\n35:45 - Hand Amputation\n42:04 - A Final Concern\n46:12 - Conclusion\n\nSources:\n\nHoly War in the Bible - Heath A.

The Gospels are, by far, our earliest and best historical sources regarding the life, ministry, and teachings of Jesus. Since the Gospels are so central to our understanding of Jesus, it is important that we know where this information is coming from. It is important that we know who authored the Gospels, that the authors were well placed to know they were talking about, and that what they report is true. But who exactly wrote the Gospels? Were they in a good position to know what they were talking about? And are their accounts trustworthy?\n\nSources:\n\nJesus Before the Gospels - Bart. D.

We saw that, while some disagreement may have existed over the exact order of Mark and Luke, there was complete agreement on the priority of Matthew. But that is just one leg for the Two-Gospel Hypothesis to stand on. There is another category of internal evidence which is equally compelling and which we will explore in this video. \nThis evidence largely comes from apparent examples of Mark combining or conflating Matthew and Luke’s narratives together. This so-called argument from conflation, if successful, decisively shows that Mark was written after Matthew and Luke for both of these Gospels would clearly have to exist in order for Mark to conflate them. We shall examine this argument in detail before considering some more internal facts about Mark which suggest that it was written third.\n\nSources:\n\nEvidence of Conflation in Mark?

In this video, I begin the task of building a positive case for an alternative hypothesis. In my next video, we will explore the internal evidence which strongly suggests that Matthew and Luke wrote their Gospels first, and that Mark was written last. But for now, I want to leave those sorts of considerations aside and examine a different category of evidence. In this video, I want to see what sort of Synoptic theory we arrive at if we only consider what our earliest witnesses have to say about the composition of the Gospels.\n\nSources:\n\nWhy Four Gospels? - David Alan Black\n\nThe Three Gospels -  Martin Mosse\n\nNew Synoptic Studies - William R.

I conclude that all of them fail for a variety of reasons. The aim is to show that the case for Markan priority has been vastly overstated and oversold. This, of course, is no proof that the Gospel of Matthew was written first or that the Gospel of Mark was written third. We shall explore the external and internal evidence for these conclusions in two future videos. The only conclusion that I reach here is that there is no justification to be had for the theory of Markan priority despite the confidence with which it is widely held. However, it is my hope that this video serves to clear away some of the bias against the the Patristics, and motivates us to take what they have to say about the Synoptic Gospels seriously.\n\nSources:\n\nChristology and the Synoptic Problem: An Argument for Markan Priority - Peter M.

    "description": "Click here to support my research: https://patreon.com/FaithBecauseofReason?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink\n\nClick here to make a one-time donation: https://paypal.me/davidpallmann?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US\n\nIn this video I offer an overview of Van Tilian Presuppositionalism and offer a response to (arguably) the most popular proponent of it - Greg Bahnsen. Specifically I address the main arguments he sets forth in chapter three of his book Presuppositional Apologetics Stated and Defended. Bahnsen primarily utilizes the logocentric predicament and the problem of induction to bolster his case. I offer solutions to both problems along with a critique of epistemic circularity and a case for acquaintance foundationalism. I realize that this video will not be the final word on this subject. But I do hope it serves to foster fruitful dialogue and takes a step towards furthering the conversation between Presuppositionalists and Evidentialists.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe Painful Truth - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPwnibUslzw\n\nFace Your Demons - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz6JNosobTc\n\nWin at All Costs - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BETMMgwrKVc\n\nWhatever it Takes - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujcERGn5_8g\n\nHaters Lessons - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i61-XaLikN4\n\nOpinions Haters Critics - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X55-vk4lXHE\n\nToday is the Day - Fearless Motivation\n\nYou Can Change - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W637v4uaQlQ\n\nSources:\n\nThe Foundations of Knowledge - Timothy J.

Although classical foundationalism has impressive historical precedent, it is currently unpopular. In contemporary epistemology, the prevailing opinion is that classical foundationalism is simply outdated and untenable. In this video, I wish to challenge this assumption and argue that rumors of foundationalism’s death are premature. Foundationalism is more than capable of meeting the objections leveled against it.\n\nMusic:\n\nBe Yourself - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnluibKQ6DY\n\nSaints and Sinners - Brand X Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbzyfHjoKzM\n\nTalkers and Walkers - Fearless Motivation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vasf2LA0ekI\n\nParadise Lost - Brand X Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYZI0HWC9pY\n\nAll or Nothing - Brand X Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RywjSw0FgTc\n\nSources:\n\nWarrant and Proper Function - Alvin Plantinga\n\n\"In Defense of Classical Foundationalism: A Critical Evaluation of Plantinga's Argument that Classical Foundationalism is Self-Refuting,\" The South African Journal of Philosophy, 26, no. 3 (2007) - John M.

    "description": "In my previous video, I built a case for believing that a genuine believer can forfeit his faith, become an unbeliever, and lose his salvation. I made this case using passages outside of the book of Hebrews. But in this video, we are going to focus on the warnings within the book of Hebrews. It is the Arminian position that these warnings are addressed to genuine believers and that the warnings are against losing one’s salvation. This video will evaluate and critique each of these alternate interpretations. I am dedicating an entire video to just these passages because of the sheer number of proposed alternatives.

    "description": "In this video we will begin examining the Biblical evidence which teaches that a genuine believer really can forfeit their salvation. Once again, there is so much evidence against eternal security that we will have to explore it in two parts. Some of the strongest warnings come from the book of Hebrews. As we shall see, Calvinists and other believers in eternal security carry out the most tortured of exegesis to escape the conclusion that these warnings really teach that believers can be lost. But in this video, we shall restrict ourselves to warnings outside of Hebrews.

Those who deny Jesus’ historical existence have received the labeled mythicists. This view is not taken seriously by scholars and therefore it receives little attention. However, due to its growing popularity, I will tackle some of their arguments in this series. Although I intend to treat mythicist arguments with respect, it needs to be stressed that scholarship does not consider this view reasonable. With the possible exception of Richard Carrier, there are no credentialed experts who would defend this view. With that in mind, let’s proceed to examine the historical evidence for the existence of Jesus.

    "description": "Among the classical arguments for God’s existence, one of the most famous (and most controversial) is the ontological argument. This argument seeks to demonstrate that God necessarily exists, and that this logically follows from the very concept of what God is. It is a frequently misunderstood argument, and many objections simply misunderstand it. It has been defended by some of the greatest philosophical theists both in the past and in the present. So just what is this controversial and provocative argument? This video presents the ontological argument for God’s existence.\n\nMusic:\n\nAbove and Beyond - Really Slow Motion\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q69psIiWJ4g\n\nBecoming - Really Slow Motion\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcOnVjDCGU8\n\nSun and Stars - Really Slow Motion\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kf-FlECN7M\n\nSources:\n\n\"A Sceptic's Guide to Atheism\" by Peter S.

Throughout this series I have tried to explain my scientific reasons for being skeptical of evolution. The lack of scientific for evolution and the mounting evidence against it is, and always has been, my primary reason for rejecting it. However, I have other reasons for rejecting theistic evolution as well. It is the purpose of this video to explain why I think this view is problematic.

    "description": "Theories of evolution attempt to study how life diverged from a common ancestor and spread over the earth. However, contrary to much of popular thought, evolution doesn’t demonstrate, but rather assumes the origin of life. Natural selection can only act once a living organism already exists. But then, how did life begin? Is there a naturalistic explanation? This video will assess various naturalistic theories of life’s origin, and argue that they all fail. Life, and more specifically the DNA that is required for life is best explained by an intelligent being rather than materialistic natural processes. It is time to explore the origin of life.\n\nMusic:\n\nEversong - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JroDsfUe-_U&list=PLa3mBPYc0eBZR3vYhq_dxYBAxqFF7EcBY\n\nEversong (No Vocals) - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SRDIQzdclU&list=PLa3mBPYc0eBZR3vYhq_dxYBAxqFF7EcBY&index=14\n\nBattlemaster (No Vocals) - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m-hvSjWmQE&list=PLa3mBPYc0eBZR3vYhq_dxYBAxqFF7EcBY&index=21\n\nDragonshield (No Vocals) - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9os_PywAZ3M&list=PLa3mBPYc0eBZR3vYhq_dxYBAxqFF7EcBY&index=16\n\nSources:\n\n\"Signature in the Cell\" by Stephen Meyer\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Signature-Cell-Evidence-Intelligent-Design/dp/0061472786\n\n\"Signature of Controversy\" edited by David Klinghoffer\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Signature-Controversy-Responses-Critics-Cell/dp/0979014182/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=signature+of+controversy&qid=1571462345&s=books&sr=1-1\n\n\"More Than Myth\" edited by Paul D.

    "description": "In my previous two videos, I argued that the usual arguments for common descent based on similarities between organisms and the fossil record are unsuccessful. These video were intended to show that there is really no evolution to explain. However, even if there was, is there a viable mechanism that could accomplish this grand evolutionary story? According to Neo-Darwinism, natural selection acting on random mutations is all that is needed to explain the complexity and diversity of living organisms. But, is this really enough? How much change can really be accomplished? New evidence is showing us that Neo-Darwinism is very limited in what it can actually do. So limited, in fact, that it cannot be the full explanation for the development of life on earth.\n\nMusic:\n\nFearless Motivation - I Can\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43s1XBcxlOY\n\nFearless Motivation - Never Make It\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziVLl2l1jw4\n\nReally Slow Motion - Myths and Legends\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVCS-oigGUI\n\nSources:\n\n\"The Natural Limits to Biological Change\" by Lane Lester and Raymond Bohlin\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Natural-Limits-Biological-Change-1989-12-03/dp/B01FEM4AQS/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+natural+limits+to+biological+change&qid=1570297685&sr=8-1\n\n\"The Edge of Evolution\" by Michael Behe\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Edge-Evolution-Search-Limits-Darwinism/dp/0743296222/ref=pd_cart_vw_crc_1_4/145-5755696-2733431?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0743296222&pd_rd_r=e86ac683-74bc-48e4-b861-57a146606ce3&pd_rd_w=S7ks3&pd_rd_wg=Gxn5U&pf_rd_p=9af4a820-d9ab-496c-bf25-8a58e63d3c7b&pf_rd_r=CSJFFM3N71B05G1ZMWWX&psc=1&refRID=CSJFFM3N71B05G1ZMWWX\n\n\"Darwin Devolves\" by Michael Behe\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Devolves-Science-Challenges-Evolution/dp/0062842617/ref=pd_cart_vw_crc_1_4/145-5755696-2733431?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0062842617&pd_rd_r=54084b01-5924-4484-933a-aab6920ca6ec&pd_rd_w=3NgXP&pd_rd_wg=yVLox&pf_rd_p=9af4a820-d9ab-496c-bf25-8a58e63d3c7b&pf_rd_r=3G5P06Y0TJKZTEWY74DK&psc=1&refRID=3G5P06Y0TJKZTEWY74DK\n\n\"Four Views on Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design\" edited by J.

    "description": "In my previous video, I examined several common arguments for common ancestry and refuted them. Most of these arguments were based on genetic, molecular, or anatomical similarities. However, such evidences can only be used to either confirm or contradict a theory of common descent based on the fossil record. The fossil evidence will always have to do the heavy lifting for any case either for or against evolution. While the fossil record as a whole is problematic for evolutionists, they have some candidate fossils that they claim demonstrate common descent. So, in this video we will examine the fossil record.\n\nMusic:\n\nHeavy Invaders - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5IcvjzB2Sg\n\nUprising - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVp0VeHB_6I\n\nStand Your Ground - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO5WZFo37RU\n\nSources:\n\n\"The Greatest Show on Earth\" by Richard Dawkins\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Show-Earth-Evidence-Evolution/dp/1416594795/ref=sr_1_1?crid=JRNAWZHRC4KY&keywords=the+greatest+show+on+earth+richard+dawkins&qid=1569085021&sprefix=dawkins+the+gr%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1\n\n\"The Origin of the Species\" by Charles Darwin\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Origin-Species-Charles-Darwin/dp/1082404802/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3PTYANSIBLZV4&keywords=on+the+origin+of+species&qid=1569085075&sprefix=on+the+o%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFPTUxERDhSQVBUSlcmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1OTUwMjcxVUdNMDdIRVpEWkYyJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyMzM5MzIyVDlBNEVOTlY0WTk1JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==\n\n\"Icons of Evolution\" by Jonathan Wells\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Icons-Evolution-Science-Teach-About/dp/0895262002/ref=sr_1_1?crid=80GDWZBD01GH&keywords=icons+of+evolution&qid=1569085140&sprefix=icons+of+ev%2Caps%2C225&sr=8-1\n\n\"Explore Evolution\" by Stephen Meyer, et al\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Explore-Evolution-Arguments-Against-Neo-Darwinism/dp/1936599112/ref=sr_1_1?crid=257RQBF5GLQ5Y&keywords=explore+evolution+the+arguments+for+and+against+neo-darwinism&qid=1569085187&sprefix=explore+evolu%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-1\n\n\"The Greatest Hoax on Earth\" by Jonathan Sarfati\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Earth-Refuting-Dawkins-Evolution/dp/1921643064/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1JSBBFU1J8TSE&keywords=the+greatest+hoax+on+earth&qid=1569085259&sprefix=the+greatest+hoax%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-1\n\n\"Searching for Adam\" edited by Terry Mortenson\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Searching-Adam-Genesis-Truth-Origin/dp/0890519757/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2JJ0CIZ8ND931&keywords=searching+for+adam+genesis+%26+the+truth+about+man%27s+origin&qid=1569085306&sprefix=searching+for+adam%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-1\n\n\"Science and Human Origins\" by Ann Gauger, Douglas Axe, and Casey Luskin\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Science-Human-Origins-Ann-Gauger/dp/193659904X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=science+and+human+origins&qid=1569085372&sr=8-1\n\n\"Zombie Science\" by Jonathan Wells\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Science-More-Icons-Evolution/dp/1936599449/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=zombie+science&qid=1569085410&sr=8-1\n\n\"Physical Anthropology\" by Gabriel Lasker\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Physical-Anthropology-Gabriel-Ward-Lasker/dp/0030897572/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Gabriel+lasker+physical+anthropology&qid=1569085518&sr=8-2\n\n\"Contested Bones\" by John Sanford and Christopher Rupe\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Contested-Bones-Christopher-Rupe/dp/0981631681/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=contested+bones&qid=1569085604&sr=8-1\n\n\"Extinct Humans\" by Ian Tattersall  and Jeffrey Schwartz\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Extinct-Humans-Ian-Tattersall/dp/0813334829/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=extinct+humans&qid=1569085645&sr=8-2\n\n\"Why is a Fly Not a Horse?\" by Giuseppe Sermonti\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Why-Fly-Horse-Giuseppe-Sermonti/dp/0963865471/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=why+is+a+fly+not+a+horse&qid=1569085718&sr=8-1\n\n\"The Design of Life\" by William Dembski and Jonathan Wells\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Design-Life-Discovering-Intelligence-Biological/dp/0980021308/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+design+of+life&qid=1569085769&sr=8-1\n\nSome stock footage obtained from https://www.videezy.com\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

    "description": "In my previous video, I introduced the theory of intelligent design and answered some preliminary objections to it. Intelligent Design’s competition, the theory of evolution, has two major pillars. The first is that all life descends from a single common ancestor, and second is that purely natural forces are sufficient to accomplish this change. This video is aimed at the first of those two claims. If universal common descent is historically false, then it doesn’t matter if natural forces can accomplish it or not. So here I am challenging a central dogma of modern biology. This is a critique of common ancestry.\n\nMusic:\n\nRide to Glory - Epic Score\nyoutube.com/watch?v=Fo-7nMLcN4U\n\nBlaze of Glory - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XcfN...\n\nFlag of Victory - Epic Score\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6EY5...\n\nSources:\n\n\"More than Myth?\" edited by Paul Brown and Robert Stackpole\nhttps://www.amazon.com/More-than-Myth...\n\n\"Zombie Science\" by Jonathan Wells\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Science...\n\n\"Icons of Evolution\" by Jonathan Wells\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Icons-Evolutio...\n\n\"Who was Adam\" by Fazale Rana and Hugh Ross\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Creation-Model...\n\n\"The Language of God\" by Francis Collins\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Language-God-S...\n\n\"The Myth of Junk DNA\" by Jonathan Wells\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Myth-Junk-Jona...\n\n\"Science & Human Origins\" by Ann Gauger, Doug Axe, and Casey Luskin\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Science-Human-...\n\n\"Only a Theory\" by Kenneth Miller\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Only-Theory-Ev...\n\n\"Contested Bones\" Christopher Rupe and John C.

    "description": "In the world around us we see amazing creatures. Organisms that display complexity on level that baffles the mind. As the scientific evidence builds, the more amazed we’ve become at the intricate details within biological systems. Can this complexity be reasonably explained by purely naturalistic causes? Or is there a need for a designing intelligence in the origin and development of life on earth? This series will take an in-depth look at the data and argue that standard evolutionary explanations are insufficient and that intelligence and foresight are indeed required.
