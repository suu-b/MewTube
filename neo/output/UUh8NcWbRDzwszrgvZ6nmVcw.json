    "description": "In this video I respond to claims made by William Lane Craig of @ReasonableFaithOrg and Sean McDowell of @SeanMcDowell and their criticism of Andrew Rillera's book Lamb of the Free - a Biblical critique of Penal Substitution. I show why their review misrepresents both the scholarship and the biblical data. I demonstrate that Craig actually rejects or softens most of Penal Substitutionary Atonement’s historic claims, creating a “Motte & Bailey” PSA which is mild and vague in public, but far more punitive in his academic writings. We walk through the 17 historical claims of PSA and show how removing even one weakens or collapses the system. I address Craig’s claims that Rillera “ignored Isaiah 53,” “denies substitution,” and “denies atonement,” and show that each of these accusations is factually wrong. I also address Craig’s labeling of Rillera's work as progressive.\n\n#Atonement #Christianity #Jesus \n\nAdditional Resources on the work of Christ:\n\n📺 WATCH: The History of Different Atonement Theories\nhttps://youtu.be/xoJa7AiQdgM?si=YHQs1n6Bo5ke_1X6 \n\nAdditional Resources:\n📚 Leviticus on the Butcher's Block\nhttps://amzn.to/4hsHU6d\n📚 CLEAN\nhttps://amzn.to/47MPu7p\n📚 Lamb of the Free:\nhttps://amzn.to/470R1Yc\n📚 Crushing the Great Serpent:\nhttps://amzn.to/479THRW\n\n📺 WATCH: Substitutionary Atonement Under Fire: William Lane Craig Refutes a New Theory\nhttps://youtu.be/Uv_GyWTEEwA?si=WljVDWDu6KEdEV4U\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Join Idol Killer to hear a sneak peak of the upcoming Album, \"Rocking the Hymnal\". These are not just hymns with electric guitars and drums, but instead completely retooled melodies & in some cases slight reworking of the lyrics or song structure - without losing the original song's meaning & all while respecting the source material. Additionally, these hymns are mostly buried gems, far from being well-known like Amazing Grace, How Great Thou Art, or A Mighty Fortress. The album takes the lyrics from classic Christian hymns (mostly from the 1700's & 1800's) and breathes new life into them, reinterpreting them as alt pop & melodic metal. Beautiful, rocking, and definitely thought provoking!\n\nThe full album releases across major music streaming services November 19, 2025, so be sure to Pre-Save it now so you'll be alerted as soon as it premieres.\n\n🎸 https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/idolkiller/rocking-the-hymnal\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "For months, both I and Marlon Wilson of @tgtengage promoted an upcoming debate between myself and @redeemedzoomer6053\non the doctrine of Total Depravity. The date was set, the topic and definitions agreed upon, and the audience was ready.\n\nThen, just one week before the debate, RZ abruptly canceled, not due to an emergency, but because he wanted to make another video on Catholicism. This last-minute cancellation wasn’t just unprofessional; it was deeply disrespectful to the moderator, to the audience, and to me, given everything involved.\n\nRZ then attempted a rug pull, suggesting that an entirely different opponent debate me in his place. When I declined, a number of online Calvinists falsely accused me of bad faith and “running” from the debate. \n\nSadly, this is not an isolated incident. Anthony Rogers @Ousias1 and James White @AOMinOrg have likewise backed out or ran from engaging me in formal debates. The frequency with which Calvinists cancel last minute has led me to adopt a new requirement for debates moving forward.\n  \n#RedeemedZoomer #Calvinism #Debate #totaldepravity \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

This was a perfect example of how to engage or respond to someone pushing a Calvinist anthropology - meaning they claim they were created spiritually dead, guilty, sinful and unable to rightly understand spiritual things or respond positively to God unless they are first regenerated, given a new heart, new mind, the gift of faith all ensuring they believe.\n\nRecently Chadd Wright of @3of7Project went on @joerogan and essentially argued this very same anthropology.\n\nThis video offers a reasonable, and Biblical way to respond to such claims.\n\n📚 Dr Allen''s new book:\nLiberating Romans from Reformed Captivity\nhttps://amzn.to/4fKw6ez\n\n#Calvinism #Debate #Christian\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

Anyone teaching the identified errors would be excommunicated, unless they turned themselves in to face the appropriate penalties.

    "description": "Pastors are meant to be shepherds... examples of holiness, humility & Christlike service. Yet a wave of high-profile scandals has rocked the modern Church, revealing moral failures, abuse of power, and the collapse of accountability.\n\nIn this video, we walk through a timeline of well-known pastors caught in sin, examine the consequences they faced (or avoided), and ask the hard questions:\n\n– What does Scripture say about such leaders?\n– How did the early Church handle these situations?\n– Why is modern church structure failing to protect God’s people?\n\nThe Church cannot afford to elevate personalities over Christ. The damage these scandals cause reaches far beyond headlines; they shake faith, silence the hurting, and lead some to walk away entirely.\n\nIt’s time to return to a biblical model of leadership, accountability, and holiness.\n\n#Christian #Scandal #Busted\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "title": "What's Wrong with Molinism?",
    "description": "Let's do a deep dive into the concept of Molinism and Middle Knowledge. \n\nMolinists affirm God has \"Middle Knowledge\", that for every metaphysically possible indeterministic scenario (one in which free creatures could choose differently) God supposedly has infallible, pre-volitional knowledge of what precisely would happen. \n\nThis assumes that there is a single, determinate truth about how each creature would freely choose... even in indeterministic situations. But that’s a highly questionable assumption, since by definition, indeterministic scenarios allow for more than one possible outcome. If multiple outcomes are truly possible, there shouldn’t be one fixed fact about what would happen.\nMolinists claim that God uses this Middle Knowledge to choose to create a world where free creatures do exactly what He wants.\n\nI recently offered a critique of Molinism on Facebook, which prompted Tim Stratton of @FreethinkingMinistries to write an article in response. This video reviews some of my concerns over Molinism and responds to the claims made in Tim's article. \n\n***Go subscribe to Tim's channel and tell him Idol Killer sent you***\n\nTim's article:\nhttps://freethinkingministries.com/does-molinism-collapse-into-determinism-a-friendly-response-to-idol-killer/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJky-BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHgFgYTnGoLEKGxl8HWgDiUmMjaC1gUEqyD8s7mBgo4EY_6_M7kYRjo17k7d2_aem_AE1OZyd8wDtw7-g8lUYHmQ\n\nAlan Rhoda's article:\nhttp://alanrhoda.net/wordpress/2021/12/a-quick-refutation-of-molinism/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJkzJdleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHoxZtf0cO7uaivgCO7odaYS4-1ukzz6yLhgiIsjK-Ks74MGku6kTSy_y_AXw_aem_51Hho3583r7sLWqw5GMjMg\n\nAlso shout out to:\nLeighton Flowers of @Soteriology101 \nEric Hernandez of @EricHernandez \nWilliam Lane Craig of @ReasonableFaithOrg \nKurt Jaros of @veracityhill \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "title": "Word Games: When Theology Twists the Bible",
    "description": "The Bible is God's self-revelation and while Christians may often be at odds over how to interpret a particular passage, one group consistently denies God's self-revelation in favor of the pagan philosophy of Plato. In doing so, it fails to meet the test for the false gods which the Holy & Living God set forth in Isaiah.\n\nClassical Theism is a philosophical and theological framework for understanding God that emphasizes divine attributes such as immutability (unchanging), impassibility (incapable of suffering or being emotionally affected), simplicity (all of God's actions and attributes are God), atemporality (existing in a single timeless moment of pure actuality), and aseity (self-existent and dependent on nothing).\n\nAt its core, Classical Theism is rooted in Platonist metaphysics rather than a literal reading of the Bible. This influence can be seen in several ways:\n\nPlato's concept of the Forms - eternal, unchanging ideals - shaped the idea that God must also be unchanging and perfect. Change, in Plato’s thought, implies imperfection or potential, which cannot apply to a perfect being.\n\nThe Neoplatonism of thinkers like Plotinus further developed the idea of \"The One\" as the ultimate, simple, and wholly transcendent source of all being, which was then adopted and adapted by Christian theologians like Augustine and Thomas Aquinas.\n\nThese philosophical commitments led Classical Theists to reinterpret biblical descriptions of God (e.g., God being angry, relenting, grieving, or acting in time) as nothing more than figurative language meant to accommodate human understanding, not literal descriptions of God.\n\nIn short, Classical Theism prioritizes philosophical coherence with Platonic ideals over a plain, literal reading of Scripture, often subordinating the dynamic, relational, and emotional depictions of God in the Bible to metaphysical principles drawn from Hellenistic philosophy.\n\nIn this video, we address some of the things God says about Himself, which were affirmed by the Apostles and Prophets, but which the Classical Theist rejects.\n\n#ClassicalTheism #christian #philosophy \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Join us as Warren McGrew of @IdolKiller and Leighton Flowers of @Soteriology101 respond to recent claims made by Scott Chasen of @roguecalvinist. In this livestream, we’ll address Rogue's contradictory arguments, theological misunderstandings, and his dramatic portrayal of himself as Calvinism's \"chosen defender.\" We'll explore his eisegesis, the flaws in his reasoning, his surprising affinity for Gnostic-like thinking, his claims that Leighton is a Master Trickster hypnotizing his audience with psychological manipulation, and Rogue's use of Star Wars quotes to speak of himself as a sort of Calvinist Jedi martyr. Let’s dive into a thoughtful discussion that separates sound doctrine from wild claims based on divine gnosis and unpack what it really means to engage in meaningful theological debate as good Bereans.\n\nThe video that Rogue responded to is entitled: \"30+ \"CALVINIST\" Texts EXPLAINED!\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/zFfoBjZolHs?si=UwPyDnaQbgs1gXKQ\n\nRogue's video is entitled: \"Provisionism is Worse Than You Thought\"\nhttps://youtu.be/jXw99aAOqQ4?si=tSSRya6mHrCFltFR\n\n#Calvinism #Determinism #Christianity \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

That would have been swell had they stopped there. However, they continued the sentence... \"popular false teachers\" and included others such as Chris Date, Michael Licona, and Greg Boyd.\r\n\r\nAmong their criticism of McGrew, Fisher and Boyd they wrote: \"These teachers embrace the wrong idea that God learns the future and that he does not know the future with 100% accuracy since the future does not exist to us or God (unorthodox view of God; finite godism).\"\r\n\r\nWarren commented on this, stating he does indeed affirm God knows the future and that Dynamic Omniscience (at least in its mere form) is essential to Christian Orthodoxy. He noted there were two possibilities for the misrepresentations made by Christicommunity... either innocent misunderstanding and ignorance, or intentional misrepresentation and dishonesty.\r\n\r\nYet, Christicommunity refused to accept Warren's beliefs as stated and even attacked the idea of God being free to create or not (themselves rejecting Christian orthodoxy in favor of fatalism). They linked to this video wherein they \"refute\" Open Theism and Dynamic Omniscience - which is what we address here.\n\nThe video we are responding to: https://youtu.be/bISzPGwU42I?si=r4ToZZjLtHpQZgyG\n\n#Calvinism #Fatalism #omniscience \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Previously Warren McGrew of Idol Killer debated @roguecalvinist on the topic of Total Depravity over on @StandingForTruthMinistries  In that debate, Rogue claimed Warren was unregenerate and could not rightly understand spiritual truths, dismissing Warren's argumentation as either lying or denying the objective truth of Rogue's isolated prooftexts. \r\n\r\nSince then Rogue went into what can only be called a meltdown, as he stated he wished Warren would burn in hell along with those who disagreed with him, called Warren a liar and claimed Warren said Rogue mistreated his children - all of which is demonstrably false. While Rogue removed some of the more offending content, he has since produced several short videos in which he either misunderstands Warren's argumentation and criticism or intentionally misrepresents it. Moreover, Rogue continues to put forward wild claims absent Biblical support.\r\n\r\nThis video will engage with and respond to Rogue's more recent attempts to salvage his position subsequent to that debate.\r\n\r\nPSA: Beware cloaked figures bearing tulips.\r\n\r\nTo see the full debate: https://www.youtube.com/live/jTjjkHxO...\r\n\r\n#Calvinism #Fatalism #gnosticism #debate \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n💡 About: \r\nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "title": "Debate Review - Rogue Calvinist on Total Depravity",
    "description": "Recently Warren McGrew of Idol Killer debated the man behind the @roguecalvinist YouTube Channel on @StandingForTruthMinistries. The debate proposition was \"Total Depravity is True\" and Scott affirmed the positive while Warren assumed the burden of the negative. To be fair to Scott, this was his first formal debate whereas it was Warren's sixth debate - his seventh if you count the open panel discussion on the Gospel Truth's channel (with Matt Slick, Vocab Malone & Chris Fisher). \r\n\r\nWatch the full debate with Rogue: https://www.youtube.com/live/jTjjkHxOA6Q?si=em_zPlnJcdQRTysV\n\nBeware cloaked figures bearing tulips.\n\nIn this broadcast, Warren will review the events leading up to the debate, the debate itself and the subsequent fallout from that debate. This is sure to cause folks to get upset and certainly bad behavior needs called out, but remember Scott claimed to have been born again in the Fall of 2021, he has no formal training on Scripture and this is his first debate - so let's cut him some slack.\r\n\r\nModerated debates are a bizarre animal and learning the format, how to operate, how to prepare and present an argument, how to operate in the cross examination, when to make a closing statement... there's a lot of components to learn. Adding to this the fact that it's being broadcast live and will likely remain online for the foreseeable future, and it can be extremely stressful. No one performs perfectly in a debate. We all make mistakes, and this is all the more common the newer we are at such forums. \r\n\r\nDid Rogue make numerous errors in debate etiquette? Absolutely. Is this something we should jump on and use to dismiss his arguments? Absolutely not. An argument needs to be considered on its merits. It must be stressed we consider the arguments as they're offered and see if they rise or fall, regardless of who is making them.\r\n\r\nDid Rogue eisegete the text, fail to understand it and make contradictory claims? Absolutely, and this is where we should focus our attention.\r\n\r\nDid Rogue behave poorly? His repeated claim that Warren is unregenerate and unable to understand spiritual truth was indeed poor behavior. Rogue often seemed to shut down, get frustrated, raise his voice and engage in ad hominem, failing to understand many of Warren's arguments, or avoiding them as best he could... and while this deserves calling out, we still must consider his arguments.\n\n#Calvinism #Fatalism #gnosticism #debate \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "This song was inspired when I was considering how many Churches offer a Program to attendees. This got me thinking about how Calvinists indoctrinate unsuspecting Christians into their systematic, redefining terms and concepts... but also how they believe we're preprgrammed to believe lies (John MacArthur) and how they believe God from all eternity decreed whatsoever comes to pass like we're all just following our programming or some secret script. All of these ideas were swirling around in my head and this is the end result. \n\nI wanted the music to evoke discomfort between the melodic and discordant, reflecting this tension between being greeted so warmly and welcomed in to the group, and that dread and foreboding arising from the realization they're teaching opposes God's self-revelation in Scripture. So I chose post-hardcore and mathrock. Then for the visual styling, I wanted to carry this theme forward, so I presented the lyrics in constantly changing formats so as to maintain this sense of vertigo so frequently experienced by new Christians when they encounter Calvinism. \n\nLYRICS:\n\nOh, hello there\nLet me get the door\nIs this your first time here?\nOut in the lobby\nGrab a muffin and some coffee\nDon't forget your program\nWe're so glad you're here\n\nI like your beard\nand your ink is pretty rad\nthe Pastor has full sleeves\nand gauges in his ears\nEver heard of Calvinism?\nNo? That's okay. \nEveryone is welcome\n\nYou'll fit right in!\n\nThe systematic is beautiful\nNothing less than the Gospel\nDon't forget your program\nTulip is the Gospel\nDon't question the program!\nJust stick to the script!\n\nYou'll fit right in!\n\nGive us your children\nThe nursery's down the hall\nSovereignly indoctrinating\nLittle tulips on the wall\nTurning vipers in diapers\ninto God's own elect\n\nEverything's predestined, just what did you expect?\n\nNow repeat after me:\n\"God decreed all sin!\nWho are you oh man\nTo question Calvinism?\"\nDon't question the program!\n\nYou'll fit right in!\n\n\n#calvinism #music #christianmusic \n\n©️ Copyright 2024 Warren McGrew All Rights Reserved \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

I spoke up and tossed my name into the hat, saying I'd be glad to debate the matter. I sent out a tweet, tagging James and letting him know I had accepted and whether or not we would debate would be his decision. \n\nDuring this time, a Representative from Breathe Reformed Church in Colorado Springs @brbcmedia who is hosting the debate reached out to me, officially inviting me to debate James on open theism / Dynamic Omniscience.\n\nThings took an unexpected turn after this phone call.

    "description": "Is Divine Simplicity is true? Well this is exactly what Dr Gavin Ortlund of @TruthUnites and Dr Ryan Mullins of @TheReluctantTheologian will be debating. \n\nNow, we're trying a new format for debate here on Idol Killer which we hope will allow for a more richer and nuanced discourse.\n\nDEBATE FORMAT:\n\nEach participant pre-records a 15 minute Opening Statement. Both will be published to Idol Killer's YouTube channel at least 1 week prior to the live event. This affords not only the audience but both participants time to familiarize themselves with the specific claims and arguments up for debate. \n\nOPENING STATEMENTS: https://youtu.be/LrvXXL4md3A?si=z4mHFDhu5ow2apUi\n\nThen, the live event (THIS video) will see each participant present a brief 2-3 minutes Steelman of the opposing view, followed by an open discussion between the participants for 30 minutes.\n\nWe then take questions from the audience which were posted to the opening statement videos, collected from Facebook, Twitter, etc. by viewers and Super Chats.   \n\nLastly, each participant has a 5 minute Closing Statement.\n\n#debate #christian #philosophy \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Over a series of messages and throughout his lifetime, RC Sproul of @ligonier consistently taught that Jesus became impure, sin incarnate, grotesque, obscene, cut off from the Father who couldn't look upon such a mass of concentrated sin, and that Jesus was damned by God, anathema, cut off and cast into outer darkness.\n\nThis is not only refuted in passages like Psalm 22 and 1 Corinthians 12:3, but results in numerous Christological and Soteriological problems, splitting the Trinity and pitting the Father against the Son, corrupting and destroying the very nature of God... not to mention distorting the loving, selfless redemptive work of God for us.\n\nWhy did RC make such blasphemous claims? Because he was being consistent with Penal Substitutionary Atonement and Federal Headship, rather than Scripture.\n\nSome may object to our criticism, noting Sproul passed away in 2017. However, his teaching is still widely circulated today and is distorting the Gospel and work of Christ. Should we endanger the living out of respect for one who passed away; one who taught blasphemy? No.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nTell me all about Jesus,\nQuote the Bible please,\nSpeak of all He accomplished,\nJust don't quote RC to me.\nSproul said He was impure.\nCalled Him sinful and obscene,\nSaid the Father damned the Son,\nTaught lies and blasphemy!\n\nWait... have you never read,\nWhat the Apostle Paul once said?\nNo one speaking by the Spirit,\nclaims God damned the Son.\nBut you write RC's words,\nInto the margins!\n\nWhat's wrong with you people?\nSo nice and compliant,\nSeated in silence,\nDesperate to fit in,\nYou'd crucify Him again!\n\nTell me all about Jesus,\nQuote the Bible please,\nSpeak of all He accomplished,\nJust don't quote RC to me.\nSproul said He was impure.\nCalled Him sinful and obscene,\nSaid the Father damned the Son,\nTaught lies and blasphemy!\n\nWhat's wrong with you people?\nSo nice and compliant,\nSeated in silence,\nDesperate to fit in,\nYou'd crucify Him again!\n\nTell me all about Jesus,\nQuote the Bible please,\nSpeak of all He accomplished,\nJust don't quote RC to me.\nSproul said He was impure.\nCalled Him sinful and obscene,\nSaid the Father damned the Son,\nTaught lies and blasphemy!\n\n#christian #music #christianmusic \n\n©️ Copyright 2024 Warren McGrew All Rights Reserved \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Theological Determinism is a form of predeterminism which states that all events that happen are pre-ordained, and predestined to happen. In this view god is both the arsonist and the fireman, the savior and the abuser, as he is said to have meticulously determined everything with specificity.\n\nThis song is dedicated to those who are suffering and believe God decreed their suffering for his own glory. I pray this breaks through and people realize God is better than this.\n\nGod doesn't get His kicks by causing men to suffer for His glory. Rather, the God of the Bible took on the totality of human nature, becoming one of us and DETERMINED TO SUFFER for us, to achieve the victory over sin, suffering and death itself - bringing us hope. THIS is what separates the Living God from dead idols.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nWhen life falls apart, when everything claimed fails,\nIt hits so hard, being decreed by God!\nWho can you look to, where can you go?\nThere is no safety, only woe!\n\nCan't run away, run away\nCan't run away, from your destiny! \n\nCrushed by the mountain, dreading the blows,\nIt’s easy to lose yourself, devil knows:\n“God can’t hear you shouting, He’s deaf to your plea.\nJust take comfort He’s in control.\nEvery single sin, every single blow,\nGod gets all the glory from every single woe!”\n\nLife’s so dark, everything’s a struggle,\nBuried under grief, determined to suffer!\nPray to an Arsonist, Abused by a Savior,\nHero and villain, this is determinism\n\nCan't run away, run away\nCan't run away, from your destiny! \n\nCrushed by the mountain, dreading the blows,\nIt’s easy to lose yourself, devil knows:\n“God can’t hear you shouting, He’s deaf to your plea.\nJust take comfort He’s in control.\nEvery single sin, every single blow,\nGod gets all the glory from every single woe!”\n\nDid you ever stop to think for a moment, \nMaybe just maybe, He's not the problem?\nThat sin and evil are contrary,\nYet He attained the victory!\n\nCrushed by the mountain, dreading the blows,\nIt’s easy to lose yourself, God knows!\nHe hears you shouting, He hears your pleas.\nTake comfort in His victory!\n\nCan't run away, run away\nCan't run away, from His love! \n(Run home!)\n\nDid you ever stop to think for a moment, \nMaybe just maybe, He's not the problem?\nThat sin and evil are contrary,\nYet He attained the victory!\n\nTake comfort in His victory!\nEvery single sin, every single blow,\nHe redeems each and every single woe!\n\n\n#christian #music #christianmusic \n\n©️ Copyright 2024 Warren McGrew All Rights Reserved \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "title": "Inability - Come Let Us Reason",
    "description": "The Reformed doctrine of Total Depravity, also referred to as Total Inability, asserts that as a result of Adam's sin in Eden, all his progenty are born spiritually dead, under God's wrath, unable to rightly understand spiritual truths or respond positively to God - that everything that is man, from his flesh, to his will, soul and intellect is so stained by sin and corrupt that it cannot please God.\n\nTo remedy this condition, the adherent argues that God effectually regenerates his elect, giving them a new heart, new mind, the gift of faith and the ability to understand spiritual truth - specifically, only those truths He determined for them to understand. Other adherents of the doctrine claim God uses prevenient grace which makes people able to freely accept or reject God and spiritual truths.\n\nThere are numerous Biblical, Christological, Historical and Epistemological problems that arise. The latter is the focus for the lyrics of this song.\n\nThe Dilemma: \nIf you are created with faculties that cannot rightly understand spiritual truth, or respond positively to God, this negates the utilization of your God given faculties to reason and consider such truths. Consequently, you would be unable to have any confidence that you've actually been regenerated, as regeneration is itself a spiritual truth you were created unable to rightly understand.\n\nSo orthodox Christians reject Total Depravity and instead historically have affirmed that as a result of Adam's sin, mankind is mortal, subject to suffering and death, born into a sinful world which besets us, tempting and deceiving us, and we go astray into sin and rebellion - becoming sinful and guilty. We are created with God-given faculties of reason, so that we can interact with and consider truth. As God says in the Scriptures \"Come, let us reason together...\" So we can recognize our personal sins and guilt, repent, and KNOW we will be forgiven and restored by a gracious God who made us in His image and likeness, and wants ALL to be saved.\n\n#calvinism  #christian #music #reformedtheology \n\n©️ Copyright 2024 Warren McGrew All Rights Reserved \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "The tale of John Calvin (Jehan Cauvin) and Michael Servetus (Miguel Serveto) is pretty well-known among Christians and non-Christians alike. Controversy still swirls around the incident, with many critics of Calvinism claiming John Calvin murdered Servetus, while some Calvinists deny this charge, claim it was the State that executed him, or even argue heretics deserve death - while others in the Reformed Churches recognize the execution was unjust. In fact, in 1903 a committee from the Reformed Churches set up a granite monument to Servetus at the place of his death, stating:\n\n\"Respectful and grateful sons of Calvin, our great Reformer, but condemning an error which belonged to his century and firm believers in freedom of conscience according to the true principles of the Reformation and the Gospel, we have raised this expiatory monument.\"\n\nBut not all Calvinists are convicted thusly, as many call for Theonomy and a State run by the Church, with a desire to follow Calvin's strict totalitarian example.\n\n7 Years Before the Execution, Calvin wrote:\n\"If he [Servetus] comes [to Geneva], I shall never let him go out alive if my authority has weight.\"\n\nDuring the Incident, Calvin wrote:\n\"We have now new business in hand with Servetus. He intended perhaps passing through this city; for it is not yet known with what design he came. But after he had been recognized, I thought that he should be detained. My friend Nicolas summoned him on a capital charge. I hope that sentence of death will at least be passed upon him\"\n\nAfter the Execution:\n\"Many people have accused me of such ferocious cruelty that (they allege) I would like to kill again the man I have destroyed. Not only am I indifferent to their comments, but I rejoice in the fact that they spit in my face.\"\n\n\"Whoever shall now contend that it is unjust to put heretics and blasphemers to death will knowingly and willingly incur their very guilt.\n\nRelated:\nCalvin was so strict and stern, he preached that rebellious children should be executed, calling them monsters, and crafting laws to this effect. Consequently, not only were men and women frequently starved, beaten, maimed and executed in Geneva, but so too were children deemed to be rebellious. Thus, Calvin's defenders seem to ignore his other sins, in frequent appeal to the State authorities involvement in the matter. Yet, these apologists overlook the depth of involvement Calvin had is both crafting the laws and enforcing them.\n\nWhile the song has the line \"Where even the devil dared not go\", it is more accurate to say \"Where the devil was not needed, for Geneva had its very own.\"\n\nGeneva is to Calvinism, what the Mountain Meadows Massacre is to Mormonism... that is to say a manifestation of the rotten fruit of false teaching, which is frequently suppressed and dismissed by their followers.\n\n#calvinism #christian #music #reformedtheology \n\n©️ Copyright 2024 Warren McGrew All Rights Reserved \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Have you ever begun a Bible study only to struggle to understand what the text is saying, as it seems to conflict with something else you believe to be true? This is often due to presupposing an extra-Biblical systematic or presupposition onto the text. It can be very difficult to set aside such things and just let Scripture speak. \n\nAs we live in a culture permeated with Augustinian anthropology and Western Christian values, we often pick up beliefs by a form of osmosis, rather than disciplined study and thoughtful consideration. \n\nWe often hear \"I didn't become a Calvinist reading John Calvin. I just read my Bible.\" But with respect to our Calvinist brothers and sisters, they were indoctrinated into Calvinism, without having to read such things, as they listened and believed others who did so. You don't need to listen to John MacArthur, RC Sproul or James White, when you have a friend, family member or local pastor indoctrinating you into Calvinism.\n\nLYRICS:\n\n[Intro]\nI don’t know what’s wrong with my Bible\nI used to think that it was so reliable.\nWhat is wrong with me?\nWhy can’t I read, why can’t I read my Bible?\n\n\n[Verse]\nWoke up this morning for a quiet time\nCoffee, comfy shirt and some sunshine.\nAs the sun rose it dawned on me\nI replaced Scripture with Reformed Theology\n\n\n[Chorus]\nReformed Theology is now all I can see\nThe systematic is organized so neatly\nT-U-L-I-P is all I need\nSo I’ll just read that into my Bible, my Bible\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I learned about the doctrines of Grace\nI was sick to my stomach, offended and ashamed.\nBut over time, my senses wore down\nI surrendered my thoughts to the Reformed crowd\n\n\n[Verse]\nI don’t know what’s wrong with my Bible\nI used to think that it was so reliable.\nWhat is wrong with me?\nWhy can’t I read, why can’t I read my Bible?\n\n\n[Verse]\nHe said you have eyes but do not see\nCould He possibly be speaking of me?\nI overlay the text with an assumption\nBut what justifies such a presumption?\n\n\n[Chorus]\nReformed Theology is now all I can see\nThe systematic is organized so neatly\nT-U-L-I-P is all I need\nSo I’ll just read that into my Bible, my Bible\n\n#Calvinism #christian #music \n\n©️ Copyright 2024 Warren McGrew All Rights Reserved \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "We have friends and family that are Calvinists whom we love dearly. To be clear, not all Calvinists make such wilds claims to say God decreed all sin and evil to obtain, or that God damns infants to eternal torment. But some Calvinists do make these claims... Calvinists like James White of @AominOrg hold that due to being \"in Adam\" when Adam sinned, we are born guilty, spiritually dead and under God's wrath... that before God created the world, He decreed all sin and evil to obtain with specificity, and determined to only save some, the elect. Meanwhile the unelect, are eternally without hope. James White affirms there are unelect adults and infants.\n\nWhile these are disgusting beliefs and claims, they're the result of a consistent application of Reformed Theology and Augustinian anthropology (Total Depravity and Original Sin). Of course, we reject these teachings as they're contrary to Scripture and the early Church. For more on that check out our video on Total Depravity: https://www.youtube.com/live/TgfpaTMjgUw?si=OK-Q67t6zC8CJoUg\n\nThis song is perfect for our Radio Sovereign Geneva playlist, as it highlights some really atrocious beliefs held by some Calvinists. Its time to shine a light on these false and blasphemous claims. Far too many grieving parents have been told they can't trust God not to cast their deceased infant or young child into hell. This is spiritual, emotional and psychological abuse. God is good. He doesn't have unelect infants and He hasn't ordained all sin and evil to obtain with specificity.\n\nLyrics:\n\n[Verse 1]\nScrolling through Twitter and what do I see?\nAnother Calvinist pushing total depravity!\nBabies are sinners with hateful hearts\nVipers in diapers, delinquent from the start!\n\n[Chorus]\n(ooh-yeah)\nBorn under wrath, \nHated by God\nDoomed from the womb\nHeaded to hell\nBurn baby, burn\nUnelect child\nInfants for the pyre\nGod’s greatest glory\nGod’s greatest glory\n\n[Verse 2]\nI turn on YouTube and what do I see?\nAnother Calvinist redefining Sovereignty!\nGod decreed every instance of sin,\nChild abuse should be seen as a win.\n\n[Verse 3]\nI go on Facebook and what do I see?\nIt's James White’s total depravity!\nGod decreed Grape, God decreed sin\nGod damns babies and tosses them in!\n\n[Chorus]\n(ooh-yeah)\nBorn under wrath, \nHated by God\nDoomed from the womb\nHeaded to hell\nBurn baby, burn\nUnelect child\nInfants for the pyre\nGod’s greatest glory\nGod’s greatest glory\n\n#baalgate #grapegate #Calvinism \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Recently James White of @AominOrg debated Leighton Flowers of @Soteriology101 on the topic of Unconditional Election, specifically focused on John 6:44. \n\nLeading up to the debate, poor Doctor White was the victim of a vast Provisionist Conspiracy. In a show of brilliance few could even imagine possible, Provisionists plotted to bury a 38 second criticism of Infant Damnation in the middle of a 4 hour livestream - knowing full well that James would see it and be forced to comment on it. Thereby, James walked into their devious trap, exposing he affirmed infant damnation and was subsequently forced to spend weeks pretending he did not hold the position so as to make the conspiracy truly successful.\n\nThis maniacal plot was due to the likes of @IdolKiller @ProvisionistPerspective @BraxtonHunter @TheChurchSplit and yes @Soteriology101 \n\nYes, all of this was a ploy to distract poor Doctor White from preparing for his debate with Leighton nearly two months later, and allowing Leighton to cruelly raise this subject in the debate.\n\nHere James explains the events that led up to the debate and how he is the victim of this Provisionist Conspiracy.\n\n#christian #christianity #theology #debate \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "The Passion of the Christ was released on February 25, 2004 - marking this its 20th anniversary. As of 2023, the film is the highest grossing R-Rated film and the highest grossing Christian film (box office adjusted). It has seen its share of controversy over the years, chiefly centered on its portrayal of the brutality Christ suffered.\n\nPaul Vendredi joins Warren McGrew of Idol Killer in this review to consider the film's portrayal of Jesus' suffering, its underlying Anselmian Atonement Theories, contrasting this with historic depictions in various paintings and iconography, as well as other portrayals in film such as Ben Hur, and we consider its impact on Christian filmmaking and the culture at large.\n\nPaul Vendredi is a conservative Christian podcaster following the Eastern Orthodox tradition. Paul focuses his attention on theories of the Atonement with side interests in the counter-cult movement and patristics. Paul's podcast can be found at PaulVendredi.com. Paul also runs the YouTube channel @ChristianTheologicalArchive  which preserves out-of-print audio and video recordings on Christian topics.\n\nIf you're interested in learning how the Work of Christ has been understood by Christians since the early Church, or are interested in our critique of Penal Substitution, check out our playlist on this topic for more.\n\n#moviereview #christian #ThePassionofTheChrist #Atonement \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "James White of @AominOrg  issued another response to the ongoing controversy that's come to be known as #BaalGate releasing both a video and Tweet. In response to being challenged on his belief that some infants are un-elect and hell-bound, he lashed out wildly calling Warren McGrew a liar, disgusting and saying he needed to be born again. \n\nHow wild is that? If you believe God saves all infants, you need to be saved. \n\nInterestingly enough, James admitted the doctrine is based upon speculative theology stemming from His Augustinian/Calvinist/Reformed presuppositions. Yet, he claims those who reject it don't believe the Bible and are offended by God.\n\nI wonder if James will tell his fellow Calvinists who agree with Warren and Leighton Flowers of  the same thing? Will James tell Calvinists like John MacArthur he's not saved?\n\nNow, James is appealing to pastoral concerns in an effort to keep his views hidden away behind closed doors, rather than in the light of day as with a Formal Theological Debate. Yet, previously he was perfectly fine refuting ID, and then when his beliefs changed he was fine defending it publicly.\n\nHere, Warren responds to those statements made by James, exposing the numerous fallacious arguments, logical fallacies and overall bad behavior from the good doctor.\n\nYes, the song at the end (including the sum\n\n#BaalGate #Calvinism #christian \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "What happens to infants and young children that sadly pass away? Scripture tells us they go to be with the God who lovingly created them. However, some Augustinians (Calvinists, Catholics & Arminians) hold to the doctrine of infant damnation.\n\nRecently, Warren McGrew of Idol Killer went on @Soteriology101  with Leighton Flowers and Jordan Hatfield of @GreatLightStudios . There the topic of unelect children perishing came up, and Warren described the spirit behind it as being akin to those ancient pagan worshippers of Molech and Baal. #BaalGate \n\nWell, some Calvinists (like James White of @AominOrg  & Marlon Wilson of @tgtengage  and others) didn't take this too kindly. However, instead of offering a Biblical or philosophical defense of the doctrine, they clutched their pearls, called Warren a liar, claimed he rejected Scripture and twisted the Bible, told people he claimed Calvinists don't love their children and overall presented this as if Warren claimed all Calvinists affirmed infant damnation. Yet, anyone familiar with either the context of Warren's statements, or his teaching elsewhere should know - Warren has never argued this is monolithic. \n\nBut nevertheless, Christians across the internet began locking horns over infant damnation, as well as these misrepresentations. Some going so far as to demand Warren apologize, calling his statements a personal attack.\n\n\"Yes, I believe your babies go to heaven. No, I'm not the least bit sorry.\"\n\nEventually Warren, Leighton and Jordan met back up to offer a response, but this video should suffice as a highlight of the firestorm Warren's comments ignited.\n\nOriginal Soteriology 101 Discussion:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/iLKMdhmXEok?si=AVraYJ3nmPY4Dx2k\n\nJames White's Response:\nhttps://youtu.be/5v6tFAgkYlc?si=fdPUqDTiDxXxmmN1\n\nSoteriology 101 Response:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/HblO1ex4tJw?si=QPH8jYLpf4gcs4ME\n\nMarlon Wilson's Response:\nhttps://youtu.be/ZIKsy27owHI?si=NsFagEUJH3PKZlmX\n\n#Calvinism #Christianity #Debate \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Recently, Dr. Gavin Ortlund of @TruthUnites released a video entitled \"Why Believe in Divine Simplicity?\" where he offered three reasons in 5 minutes. Several viewers reached out, asking for my thoughts on the matter. So I brought on Dr. Ryan Mullins and Dr. Alan Rhoda to respond to Gavin's video with me.\n\nDivine Simplicity is the doctrine that all of God's attributes and actions are identical to God. As you will see, there are some major issues with Divine Simplicity that are so severe that Christians should not affirm it.\n\nThis being said, we like Gavin and our response is in no way intended to be mean spirited, but rather just a friendly in-house discussion among Christian brothers.\n\nCheck out Gavin's original video:\nhttps://youtu.be/c0zdB_xYwDw?si=YdwQ5N8AWCDz6hKZ\n\nAlso if you would like a copy of \"The Emotions of God\" by David Lamb, this link provides us a small commission: https://amzn.to/41UTYVP\n\n#DivineSimplicity #christianity #philosophy #apologetics \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "As we reflect on the birth and Work of Christ, how should we understand His salvific triumph? \n\nMatt and Billy of @BibleBrodown join Idol Killer to compare and contrast Christian Inclusivism with Carlton Pearson's \"Gospel of Inclusion\" (aka universalism or pluralism). Pearson taught everyone is saved and going to heaven; that no one need repent of sin or change their lives to be in keeping with some divine standard. Whereas Christian Inclusivism teaches God has made a way for all people, through Christ - that no one is saved apart from Him, and yes, not everyone will be saved.\n\nWhile the terms sound similar, the so-called \"Gospel of Inclusion\" and Christian Inclusivism are very different beliefs. Pearson jettisoned the Bible, arguing it was flawed writings of men about God; while Inclusivists affirm Scripture is Inspired by God Himself (2 Timothy 3:16-17).\n\n#Universalism #inclusion #inclusive #christian \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Somewhere outside the city of Geneva, on Earth 1689, it happened that a Calvinist Theologian was praying, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Pastor, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.” and he said to them: \n\n\"Oh Sovereign God, whom from all eternity, freely and unchangeably ordained whatsoever comes to pass, I thank you... I know you bring about all things in accordance with your will,... I know the evils of this world have NOT arisen by your mere permission, (or as a result of your patient call to repentance), but that YOU yourself bring about all evils for your glory and good pleasure,... I thank you for bringing evil into the world. I thank you for the brutality at Birkenau and at Auschwitz. I thank you for the terrible killings of Dennis Rader. I thank you for the brutality of war, and the countless widows and orphans it creates. I thank you for the perverse abuse of young children. I know these evil men were perfectly obeying your Sovereign will. I thank you. I see your gracious hand in the hurts others do to me, (like the Ford Focus that cut me off at the light this afternoon). I thank you. I thank you for my wife, and the abuse she inflicts upon our children while I’m away from the home. I know you did this to build mine and my children’s character. I thank you that its only been bruises and bloody noses. I know you saw fit to have my boss fire me from my job, during the holiday season, just as I know it was your Sovereign will that he hire Stephanie this past Spring and that we have an affair. I thank you for giving me an irresistible desire for red heads. Above all, I know it was your Sovereign hand keeping my wife ignorant of our illicit love making, (during our lunch break at the motel six). I thank you. I know that it was your perfect will that my neighbor got drunk and took his own life this morning, just as it was your perfect will that I was distracted on my cell phone and backed the car over his son last week. I thank you. I know you've regenerated me and elected me unto salvation, and while I'm unsure about my wife and children's eternal destiny, I thank you. Please bless this food to the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it, or don't. Whatever your Sovereign will is. Thank you, and amen!”\n\n#calvinism #satire #parody \n\nIn this video we learn how to pray like an Honest Calvinist from men like John MacArthur of@gracetoyou RC Sproul of @ligonier James White of @AominOrg Voddie Baucham of@gfbc1689 and others. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Balthasar Hubmaier (1480–1528) was an influential German Anabaptist leader and one of the most well-known and respected Anabaptist theologians of the Reformation.\n\nIn the closing of his work entitled \"Freedom of the Will\" he laid out a very strong argument against theistic determinism and fatalism which are the undercurrent of Augustinian philosophy and Calvinist \"Sovereignty\".\n\nBoth he and his wife were seized by the Austrian authorities and taken to Vienna. \n\n\n\"I may err – I am a man,\" he wrote, \"but a heretic I cannot be, because I ask constantly for instruction in the word of God.\"\n\nHe suffered torture on the rack, and was tried for heresy and convicted. On 10 March 1528, he was taken to the public square and executed by burning. His wife exhorted him to remain steadfast.

    "description": "Across his six videos defending PSA and criticizing those who don't affirm this doctrine, Mike made some pretty charged comments. As he perceives PSA as the heart of Christianity and the Gospel, he received challenges to this doctrine as though they were challenging the Work of Christ itself.\n\nThus, Mike placed critics of PSA into two categories: lying, liberal, progressive, poop-faces who have stripped away the true meaning of the cross in an effort to create a god in their own image and deceive others in the process... or those who have been deceived and are too ignorant to accept PSA and should have just trusted their Bible. \n\nThis brief video is intended to highlight some of Mike's statements, so we are not accused of inventing these out of thin air. Yes, there is a context in which he said these things and you can watch his entire series via the links provided below and determine for yourself the merit of Mike's claims and ours.\n\nWe do not view PSA as a litmus test to determine who is a Christian and who isn't. We do have strong reasons for rejecting the doctrine, as we discussed in our 15 Part series responding to him.\n\nWe are conservative, Bible believing Christians who respect Christian history. As noted in our response series, we love and appreciate Mike and his ministry. This is just one of those areas where we must disagree.\n\n#PenalSubstitution #Atonement #MikeWinger\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMike's Teaching on PSA:\n\n▶️ The Real History of Penal Substitutionary Atonement\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/O4bTHScjdEo?feature=share\n\n▶️ Where The Old Testament Teaches Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/EBTkCdB5GV0?feature=share\n\n▶️ This Is How The Cross Works\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/QZjQe8QkV7w?feature=share\n\n▶️ What Romans Really Tells Us About the Cross and How it Saves\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/ws7EAfoKQEI?feature=share\n\n▶️ They Are Trying to Shame Us out of Good Theology by Misrepresenting Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/OzYQSh0SK2o?feature=share\n\n▶️ Answering The TOUGHEST Objections to Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/la0SkKC091s?feature=share\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Episode 15/15\n\nDoes Penal Substitutionary Atonement portray God as unjust? Yes. Yes, it does. However, Mike Winger has produced six videos in defense of Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA), claiming there is no such injustice in PSA; it is perfectly acceptable for the innocent to be punished in the place of the guilty.  \n\nIn this episode we provide quotes from @MikeWinger, as well as clips & quotes from various theologians and individuals such as William Lane Craig @ReasonableFaithOrg, John Dominic Crossan, Wayne Grudem, Walter Martin, Worley Oscar Vaught, James White @AominOrg, James MacDonald, Hank Hanegraaff, Edwin Barnhart, Marshall Eakin; demonstrating that Penal Substitution is not Biblical nor an essential doctrine of the Christian faith.\n\nThis series of videos intends to offer a respectful response & counter-argument to the claims Mike has made. It is our contention that he is the one who is engaging in historical revisionism, & an anachronistic handling of the materials. Though, we do not believe he is doing so intentionally, but rather the result of a bias which has left him far from objective.\n\n\"Does Penal Substitution make God unjust?\" The Biblical answer is an emphatic, \"Yes!\"\n\n#PenalSubstitution #Atonement #MikeWinger\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBooks Referenced in this video:\n\n📚 Atonement and the Death of Christ\nhttps://amzn.to/46moxG7\n\n📚 Systematic Theology\nhttps://amzn.to/43L0yOT\n\n📚 Essential Christianity\nhttps://amzn.to/3NCf46c\n\n📚 Politics - According to the Bible\nhttps://amzn.to/3Jfyjja\n\nIdol Killer receives a small commission on purchases which use the above links.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMike's Teaching on PSA:\n\n▶️ The Real History of Penal Substitutionary Atonement\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/O4bTHScjdEo?feature=share\n\n▶️ Where The Old Testament Teaches Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/EBTkCdB5GV0?feature=share\n\n▶️ This Is How The Cross Works\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/QZjQe8QkV7w?feature=share\n\n▶️ What Romans Really Tells Us About the Cross and How it Saves\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/ws7EAfoKQEI?feature=share\n\n▶️ They Are Trying to Shame Us out of Good Theology by Misrepresenting Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/OzYQSh0SK2o?feature=share\n\n▶️ Answering The TOUGHEST Objections to Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/la0SkKC091s?feature=share\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTimestamps:\n\n2:15 Mike Winger, Attorney at Law\n4:17 Winger Waffles\n7:30 Is PSA Unjust?\n9:47 WLC on Atonement\n12:24 Its ok to kill the innocent\n16:20 Two views on Christ's Life in PSA \n22:06 Voluntary Piñata\n29:26 Edwin Barnhart\n32:26 Power to Pay\n34:17 PSA, Anselm & Eutychianism \n36:52 Imputation\n41:09 Legal Fiction\n46:24 Conquest of the Americas\n52:27 The Thumbprint of God\n58:20 Law School\n1:02:54 Human Law vs Divine Law  \n1:08:29 Code Vs Common Law\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

However, as we document here, that is precisely what PSA entails. \n\n@MikeWinger seemingly is rejecting several entailments of PSA, while simultaneously seeking to affirm and maintain it as a cohesive model.

    "description": "Episode 9/15\n\nIn this, our 9th Episode responding to claims Mike Winger has made regarding Penal Substitution, we consider PSA's Pagan parallels.\n\nMike has argued that Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) isn't like pagan human sacrifice, as the victim (Jesus) goes willingly. However, here we point out this is actually common among pagan human sacrificial systems. We also explore the parallels in more detail, noting the problems with the claims Mike Winger made.\n\nIt is our contention the passages of Scripture @MikeWinger & the Early Church Fathers he references do NOT teach PSA.

    "description": "Episode 8/15\n\nContinuing response to Mike Winger's claims regarding Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA), we consider his fallacious arguments. The fallacy of hypostatized proof (Reification) is when an abstraction is treated as though it were the event itself. This episode seeks to demonstrate Mike Winger's repeated reliance upon such fallacious reasoning.\n\nTo date, Mike has produced six lengthy videos defending PSA while simultaneously claiming Christians who do not accept his Atonement Theory do so by way of misrepresenting the facts, engaging in historical revisionism & teaching unBiblical views of how we are saved. He insists PSA is the heart of Christianity and the Gospel. \n\nWith respect to @MikeWinger, it is our contention that he is the one who is engaging in historical revisionism, & an anachronistic handling of the materials. Though, we do not believe he is doing so intentionally, but rather the result of a bias which has left him far from objective.\n\nIn this episode we provide several quotes from Mike, as well as a clip from James White @AominOrg and numerous passages of Scripture.\n\n\"Is Penal Substitution True?\" The answer is clearly, \"No!\"\n\n#PenalSubstitution #Atonement #MikeWinger\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMike's Teaching on PSA:\n\n▶️ The Real History of Penal Substitutionary Atonement\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/O4bTHScjdEo?feature=share\n\n▶️ Where The Old Testament Teaches Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/EBTkCdB5GV0?feature=share\n\n▶️ This Is How The Cross Works\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/QZjQe8QkV7w?feature=share\n\n▶️ What Romans Really Tells Us About the Cross and How it Saves\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/ws7EAfoKQEI?feature=share\n\n▶️ They Are Trying to Shame Us out of Good Theology by Misrepresenting Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/OzYQSh0SK2o?feature=share\n\n▶️ Answering The TOUGHEST Objections to Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/la0SkKC091s?feature=share\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotable Timestamps:\n\n1:58 Fallacy of Hypostatized Proof Defined\n2:32 Mike commits the FoHP\n8:46 The Law is not compatible w/ PSA\n15:58 The Psalms are not compatible w/ PSA\n26:12 The Prophets are not compatible w/ PSA\n32:17 \"I gave you no command\"\n33:34 Isaiah 53\n38:29 1 Peter 3:14-18\n39:49 1 Peter 4:1-2\n41:19 Work of Christ Models\n47:56 James White on Models\n51:31 The Intent of the Author vs Presuppositions\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Episode 3/15 \n\nContinuing our response to Mike Winger's defense of Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA), we address his claim Athanasius taught PSA by examining his actual writings on the work of Christ.\n\nAs in past responses, we will continue to provide quotes from @MikeWinger, as well as clips & quotes from various men such as James White @AominOrg, Wayne Grudem, RC Sproul Sr @ligonier, Todd White @ToddWhiteLC, RC Sproul Jr, Alex Metherell & Brian Zahnd @WOLCTV.  \n\nThis series of videos intends to provide Mike Winger with a respectful response & counter-argument. While he has asserted those who deny PSA do so by misrepresentation && an anachronistic handling of the data, it is our contention that he is the one who has done this very thing - albeit, we do not believe he has done so intentionally. Instead, we believe Mike's sincerely mistaken; the result of his imposing a bias onto the data.\n\n\"Did Athanasius Teach Penal Substitution?\" The answer is a resounding, \"No!\"\n\n#PenalSubstitution #Atonement #MikeWinger\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBooks Referenced in this video:\n\n📚 On the Incarnation: Saint Athanasius\nhttps://amzn.to/3ZIAvFH\n\nIdol Killer receives a small commission on purchases which use the above links.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMike's Teaching on PSA:\n\n▶️ The Real History of Penal Substitutionary Atonement\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/O4bTHScjdEo?feature=share\n\n▶️ Where The Old Testament Teaches Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/EBTkCdB5GV0?feature=share\n\n▶️ This Is How The Cross Works\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/QZjQe8QkV7w?feature=share\n\n▶️ What Romans Really Tells Us About the Cross and How it Saves\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/ws7EAfoKQEI?feature=share\n\n▶️ They Are Trying to Shame Us out of Good Theology by Misrepresenting Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/OzYQSh0SK2o?feature=share\n\n▶️ Answering The TOUGHEST Objections to Penal Substitution\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/la0SkKC091s?feature=share\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:45 Mike's 14 Patristic Sources\n2:20 Modus Tollens\n4:44 Pretending Athanasius held PSA (w James White)\n5:58 Making Thomas Aquinas Protestant (w/ Norman Geisler)\n7:52 Claiming Athanasius was a PSA Protestant (w/ James White)\n9:28 Reconciling James White's conflicting statements\n16:56 Athanasius on the need for a public death\n18:04 Athanasius, why Jesus died a public & shameful death\n21:04 Athanasius, Jesus died to destroy the power of the devil\n23:05 Athanasius, Christ as an icon of human unity\n23:59 Athanasius, Christ as an icon of indivisibility\n24:37 A review of Athanasius' view of the Crucifixion\n26:33 Wayne Grudem, why the crucifixion?\n30:04 R.C.

    "description": "How should we understand God's knowledge of and relationship to future events? Chris Fisher of @realityisnotoptional joins Idol Killer to discuss various models and specifically a recent Idol Killer community post:\n\nQuestion: \nDoes God know what horse will you ride three days before Thanksgiving 2028?\n\nSolution 1. \nGod from all eternity determined you to ride the Palomino, so He will effectually bring it to pass. Thus, He knows what you will do, because He will ensure you do it.\n\nSolution 2. \nGod created all time and actions such that sequence is an illusion; past, present and future are all equal existing realities. As such a temporal counterpart of yourself has always ridden the Appaloosa. God knows this, because He created it this way. The you reading this right now, will never ride the Appaloosa, but your temporal counterpart is forever.\n\nSolution 3. \nGod looked at all possible worlds and for some reason really wanted to actualize the world where you will certainly ride a Thoroughbred. In another world you could've ridden any other horse, or chosen not to ride a horse, but in this world you will always choose to ride the Thoroughbred because God determined you to when He created this world.\n\nSolution 4.\nYes, God knows what horse you will ride or won't. We don't know how or why, and we don't like to consider all the problems this claim creates, like seemingly entailing all things obtain necessarily due to God's perfect knowledge of settled future events. We appeal to mystery.\n\nSolution 5. \nThe matter of if you will or won't ride a horse is as of yet indeterminate. Why must you ride a horse 3 days before Thanksgiving 2028? God hasn't created it as an existing reality equal to past and present, nor has He effectually decreed it to obtain and committed Himself to bringing it to pass, nor have you determined to ride a horse, nor is the future so linear that it is inevitable you will ride a horse. Neither the past nor the future exist. When the matter is settled, God will know this perfectly because His knowledge of reality is perfect... until then He knows this as indeterminate, because again His knowledge of reality is perfect.\n\n#Foreknowledge #Omniscience #Christianity \n\nIf you're interested in the various views of Divine Foreknowledge and would like to learn more, consider the following resources:\n\n📚 Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views\nhttps://amzn.to/3oLuMlK  \n\n📚 Four Views on Divine Providence\nhttps://amzn.to/3IUqU8K\n\n(Idol Killer receives a small commission on purchases which use the above links.)\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Omnipotence is dead.\n\nAt least according to a recent argument put forward by Thomas J Oord in his latest book the Death of Omnipotence and the Birth of Amipotence.\n\nThere, Oord argues Omnipotence has no biblical support, dying a death of a thousand qualifications in philosophy. Further Oord points to the problem of pain and evil as reasons to reject Omnipotence. However, he argues the death of omnipotence is not the death of God.\n\nJoining Idol Killer to discuss the concept and claims surrounding Oord's views on Amipotence is none other than Thomas J Oord and Ryan Mullins.\n\nThomas Jay Oord, Ph.D., is a theologian, philosopher, and scholar of multi-disciplinary studies. Oord directs the Center for Open and Relational Theology and doctoral students at Northwind Theological Seminary. He is an award-winning author and has written or edited more than thirty books. A gifted speaker, Oord lectures at universities, conferences, churches, and institutions. He is known for his contributions to research on love, science and religion, open and relational theology, the problem of suffering, and the implications of freedom for transformational relationships. ✈️ Visit his website: thomasjayoord.com\n\n📚 The Death of Omnipotence and Birth of Amipotence\nhttps://amzn.to/3pmPLuW\n(Idol Killer receives a small commission on purchases which use the above links.)\n\nR.T. Mullins, PhD., has published over 30 essays on various topics in philosophical theology related to models of God, philosophy of time, personal identity, the problem of evil, disability theology, the Trinity, and the incarnation. He has published two books, The End of the Timeless God (Oxford University Press, 2016) and God and Emotion (Cambridge University Press, 2020).

This video comes by way of a special request from a viewer... yes, it is a parody... yes it mocks that horrendous doctrine of Total Depravity.\n\nWe hope you got a chuckle out of it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWasher's original quote:\n\nImagine for a moment an 18-month old baby that you are holding in your arms, and that 18-month old baby sees that shining watch on your wrist, and he grabs for your watch, and you pull his hand away and say, “No.” He begins to cry and move about in your arms. He reaches for the watch again, you grab his hand and say, “No.” He begins to scream and cry. He reaches for the watch again, you say, “No.” He begins to flail his arms even in the direction of your face. I submit to you that if that 18-month old baby had the strength of an 18-year old man, he would slaughter you there where you stand, father, rip the watch off your arm and walk across your bloody body, out the door without feeling an ounce of remorse. \n\nYou see, here is something you need to understand: Hitler was not an anomaly. Hitler was not a phenomenon. Hitler was what everyone in this room has the potential of being. And not only that, you need to understand, even in all the wickedness of Hitler, Hitler was still restrained by the common grace of God. And you need to know this, that if it were not for the common grace of God restraining you in your unconverted state, you would make Hitler look like a choir boy. What we do not understand is what Scripture teaches about men: Men are evil. \n\nYou say, “Well I don’t agree.” That’s because you’ve grabbed enough of Christianity to stand, but you don’t believe the Bible. The Scripture’s testimony against you, and all men, is that we are born with evil, and we are evil. Do you have to teach a child to lie? Do you have to teach a child to be self-centered? Do you have to teach a child to be selfish? Do you have to teach a child to be brutal to other children? They learn that on their own. Set them free, discipline them not, and see what you have in 10 years – a monster. Why? Because what Scripture says is true. And you hold your ears and you say, “I don’t want to hear it! I don’t want to hear it!” In the same way that a person dying of cancer is in denial and says to the doctor, “I don’t want to hear it! I don’t want to hear it!” That by cupping the hands over your ears, you close yourself off from any remedy.\n\nThe first thing you must embrace is this: All men are born in sin, and given over to sin; and all men are born hating God.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#PaulWasher #TotalDepravity #Calvinism \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

Voddie, like all Augustinians, holds a view of inherited or imputed sin and guilt which is at odds with the text of Scripture.\n\nThis is but a short compilation intending to highlight his absurd claims and note the dangers such beliefs can entail; particularly with regard to how Total Depravity can lead to child abuse. Moreover, in telling people they sin because they're a sinner, this doctrine makes sin natural, numbing the conscience to remorse, while claiming repentance is impossible.\n\nIt is our hope that such a presentation provokes adherents of Augustinian philosophy to be good Bereans and search the Scriptures on this matter.\n\n▶️ Voddie Baucham: Total Depravity \nhttps://youtu.be/qPV8LOQHKxA  \n\n▶️ Voddie Baucham: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil \nhttps://youtu.be/Yaj7tBY2UGI\n\n#OriginalSin #TotalDepravity #SinNature \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

So who was Augustine, what did he believe and why did he have a pet hippo?\n\nAugustine was a former Manichean convert to Christianity. Regrettably, he let his his former Manichean beliefs influence his understanding of Scripture, filtering it through his neo-Platonist philosophical commitment. He built upon pre-existing errors, tweaking and repackaging them into what would come to be known as the doctrine of Original Sin.\n\nA summary of some of his more outlandish beliefs:\n\n1. Unbaptized infants go to hell due to Adam's sin, but it isn't as hot for them as it is for adults; though some baptized infants also go to hell.\n\n2. Being intimate with your wife for pleasure is worse than with a \"lady of the night\".\n\n3. The use of violence to force conversion to Christianity is acceptable.\n\n4. The use of contraception in marriage is adultery.\n\n5. Only those trained in the sciences approved by Augustine should be allowed to teach theology.\n\nAugustine's influence on Christianity cannot be understated.

    "description": "TYLER VELA RENOUNCES CHRIST\n\nRecently Calvinist YouTuber and Podcaster, Tyler Vela of @TheFreedThinkerPodcast publicly renounced his faith in Christ. As regular viewers of this channel are aware, Warren and Tyler have often disagreed and locked horns in online and formal debate.\n\nTo be crystal clear, in no way should this video be seen as dunking on Tyler or celebrating his walking away from Christianity. Rather, this is somewhat of a sympathetic rebuke and encouragement for him.\n\nThis video is NOT calling Tyler to return to the god of neo-Platonism... he’s clearly still following him. This is NOT calling Tyler to return to god as he understood Him in Calvinism. Rather, this video is calling Tyler to consider the reason he cried out to God for comfort in the first place; that this innate need for a transcendent comfort points to a transcendent Comforter... Tyler's need for transcendent love points to a transcendent Lover… not a static, unfeeling, un-relational concept as he's experienced in neo-Platonism.\n\nTyler’s admitted need for comfort shows he was looking in the wrong place - not that it was wrong to look… not that it was wrong to realize that place was empty… but an encouragement to keep looking.\n\n\nTyler called the God presented in the Bible, absent neo-Platonism, a Hebraic Mega-Zeus and that may be a cute or effective form of rhetoric for some, but this video is an invitation for Tyler to ponder is how comforted David was by this God when he lost his child… How Jesus came because of God’s love for the world… to consider the care with which God clothed Adam and Eve after they introduced sin, suffering and death by their rebellion… to consider the early martyrs who sang while being burned alive and devoured by lions… to consider the Living and relational God of the Bible does indeed comfort… unlike the god he found wanting.\n\n\nI love you Tyler… I disagree with you now, as I have previously… but God is better than the both of us… and I pray you come to know Him in a truly profound way.\n\n\nYa’ll lift this man up in prayer… God bless.\n\n\n#TylerVela #Deconversion #Apostasy \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n💡 About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "RESPONDING TO BILL FORTENBERRY'S CRITICISM OF IDOL KILLER'S VIDEO ON IS OPEN THEISM ATHEISM\n\nBill Fortenberry, a Christian philosopher and historian, recently posted a review critical of a video response Idol Killer made to Anthony Rogers.\n\nWatch that video here:  https://youtu.be/eJGfKgNhVXc\n\nTo be fair to Mr. Fortenberry, he seemingly did not share Mr. Rogers' view that Open Theism is a form of atheism. Some of Mr. Fortenberry's criticism was unjustified, some understandable, and some even deserved. For instance, in his article Mr. Fortenberry attacked the video's production quality and content:\n\n\"The video is difficult to watch. It is an amateurish conglomeration of clips, texts, and sounds with very little consistency.\" Bill Fortenberry\n\nSo clearly not all of Mr. Fortenberry's criticism was unfounded. The video most certainly is, and rather unashamedly so, amateurish and difficult to watch... we claim this was intentional and simply call it our \"style\".\n\nRegardless, there were some points of criticism that were in error, so Dr. Alan Rhoda came on the program to respond. This seemed fair, as in his article Mr. Fortenberry criticized comments Dr. Rhoda made in the Idol Killer video. \n\nNot surprisingly, at points Dr. Rhoda agreed with Mr. Fortenberry that Warren's comments were imprecise, brutish and needed refinement. Nevertheless, Dr. Rhoda did note several points made by Mr. Fortenberry were simply in error.\n\nFor more from Dr. Rhoda, visit his blog:  http://www.alanrhoda.net \n\nThis video is intended to be a somewhat lighthearted response to the claims and challenges made by Bill Fortenberry, and certainly not meanspirited. Like our poor production quality, our sense of humor is amateurish and difficult to understand... and for the record, Warren is the cute one. We know this because he tells himself this in the mirror twenty times every morning.\n\nTo read Mr. Fortenberry's article in full:  http://www.increasinglearning.com/blog/open-theism-video?fbclid=IwAR0Xjjh_w6od8mSvf4NtnrM_eSq2tS3gqQYjNx5KkqJElTTrzHguYB2eXdw\n\n#opentheism #dynamicomniscience #christianphilosophy \n\n------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "DARRELL BROOKS SUGGESTS GOD CAUSED HIS ACTIONS\n\nDarrell Brooks was charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 71 other counts due to driving his SUV into the Waukesha Christmas Parade on Nov. 21, 2021. After rejecting council and electing to defend himself in court, on October 26. 2022, the jury found him guilty of the charges against him.\n\nIn this brief video, we analyze comments he made during his closing remarks, suggesting this was all due to God's will, and how this view of Theistic Determinism helped him shift the burden of his actions from himself onto God.\n\nTheistic Determinism is the view that God determines every event that occurs in the history of the world. While many Christians hold to such a view, it is essential this be pointed out... Theistic Determinism is NOT in keeping with Christian Orthodoxy and is a variation of fatalism. While God does intervene at times, directing the course of human history, it is false to assert He has effectually decreed whatsoever comes to pass. Rather, God formed man in His image and likeness and bestowed upon him the gift of self-determination.\n\nAs we see in this brief video, Theistic Determinism allows one to shift the guilt of their actions from themselves onto God. Perpetrators of evil are held accountable precisely because they were free and capable of doing other than what they did.\n\nLives were lost and people suffered due to the free actions Darrell Brooks took. He and he alone is guilty for the evil he perpetrated.\n\n#darrellbrooks #trial #waukesha",

In this video we present Derek's comments with Doug, as well as Warren's and even James White's take on the whole thing.\n\nWe ask the question, why give an atheist the anti-Gospel - why tell them they can't believe, repent and trust in Christ but must sit around hoping they're elect and God eventually zaps them with regeneration, enabling them to believe? Why must Calvinists engage in such an exercise in futility? \n\nWarren also points out some really bad argumentation from James and concludes with a simplified presentation of the Good News, that God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish.\n\n#Gospel #Calvinism #Atheism \n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "THE UNIVERSAL NEED FOR LOVE SERVES AS EVIDENCE FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE, INFORMING US ABOUT WHO HE IS.\n\nIn this brief video, we discuss how love is essential for human flourishing - how love is transcendent and points us to a transcendent lover: God.\n\nIt's a sad thing to go through life unloved and unappreciated. At times our parents, siblings, friends, significant other - they fail to love or appreciate us. To be fair, we can be guilty of the same.\n\nYet, something in each of us deeply desires to love and be known... to love and to know the heart of another.\n\nLove is just as important to human flourishing as clean water, shelter, healthy food and healthcare. It's a universal need. \n\nYet, love is transcendent. Like consciousness, love is beyond the material universe. I am convinced that our transcendent need for love is evidence of a transcendent lover. God.\n\nSuch a thing merely serves as a reason, a marker - pointing us to God. However, it also reveals something about the nature of God as well: that He made us to love and be loved, that He is relational.\n\nSo it seems to me that understanding love is a good starting point in coming to know the heart of God.\n\nNow critics will point to differing conceptions of love or the fickle nature of hormones and chemical reactions, drawing us back to the material world, failing to address the transcendent nature of love.\n\nHuman love can fail. This isn't in dispute. After all, this was my starting point. However, the universal need for transcendent love calls us to direct our hearts homeward... to recognize we are loved and to properly direct our love to He who will not fail.\n\n\"Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous; love does not brag, it is not arrogant. It does not act disgracefully, it does not seek its own benefit; it is not provoked, does not keep an account of a wrong suffered, it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; it keeps every confidence, it believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails...\" 1 Corinthians 13:4‭-‬8\n\nSo tell us about this loving God!\n\n“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.\" John 3:16‭-‬17\n\nIn the Bible Jesus tells us the greatest commandment is to love God... and the second is like this - to love others.\n\nOr to quote to Smiths...\n\n\"I am human and I need to be loved\nJust like everybody else does...\"\n\n#GodisLove #WhatisLove #Christianity \n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

Anthony put forward several claims, begging the question for fatalism and the settled future, arguing this IS the Christian view and all views entailing an Open premise are damnable heresy... and in doing so, he condemned his own tradition, Calvinism.\n\nIn this episode you'll hear from ACTUAL Open Theists like Greg Boyd, William Hasker and Alan Rhoda as well as respected Molinist philosopher Ryan Mullins as they lay out the unique claims of Open Theism.\n\nThis response intends to correct some really, REALLY, no good, super bad, terrible, odious and downright faulty criticism of the open position.

    "description": "FOREKNOWLEDGE & PREDESTINATION ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CALVINISM (OR CLASSICAL THEISM AT LARGE).\n\nIn this brief video, Anthony Rogers and Edward Dalcour both affirm that God lacks literal foreknowledge and has never literally predestined anything. This of course seemingly breaks the Calvinist's \"Golden Chain of Redemption\".\n\nWhy would they make such an assertion and hold to contradictory tenets? Because of their commitment to God being atemporal. They claim such terms are meaningless anthropomorphism wherein God condescends to the Biblical authors as they were less intelligent than the Platonists.\n\nWhat does it mean to be atemporal, you ask? It means to be timeless... not merely eternal and without beginning or end, but lacking activity, sequence, absent any temporal location, duration or extension... static, frozen and immobile... completely unrelated to temporal events and the created realm. This concept arises not from Scripture, but Platonist philosophy. Rather, Scripture speaks of God in terms of endless time, or ages of ages, and affirms His sequential operations as it directly connects such things with Him being the Living God.\n\nlink to the full video: https://youtu.be/H-tuwfhEjIY\n\n#foreknowledge #predestination #Calvinism\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "ANTHONY ROGERS RUNS FROM DEBATE, WHILE NAME CALLING & LYING\n\nIn September of 2021, Anthony Rogers produced a video attacking all open (non-Fatalistic) positions as non-Christian. Specifically, Rogers attacked Dynamic Omniscience (DO). \n\nWarren McGrew of Idol Killer reached out to Anthony and offered to debate the topic with him, in an effort to set the record straight and demonstrate DO's place within Scripture and Christian orthodoxy. Initially, Anthony agreed and the debate was set for October... then January. One week prior to the debate Rogers canceled, asking that it be postponed. The debate host & moderator, Marlon Wilson w/ the Gospel Truth, then attempted to reschedule the debate. Dates in March and May were offered, but Rogers refused to respond or reschedule.\n\nRecently, a viewer of Roger's program asked him if he intended to debate Warren. Rogers claimed to be busy and further attacked and lied about Warren, claiming he was rejecting Christ.\n\nAt no point has Warren rejected Christ. Rather, Warren has argued against fatalism. Anthony knows this, but finds it easier to call Warren a heretic, a Christ denier and other names than to actually engaged him in debate.\n\nWill this debate ever take place? That's up to Anthony. He need only invest about 15 minutes to schedule it, should he be willing.\n\n#AnthonyRogers #Omniscience #Debate\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "TYLER VELA VS WARREN MCGREW DEBATE\n\nRecently Warren McGrew of Idol Killer debated Tyler Vela of the Freed Thinker Podcast to debate whether or not God Possesses Dynamic Omniscience, meaning does God possess active awareness and complete knowledge based in a temporally present perception of reality?\n\nMake Exegesis Great Again! \n\nFor his part, Warren provided passages of Scripture showing God thinks, has intelligence and actively uses wisdom. However, Tyler argued God doesn't think; that accepting the depictions of God in Scripture as anything but analogical is to worship a Hebraic Mega-Zeus. So the Biblical support Warren provided was simply dismissed and not engaged. Warren also cited the statements of men like Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Ignatius and Aristides who all affirmed God's active omniscience and Tyler dismissed these as well. Warren provided philosophical arguments and here too, Tyler rejected them and instead chose to misrepresent Warren's view, attack strawmen and bring up irrelevant issues instead.\n\nThis video provides a brief overview of all this and addresses some misrepresentations and misunderstandings in an attempt to set the record straight.\n\nWHAT IS DYNAMIC OMNISCIENCE?\n\nDynamic Omniscience is a new term for an old belief in the Living God. It is defined as God’s active awareness and complete knowledge based in a temporally present perception of reality; accounting for the various epistemic categories of knowledge in light of its cognate expressions.\n\nIt’s quite a mouthful… but, it rests upon 4 essential Christian beliefs: \n\n1. God is living\n2. God is free\n3. Sin is rebellion\n4. Jesus IS resurrected\n\nThe original debate can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/FDfSHEZTs4s\n\n#Dynamic #Omniscience #Debate\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "#PenalSubstitution #PSA #Atonement\n\nDID JESUS FULFILL ALL THE OLD TESTAMENT SACRIFICES & SAVE US FROM GOD?\n\nThis is the 7th and final episode in a 7 Part Series exploring the doctrine of Penal Substitutionary Atonement, abbreviated as PSA. Here, we detail and review the claims 16 through 17 and the problems they face both with Scripture and the other claims of this Atonement Theory. \n\nDid Jesus fulfill ALL the Old Testament Sacrifices? Did Jesus save us from God, from the devil, or from the grave - how should the ransom be understood?\n\nJoining Idol Killer throughout the entirety of this series is Paul Vendredi, who himself produced a long running podcast detailing PSA's claims and problems. \n\n--------\n\nThe 17 Claims of Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA).\n\n1. Adam’s federal headship of humanity makes all mankind guilty of his sin. (Augustine) \n2. Thanks to the transmission of original sin, mankind is now totally depraved. (Augustine) \n3. Even infants, innocent of actual sin, are guilty of original sin. (Augustine) \n4. This sin, apparently so minor, infinitely offends God because the gravity of an offense depends on the status of the one offended. (Anselm) \n5. All sin is to be understood as a debt that we owe God for the crime of having dishonored him. (Anselm) \n6. Even infants owe this debt. (Anselm) \n7. In the Old Testament era, God insists that this debt be paid by one’s shedding an innocent animal’s blood. (Aquinas & Atonement School) \n8. God could have redeemed man by the simple act of willing it... (Anselm) \n9. ...But God cannot forgive a sin without first punishing the sinner. (Anselm) \n10. Not only must the redemption mirror the fall, but it must also be as painful as possible since the fall was so easy. (Anselm) \n11. Only the death of a god-man is worthy to serve as recompense to God for his offended honor. (Anselm) \n12. Christ becomes incarnate so that his humanity can suffer as a substitute for us. (Anselm) \n13. God pours out his wrath and judgment upon the crucified Christ, imputing mankind’s wickedness to Christ and Christ’s righteousness to mankind. Man thereby becomes positionally righteous; Christ becomes positionally wicked. This imputation is a legal declaration, not an actual change in nature. (Atonement School) \n14. Bearing the imputed sins of all humanity, the crucified Christ becomes the embodiment of sin and a literal curse. (Atonement School) \n15. God, too holy to look upon sin, turns his back on Christ, abandoning him, judging him, and in effect driving him out of the Trinity—God damns Christ. (Atonement School) \n16. As the perfect, unblemished offering, Christ’s sacrificial death appeases God’s wrath once and for all, ransoming us from the wrath of God and bringing an end to the Old Testament sacrificial system, as symbolized by the tearing of the temple veil. (Anselm, Atonement School) \n17. Thus, Christ’s death ransoms humanity from God’s wrath.

    "title": "Jesus Became Sin on a Tree - Todd White",
    "description": "TODD WHITE BELIEVES JESUS BECAME SIN ON THE CROSS.\n\nRecently Todd White of Lifestyle Christianity recently gave a controversial sermon. It was so shocking that it was soon removed from his YouTube channel. In the video, White gave his interpretation of 2 Corinthians 5:17-21... specifically focusing on the portion where \"Jesus became sin\" for us. This Todd seemingly took to mean Jesus literally \"became sin on a tree\".\n\nCalvinists and Reformed teachers and preachers were pretty quick to jump on him for such statements, and his stunning examples. They claimed he was unregenerate, lost, unsaved, a false teacher, a heretic, etc.\n\nYet, none of White's detractors seemingly take issue with other Calvinists for asserting the same thing. Men like RC Sproul taught that Jesus became sin incarnate, a mass of sin, became a literal curse, etc... and Charles Spurgeon noted how men cannot exchange their sin with another, but this is possible for God.\n\nSo why are Calvinists condemning White as an unbeliever and turning a blind eye to their own teachers who White apparently learned this from?\n\nAlso in this video are comments from Justin Peters, a Calvinist Preacher, condemning Todd White as an unsaved, unregenerate false teacher. These clips are used to demonstrate the Reformed camp's response to White, while also ironically highlighting the problems with Sproul and Spurgeon. Justin's original video can be seen here: https://youtu.be/uUHZN1kxb48\n\n#ToddWhite #Atonement #PenalSubstitution\n\n---------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "WHAT DOES TOTAL DEPRAVITY MEAN?\n\nWe bring you another tune straight from Radio Sovereign Geneva. This time we hear from some of the leading Calvinist voices and their view of children. John MacArthur holds a gnostic view of sin wherein sin is a substance to be transferred and exchanged; thus he believes the greatest act of depravity is when a husband and wife become pregnant. RC Sproul takes issue with John Calvin's claim that children are as depraved as rats. In Sproul's opinion, this is far too insulting to the rat. Voddie Baucham calls an infants a \"viper in a diaper\". While Paul Washer claims infants are born evil, possessed of murderous intent and hating God.\n\nHowever, the Scripture are clear. These men are teaching lies and slandering God's innocent and helpless little imagebearers.\n\n\"You are He who brought me forth from the womb;\nYou made me trust when upon my mother’s breasts.\nI was cast upon You from birth;\nYou have been my God from my mother’s womb.\" Psalm 22:9&10\n\n\"The WICKED have TURNED AWAY from the womb;\nThese who speak lies GO ASTRAY from birth.\" Psalm 58:3\n\n\"For You are my hope;\nLord God, You are my confidence from my youth.\nI have leaned on you since my birth;\nYou are He who took me from my mother’s womb;\nMy praise is continually of You.\" Psalm 71:5&6\n\n\"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord,\nThe fruit of the womb is a reward.\nLike arrows in the hand of a warrior,\nSo are the children of one’s youth.\nBlessed is the man whose quiver is full of them;\nThey will not be ashamed\nWhen they speak with their enemies in the gate.\" Psalm 127:3-5\n\n\"For You created my innermost parts;\nYou wove me in my mother’s womb.\nI will give thanks to You, because I am awesomely and wonderfully made;\nWonderful are Your works,\nAnd my soul knows it very well.\" Psalm 139:13&14\n\n#OriginalSin #TotalDepravity #RadioSovereignGeneva\n\n---------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "RC SPROUL BELIEVES JESUS BECAME IMPURE & GOD DAMNED HIM AT THE CROSS.\n\nThe lengths men will go to in defending Penal Substitutionary Atonement is astounding. In this polemical work, we took several clips from RC Sproul teaching that Jesus died impure, sin incarnate, cursed and forsaken by God. The original clip: https://youtu.be/Lgwpd0SKpmc\n\nIn Isaiah 53 we read that men cursed Jesus and claimed it was actually God who cursed Him, yet there was Jesus - God with us - laying down His life to redeem and deliver us in a display of selfless love and mercy.\n\nSproul argues that Jesus didn't suffer and die unjustly, but that He became sinful so the punishment was just. This denies that Jesus was the Spotless and sinless lamb. Instead, he argues that Jesus was the MOST sinful human to ever walk the planet.\n\nThis is a blasphemous view of God, stemming from a Gnostic view of sin, wherein sin is a substance. It causes God's justice and mercy to become perverted and disrupts the unity of the Triune God. They claim Jesus became sinful and cursed because God is incapable of genuinely forgiving the repentant. Thus they claim God punished the most innocent, most righteous, most good, most upright man to ever walk the earth... and they claim because of this they are free to live how they please as they're among the elect for whom Jesus suffered the punishment of all their past, present and future sins.\n\nThis is an obscene and heretical view of the Redemptive work of Christ! Yet, popular teachers like RC Sproul, John MacArthur and others teach this wickedness as though it were truth.\n\n---------\n\nIn the original clip (linked above) Sproul recognizes Jesus' cry in Matthew 27:46 is referencing Psalm 22, yet he dismisses it in order to blaspheme against Jesus.\n\n\"I will proclaim Your name to my brothers;\nIn the midst of the assembly I will praise You.\nYou who fear the Lord, praise Him;\nAll you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him,\nAnd stand in awe of Him, all you [s]descendants of Israel.\nFor He has not despised nor scorned the suffering of the afflicted;\nNor has He hidden His face from him;\nBut when he cried to Him for help, He heard.\"\n\n#RCSproul #Atonement #RadioSovereignGeneva\n\n---------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

YES! Paul assures us he will upload this series soon for everyone to enjoy. We will post links when that happens.\n\nTheophylact's Commentary on Matthew:\n🏪 https://amzn.to/3B83iYu\n\nTheophylact's Commentary on Mark:\n🏪 https://amzn.to/3is1Dpc\n\nTheophylact's Commentary on Luke:\n🏪 https://amzn.to/2YerrOX\n\n--------\n\nThe 17 Claims of Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA).\n\n1. Adam’s federal headship of humanity makes all mankind guilty of his sin. (Augustine) \n2. Thanks to the transmission of original sin, mankind is now totally depraved. (Augustine) \n3. Even infants, innocent of actual sin, are guilty of original sin. (Augustine) \n4. This sin, apparently so minor, infinitely offends God because the gravity of an offense depends on the status of the one offended. (Anselm) \n5. All sin is to be understood as a debt that we owe God for the crime of having dishonored him. (Anselm) \n6. Even infants owe this debt. (Anselm) \n7. In the Old Testament era, God insists that this debt be paid by one’s shedding an innocent animal’s blood. (Aquinas & Atonement School) \n8. God could have redeemed man by the simple act of willing it... (Anselm) \n9. ...But God cannot forgive a sin without first punishing the sinner. (Anselm) \n10. Not only must the redemption mirror the fall, but it must also be as painful as possible since the fall was so easy. (Anselm) \n11. Only the death of a god-man is worthy to serve as recompense to God for his offended honor. (Anselm) \n12. Christ becomes incarnate so that his humanity can suffer as a substitute for us. (Anselm) \n13. God pours out his wrath and judgment upon the crucified Christ, imputing mankind’s wickedness to Christ and Christ’s righteousness to mankind. Man thereby becomes positionally righteous; Christ becomes positionally wicked. This imputation is a legal declaration, not an actual change in nature. (Atonement School) \n14. Bearing the imputed sins of all humanity, the crucified Christ becomes the embodiment of sin and a literal curse. (Atonement School) \n15. God, too holy to look upon sin, turns his back on Christ, abandoning him, judging him, and in effect driving him out of the Trinity—God damns Christ. (Atonement School) \n16. As the perfect, unblemished offering, Christ’s sacrificial death appeases God’s wrath once and for all, ransoming us from the wrath of God and bringing an end to the Old Testament sacrificial system, as symbolized by the tearing of the temple veil. (Anselm, Atonement School) \n17. Thus, Christ’s death ransoms humanity from God’s wrath.

During this, he repeatedly asserted Warren was mistaken, in error, a Pelagian and teaching heresy, but didn't offer any substantive rebuttal or defense.\n\nAt one point, a guest seemed to mock Warren for studying the Bible and not submitting to Matt's teaching. Matt did not correct this man in any way.\n\nNo one this side of heaven has perfect doctrine and must work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, studying to show themselves approved. Warren is open to correction, but on the topic of Total Depravity, he is absolutely correct; it is an assault on Scripture.\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

As a result all mankind is born spiritually dead and unable to respond to God.\n\n3.

    "description": "#OriginalSin #AlisaChilders #Augustine\n\nRESPONDING TO ALISA CHILDERS & KEN SAMPLES\n\nRecently, Alisa Childers interviewed Ken Samples on the topic of Augustine and Original Sin, as well as touching on Penal Substitution. The original video was entitled \"Did St. Augustine Invent The Doctrine of Original Sin Because He Had Sexual Issues?\" (https://youtu.be/nz6Ro1faoFk)\n\nThe video frames the question in such a way that one can focus on the WHY of the question, rather than the IF and in doing so, ignore the implications. Moreover, the video repeatedly linked rejecting Augustinian philosophy with \"liberal\" and \"progressive\" Christians. \n\nIf one were not paying close attention, if one were not studied in these topics, a viewer might watch this and well assume Augustinian philosophy is Biblical, when in fact the opposite is true. \n\nThis response video seeks to set the record straight and address some errors the original presentation included. This is NOT a hit piece against either Childers or Samples, but a much needed correction of the record.\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "#PenalSubstitution #PSA #Atonement\n\nWHAT IS PENAL SUBSTITUTIONARY ATONEMENT?\n\nThis is the first episode in a 7 Part Series exploring the Augustinian Doctrine of Penal Substitution, abbreviated as PSA. In this episode, we lay out essential terms and definitions, review the historical development of PSA, consider an alternative Model of Redemption known as Restored Icon and we lay out the 17 unique claims comprising Penal Substitution.\n\nJoining Idol Killer for the entirety of this series is Paul Vendredi, who himself produced a long running podcast detailing PSA over 77 episodes.\n\n--------\n\nThe 17 Claims of Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA).\n\n1. Adam’s federal headship of humanity makes all mankind guilty of his sin. (Augustine) \n2. Thanks to the transmission of original sin, mankind is now totally depraved. (Augustine) \n3. Even infants, innocent of actual sin, are guilty of original sin. (Augustine) \n4. This sin, apparently so minor, infinitely offends God because the gravity of an offense depends on the status of the one offended. (Anselm) \n5. All sin is to be understood as a debt that we owe God for the crime of having dishonored him. (Anselm) \n6. Even infants owe this debt. (Anselm) \n7.

God could have redeemed man by the simple act of willing it... (Anselm) \n9. ...But God cannot forgive a sin without first punishing the sinner. (Anselm) \n10. Not only must the redemption mirror the fall, but it must also be as painful as possible since the fall was so easy. (Anselm) \n11. Only the death of a god-man is worthy to serve as recompense to God for his offended honor. (Anselm) \n12. Christ becomes incarnate so that his humanity can suffer as a substitute for us. (Anselm) \n13. God pours out his wrath and judgment upon the crucified Christ, imputing mankind’s wickedness to Christ and Christ’s righteousness to mankind. Man thereby becomes positionally righteous; Christ becomes positionally wicked. This imputation is a legal declaration, not an actual change in nature. (Atonement School) \n14. Bearing the imputed sins of all humanity, the crucified Christ becomes the embodiment of sin and a literal curse. (Atonement School) \n15. God, too holy to look upon sin, turns his back on Christ, abandoning him, judging him, and in effect driving him out of the Trinity—God damns Christ. (Atonement School) \n16.

Of course when combating atheism, he argued against determinism. All revealing his inconsistencies and the internal contradictions within Calvinism.\n\nIf God decreed whatsoever comes to pass, then this would include all things such as evil and our thoughts.

According to RC Sproul, its recognizing that Jesus is God and accusing Him of being a devil. Theodicy is an explanation for the existence of evil, specifically a defense of God in light of evil's existence.\n\nRC Sproul affirmed the Westminster Confession of Faith and was an Augustinian. As such, he concluded God ordained whatsoever comes to pass. Ordain means to confer holy orders, command and decree... thus to ordain evil is to be the cause of evil.\n\nThis polemical work is intended to show how if one is consistent with their application of determinism, as articulated by Augustine, the Westminster Confession and Sproul... one must conclude God is responsible for all evil in the world.

    "description": "JOHN MACARTHUR, RC SPROUL & JAMES WHITE BLAME GOD FOR EVIL.\n\nThis video uses the words of well known Calvinists to expose and refute Calvinism. Often this employs using one statement they made to refute another statement they made. In some cases liberty has been taken with their words to rebuke their position. \n\nMost of the clips of JMac come from the link below and his sermon: \"Why Does God Allow So Much Suffering and Evil?\" This of course is a polemical work intended to refute not only MacArthur, not only Calvinism, but all of Theistic Determinism. This system believes God has decreed everything, including every act of evil; that He is not allowing evil acts but rather is the ultimate causal agent by way of His immutable eternal decree. \n\nThis of course is contrary to Scripture and accuses God of all evil. JMac is joined here with soundbites from RC Sproul & James White who likewise are notable adherents of this faulty philosophy.\n\nIt is our hope that this causes Calvinists, including MacArthur and White, to repent from such beliefs and stop blaming God for sin and evil. Rather, we are God's imagebearers, and as such were created with genuine freewill and self-determination. For this reason, sin originates not in the mind or decree of God, but with His wayward imagebearers.\n\nContrary to the claims made by Calvinists, God did not create evil. Evil is death and meaningless. However, God is Life and can use such things to bless and bring life to those who trust Him. If you've been hurt by evil men, that was NOT your Father in heaven hurting you through them. He hates evil and will judge them for it.\n\nIf you've believed the lie that God created perfect evil, repent and run home. The Father is waiting and willing to forgive.

    "description": "GOD DECREES EVERY ACT OF EVIL\n\nVarious clips from James White of @AominOrg (@Alpha & Omega Ministries) were used to create this polemical work. As he is a theistic determinist, James believes God has decreed everything, including every act of evil; that He is not merely permitting evil acts but rather is the ultimate causal agent - that God effectually decreed every act of evil into existence.\n\nThis of course is contrary to Scripture and accuses God of all evil. White does this as a result of affirming Calvinism and Classical Theism. This work is intended to reveal a monumental problem within his view.\n\nThis is a polemical work using statements James White made on various programs affirming God creates and decrees all evil. Keep in mind, two statements were made wherein James and his cohost restate objections commonly raised by non-Calvinists, that this means God forces men to sin and is the author of child abuse. While both quoted these objection, neither were able to overcome them via their commitment to \"Reformed Apologetics\" and presuppositional commitment to Calvinism.\n\nIt is our hope that this causes Calvinists, including James White, to repent from such beliefs and stop blaming God for all sin and evil. Rather, we are God's imagebearers, and as such were created with genuine freewill and self-determination. For this reason, sin originates not in the mind or decree of God, but with His wayward imagebearers.\n\nContrary to the claims made by White, God did not create evil. Evil is death, rebellion and meaningless. However, God is Life and can redeem such things to bless and bring life to those who trust Him. If you've been hurt by evil men, that was NOT your Father in heaven hurting you through them. He hates evil, calls them to repent and will judge them for rebellion.\n\nIf you've believed the lie that God created perfect evil, repent and run home. The Father is waiting and willing to forgive.

    "description": "HOW VIEWS ON GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY CAN CREATE DOUBT & DISBELIEF. It's often argued that God is sovereign, by which they mean God has decreed everything that comes to pass including all sin and evil. Such a view is blasphemous, accusing God of desiring evil. Moreover, it places the accuser in peril, but also whoever might listen to such slander. \n\nThose who have suffered abuse and trauma are often seeking to heal and recover, looking to God to work through such evils to bring about good. However, for one to believe that it was God bringing about the abuse and trauma, to whom can they turn? When they believe God was the ultimate abuser, where can they run but away from Him? \n\nSuch perverse views on God sacrifice His holiness and love, worshipping an idol called \"power\", \"might\" & \"sovereignty\" which is nothing more than an empty chair without the heart of God seated there. So instead of looking to God for comfort and healing, restoration and deliverance, many come to view Him as the ultimate abuser and thus shipwreck their faith.\n\nIn this episode, Idol Killer reviews a meme that's been popular on religious forums recently, as well as the claims that God either must decree evil or He is a perverted voyeur watching it happen and refusing to help.

    "title": "Does Evil Disprove God? Walking Through Theodicy",
    "description": "THEODICY & THE PROBLEM OF EVIL\n\nDoes the existence of evil in the world disprove the existence of God? That's what many have argued, but here Idol Killer considers the arguments and offers an explanation. We discuss Epicurus, Pierre Gassendi & David Hume - reviewing the argument and considering various explanations. We examine various Theistic responses and weigh the pros and cons of each.\n\nDoes evil exist? Yes.\n\nNow the argument commonly made arises. If God is all knowing, then He knows of evil. If He is all powerful, then He could stop evil. If He is good, then He would. Thus, since evil runs rampant and unimpeded, God does not exist. \n\nHowever, the argument fails to recognize a central aspect of God's character... chiefly that He is patient, not willing that any should perish. Thus He call men to repentance and employs the faithful into the ministry of reconciliation. Moreover, God has given us laws and consequences. Evildoers do suffer these consequences woven into creation and should they not repent, they will face God's judgment. Additionally, God often restrains the evil men do, yet in some instances will enact a judgment by ceasing such restraint and allowing the evil to destroy themselves.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in recognizing the existence of evil, men acknowledge a transcendent standard which God has written on their hearts. To know what evil is, is to know it is opposed to good. Thus to recognize the existence of the counterfeit is to acknowledge the existence of the genuine. So we see man innately knows good and evil, thus recognizing the existence of God.\n\n📚 The Problem of Pain by C.S.

    "description": "Adherents of Augustinian philosophy embrace the concept known as Original Sin. That is, that since Adam's sin in Eden, all mankind is now born with their flesh, will, mind and soul stained by sin. \n\nThis creates serious problems when applied to the incarnation of Jesus Christ. In Hebrews 2:14-18 we read that Jesus came in our flesh and blood, like us in EVERY respect.\n\n\"Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the SAME THINGS, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in EVERY RESPECT, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.\" Hebrews 2:14-18\n\nSo, if we are born with our flesh, will, soul and mind stained by sin - and Jesus came like us in every respect, then Jesus would be just as sinful. Which corrupts the incarnation and denies His role as the Spotless Redeemer who knew no sin.\n\nAugustinians often seek to Move the Goalposts, and redefine our nature to include things like drinking frappuccinos, our ethnicity or something other than our flesh, will, soul and mind. This is known as the Starbucks Fallacy.\n\n#shorts #apologetics \n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "#shorts #Augustine\n\nRoman Catholicism and Reformed Protestants stand on the foundation of Augustinian philosophy. So who was Augustine and what did he believe?\n\nAugustine: Sex with your wife for pleasure is worse than with a prostitute.\n\n\"For, whereas that natural use, when it pass beyond the compact of marriage, that is, beyond the necessity of begetting, is pardonable in the case of a wife, damnable in the case of an harlot; that which is against nature is execrable when done in the case of an harlot, but MORE execrable in the case of a wife... the wife is more shameful, if she allows it to take place in her own case, than if in the case of another woman.\" Of the Good of Marriage - Augustine of Hippo\n\nAugustine: the use of violence to force conversion to Christianity is acceptable.\n\n\"For originally my opinion was, that no one should be coerced into the unity of Christ, that we must act only by words, fight only by arguments, and prevail by force of reason, lest we should have those whom we knew as avowed heretics feigning themselves to be Catholics. But this opinion of mine was overcome not by the words of those who controverted it, but by the conclusive instances to which they could point. For, in the first place, there was set over against my opinion my own town, which, although it was once wholly on the side of Donatus, was brought over to the Catholic UNITY BY FEAR of the imperial edicts, but which we now see filled with such detestation of your ruinous perversity, that it would scarcely be believed that it had ever been involved in your error. There were so many others which were mentioned to me by name, that, from facts themselves, I was made to own that to this matter the word of Scripture might be understood as applying: Give opportunity to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser. Proverbs 9:9 For how many were already, as we assuredly know, willing to be Catholics, being moved by the indisputable plainness of truth, but daily putting off their avowal of this through fear of offending their own party! How many were bound, not by truth— for you never pretended to that as yours — but by the heavy chains of inveterate custom, so that in them was fulfilled the divine saying: A servant (who is hardened) will not be corrected by words; for though he understand, he will not answer! Proverbs 29:19 How many supposed the sect of Donatus to be the true Church, merely because ease had made them too listless, or conceited, or sluggish, to take pains to examine Catholic truth! How many would have entered earlier had not the calumnies of slanderers, who declared that we offered something else than we do upon the altar of God, shut them out! How many, believing that it mattered not to which party a Christian might belong, remained in the schism of Donatus only because they had been born in it, and no one was compelling them to forsake it and pass over into the Catholic Church!\" Letter 93 - Augustine of Hippo\n\n📚 Buy Of the Good of Marriage, and On Marriage and Concupiscence \nhttps://amzn.to/2PBn4sy\n\n📚 The Foundation of Augustinian-Calvinism (Dr Ken Wilson)\nHere Dr Wilson demonstrates Augustine's utilization of Manichaean thought\nhttps://amzn.to/3dic3nY\n\n📚 The Myth of Pelagianism (Dr Ali Bonner)\nHere Dr Bonner demonstrates how Augustine slandered the monk Pelagius so as to shift Christian orthodoxy.\nhttps://amzn.to/3u2fshn\n\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

Is it consistent with Scripture? Has it been affirmed in the past? Does this deny God has perfect knowledge? These are but some of the questions we will be answering!\n\nDr. Sanders is an American theologian who has authored and edited seven books as well as over three dozen articles and book chapters. Three of his books were named in Christianity Today magazine’s books of the year awards. He has a doctorate in theology, spent a year as the Dominic Crosson Fellow at the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame, and is presently professor of religious studies at Hendrix College in Arkansas.\n\nMost of Dr Sanders’ publications are on four topics: (1) open theism, (2) Christian views on the salvation of non-Christians for which he is a proponent of what is called inclusivism, (3) Christian views on the nature of hell, and (4) applying cognitive linguistics to theology. He has given over eighty presentations at academic conferences and dozens more in church settings. His work has generated a great deal of scholarly activity in that they are substantively engaged by or at least cited in 369 books, book chapters, and  journal articles.

    "description": "ARE YOU UNKNOWINGLY A PELAGIAN? \nRecently, Dr Ali Bonner joined Idol Killer to discuss her work on The Myth of Pelagianism. During the course of the interview, Dr Bonner noted how the works of Pelagius had survived, being passed around and attributed to Jerome and even the Canons of the Council of Nicaea.\n\nThis means two things:\n\n1. The ACTUAL teachings of Pelagius were revered as orthodox and thus were foundational to doctrinal development. Pelagius was NOT a Pelagian. Pelagianism is comprised of 14 unique charges which Augustine cobbled together to slander him. Of the 14 points, Pelagius only affirmed half of one point.\n\n2. If your theology agrees with these works, meaning Christian orthodoxy, or your beliefs have been influenced by these writings or by the teaching of men who have been so influenced... then you're Pelagian! - in the sense of agreeing with Pelagius, not the 14 points falsely attributed to him by Augustine.\n\nPerhaps it is time to cease using the Pelagian Boogeyman and seriously engage the arguments in light of Scripture. Perhaps it's time Augustinians cease falsely accusing an orthodox follower of Christ and repent.\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

Where did it come from? Did Pelagius believe in \"Pelagianism\"? Why did Augustine condemn Pelagius and Pelagianism? All of these questions and more are explored in this interview.\n\nAfter reading Classics at Oxford, Alice Bonner studied Anglo Saxon, Norse, and Celtic in Cambridge, where she gained a BA (Aff.) and MPhil, followed by a PhD on the manuscript transmission of Pelagius' Letter to Demetrias. Subsequently she was a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at Jesus College, Oxford, before being appointed to the Lectureship in Celtic History at Cambridge. Her research focuses on Pelagius and Faustus of Riez, two British authors of the fifth century who wrote in Latin, and she has published on St Patrick and Pelagius. She currently teaches on Celtic history, that is, the history of the Brittonic speaking peoples and the Gaelic speaking peoples from AD 380 to 1170\n\n📚 Buy Dr Bonner's Book: The Myth of Pelagianism\n(We are paid commissions for purchases made through this link)\nhttps://amzn.to/2Msv8ux\n\n📚 The Fear of Freedom (Rowan A.

    "description": "WHAT IS PELAGIANISM?\n\nWarren McGrew of Idol Killer sits down to discuss the different definitions of Pelagianism, but particularly Augustine's 14 points he claimed comprised Pelagianism. Warren references Dr Ali Bonner's book \"The Myth of Pelagianism\".\n\nIs Pelagianism opposed by Scripture? Is it heresy? What does Pelagianism assert with regard to our view of God, man, sin and righteousness? \n\nThe 14 Points of Pelagianism:\n\n1. Adam was created mortal & would die whether he sinned or not 30:06\n2. Adam’s sin harmed only Adam, not mankind 31:06\n3. The law leads to heaven in the same way as the Gospel 32:21\n4. Newborn infants are in the exact same state as Adam before his sin 33:27\n5. The whole human race doesn’t die through Adam & live through Christ 35:12\n6. Even unbaptized infants possess eternal life 36:16\n7. The wealthy must renounce their possessions or they will not see the Kingdom of Heaven 37:23\n8. God’s grace & help are not given for individual actions, but consist in free will, the law & teaching. 38:59\n9. God‘s grace is given in accord with our merits & is located in the human will 40:33\n10. Only those who are without sin can be called children of God 42:04 \n11. Forgetfulness & ignorance are not sinful since they’re not done willingly 42:50\n12. A choice is not free if it needs God’s help 45:32\n13. Our victory is not the result of God’s help, but free will 46:23\n14.

Augustinians often assert their teaching of Original Sin and Total Depravity can be found in the book of Job. Specifically, they refer to Job 15:14-16, Job 25:4-6 and Job 14:4; so in this episode we consider each of these prooftexts to determine if the passages actually support their claims. We also look at several quotes from various early Church Fathers who expounded on the meaning Job was intending to convey and its impact on the coming incarnation of Christ.\n\nThis series conducts a comprehensive examination of Augustinian inherited sin doctrines, taking a critical look at the various problems that arise in light of the Bible.

    "description": "#Pelagian #Heresy #Theology\n\nIt is not uncommon for an adherent of Augustinian philosophy to accuse those of us who reject it as being Pelagian heretics. This label is most often applied when the Augustinian is struggling to defend their position and seeks to malign us, dismissing us without actually refuting our claims or defending their own. \n\nWhen it is pointed out that their own definitions for Pelagianism fail to apply to us, they routinely double down and cry \"Heresy!\" all the louder. \n\nOf course such a claim is demonstrably false and they are bearing false witness. So knock it off.\n\n--\n\nThis video uses excerpts from a debate between Warren McGrew (idol killer) and Matt Slick (CARM) in which Matt accused Warren of being a Pelagian. Warren presented Mr Slick with articles Slick had written and pointed out how the label didn't represent Warren's views. However, Mr Slick continued to slander him and accuse him of being Pelagian.\n\nAdditionally, this video includes a recent segment from Dr Leighton Flowers' on Soteriology 101 in which he is addressing the issue of falsely calling people Pelagian. His comments were made before the debate and were in now way a direct response to this debate, but they're used here as they are relevant and demonstrate how we are not Pelagian.\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "#Debate #TotalDepravity #Calvinism\n\nMatt Slick of CARM vs Warren McGrew of Idol Killer.\n\nIs Total Depravity True? A question rooted equally in Scripture and epistemology. \n\nWhile employing epistemology Matt argued against epistemology, maligning it as something heretical. However, it is simply the study of knowledge; especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes a justified belief from a baseless opinion. In other words... this is what all good and noble Bereans should strive for.  \n\nIn this debate Warren presents several challenges to the doctrine of Total Depravity and reveals numerous undercutting defeaters and inconsistencies inherent in Mr. Slick's position. \n\nAdditionally, Mr. Slick repeatedly abandoned the debate topic, redefined Total Depravity, going so far as to not only argue against his own statements made in his CARM articles, debates, teaching videos and the definition he agreed to prior to the debate, but even those positions he stated in the actual debate itself. This debate is sadly a good example of cognitive dissonance at work. \n\nMr. Slick's argumentation essentially consisted of appealing to circular reasoning, calling Warren a Pelagian, asserting his own credentials as superior, misrepresenting what Warren said, appealing to confusion, mocking and condescension. He failed to address the undercutting defeaters Warren presented and repeatedly changed positions, redefining Total Depravity when he felt it was expedient to his argument.\n\nMatt Slick's Opening Statement: 9:26\nWarren McGrew's Opening Statement 19:15\nMatt's Rebuttal 29:31\nWarren's Rebuttal 34:47\nMatt's Cross Examination 40:06\nWarren's Cross Examination 55:44\nOpen Discussion 1:12:26\nMatt's Closing Statement 1:39:29\nWarren's Closing Statement 1:45:45\nQ&A 1:50:48\n\nIdol Killer's Debate Response:\nhttps://youtu.be/RBcHyAL9dtU\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

God is far greater than their philosophy teaches. We pray this spurs you on, perhaps with a chuckle, to consider the matter further.\n\nCalvinism is a 500 year old systematic theology rooted in John Calvin's understanding and affirmation of Augustinian philosophy. Augustine merged Manichaean gnosticism and Greek philosophy with Christian terms and themes, obfuscating the Gospel and Truth. It is false and in opposition to Scripture... but since Calvinists have historically held bearded men in high esteem, we figured this would break the news to them in a way they might choose to accept.\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

To be clear, we do NOT affirm either Original Sin or Infant Damnation - these are both anti-Christ teachings which assault the good nature of God and cause parents undo grief and concern.

    "description": "#OriginalSin #TotalDepravity #BornSinners #Yetzer #Epithumia #Concupiscence\n\nWHAT IS THE NATURE OF MAN ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE? In this episode we consider man's desires, drives, appetites and ambitions as understood by the Latin term Concupiscence as opposed to the Hebrew yetser and Greek epithumia.\n\nThe Hebrew term yetser describes our neutral God given drives, appetites and ambitions which can be used for good (yetzer ha-tov) or evil (yetzer ha-ra). The Greek term epithumia likewise describes our desires which can be either good or evil. However, the Latin term concupiscence has no such nuance and means sinful lust and animalistic desire. As Augustine and many in the West were unable to read Hebrew or Greek, they relied on Latin translations and as such failed to understand such distinctions.\n\n\"If you want it, it's sin... if it feels good, God hates it.\" This is often the view adherents of Western Christianity take with regard to our appetites, drives, ambitions and desires... but it isn't the Biblical view. Rather, the origins of this perspective are found in poor Latin translations of the Scriptures which were then filtered through neo-Platonist philosophy and Manichaean doctrine - ultimately leading to the formulation of Original Sin.\n\nIf Original Sin is true and mankind is stained with concupiscence, then this would corrupt the nature of Christ and deny His role as our Spotless Redeemer. Moreover, it would render us incapable of rightly understanding spiritual truth or even knowing if we've truly responded to God in faith. Rather we should understand God has given man ambition, drives, appetites and desires and when used as He intended they are good, but when misused they lead to sin and bondage.\n\nThis series conducts a comprehensive examination of Augustinian inherited sin doctrines, considering various passages in Scripture used to teach and refute it, as well as offers a critical look considering the various problems that may arise.\n\nTime Stamps:\n\n0:38 Yetser / Yetzer Defined\n2:11 Bereishit Rabbah\n4:43 Genesis 8:21\n5:25 Epithumia Defined\n6:26 Jesus Refers to His Own Desires\n7:08 Yetzer & Epithumia Compared\n7:44 Rome's Troubles & The Loss of Greek & Hebrew\n8:19 Augustine's Difficulties\n9:19 Concupiscence Defined\n\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "#OriginalSin #TotalDepravity #BornSinners #HypostaticUnion\n\nORIGINAL SIN IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE HYPOSTATIC UNION. In this episode we consider the Hypostatic Union in light of Augustinian inherited sin doctrines. \n\nThe Hypostatic Union is a Christian doctrine describing the union of Christ's human nature and His divinity in one individual existence. Original Sin asserts that all of Adam's progeny are born stained and corrupted by Original Sin. Yet, Scripture states Jesus took on all of our nature, like us in every respect, so as to redeem us. \n\nThe Early Church was explicit in condemning any view which denied Jesus took on Himself all of human nature; our flesh, will, soul and mind - being made like us in every respect so as to redeem us. In fact, Scripture calls a denial of this the \"spirit of antiChrist\" (1 John 4:2-3), as it is opposed to the truth of who Jesus is and what He accomplished. Many have been deceived by this spirit, but those who truly love Jesus and desire the truth are free to repent and follow Him in truth.\n\nMany adherents of Augustinian philosophy will seek to defend Original Sin or Total Depravity by pointing to the Hypostatic Union. However, if Jesus assumed our fallen nature to redeem us, then He assumed corruption and would be negated from being the Spotless Redeemer of Scripture. If Jesus did not assume our fallen nature, then He didn't redeem our nature. \n\nHere we will explore the origins of the Hypostatic Union and deep dive into this conflict between it and Augustinian philosophy, demonstrating how the two are incompatible. \n\nTime Stamps:\n\n0:38 Hypostatic Union Defined\n0:49 Development of the Doctrine\n1:06 Gregory the Theologian - What is not assumed is not redeemed\n1:20 Council of Chalcedon 451\n3:06 A Problem Arises - Original Sin (R.C.

    "description": "#OriginalSin #TotalDepravity #BornSinners #Incarnation\n\nORIGINAL SIN & TOTAL DEPRAVITY REJECT THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST! In this episode we consider the impact Original Sin and Total Depravity have on the incarnation of Christ. Additionally, we explore the doctrines of Mary's Immaculate Conception and the Virgin Conception.\n\nAugustinian sin doctrines assert that as a result of Adam, we're all born spiritually dead, possessing his guilt and sinful nature; that our flesh, will, soul and intellect are corrupt and we're naturally incapable of knowing God or rightly understanding spiritual truths. Yet, Scripture says Jesus came in our flesh and blood, like us in every respect (Hebrews 2:14-18). Now if our flesh is sinful and corrupt and Jesus came in our flesh, taking on every aspect of our nature, then this would result in corrupting Him, negating His role as the spotless and sinless Redeemer of mankind spoken of throughout Scripture.\n\nOriginal Sin and the Incarnation of Christ are not compatible. This is why following the State Church's embrace of Augustinian philosophy, views on the virgin birth were modified in an attempt to protect Christ from the very human nature He came to assume and redeem. Thus we see the invention of Mary's own Immaculate Conception, where God spared her the stain of Original Sin when her parents conceived her. \n\nWe're told the Immaculate Conception is a better redemptive work than the one performed by Christ, and we see how this view makes the incarnation, suffering and death of Christ pointless. As God could have easily done for mankind what He did for Mary. Such beliefs in special treatment for the Mother of Jesus (Theotokos) then resulted in her further elevation within the State Church and its subsequent Marian dogmas such as her perpetual virginity, her role as Queen of Heaven and co-Redemptrix, her heavenly assumption, Mediatrix and Mother of the Church... replacing Christ with His blessed mother whom He came to save as well as all mankind. \n\nThis series will conduct a comprehensive examination of Augustinian inherited sin doctrines, consider various passages in Scripture used to teach and refute this, as well as take a critical look and consider the various problems that may arise.\n\nTime Stamps:\n\n0:40 Augustinian Sin Doctrines Summarized\n1:06 Genesis 3:15 - Jesus, the offspring of Adam & Eve, our Redeemer\n1:13 Genealogy of Jesus\n1:29 The Messiah is Sinless\n1:41 A Faulty Solution - Virgin Birth & Immaculate Conception\n2:48 Immaculate Conception Defined\n3:38 What About Mary's Personal Sins?\n4:21 Why Did Mary Need a Savior?\n5:56 The Virgin Birth\n6:49 A Doctrine Absent from Scripture\n7:17 What Scripture DOES Tell Us\n8:18 Scripture Vs Augustinian Philosophy\n9:41 Appeals to a form of Docetism - Spirit of antiChrist\n10:31 The Incarnation Redeems Man's Nature, as Christ Assumed it Fully\n\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "#OriginalSin #TotalDepravity #BornSinners\n\nORIGINAL SIN AND TOTAL DEPRAVITY REFUTED! In this episode we consider an undercutting defeater for Augustinian inherited sin doctrines; Original Sin and Total Depravity. \n\nBoth doctrines assert that man is created with our flesh, soul, will and intellect corrupt. So the logical question then arises: If you're created with a corrupt flesh, soul, will and intellect - being naturally unable to rightly know God or spiritual truths, then to what can you appeal to for validation your present understanding is valid?\n\nTo answer this question, adherents of Augustinian philosophy routinely point to their regeneration and enablement to know spiritual truths. However, as regeneration is itself a spiritual truth, such an assertion does nothing to address the undercutting defeater. \n\nAnother common response to this problem is an appeal to divine gnosis. Essentially, the adherent will assert they just know, or have received a divine revelation from God as confirmation. However, as such a thing itself would be a spiritual truth, this too does nothing to address the undercutting defeater.\n\nIf you're created with faculties incapable of rightly understanding spiritual truth, there is nothing one can point to for validation of a correct present understanding. This is due to the adherent still being unable to utilize anything apart from their natural faculties - the flesh, soul, will and intellect they've previously asserted cannot rightly know spiritual truth.\n\nThis series will conduct a comprehensive examination of Augustinian inherited sin doctrines, consider various passages in Scripture used to teach and refute this, as well as take a critical look and consider the various problems that may arise.\n\nTime Stamps:\n\n0:44 Epistemology and the Undercutting Defeater\n0:51 John Pollock - Reason & Conclusion\n1:00 William P.

    "title": "Original Sin - A Doctrine Examined - Episode 1 - What is Original Sin & Total Depravity?",
    "description": "#originalsin #totaldepravity #bornsinners\n\nWHAT IS ORIGINAL SIN AND TOTAL DEPRAVITY? In this episode we review the various historical and modern articulations of both Original Sin and Total Depravity, offering a definition for each. This is intended to provide a foundation so as we consider Scripture and the views held by the early Church we can see if these teachings are correct. This is not intended to be an endorsement of these doctrines, but rather a fair representation; a Steelman.\n\nThis is the first episode in an ongoing series which will conduct a comprehensive examination of these doctrines, consider various passages in Scripture used both to teach and refute this, as well as take a critical look and consider the various problems that may arise. Each subsequent episode will reveal why these doctrines are not in keeping with Biblical Christianity and cause serious harm to the Gospel, the teaching and work of Christ.\n\nFor example, future episodes will look at how Original Sin undermines the incarnation of Christ, offers sinners an excuse for their sins, and even negates foundational principles such as the use of logic and reason to consider and know truth.\n\nRejection of Original Sin is often portrayed as a novel and heretical position, however it was not until the 5th century that Augustine of Hippo formulated it. Prior to this, the early church unaminously affirmed frewill, refuting determinism, that man is created innocent and able to freely do either good or evil. Moreover, the Eastern Orthodox, Anabaptists and other Christian groups reject Original Sin to this day.\n\nTime Stamps:\n\n0:44 Original Sin defined\n1:26 Total Depravity defined\n2:03 Augustine on Concupiscence in infants\n2:12 Martin Luther born sinners\n2:26 John Calvin all of man is corrupt\n2:54 Article 3, Augsburg Confession - Original Sin IS sin\n3:29 Article 3, Canons of Dordt - born under wrath & total inability\n3:58 Article 14, Belgic Confession - sin is hereditary\n4:30 1644 London Baptist Confession - sin is our nature\n4:55 1644 LBC - born under wrath\n5:08 1655 Midland Confession of Faith - defiled from the womb\n5:31 1655 MCoF - God withholds the ability to believe & be saved\n5:40 1689 Baptist Confession - all of our nature & faculties are defiled\n6:01 1689 BC - Sin is passed on via sexual reproduction\n6:38 Canon 7, Council of Orange - man cannot naturally understand & believe the Gospel\n7:09 R.C.

    "title": "Let Me Tell You Something About Man & God",
    "description": "#Gospel #Christianity #Truth\n\nWarren McGrew of Idol Killer discusses Biblical truth that has largely been lost in modern churches today. \n\nThe Gospel is good news for all mankind. God is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance and live. Jesus came in our flesh and blood, like us in every respect, in order to destroy the works of the devil and the hold of the grave, thereby reconciling those who through fear of death were subject to a life of futility. We shouldn't fear returning to God in repentance, for He loves us greatly and will faithfully restore us.\n\n--\n\nLet me tell you something about man and God…\n\nScripture says we are fearfully and wonderfully created by God in our mother's womb (Psalm 139:14), that we are a marvelous work of God, entirely dependent upon Him (Psalm 22:8-10, 71:5-6), that we are His imagebearers (Genesis 1:26, 3:22).\n\nWe’re told sin is contrary to who we are and seeks to rule over us, but we must master it (Genesis 4:6-7); that we depart our initial state of innocence and go astray into sin and trespasses (Psalm 58:3, Proverbs 14:22, Hebrews 5:2), developing a nature in bondage to sin and rightly deserving judgment (Ephesians 2:1-3).  \n\nThat by our young adult years the imagination of our hearts has become set on wickedness (Genesis 8:21) and yet even in such a state as this we can come to our senses and return to the Father who draws all men to Himself (Luke 15, John 12:32, 2 Peter 3:8-10), promising to freely and abundantly pardon us, lavishing His restorative love upon us and declaring us innocent once more (Ezekiel 18, Isaiah 55:7, 1 John 1:9).\n\nWe’re told that in order to redeem man and conquer the hold of the grave that Jesus came in our flesh and blood, like us in every respect (Hebrews 2:14-18), that in the greatest example of selfless love in the history of the universe He took our suffering and our death upon Himself (John 15:13, Acts 2:24) and though He was tempted in every way as we are and though He suffered greatly, He did not stumble, He did not waiver… He did not sin (1 Peter 2:22, Romans 8:3). \n\nWe don’t have a cold and uncaring God who can’t sympathize with our suffering. We have a God who picked up His own cross and showed us just how much He understands and how far He is willing to go to save us (Hebrews 4:15).\n\nYou see man was created in the image of God and would walk with Him in paradise in the cool of the day (Genesis 1-3:8) and it’s in the arms of your Heavenly Father where you will find true freedom, love, fulfillment, joy… realizing the purpose for which you were created (Ephesians 1:11-12).\n\nGod is the source of Life and all good things (John 14:6), apart from Him there is only the absence of such things… pain and death (Genesis 2:17, Romans 6:23). You may be like Adam and Eve and hiding in the bushes, afraid of what He will think when He sees the mess you’ve made, but when the Father sees you returning He will rush out to greet you, throw His arms around you, kiss your dirty face, cover you in His best robe, place a ring on your finger, celebrate and declare “My child who was dead is alive again!” (Luke 15:11-32)\n\nReturn to Him while there is time.\n\n--\n\n--------\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Idol Killer e5 - The Matter of Pharaoh's Heart\n\nWhen considering the theological concept of God's Sovereignty from a Reformed / Calvinist view, the topic of God hardening Pharaoh's heart is often raised. After our recent episode on the sovereignty of God, requests came in asking that we address this specific instance in Scripture.\n\nWhat does it mean when Scripture says God hardened Pharaoh's heart? Did God cause Pharaoh to rebel and sin? Did God make Pharaoh incapable of repentance? If Pharaoh was totally depraved and unregenerate why did God need to harden his heart? How does this instance in Scripture affect our understanding of the workings of God and His judgments? We address these questions and more in this episode.\n\nFor more visit: https://www.idolkiller.com/home/matter-of-pharaoh-heart\n\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

Thus the 18 and over age restriction has been enabled for this episode.\n\n“I believe in the Sovereignty of God!” This is a common phrase often declared from Protestant pulpits, specifically those identifying as Reformed or Calvinist – but what does it mean?\n\nMany Calvinist Preachers, Teachers and Commentators will assert that whatsoever comes to pass does so because it was God's will, that at some point in eternity past God decreed all things including evil and wickedness. In this view, God is somehow lessened if something happens He did not cause. However, this view does not elevate God as it adherents mistakenly believe. Instead, such claims make God out to be a devil behind Satan, commanded murder, adultery and every evil ever perpetrated. \n\nIn this episode of Idol Killer we consider the errors of the Calvinist view of Sovereignty, as well as what the Bible actually says about God and the basic definitions of the term.\n\nOur article: https://www.idolkiller.com/home/what-is-god-s-sovereignty\n\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "Idol Killer - A Martian Gospel\n\nDo you often find yourself struggling to witness, or relate your faith in a way that is understandable? Are you an atheist, agnostic or adherent of another religion trying to understand the Christian worldview? \n\nIn this episode of Idol Killer we consider who God is and the nature of our relationship with Him in a rather unconventional way - via a modern parable entitled \"Mars\".\n\nLike all parables its not perfect and there are sure to be areas in which it fails under scrutiny. However, we believe this explains things in a simple and easily understood way without resorting to legalism, or beating people over the head with the Bible. \n\nThis brief little tale has worked rather well in building bridges where respectful discourse can occur on a topic all too divisive.\n\n\n☝️ About: \nIdol Killer is committed to spreading the Gospel and making disciples of Christ.

    "description": "God's Redemption of Man & the History of Penal Substitution (PSA).\n\nIn this edition of Idol Killer we explore the Redemption Models of the early Church (Recapitulation, Ransom & Moral Influence), as well as latter Atonement Theories (Satisfaction Theory & PSA).\n\nDid Jesus come to enable God’s forgiveness, or did He come because God is forgiving? These Redemption Models and Atonement Theories approach this question differently.\n\nIt is virtually undisputed that today the most popular explanation of the cross is that of Penal Substitution, that God who is Holy cannot merely forgive men, but instead must pour out His wrath and chose to do so on Jesus, thereby saving us from the wrath of God. But is this what Scripture teaches? Is this explanation in keeping with what the early Church taught? When was this teaching introduced and are there any problems with it? Does Isaiah 53 teach Penal Substitution? What are the unique claims of PSA?
