Mix the flour, ground almonds, salt, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add one egg to the butter and sugar mixture and beat in, then a third of the dry ingredients, then the second egg, and so on. Add two tablespoons of elderflower cordial and mix. Place in a greased baking tin and bake at 160 degrees Celsius (fan oven) for 20-25 minutes until just beginning to brown at the edges. Meanwhile, mix the drizzle - 100ml of elderflower cordial and the juice of the two lemons. When the cake is done, prick all over with a cake tester (or piece of spaghetti), and slowly pour on the drizzle so it soaks in and doesn’t pool. Sprinkle modestly with granulated sugar and poppy seeds. Leave to cool completely before cutting. Pairs excellently with a cup of earl grey tea or a glass of rosé wine (French, not Californian).\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 - Appetizer\n2:29 - First Course\n10:30 - Second Course\n21:55 - Side Dish: The Ballad of Kelly Slaughter\n28:45 - Third Course\n\n#Food #Cooking #Beauty",

It would actually fall under the religious arguments section, and the argument from being unnatural can stand without it. This was my fault, I apologise for my gross abuse of the Latin.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PhilosophyTube?ref=hl\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PhilosophyTube\n\nStudy suggesting intrauterine hormone exposure can determine sexuality: http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/262525\nStudy suggesting that the number of older brothers a man has affect his chances of being homosexual because of H-Y antigens in the intrauterine environment: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251939690315X\n\nIf you type 'homosexuality chosen or not' into Google you'll get lots more results. I didn't include more because I'm not sure how many studies people will have access to; I get to see them through my university but your circumstances might be different.\n\nIf anybody is interested in how genetic determination works and the extent to which genes/environment affect you I can recommend the book 'Genome' by Matt Ridley. A little dated in placed but still very easy reading and fascinating stuff.\nIf anybody has any more studies or data to share, do!\n\nComment music this week is The Pixies' \"Where is My Mind?\"",
