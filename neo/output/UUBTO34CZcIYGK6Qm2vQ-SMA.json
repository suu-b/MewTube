    "description": "The Dead Sea Scrolls are comprised of tens of thousands of fragments, and most of the work by scholars over the last near-century since there discovery has been putting together this frustratingly incomplete jigsaw puzzle. One of the most captivating texts in the Scrolls is The War Scroll—a collection of rituals, songs instructions and inventories for fighting the war between the Sons of Light and Darkness in the Last Days. The War Scroll was found in Cave 1Q, but there were also copies discovered in Cave 4Q, including 4Q491.\nThis is a lecture that I gave in Göttingen in 2017 about the process, problems and some of the surprising and interesting results in working with fragmentary manuscripts. Using 4Q491 as a test case, I show how much this manuscript has been misunderstood by scholars, and how much a careful reconstruction changes our perspective of The War Scroll.\n\nAs always, Q&A will follow.

    "description": "In Isaiah 6:1, the Prophet says: \"In the year that King Uzziah died I saw YHWH sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his ****** filled the temple.\"\n\nAlmost all translators and biblical scholars tell us that while a puzzling word used here, it most likely refers to the enormous length of YHWH's robes, which seem to overwhelm Isaiah. But Francesca Stavrakopoulou has most recently revived an older, much more scandalous reading of this story that practically set the Refromed- and Ortho-Bros collective hair and giant beards on fire.\n\nSo, what did Isaiah actually see, when he saw his vision of God?

    "description": "Between 1996–2014, private collectors managed to successfully purchase over a hundred fragments claimed to belong to the Dead Sea Scrolls, and nearly all of them have turned out to be modern forgeries. After millions of dollars changed hands, years of scholarly promotion followed by investigation, and eventually embarrassing lawsuits, the story of the post-2002 Dead Sea Scrolls-like forgeries is a cautionary tale about provenance, trafficking, devotion and greed. Who was behind this shocking fraud?\n\nJoin me and @Vishanti for a special live discussion with Erin Thompson, America's only professor of art crime at CUNY, who is currently working on a fascinating book project that tracks this incredible tale among others in the shady world of antiquities markets.\n\nProf. Thompson will be on hand to answer your questions at the end of the show.

    "description": "There are plenty of online Christian apologetic channels who are determined to have us all believe that modern, critical theories about the origins and formation of the Torah and the rest of the Bible are baseless nonsense; that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, and all the claims of traditional authorship and history in the texts can be accepted on the face of it. Of course, most of the time, these desperate promotions are bereft of scholarship, and fail to adequately address the evidence.\n\nJoin me and @Vishanti  for a special live discussion with Union Seminary Professor of Hebrew Bible David M. Carr, who will help us to set the reconrd straight about the many questions of scribal practices and scholarly theories about the Pentateuch.

    "description": "Does the archaeological picture of Canaan at the end of the Bronze Age support the biblical narrative of the Conquest in the Book of Joshua? This has been frequently and loudly claimed by apologists @InspiringPhilosophy But, recently, my colleague Dr. Joshua Bowen from @DigitalHammurabi and I had the rare opportunity to discuss these issues with a luminary in the field to set the record straight.\n\nAmihai Mazar is Professor Emeritus in the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the holder of the Eleazar Sukenik Chair of Archaeology. He was the director of excavations at Tell Qasile, Tel Batash (biblical Timnah), Tel Beth Shean and Tel Rehov. His primary fields of research are in the Levant of the Bronze and Iron Ages, the periods of Israelite emergence and statehood, and the relationship between archaeology and the Hebrew Bible. Prof. Mazar has written and published prolifically, including his bestselling Archaeology of the Land of the Bible (1990) and The Quest for the Historical Israel (2007, with Israel Finkelstein). He is the former editor of Qadmoniot (1994–1995), and was a co-editor of the Israel Exploration Journal (2010–2015). He is the recipient of the Israel Prize in Archaeological Research (2009), and a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n04:25 Interview with Prof. Mazar\n40:00 Post-interview discussion about a 2023 publication by Lorenzo Nigro\n\nDr. Josh's links can all be found @https://www.digitalhammurabi.com, and support his work @https://www.patreon.com/digitalhammurabi \n\nI have Channel Memberships!

It is the largest, most comprehensive ethnographic survey of this specific sub-culture and how they interact with Christianity.\n\nIn today's show, Jon will summarise his work and his findings, and we will more narrowly discuss the intersection of his research with my own scholarly appraisals of Christian apologetics.

    "description": "Josh McDowell is one of the most recognisable Evangelical apologists of the last half-century, and he is renowned in part for his usage of ancient manuscript studies to fortify a number of his exaggerated claims about the New Testament and Christianity. McDowell is a private manuscript collector in his own right, and he involved himself in the recent controversy surrounding the popularisation of a supposedly first-century manuscript fragment of the Gospel of Mark.\nhttps://youtu.be/uC_SgXKYjk4\n\nFollow the link, and join Dr. Kipp Davis as he tracks McDowell’s history with ancient manuscripts parallel to the recent history of controversial biblical manuscript finds and forgeries, and deconstructs how he has manipulated this history to rewrite his own conversion narrative.\n\n\"Josh McDowell: Manuscript Hunting and Mythmaking for Jesus\" was produced with funding from the \"Lying Pen of Scribes\" NFR FRIPRO Toppforsk Project at the University of Agder.",

Ehrman, in which we discuss the Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament, and his experience in the \"First Century Mark\" controversy from 2012.\r\r\n\nProf. Ehrman will be hosting an all-day webinar this Sunday, 5 December, titled \"Did the Christmas Story Really Happen?” This will be a series of four online lectures complete with an open Q&A; it is a tremendous opportunity to learn from and interact directly with one of the world’s most recognisable biblical scholars. Registration is limited, so please follow the link below to Prof. Ehrman’s webpage in order to get in on this special event.\n\n\r\rhttps://www.bartdehrman.com/did-the-christmas-story-really-happen-webinar/\n\nIf you haven't already seen it, be sure to check out my documentary that I mentioned in the interview about First Century Mark: \"Josh McDowell: Manuscript Hunting and Mythmaking for Jesus\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC_SgXKYjk4",

    "title": "Josh McDowell: Manuscript Hunting and Mythmaking for Jesus",
    "description": "Josh McDowell is one of the most recognisable Evangelical apologists of the last half-century, and he is renowned in part for his usage of ancient manuscript studies to fortify a number of his exaggerated claims about the New Testament and Christianity. McDowell is a private manuscript collector in his own right, and he involved himself in the recent controversy surrounding the popularisation of a supposedly first-century manuscript fragment of the Gospel of Mark. Join Dr. Kipp Davis as he tracks McDowell’s history with ancient manuscripts parallel to the recent history of controversial biblical manuscript finds and forgeries, and deconstructs how he has manipulated this history to rewrite his own conversion narrative.\n\nDr. Kipp Davis is a senior researcher with the Lying Pen of Scribes Toppforsk project at the University of Agder. He is a specialist in early Jewish manuscripts and history, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently has been on the cutting edge of forgeries research in biblical antiquities. He is widely published, and his work has been featured in popular media outlets like The Guardian, Science, CNN, CBSNews, and PBS Nova. Dr. Davis holds a PhD from the University of Manchester (2009), and presently resides and works in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nOriginal music by Jordan Davis of tempoTronix: https://tempotronix.bandcamp.com\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tempotronix\n\nWith funding provided by The Lying Pen of Scribes: Manuscript Forgeries, Digital Imaging and Critical Provenance Research (RCN FRIPRO Toppforsk 2019–2024: https://lyingpen.uia.no)\n\nThe voice for Josh McDowell was provided by Derek Lambert of Mythvision podcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWVCimOe67LOfyi9PjUeGgA\n\nvideo sources:\n“The Bible: Fact, Fiction or Fable? or, Was He a Lunatic,” 24 March, 2013, Gracespring Church  (https://vimeo.com/62646535?utm_campaign=2617611&utm_source=affiliate&utm_channel=affili ate&cjevent=dded93870ee311ea83 a601980a1c0e0b)\n\n“Josh McDowell Testimony Part 2” — Josh McDowell (22 Oct, 2008, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v =oy_T4r8u9dA)\n\n\"Josh McDowell: Undaunted: A Journey from Skepticism to Faith – Biola University Chapel” — BiolaUniversity (23 Mar, 2012, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xORJALbxuS4)\n\n“Josh McDowell’s Story (updated)” — Josh McDowell (29 Jan, 2013, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= WhJ9HkaR8Gg)\n\n“Josh McDowell Testimony – Session 1” — Women’s Bible Study (17 Jan, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jee1tg2pAls)\n\n“Testimonio Josh McDowell” —CRU Argentina (24 May, 2019, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= YRNxXmidiVg&)\n\n“Josh McDowell’s Testimony | IDC 2021” — Christ’s Commission Fellowship (2 Feb, 2021, https://www.you tube.com/watch?v=9H6NjZx9xmQ)\n\n“Debate – Josh McDowell vs. Ahmed Deedat: Was Jesus Crucified?” — Radical Truth (17 Apr, 2013, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E-lNVbv1r4)\n\n“Is the Original New Testament Lost? :: A Dialogue with Dr. Bart Ehrman & Dr. Daniel Wallace” — ehrmanproject (13 Feb, 2012, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg-dJA3SnTA)\n\n\"Discover the Evidence: 200 Biblical and Classical Manuscripts Discovered\" — Josh McDowell: A CRU Ministy (https://www.josh.org/resources/apologetics/discover-the-evidence/)",

    "description": "This is a response to two videos uploaded by Christian apologist SJ Thomason. The first seeks to establish Psalm 110 as a messianic prophecy, and the second attempts to reconcile the contradictory orders of creation in Genesis 1 and 2. As I demonstrate throughout, Thomason's work suffers greatly from her very poor understanding of biblical Hebrew, and of the history and culture of the region.\n\nOriginal videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EDEYdQ85Ec\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSHzcmc8TGI",
