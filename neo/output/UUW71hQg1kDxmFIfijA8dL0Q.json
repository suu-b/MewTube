I was re-reading the Boespflug and Jackson article the other day (since I wrote this video from some previous notes I had made) and I think they had got a lot of their information from there. Sorry about this, it was stupid of me and I apologize. I now have a policy of if I ask someone for help with a video, I request a list of their sources. Nonetheless, my videos are my responsibility, and this was a failure on my part.

Here is a translators introduction where they make that very argument: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property. Here is another https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2007.11.001. I’ve also cut the bit about Stirner’s ‘racism’ since having done a bit more reading I’ve become convinced of the satirical interpretation of that. Additionally, if I were writing this again, I would probably not say that he is “often” thought to have influenced Nietzsche and the existentialists. While there is some evidence for this, I think I overstate things here, and it would be better to have said something like “there are some connections between these philosophies”. In hindsight, I am also quite unhappy with my presentation of Feuerbach. I would not say that he found these things “inherently” desirable, but rather that we just do desire them, out of our human essence.\n\nThere are few philosophers who are as controversial as Max Stirner, and his philosophy of egoism. He has managed to influence existentialism, anarchism, and more, and yet his ideas also tend to produce revulsion wherever they appear.\n\nBut does this philosophy hold up to scrutiny, and how should we approach it today? Well, let's find out.\n\nSupport me on Patreon here (you lovely person): https://patreon.com/UnsolicitedAdvice701?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\n\nSubscribe to my Substack here for more of my writings (and my scripts): https://josephfolley.substack.com/\n\n00:00 The Ego and Its Own\n01:03 The Development of Humanity\n09:59 The Tyranny of Ideas\n17:59 Egoism and Agency\n24:40 Stirner Under Fire",

    "description": "Philosophers are often thought of as truth-seekers, but often people are more interested in the mucky world of simple debate, and there is a sardonic, sarcastic essay by Schopenhauer that can help us out here - \"On the Art of Being Right\". In here he compiles a series of tactics used (often highly dishonestly) to secure victory in an argument even when one is misinformed, or just downright wrong. And this is just what we will look at today, so that we can learn how to destroy anyone in an argument. And also, why we probably shouldn't\n\nSupport me on Patreon here (thank you you wonderful person): https://patreon.com/UnsolicitedAdvice701?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\n\nSign up to my email list for more philosophy to improve your life: https://forms.gle/YYfaCaiQw9r6YfkN7\n\n00:00 The Art of Being Right\n01:32 \"So What You're Saying Is...\"\n03:43 \"What I'm Saying is...\"\n06:02 Endless Questions\n09:09 Control the Metaphors\n13:05 The \"Strength\" of Common Sense\n15:36 Interru-\n17:14 Make Your Opponent Angry\n19:04 Toss a Word Salad\n21:14 Miscellaneous Pointers\n23:18 The Lessons of Deceit",

    "description": "The first 500 people to use my link will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare https://skl.sh/unsolicitedadvice04241\n\nThere have been few public intellectuals who are quite as well-respected as Robert Sapolsky. He is clear in his argument, precise in his speech, and persuasive in his claims. Here we will look at his most recent book: Determined: Life without Freewill. It is one of my favourite popular philosophy books I have ever read, and while I don't entirely agree with Sapolsky's conclusions, he is a brilliant writer and I really hope he decides to try his hand at more philosophical debates. He argues that if determinism is true, then despite all appearances, we are not responsible for our actions.\n\nThank you once again to Skillshare for sponsoring this video.\n\nSupport me on Patreon here (thank you you wonderful person): https://patreon.com/UnsolicitedAdvice701?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link\n\nSign up to my email list for more philosophy to improve your life: https://forms.gle/YYfaCaiQw9r6YfkN7\n\nDavid and Choi paper referenced: https://www.jstor.org/stable/25655385?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n\n00:00 Determined\n01:35 The Freewill Debate\n07:07 Determinism and Moral Responsibility\n16:52 Freewill and The Law\n23:33 Conceptions of Will and Responsibility",

And this is a shame because it prevents us having clear and precise conversations about what is perhaps one of the most important philosophical issues of the past 200 years.

Once we know this, it becomes much easier to see solutions to it.\n\nI hope you found the video helpful and stick around for thinking to improve your life.\n\nAnd subscribe to my email list here: https://forms.gle/ju7C977ouTTqkRnHA\n\nStock footage by Videvo.com (that which was not filmed by me)\nSound effects from Pixabay",

Stoics placed huge value on self-knowledge, including knowledge of your emotions. This is because they ultimately did not want to suppress their emotions, but treat them as information.\n\nIf you are angry, that tells you something! It tells you that there is something happening which is against your values.\n\nIf you are scared, it tells you that there is something you perceive as a threat.\n\nAll the Stoics said is that we should not be carried away by these emotions, but should take a step back, ask why we feel the way we do, and then decide a course of action.\n\nIt is quite similar to the methods taught in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and no one accuses them of suppressing their feelings.",

Luckily, as with most things, some philosophers are on hand to help us through this difficult psychological state. From Schopenhauer to Montaigne to Nietzsche to Pascal, there are a whole host of thinkers on hand to help us deal with loneliness like a philosopher.\n\nWe will begin with Arthur Schopenhauer, and undeniably quite lonely guy, before moving through Nietzschean thought, Stoicism, the Renaissance stylings of Michel de Montaigne, and finally ending on some wisdom from mathematician Blaise Pascal.\n\nWith loneliness as an increasing epidemic in our society, what better time to learn how to deal with it with a calm mind. To see its upsides, acknowledge its downsides, and greet it as a necessary but sometimes unpleasant part of life. In short, how can we all greet loneliness a little more philosophically? I hope by the end of this video, you will have a better answer to this question than at the beginning.\n\nAnd if you liked it, stick around the channel for more on philosophy to improve your life.",

Once they could reliably feed themselves, had a roof over their head, and had a small collection of good friends, nothing they gained seemed to make them any happier.\n\nEpicurus had accurately identified the phenomenon of hedonic adaptation, where beyond having their bare necessities covered, people very quickly adapt to new material fortune, and it loses its ability to make them happy.\n\nIf you don’t know this, you could spend your whole life chasing things that will never make you happy….good job you watched this then, really.",

The straw man is where someone takes your argument, and mischaracterises it as a much more extreme and less reasonable position than you actually stated.\n\nThis is when someone gives an argument that we might want to fight climate change only for the other person to throw up their hands and say “so you want us to stop using all plastics? Just overnight?”. Of course, this is obviously not what they meant. But it is easy to have an argument where no one is actually addressing their opponent’s position, and instead spend all their time hacking at straw men.\n\nSo the next time you are arguing with someone, ask yourself if you are being charitable to their position, or are you strawmanning what they are saying. You can check whether you understand what they are saying by repeating your understanding of it back to them and asking whether that was what they meant.\n\n#cambridgeuniversity #student #logic #philosophy #fallacy",

    "description": "This fallacy pops up in politics all the time. It is the “middle-ground fallacy” and it is when we assume the correct position in an argument is in the middle of all the opposing sides in an argument. This is such a natural human instinct because when we enter a discussion we often use the first things we hear as our anchor points - and if we get two opposing anchor points, then we tend to lay our flag firmly in the middle of them.\n\nThe reason this is a fallacy is because whether something is true bears no relation to what the middle ground between two arguments are. If one of the two positions has arguments that are sound and valid, and the other side has nothing to support their position, then it doesn’t matter what the middle ground between these two arguments are, the substantiated side is clearly right.\n\nRemember that this just means that the middle ground between opposing positions is not always the correct position. It does not mean that it cannot be sometimes used as a rule of thumb.\n\n#cambridgeuniversity #philosophy #logic #fallacy",

The whole group could be evil, but it is not shown through this argument.\n\nHere is a simple example of the same reasoning that is obviously incorrect. I can form a square with two triangles. The fallacy of composition would be to say “one of those triangles has three sides, so the square as a whole must have three sides”. This obviously does not follow: the square has four sides.\n\nSo watch out for this fallacy in the wild.\n\n#logic #philosophy #cambridgeuniversity #fallacy",

    "description": "How much time do you put into improving your logical thinking? Don't be ashamed if the answer is pretty low! We think that we are pretty logical beings, so it does not often occur to us to consciously work on our thinking. But in fact, learning to think better is one of the most valuable things you can do for any goal you wish to achieve. #philosophy #logic \n\nIn this video, I delve into the basics of propositional logic - the simplest logical language - and cover what this language is, what its connectives are, and how we can use it in real-world arguments. #debate #argument \n\nBy the end of this video, you will be able to think better than most people, and with some practice you will navigate the arguments around you with ease.\n\nWhether you are a budding politician, a philosopher, or just someone looking to improve their understanding of the world, this video is definitely for you.",

    "description": "If you are looking for a quicker way to reach a deeper understanding in your studies, then keep watching.\n\nThis technique was used by Richard Feynman to become one of the greatest physicists and educators of his time.\n\nIt comes in 4 steps:\n\nStep 1: pick your topic\n\nStep 2: write everything you know about that topic from memory, as if you were trying to explain it to someone who knew absolutely nothing about the topic. You don’t know true challenge until you’ve tried to explain Nietszche to a 5 year old.\n\nStep 3: Check your notes or textbook to see where the gaps in your summary are.\n\nStep 4: plug the gaps and refine your summary. Add new analogies, look at the topic from new angles, and explain it in new ways.\n\nThis technique forces you to grasp a topic at a deeper level by pretending to explain it to an uninformed 3rd party. Getting into “teaching mode” makes you look at the problem from so many different angles, inevitably giving you “eureka” moments.\n\n#cambridgeuniversity #study #productivity #student",

    "description": "Most people find studying a completely miserable experience. All cooped up by themselves in a dark room hunched over a desk, but it does not have to be like this.\n\nIn fact, you can get more out of your studying by chatting it through with some friends. Gather some people round who are studying the same topic you are, and have a discussion about it.\n\nYou can harvest their perspectives, test one another, and teach one another the aspects of the topic you are most gifted at. And they can help you with what you are struggling with.\n\nIn fact, this is likely even more effective than studying by yourself, while being much more enjoyable. Provided you can keep the discussion focused.\n\nSo say goodbye to days trapped studying by yourself, because…\n\n#study #cambridgeuniversity #productivity #student #studyhacks",

    "description": "This riddle was used by Bertrand Russell to derail one of the greatest mathematical projects of the 20th century. It may also make your head hurt.\n\nThere is a town with one barber. The barber shaves only those men who do not shave themselves. In this town, who shaves the barber?\n\nJust like that the logical trap is sprung. If the barber does not shave himself, then the barber must shave himself, but if he shaves himself, then he cannot shave himself.\n\nIn other words, if the barber shaves himself, then he doesn’t, but if he doesn’t, then he does.\n\nBelieve it or not, this whimsical tale about an imaginary barber made it impossible to ground mathematics in purely uncontroversial logical principles, and caused a debate that still rages to this day.\n\n#cambridgeuniversity #study #productivity #philosophy #logic",

    "description": "Are you sick of studying something for hours, and still not feeling like you are learning anything. Well I am going to show you one of the most effective learning methods known to humankind.\n\nIt sounds grand, but it is actually very simple. It is to teach someone else whatever you are learning.\n\nWhen we teach someone else, we are forced to prioritise information, look at things from different perspectives, and communicate our thoughts on a topic clearly and effectively. All of this cognitive effort tells our brain that this is really useful information that is worth remembering.\nI can’t tell you the number of times I have suddenly grasped something at a much deeper level when I tried explaining it to someone else.\n\nIt is like magic for learning, and very time efficient. Just pull up a friend, or even explain to someone imaginary if you are a social recluse like me.\n\n#study #cambridgeuniversity #productivity #student #teaching",

    "title": "Think like a Cambridge student using logic",
    "description": "While at Cambridge I studied a lot of logic. And it has helped me immeasurably both while I was studying and in my wider life. With logic you can analyse an argument to see if it should be persuasive. You become much more alert to when someone is using rhetorical tricks to win you over, as opposed to cold hard reasoning. Overall, you become a better thinker and a better student.\n\nSo here I share with you the first steps to thinking like a logician. We learn how to put an argument in propositional form, and then how to check it for soundness or validity.\n\nStay tuned to become a better thinker, and a better student, with me.\n\n#cambridgeuniversity #study #logic",
