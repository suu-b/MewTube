(Google Books)\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls are a set of ancient Jewish manuscripts from the Second Temple period. They were discovered over a period of 10 years, between 1946 and 1956, at the Qumran Caves near Ein Feshkha in the West Bank, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea. Dating from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE, the Dead Sea Scrolls include the oldest surviving manuscripts of entire books later included in the biblical canons, including deuterocanonical manuscripts from late Second Temple Judaism and extrabiblical books. At the same time, they cast new light on the emergence of Christianity and of Rabbinic Judaism.

    "description": "To support me on Patreon (thank you): http://www.patreon.com/cosmicskeptic\n\nTo donate to my PayPal (thank you): http://www.paypal.me/cosmicskeptic\n\n- NOTES\n\nAn important correction:\n\n(TL/DR: my first response to Sean's last question was \"there's research in both directions\", which does seem to be true. But I then concluded by saying, \"the studies actually show the opposite\" when I should have said have said, \"some studies appear to show the opposite\". I wasn't speaking carefully and suggested that there is a consensus in the opposite direction. I had based this on work by Jacob Mchangama, but upon review think it at best shows that the results are inconclusive (especially in deducing a causal relationship between free speech and less social conflict and violence, as opposed to mere correlation). This is still a relevant observation, but did not warrant me saying that \"the studies actually show the opposite\". Also the study I cited on terrorism refers to offline free speech, as freedom online is difficult to measure accurately, and the link was found only in democracies, with the results in autocracies being mixed.)\n\nThe study I cited can be found here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0032321720950223#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20freedom%20of,effectively%20gather%20information%20on%20potential\n\nI wanted to say that this study is only conclusive for offline speech, not online speech, and so may have not been a good study to cite in this context. The authors write that \"the relative absence of precise data and open questions regarding how to measure freedom in the cybersphere means that whether freedom of expression in electronic media is different must remain an open question.\"\n\nIt's also worth emphasising that the study found an unambiguous association between increased discursive freedom and reduction in terrorism in democracies, but the results in autocracies are mixed.\n\nAlso, I think it was too strong to say \"the evidence points the other way\":\n\nI had based this on Jacob Mchangama's recent history of free speech in which he writes, \"But while online expression may sometimes lead to real-life harm, it does not necessarily follow that placing restrictions on free speech is an effective remedy. On the contrary, studies suggest that, on the whole, freedom of expression is associated with less rather than more violent extremism and social conflict in democracies. The preventive effect of free speech on terrorist attacks seems particularly strong.\" (Mchangama, \"Free Speech: A Global History From Socrates to Social Media\", Hardback, p. 371)\n\nFor the final claim he cites the study linked above, and for the more general claim he cites his own work which can be found online here: https://www.cato-unbound.org/2018/06/11/jacob-mchangama/how-censorship-crosses-borders/, itself mentioning a then-upcoming study, now published and available here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/r3yvzyt1zfn5e9z/Freedom%20of%20expression%20-%20What%27s%20the%20point_vF.pdf?dl=0\n\nThe study finds that \"some of the most commonly expressed concerns regarding freedom of\nexpression — such as its potential detrimental effects on social conflicts (including genocide), radicalization and terrorism — by and large are not supported by the evidence or the existing research literature\", and that increased freedom of speech is associated with a number of societal benefits and less social conflict in democracies.\n\nMy understanding is that, especially concerning online media, the evidence is unclear and the issue far from settled regarding the influence of free speech on hate crime.\n\nSo, my first statement that \"there's research in both directions\" was accurate, but I said, \"the studies actually show the opposite\" when I should have said have said, \"some studies appear to show the opposite\".\n\n - SPECIAL THANKS\n\nAs always, I would like to direct extra gratitude to my top-tier patrons:\n\nItamar Lev\nEvan Allen\nJohn Early\nDmitry C.\nSeth Balodi\nJames Davis\ng8speedy\nJames Davis\nMouthy Buddha\nSolaf\n\n - CONNECT\n\nMy Website/Blog: http://www.cosmicskeptic.com\n\nSOCIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/cosmicskeptic\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cosmicskeptic\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/cosmicskeptic\nSnapchat: cosmicskeptic\n\nThe Within Reason Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/within-reason/id1458675168\n\n - CONTACT\n\nBusiness email: contact@alexoconnor.com\n\n------------------------------------------",

Most people have heard it, many know what it means, but fewer still are aware of the myriad debates surrounding its meaning, translation, and success. I certainly wasn't before encountering it at university, where I chose to specialise in early modern philosophy.\n\nThis video is an introduction to \"the cogito\", as it is often called, and a brief exploration of some of the debates that surround it.\n\n(A note: I refer to a horse and a horn as a Humean \"simple idea\" - this is not quite right: a simple idea is one which cannot be broken down into further simple ideas (such as colours, smells, etc.). To explain this nuance would have been an irrelevant detour, and the point ought still carry. A unicorn is, to correctly invoke Hume, a complex idea made up of further complex ideas, made up of simple ideas, which originate in simple impressions.)\n\n(Note 2: Some empiricists will claim that knowledge comes *primarily* from our sense data, allowing for some limited a priori knowledge, and still call themselves empiricists.)\n\n---------------RECOMMENDED READING----------------\n\nRené Descartes, \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" (meditations one and two): https://amzn.to/32SiBZd\n\nJohn Cottingham, \"Descartes\" (chapter 2): https://amzn.to/3t8dv5M\n\nGeorges Dicker, \"Descartes: An Analytical And Historical Introduction\" (chapters 1-2): https://amzn.to/3HAv6re\n\nPeter Markie, \"The Cogito and its Importance\", reprinted in the Cambridge Companion to Descartes: https://amzn.to/3ePTuZH\n\nAlso relevant:\n\nFor more information on rationalism - John Cottingham, \"The Rationalists\": https://amzn.to/336jEo5\n\nDavid Hume's epistemology is mentioned, which can be read about in his \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", Book I, Part 1 and Book I, Part III §5: https://amzn.to/3380K0p\n\nBaron Reed's example of psychological certainty is taken from his SEP entry, \"Certainty\": https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/\n\n-------------------------TIMESTAMPS---------------------------\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:05 1: Rationalism\n3:58 2: The Evil Demon\n6:36 3: The Cogito\n10:16 4: Deduction or Intuition?\n15:30 5: A Mistranslation of Descartes?\n18:35 6: Certainty vs Truth\n20:43 Closing\n\n----------------------SPECIAL THANKS------------------------\n\nAs always, I would like to direct extra gratitude to my top-tier patrons:\n\nItamar Lev\nEvan Allen\nFaraz Harsini\nJohn Early\nSveline\nTeymour Beydoun\nAdam Gray\nNolan Kent\nSeth Balodi\nCitizens of Civilization\nJames Davis\n\n-----------------------------CONNECT------------------------------\n\nMy Website/Blog: http://www.cosmicskeptic.com\n\nSOCIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/cosmicskeptic\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cosmicskeptic\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/cosmicskeptic\nSnapchat: cosmicskeptic\n\nThe Cosmic Skeptic Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cosmic-skeptic-podcast/id1458675168\n\n----------------------------CONTACT-------------------------------\n\nBusiness email: contact@cosmicskeptic.com\n\nOr send me something:\n\nAlex O'Connor\nPo Box 1610\nOXFORD\nOX4 9LL\nENGLAND\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Subscribe here for more debates similar to this one: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg\n\nTwo months ago I released a video called 'Could God Be Evil?' (https://youtu.be/xLnsY5io964) in which I discussed a strange and unique angle to the problem of evil for religion. If we would reject the existence of an all-evil god due to the pervasiveness of good in the world, why can't we also reject the existence of an all-good god due to the pervasiveness of evil?\n\nDr. Max Baker-Hytch is a tutor in philosophy at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford University. He co-authored a paper on the so-called 'evil god challenge', objecting to it in various ways. So, he and I had this discussion, to see if the evil god challenge as I originally presented it can hold up.\n\n--------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------\n\nCapturing Christianity: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg\n\n'Could God Be Evil?'

However, his remarkable wit sometimes conceived remarkably poor reasoning, something often unnoticed by those drunk on his elegance.\n\nIn this video, I take three typical examples of sophistic reasoning from Hitchens' various debates and speeches, and break them down to expose their flaws.\n\nIt is unlikely that I will ever cease praising Hitchens as my favourite writer anytime soon; anybody unfamiliar with my work who lands on this video should know that I take deep inspiration from him.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\nIntroduction - 0:00\nThe Moral Argument -- 4:10\nFree Will -- 16:30\nThe Cosmological Argument -- 21:20\n\n--------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------\n\nGalloway vs Hitchens debate: https://youtu.be/XLKQGwVkczg\n'Why Women Aren't Funny': https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/20...\n'Why Women Still Aren't Funny': https://youtu.be/I7izJggqCoA\n'That's your opinion': https://youtu.be/RvAe4UJZl0w?t=25\n\nHitchens, Letter to a Young Contrarian (affiliate link): https://amzn.to/2JP4fMb\n\n[1] 'Christopher Hitchens - The morals of an atheist': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOHgr...\n[2] 'Best of Hitchslap Part 2': https://youtu.be/889eXqS_MtI?t=85 (taken from the debate, 'We'd be better off without religion': https://youtu.be/tWOZi_OUQL8)\n[3] 'Christopher Hitchens destroys the myth that morality comes from religion': https://youtu.be/iG-JLmc4Krw\n[4] 'Christopher Hitchens on Morality': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwaWJ...

    "title": "Antinatalism | Is Life Worth Beginning?",
    "description": "To support me on Patreon (thank you): http://www.patreon.com/cosmicskeptic\n\nTo donate to my PayPal (thank you): http://www.paypal.me/cosmicskeptic\n\nTo purchase Cosmic Skeptic merchandise: https://cosmicskeptic.teemill.com/\n\n--------------------------VIDEO NOTES--------------------------\n\nAntinatalism is the view that it is immoral to have children. Perhaps its most well-known contemporary advocate is David Benatar, whose book 'Better Never To Have Been' advances the 'asymmetry of pleasure and pain,' claiming that, before birth, an unborn person's potential pleasures are morally irrelevant, but their potential suffering matters greatly in our deciding whether or not to bring them into existence.\n\nA useful diagram explaining the asymmetry can be found here: https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/59139/is-benatars-asymmetry-of-pleasure-and-pain-wrong\n\nTo explain this, Benatar asks us to think of Mars, on which there is no life. We do not lament the non-existence of potential pleasure on Mars; it's not a bad thing that there is no pleasure being experienced there. However, arguably, it is a good thing that there is no suffering.\n\nIn other words, to suffer from a lack of pleasure, there must be a person actually existing to do the lacking, whereas to benefit from a lack of pain does not require a potential person to actually exist.\n\nIn this discussion, I speak to Jack Hancock (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_M41aNZ0tDeyP-32aPEIw) about the asymmetry, as well as whether a case for antinatalism can be made if the asymmetry is rejected. On Jack's channel, we spoke about wild animal suffering ('the vegan blindspot'), which is available in the link below.\n\nPlease note these are my preliminary thoughts on antinatalism, which I would like to develop in response to comments on this discussion, and perhaps make a future video expressing more solidified views.\n\n--------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------\n\nDiscussion on Wild Animal Suffering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TaFwHa5ZRs\n\nHumane Hancock's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_M41aNZ0tDeyP-32aPEIw\n\nD.

The Machar Conference is an atheist conference hosted by the Israeli Atheist Association, but the organisers kindly let me speak on veganism, with the leader of the organisation telling me that Christopher Hitchens inspired him to platform a style of thought, rather than a style of talk (it's not what you think, but how you think).\n\nDuring the talk I displayed in realtime the number of animals that had been killed worldwide since I began speaking. Billions of animals are exploited every year for our convenience and entertainment, and nothing could be more ethically obvious than that this must come to an end.\n\nI hope those of you who are not vegan will consider the gravity of this issue, and of our dietary choices, and do what they can to relieve the world of this unnecessary suffering.\n\n--------------------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------------------\n\nRealtime counter of animal deaths: https://thevegancalculator.com/animal-slaughter/\n\n-----------------------------------------CONNECT------------------------------------------\n\nMy Website/Blog: http://www.cosmicskeptic.com\n\nSOCIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/cosmicskeptic\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cosmicskeptic\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/cosmicskeptic\nSnapchat: cosmicskeptic\n\nThe Cosmic Skeptic Podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cosmic-skeptic-podcast/id1458675168\n\n----------------------------------------CONTACT-------------------------------------------\n\nEmail (business only, please): cosmicskeptic@gmail.com\n\nOr send me something (business or personal):\n\nAlex O'Connor\nPo Box 1610\nOXFORD\nOX4 9LL\nENGLAND\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

A great deal of atheistic moral philosophy is predicated on experiences of pleasure and pain, which seem in some instances to come into conflict with a rights-based ethical worldview.\n\nWhat if pleasure is maximised by violating a right? Can we objectively ground human rights without invoking God or religion?

I'm less than convinced.\n\nSome philosophical notes:\n\n1. There is a difference between an argument being deductive and being valid. All examples of deductive arguments I have given are valid (for simplicity of explanation). First characterisation of the logical problem of evil ('I can't think of a reason, therefore there is no reason') is invalid, yet it is clear from the conclusion that he is attempting a deductive rather than an inductive argument. It is therefore an invalid deductive argument. The very point Jon is making is that the conclusion doesn't follow from the premise, implying that it should do in order to be a good argument. If the conclusion must follow to make it a good argument, it is an attempt at deduction.\n\n2. My use of the word 'syllogism' throughout this video is regrettable upon review. A syllogism is technically a formation of a valid deductive argument, not just any formation of any argument (which is how I was using it). If confused, replace my use of 'syllogism' with 'specific version of an argument'.\n\n--------------------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal video: https://youtu.be/FqVAk4kDK8I\n\nAll upcoming events: https://cosmicskeptic.com/events/\n\nInductive/deductive arguments: https://www.iep.utm.edu/ded-ind/\n\nJ.L.

This seems now to be circular, since I'm trying to argue that pleasure is the only thing desired in itself. Rather than simply redefining pleasure to mean what is desired, I'm trying to demonstrated that 'desiring what is pleasurable' is essentially a tautology, so don't take my definition there as a step towards the conclusion of my argument, but the conclusion itself.

The attempts by protestors to prevent access to the talk sparked a debate in the university surrounding the limits of free speech and the right to protest.

One thing is clear, however: those blocking entrances to a talk at a private institution should be ashamed of themselves and think carefully about the lasting repercussions of condoning such behaviour.\n\n--------------------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------------------\n\nBannon's talk: https://youtu.be/8AtOw-xyMo8\n\nMy livestream, interviewing protestors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-DhIhzhdWE\n\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf2kzaE7uOw\n\n-----------------------------------------CONNECT------------------------------------------\n\nMy Website/Blog: http://www.cosmicskeptic.com\n\nSOCIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/cosmicskeptic\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cosmicskeptic\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/cosmicskeptic\nSnapchat: cosmicskeptic\n\n----------------------------------------CONTACT-------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness email: cosmicskeptic@gmail.com\n\nOr send me something:\n\nAlex O'Connor\nPo Box 1610\nOXFORD\nOX4 9LL\nENGLAND\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

He's hosted discussions recently with people such as Jordan Peterson, Derren Brown, N.T. Wright and Steven Pinker in his 'Big Conversation' series, available below.\n\nThis was fairly surface-level, so if you'd like to see a more developed version of Cameron's argument, check the link below. This discussion begins with introductions, then a period of Cameron laying out his argument, before we begin discussing it.\n\nIf you'd like to see a more specific rebuttal of Cameron's argument as written on his website, let me know.\n\n--------------------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------------------\n\nCameron's version of the contingency argument: http://capturingchristianity.com/updated-contingency-argument/\n\nCameron's website: http://capturingchristianity.com/\n\n'The Big Conversation' series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS5E_VeVNzAtoCiw41dJh42efFH-7upue\n\nUnbelievable: https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Saturday/Unbelievable\n\n-----------------------------------------CONNECT------------------------------------------\n\nMy Website/Blog: http://www.cosmicskeptic.com\n\nSOCIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/cosmicskeptic\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cosmicskeptic\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/cosmicskeptic\nSnapchat: cosmicskeptic\n\n----------------------------------------CONTACT-------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness email: cosmicskeptic@gmail.com\n\nOr send me something:\n\nAlexander O'Connor\nPo Box 1610\nOXFORD\nOX4 9LL\nENGLAND\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

This means that there are some points at which we had to briefly stop so I could restart the camera. If you notice any 'jumps' in the footage (which I tried to smoothly edit), this was where we simply stopped for a few seconds and immediately restarted talking.\n\nThis conversation was only supposed to last one hour, but went over. Because of this, the cameras ran out of batteries. Thus, the last section of this video is audio only. Rather than thinking of it as lost video, consider it to be extra audio, since the conversation lasted longer than intended.\n\nWith that said, I hope these issues don't detract from the conversation about nihilism and purpose. Let us know what you think, and be sure to watch our other conversations, on veganism and abortion, on Stephen's and Rachel's channels respectively. \n\n--------------------------------------------LINKS---------------------------------------------\n\nVeganism discussion (Rationality Rules): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ5hFdOSRB8&feature=youtu.be\n\nAbortion discussion (Rachel Oates): (link when available)\n\nRationality Rules: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZMgLgGlYAWvSU8lZ9xiVg\n\nRachel Oates: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC6ue7UYt1yeS621xmTMKrQ\n\n-----------------------------------------CONNECT------------------------------------------\n\nMy Website/Blog: http://www.cosmicskeptic.com\n\nSOCIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/cosmicskeptic\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/cosmicskeptic\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/cosmicskeptic\nSnapchat: cosmicskeptic\n\n----------------------------------------CONTACT-------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness email: cosmicskeptic@gmail.com\n\nOr send me something:\n\nAlex O'Connor\nPo Box 1610\nOXFORD\nOX4 9LL\nENGLAND\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "description": "A video captioned 'This guy might have just proved in one video that God actually exists!' has recently been circulating on social media, and although he does bring up some interesting topics, I must say that this guy doesn't really seem to fulfil the claim.

Yet I must say that I have never before come across such an audacious claim that not only does the problem of evil not disprove God, but that it in fact does the opposite and proves the authenticity of theism.\n\nI'd like to give appropriate thanks to the two individuals who designed and created my logos.

    "description": "The argument from apparent design, or teleological argument, is commonly employed by the religious in debate. It has an appealing premise, but given enough thought can be easily confronted and tackled. How is Earth so finely tuned to support human life? Why are the laws of physics perfect for the interaction of celestial bodies? Was the universe intelligently designed or did it come about through natural processes? These are the questions that we discuss in today's video.\n\nI cannot sufficiently express my gratitude towards all those who have shared and supported my channel over the past few days.

Fortunately, there is a great and incredibly effective way to deal with these contradictions; you simply ignore or deny them. I don't think this man is necessarily trying to be malicious, but even if the harm that this way of thinking causes is not intentional, I still feel as though I can't just let it be.

    "description": "Logical paradoxes are great fun to think about. There are many, many famous paradoxes, and many much less popular. In this video, I have collected 7 of my personal favourites, involving maths, words, time travel and physics.

    "description": "Certain types of prayer are almost certainly futile. This is plain to see when we consider the purpose of prayer along with the capabilities attributed to the gods of Abrahamic scripture. If you belong to one of the three dominant religions of today, I hope this gives you something to chew on.\n\nIf you are finding it difficult to understand this principle and why this type of prayer is a paradox, a more detailed explanation is available at https://chokethemotion.wordpress.com/the-paradox-of-prayer\n\nSubscribe for more critical thinking.
