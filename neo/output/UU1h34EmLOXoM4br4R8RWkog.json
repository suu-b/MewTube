    "description": "About two months before the 2024 election, Eric Weinstein appeared on the Chris Williamson podcast and put forward a provocative theory suggesting that the international world order is exerting control over the West. Notably he said that Trump was not going to be allowed to be president. \n\n In this video, I offer my reaction to his statements.During the discussion, Weinstein employed what can be described as a form of \"epistemic terrorism,\" making vague and hyperbolic references to historical conspiracies without offering substantive clarity. He proposed questionable epistemic norms while dismissing more constructive approaches, belittling frameworks that promote critical thinking. His appearance garnered significant attention, with over 10 million viewers tuning in to the episode.\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mon037895046\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Z5x2FgY4Gm\n\nSubstack: https://mon0.substack.com/",

    "description": "I have gone back and forth with what I think about Postmodernism for some time now but I think it could be helpful to make my thoughts public. \nPostmodernism is generally understood to be a cultural and intellectual tradition that challenges ideas of objective truth, grand narratives, and fixed meanings. It emphasizes relativity, diversity, and the deconstruction of traditional structures, blending irony, fragmentation, and blurred boundaries across art, literature, and philosophy.  \n\nThe main problem we will deal with in this video is the form with which some philosophers (but not only) present their thoughts. \nThe worry is that getting used to a certain form has broad societal implications. \n\nFor more examples of obscuring form see Fashionable Nonsense the book by Sokal and Bricmont.\n\nFor algorithmic reasons I think it might be useful for me to mention here Derrida, Foucault, the Sokal Hoax, Daniel Dennett, Thomas Nagle, Martha Nussbaum.\n\nReferences: \n\n[1]  Article by Dan Sperber I mentioned in the video:\nhttp://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010_the-guru-effect.pdf\n\nDaniel Dennett: \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/12/daniel-dennett-politics-bacteria-bach-back-dawkins-trump-interview\n\nJohn Searle: \nhttps://reason.com/2000/02/01/reality-principles-an-intervie/\n\nThomas Nagel:\nhttps://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/nagel.html\n\nMartha Nussbaum:\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/150687/professor-parody\n\n[2]  Foucault's quote: \nhttps://reason.com/2000/02/01/reality-principles-an-intervie/\n\n[3] The Letter against Derrida's Honorary Degree:\nhttps://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2016/03/the-letter-against-derridas-honorary-degree.html\n\n[4] Fashionable Nonsense: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashionable_Nonsense\n\n\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Mon037895046\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.gg/Z5x2FgY4Gm\nSubstack:\nhttps://mon0.substack.com/",

    "description": "This video is a response to a video essay by Dr. Fatima who vehemently criticized Alan Sokal and the Sokal Hoax. I believe Dr. Fatima (who labels herself as a postmodernist) makes many misleading comments in her video, my aim is to straighten the record a bit to benefit the general public. \n\nThe Sokal Hoax refers to an academic prank orchestrated by physicist Alan Sokal in 1996 to criticize the lack of intellectual rigor in certain areas of postmodern cultural studies. Sokal submitted a deliberately nonsensical paper titled \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\" to the journal Social Text, a publication in cultural studies. The paper was filled with jargon and absurd claims, suggesting that quantum gravity had cultural and political implications, but it lacked any real scientific basis. To Sokal’s surprise, the journal published the paper. Afterward, Sokal revealed the hoax, sparking a heated debate about academic standards, the divide between the sciences, critical theory and culture studies, and the role of postmodernism in scholarship.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nSokal's paper\nhttps://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html\n\n[1] Response of the editors to the Sokal Hoax:\n\nhttps://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf\n\n[2] Sokal on his own parody:\n\nhttps://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/noretta.html\n\n[3]  Chomsky on Postmodernism:\n\nhttp://bactra.org/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html\n\n\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mon037895046\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Z5x2FgY4Gm\nSubstack: https://mon0.substack.com/",

    "description": "Today we look at a paper entitled \"The Origins and Consequences of Affective Polarization in the United States\", it's the most cited paper since 2010 in the annual volumes of political science. Its abstract reads as follows:\n\nWhile previously polarization was primarily seen only in issue-based terms,a new type of division has emerged in the mass public in recent years: Ordinary Americans increasingly dislike and distrust those from the other party.Democrats and Republicans both say that the other party’s members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere. Finally, we discuss strategies that might mitigate partisan discord and conclude with suggestions for future work.\n\nlink to paper: https://pcl.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj22066/files/media/file/iyengar-ar-origins.pdf\n\nlink to other citations: https://perceptiongap.us/media/zaslaroc/perception-gap-report-1-0-3.pdf\n\nLink to NORC nationwide poll video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmxSDK6sL08\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:49 Partisan social identity\n3:05 Causes of affective polarization\n7:20 Decreasing affective polarization\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/Mon037895046\n\nDiscord:https://discord.gg/Z5x2FgY4Gm\n\nSubstack:https://mon0.substack.com/",

    "description": "This video is about obscurantism in continental philosophy, focusing on the postmodern tradition. We explore the challenges faced by John Searle, \na renowned philosopher of language (analytic tradition) as he grappled with the texts of postmodernists. His struggle was so profound that at one juncture, he even queried Michel Foucault about the seemingly poor quality of their writing. The answer Foucault gave to him, if true, is revealing of a certain practice that may call into question the works of certain philosophers of the continental tradition. After hearing Foucault's response I soured a bit on postmodern philosophy. \n\nAlso, I must say I don't know exactly if Foucault and Searle became friends in the 80's or before.

    "description": "The landscape of modern politics can be a bit overwhelming and confusing, in the 21st century we have so many different choices to make regarding who to listen to and which information sources merit our trust.\nIn the video, we informally propose a novel psychological conceptualization of the political sphere based on dual process theory.\nWe then argue that viewing politics through our proposed framework (the system 1 versus system 2 spectrum) can be illuminating, especially considering the developments of the past 20 years. \nAlthough our psychological paradigm isn't merely a tool to understand the development of modern politics, but its application at an individual level could hopefully improve the filter mechanisms behind what sources of information we trust.\n\nOh yes, we also talk about metacognitive abilities. \n\n“He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion... Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them...he must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form.”\n― John Stuart Mill, On Liberty \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlink to a metacognitive type test:  https://calibration-practice.neocities.org/\n\nReferenced works:\n\nMetacognitive Failure as a Feature of Those Holding Radical Beliefs,\nMax Rollwage, Raymond J.

    "description": "Just a brief summary of my current metaethical position.\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n1) The tactic we used to define what is morally true is inspired by the counterarguments of relativists and anti-realists to the self-refutation attack. Relativists and anti-realists will \n come up with many clever ways to argue that relativism is not self-refuting or if it is it does not matter. When one claims that they don't live like an anti-realists they can simply shrug it off. \n If we offer to define what is true starting from principles that we seem to share and abide by, then it becomes harder for the anti-realist to defend his position. Perhaps a similar tactic could be used\n in the epistemic domain to defend epistemic normativity.\n \n\n2) We did not stress the fact that the mechanisms with which we create heuristics are ingrained in our cognition but some of our moral biases are obviously socially constructed, for the sake of our enterprise this isn't very problematic: Some heuristics we use are socially constructed others aren't. But perhaps another way to reach first principles in the moral domain could be trying to understand if the intuitions we have are socially constructed or not.\n\n3) Perhaps we should define the moral domain as how we think we should behave towards others (not sure).\n\n4) Some citations are missing, future me will insert them.\n\nLink to document:\n\nhttps://mon0.substack.com/p/utilitarian-naturalism\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Mon037895046\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.gg/Z5x2FgY4Gm\nSubstack:\nhttps://mon0.substack.com/",

    "title": "Peterson's and Chomsky's Critiques of Postmodernism.",
    "description": "We summarize and compare the critical views of Jordan Peterson and Noam Chomsky on Postmodernism. Peterson views Postmodernism as a resentful movement bent on obtaining power within society while Chomsky sees more mundane motives behind the philosophy. The main focus of their criticisms turns out to be strikingly different.\n\nBoth academics broadly generalize when talking about the philosophical current they do not distinguish between say Poststructuralism or Deconstructive Postmodernism. In addition, although both Peterson and Chomsky talk about the relationship between Postmodernists and Power they have in mind two very different kinds of Power. Peterson is talking about the Power to rule over the whole society while Chomsky is talking about academic Power structures. So we did not emphasize this, only formal, similarity.\n\nPersonal Thoughts on Postmodernism: \n\nThere are things I agree with and disagree with in both the criticisms of Chomsky and Peterson. \n\nEveryone who works in academia knows that a fair amount of academics want to make a career for themselves out of public relations and get their names on as many papers as possible. There is also a drive to publish papers even if they verge on the nonsensical. This is in part a problem due to the set of incentives academics are placed under but it is also a personal choice of each academic. Such attitudes go on in all academic disciplines but as one moves from the hard sciences to the soft sciences the problem tends to get worse, not because the soft sciences are somehow inferior to the hard sciences but because the soft sciences are more prone to interpretations and make for an easier setting in which to use sophistry. Some of the main ideas that define Postmodernism (relativism, skepticism towards truth and logic)  make Postmodernism the perfect guise to hide under if one wants to play these kinds of games in academia. So many academics that want to game the system may gravitate towards Postmodernism. Thus I agree with Chomsky when he sees the set of incentives as having to do with prestige and material reward but I would not extend the criticism to the whole philosophical enterprise. Although I believe Postmodernists start with some misguided premises some questions they investigate deserve to be investigated. \nA criticism that I would instead extend to much of continental philosophy is to try to be clearer when you write, and less verbose to avoid misinterpretations. Relevant to this is that I don't believe Postmodernists invented identity politics being that they were heavily anti-essences, but it is possible that their focus on Power inspired identity politics.\nWhere, instead, I disagree more with Chomsky and align more with Peterson is on the societal implications of bad academic practices. The use of sophistry in academia seeps right down to the whole of society and it corrupts people's ability to reason, at all levels, leading people to hold absurd beliefs.\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Mon037895046\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.gg/Z5x2FgY4Gm\nSubstack:\nhttps://mon0.substack.com/",

    "title": "You're probably an anarchist (under Chomsky's conception)",
    "description": "In this video, we give a quick introduction to the form of anarchism espoused by Noam Chomsky.  He has a broad definition of anarchism that is hard to disagree with, indeed he believes that, in principle, it is universally accepted but not universally practiced. Interestingly, for Chomsky, his conception of anarchism is inspired by enlightenment principles from Rosseau to Adam Smith. Chomsk's view of anarchism is more that of a philosophy of life than a specific societal goal, dismantling unjust power structures one at a time we should gradually reach a more just and free society.\n\nPersonal doubts: \nConcerning \"renting yourself to survive\" it seems to me that humans, during their entire history, had to prove their worth to the tribe (only those at the apex of some power structure could get by being useless). Crucially I suspect that thinking you are useful to the community is deeply tied to happiness so it seems like we are always going to be tied to some form of proving our worth to be happy. Maybe, I don't know.\n\nConcerning freedom I'm not sure we enjoy too much freedom, it's strange, certainly a certain level of freedom is good but when one has too many choices all the time I believe it can have weird negative effects. I would not put freedom as an absolute atm. \nAlso, I tend to agree that all humans are naturally creative but I'm not sure every human wants to delve deep into that creativity.

    "description": "We give a brief and simplified overview of an article by Kevin Korb entitled \"Bayesian Informal Logic and Fallacy\".\n\nAbstract: Bayesian reasoning has been\napplied formally to statistical inference,\nmachine learning and analysing the scientific\nmethod. Here I apply it informally to more\ncommon forms of inference, namely natural\nlanguage arguments. I analyse a variety of\ntraditional fallacies, deductive, inductive and\ncausal, and find more merit in them than is\ngenerally acknowledged. Bayesian\nprinciples provide a framework for\nunderstanding ordinary arguments which is\nwell worth developing.\n\nWe keep the bayesian talk until the end of the video to, hopefully, make the video more accessible while retaining the primary contribution of the article.\n\nLink to article: https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/bayes/2003-korb.pdf\n\n\nUlterior thoughts:\n\n1)  The cases I thought of when an ad hominem makes sense are when we have finite capacities (court example) so that we are unable to check if a certain premise is true (\"I saw the victim slip and crack his head, trust me\") and when we are under time constraints so that even if we could analyze the argument in its totality it would be unproductive to do so.

    "description": "This is a video of the playlist: \"In Defense of Utilitarianism\". The playlist is meant to be a lighthearted introduction to the Utilitarian theory, with some bad humor, where we analyze some of the strongest counterarguments and counterexamples that have been made against it. The novelty and complexity of the playlist will scale up with the video number. \nThe intent is educational, both for me- I can be corrected or critiqued by the audience- than for the audience - that may learn something new.\nAll serious criticism is welcomed and criticism regarding the utilitarian moral theory will be answered in a separate video.\n\n\nAbstract: \nIn \"Utilitarianism: For and Against\" Bernard Williams raises an issue pertaining to act-consequentialist moral theories: whether they are able to account for the integrity of agents. To showcase his point, Williams constructs two examples, such that applying a consequentialist framework to them, leaves no trace of the value of integrity. We will argue that, in his consequentialist calculations, Williams does not give sufficient relevance to the second-order effects of actions. Second-order effects are of tantamount importance if one wants to account for changes in societal norms and integrity is often the basis for such changes to start taking place. Having integrity produces real palpable consequences.\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n1) Another way I have heard to answer the dilemmas posed by Williams is to say that \"even if one is going to do something bad if you don't do it this does not exonerate you for performing the bad action in his place\".  Problem is that usually (?) Utilitarians usually construct the theory evaluating the morality of actions, not actors (there are of course ways to extend the theory to actors). So this defense would require other considerations that were outside of the scope of the video.\n\n2) These counterexamples given by Williams were a strong motivating reason for me to explicit the utility of rules in the felicific calculus. Considering the \"rule erosion component\" and in general the second-order effects of actions allows one to grasp the theory more clearly.",

    "title": "There is a HOMOTOPY between Utilitarianism and Deontology?",
    "description": "Short video where I explain another reason why I like to consider second-order consequences of actions through the rule erosion component in the felicific calculus.\n\nHopefully, it's theoretically enjoyable stuff.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n1) We are not being overly precise with the notation for the sake of not bringing too much to the table. If one wanted to be more accurate we would say that the equation we have been using to think about the expected utility of actions really is\n\nE[Utilityaction] = p_1 U -  1_{b}  p_b R   + 1_{nb}   p_a R   \n\nwhere 1_{b} and 1_{nb} are indicator functions over the cases that one breaks a social rule through an action or doesn't.  This equation, considered as a function of R, would unfortunately not be continuous everywhere but I believe that a single discontinuity is not really a problem to talk about a homotopy between functions.\nAlso, p_b and p_a are not \"only\" probabilities but also represent the percentage of erosion a certain action would have on a certain rule. Whatever, no big deal.\nAlso, we are considering actions that are either follow the naive deontology rules or that break them. Only on these actions does the homotopy hold but that was obvious.\n\n2) As we will discuss in future videos, accounting for second-order consequences (rule erosion component) I believe Utilitarianism can overcome the integrity objection raised by Bernard Williams. \n\n3) It seems superfluous to say that a naive version of virtue ethics that defines an action as moral if it follows a set of virtues V_1, V_2, ..., V_n could also be generalized by our framework by simply considering the virtues as societal norms (turns out that virtue ethics is now the most popular moral theory among professional philosophers).\n\n4) I believe, depending on the definition of threshold deontology, that a \"rule erosion Utilitarian framework\" might turn out to be isomorphically equivalent to it, if the threshold is defined as the utility the rule is producing. But I am not interested in \"formalizing\" this atm (funny to be calling what I am doing formalizing haha).",

    "description": "Talk I had with, PhD student in philosophy, Kane b. we discussed metaethics, moral antirealism, and the PhilPapers survey. \n\n\n\nLink to Kane's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/kanebaker91\n\n\nLink to PhilPapers survey: https://survey2020.philpeople.org/\n\n\n\nThoughts: \n\n1) Should put the mic farther away from my face.\n\n2) Kane objected to the idea of innate moral structures universally present in human nature. An argument he made is: how can an innate structure such as \"in principle, the suffering of any person should not count more than the suffering of any other person\" (a kind of impartiality) arise from an evolutionary process. It seems more likely instead that we would care more about the suffering of the people closest to us (as in fact we do). \nWhat I was trying to get at when answering him is that it's possible the idea of impartiality arises when one combines two, in my opinion, innate features of humans: our ability to reason, and our desire for ourselves and our kin not to suffer. \nWhen we intuitively recognize that unnecessary suffering is bad for us and our kin we can ask ourselves a question: should we consider suffering only bad for us and our kin? Applying our reason to answer this question I believe that we conclude that in principle there is nothing special about our kin and ourselves with respect to other people; we all seem to have ruffly the same sensory experience, we all seem to be able to suffer, why should we privilege, ceteris paribus, some individuals over others? \nThis is why I believe that a statement like \"in principle, the suffering of any person should not count more than the suffering of any other person\" rings intuitively true to most. It arises from combining two different parts of human nature.\nReason, that is itself, likely, a product of evolution, apparently presents this peculiar feature of being able to question, and in this sense transcend, its creator itself. \n\n\n3) I (hopefully) am open to having my mind changed on all my positions, especially metaethics where I am just an amateur, so any moral realist can post their arguments for moral realism and I will definitely take a look.

    "title": "An Argument Against Moral Relativism.",
    "description": "This video is part of the Descriptive Utilitarianism playlist where we argue that Utilitarianism is prominently present in Human behavior. As a matter of fact,  Utilitarian tendencies can be found cross-culturally and at all observed time frames of human existence.\nMaybe the emergent empirical phenomenon we call human morality could be largely explained under the utilitarian paradigm? \n\n\nAbstract:\nMetaethical moral relativism is the claim that the truth or falsity of moral judgments, or their justification, is not absolute or universal, but is relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of a group of persons. This belief is usually justified constructing an argument based on descriptive moral relativism: The observation that, as a matter of empirical fact, there are deep and widespread moral disagreements across different societies, that we can't find any common ground on.\nIn the video, we provide an argument against metaethical moral relativism based on revisiting the strength of descriptive moral relativism. To do so we point out a possible common structure that encompasses the overwhelming majority of societal norms.\n\n\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n\n1) While editing the video I though it could be possible to partially incorporate Foucault's idea of regimes of power into our account. In our case, the regimes of power would have to behave according to some principles, to give rise to the structures underlying the emergence of moral norms. But this is coherent with a shared desire for a happier society, the desire will have the power of the many backing it up. The regimes of power would then be build around this desire with a certain variability given by different initial conditions/variables.\n\n\n2) In his answer to the moral relativist Noam Chomsky also calls into question descriptive moral relativism by appealing to a common human nature. I tend to believe that we could see the idea of goodness as collective well as being implied by human nature or directly included in it.\n\n\n3) Maybe our claims on how moral norms emerge are too strong. We could weaken them slightly by introducing the idea that norms that emerge out of the will to pursue collective happiness are the ones that will likely stand the test of time. So they are the most prevalent.\nOthers will dissipate fairly quickly showing that collective well-being is the \"best\" common currency.\n\n\n4) I tend to believe that the norm internalization phase, at least in the ancient past, was often facilitated by the norm enterpreneur himself (prohet) and associates (disciples) that understood his project. They could have willingly created all sorts of ad hoc arguments (religion) to speed up the process of norm internalization. Agents that are more rational or cunning may, in their view, benevolently \"trick\" less rational humans to encourage a widespread norm cascade.\n\n5) The cultural norm of waging war may also fit into the framework we discuss in the video,\nthe emergence is due to a scarcity of resources and a lack of information regarding other groups of humans. Hundred of thousands of years ago one may conceive of scenarios where war with neighboring tribes might be the best solution to increase well-being in an environment of limited information. Thus the norm may emerge in the service of well-being. \n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nVideo of Noam Chomsky:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63_kAw3WmE\n\n\nThick and Thin: Moral Argument at Home and Abroad, Michael Walzer, 1994.\n\n\nIntuitive ethics: How innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues, J Haidt, C Joseph - Daedalus, 2004 - MIT Press.\n\n\nInternational Norm Dynamics and Political\nChange, Martha Finnemore, Kathryn Sikkink\nInternational Organization ,1998.\n\n\nMoral dumbfounding: when intuition finds no reason, F.

    "description": "This video is part of the applied Utilitarianism playlist, where we take Utilitarianism as our moral theory of choice and explore its implementation in the real world.\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe afterlife is a purported existence in which the essential part of an individual's identity or their stream of consciousness continues to live after the death of their physical body. Abrahamic religions canonically think of the afterlife as divided between a place of eternal rewarding, heaven, and a place of eternal punishment, hell. \nIn this video, we show that the belief in obtaining rewards or punishments in a continued existence after death can completely distort consequentialist reasoning, sometimes incentivizing one to commit some highly dubious actions.\nReligions understood the importance of consequentialist reasoning as a motivation for ethical choices and invented the ideal metaphysical construct to harness it: life after death. With such a belief the deontological approach to morality and the consequentialist one could finally be aligned in their conclusions regarding the morality of actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther comments:\n\n\n1) If we were to gradually substitute religious morality with a consequentialist paradigm we should probably get rid of any dogmatic elements.

    "description": "This video is part of the applied Utilitarianism playlist, where we take Utilitarianism as our moral theory of choice and explore its implementation in the real world.\n\nAbstract:\nIn the field of moral philosophy, there is an age-old tension between the two most renowned approaches to ethics: deontology and consequentialism.\nA deontological moral theory informs individuals on what acts are good or bad based on a series of rules. Rules comprise the moral theory. Instead, a consequentialist moral theory like utilitarianism decides if an action is good or bad based on its consequences.\nCanonically, these two approaches are taught as separate and distinct, but many attempts have been made to unify them.\nIn this video, we aim to show that even an act-consequentialist theory can value deontological type thinking in applied settings. Indeed, we argue that rules and norms should feature prominently in Utilitarian calculations.\n\n\nOther thoughts or comments:\n\n1)\nEmpirically it doesn't seem possible for humans to build a society without norms (even animals have norms) so any consequentialist theory benefits in clarity by explicating its relationship with them.\n\n2)\nI have recently discovered that the specific Utilitarian framework we discuss in this channel has a lot in common with \"Precedent Utilitarianism\" but I couldn't find a reputable source for \"Precedent Utilitarianism\" if anyone knows a bit more about it and its origins please let me know.\n\n3)\nRules are very important and we likely couldn't live without them, but taking them as dogmatic dicta can lead to problems as we have already discussed here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Lj2gkctY0 , with regards to our moral intuitions.\nThis is not the only problem that can arise, we will see others in future videos.",

    "title": "Is Utilitarianism Intrinsic to Human Nature? (non-standard)",
    "description": "This video is part of the Descriptive Utilitarianism playlist where we argue that Utilitarianism is prominently present in Human behavior. As a matter of fact,  Utilitarian tendencies can be found cross-culturally and at all observed time frames of human existence.\nMaybe the emergent empirical phenomenon we call human morality could be largely explained under the utilitarian paradigm? \n\nAbstract:\nConsidered as a superorganism humanity appears to have different behaviors than other life forms. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that humans are extremely well versed- with respect to other species- at problem-solving. We manage to gather information and understand future patterns in a way that does not resemble any other known living organism. We have Reason.\nIn this video, we argue that our unique capacity to reason may explain some of our unique behaviors. In particular, we focus on the descriptive ethical sphere, where we argue that our capacity to consciously apply logic gives rise to Utilitarian tendencies. Utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals.\n\nPersonal thoughts:\n\n1)\nA way one could look at how life forms behave from a macro perspective is through an optimization principle. Population/evolutionary potential/genetic survivability are candidates for the objective of the maximization. They are related to one another, e.g., if life forms acted to maximize their evolutionary potential then the maximization of population would be a by-product of the primary goal of maximizing evolutionary potential.\nIn all cases, a population with a high growth rate would be, ceteris paribus, favored with respect to a population with a lower growth rate, even if the population with a high growth rate had a high death rate.\nFor example, Many animals produce huge quantities of offspring of which the overwhelming majority die: there is a high death rate. (spiders, toads, etc)  What matters is that the growth rate is positive.\nIf superorganisms behave according to this principle then the well-being of the individuals is of secondary importance in achieving the goal.\n\n2) \nHumans display the extraordinary capacity to employ reason, we are so good at utilizing logic with respect to other animals that the human capacity to reason may be considered unique (as we say in the video). This can sometimes suggest a binary idea of reason, either you have it or you don't. We prefer to think of reason as on a spectrum, humans can have more or less of it depending on the individual and so can various other life forms. There is intraspecies variability as well as interspecies variability with humans being the top dogs.\n\n3)\n Quick reminder that when we suggest that human morality can be descriptively seen as Utilitarian we do not mean that humans behave like perfect Utilitarians, rather that we employ utilitarian logic when making reasoned decisions regarding morality (sometimes the decisions are far from optimal under perfect utilitarian logic).\n\n4)\n Other points that were cut from the video regarding the different inclinations of humans and other life forms versus suffering:\n\nHumans could be the only life form to have individual members that commit suicide, the notion that other animals also perform this self-destructive act is debated by the scientific community. Under our conjecture, it would make perfect sense that humans would engage in such behavior more than other species given their focus on well-being instead of the survival of hereditable genetic material.\n\nAlso, Humans seem to be unmatched in how much they care for the suffering of life forms dissimilar to their own. Although it is true that most humans eat other animals it seems like humans also care, to an extent, about their suffering. In the natural world instead, predators will consume prey alive if it's not a bother.  (cut this because I was unsure of its merit)\n\n5)\n There are animals in nature that do not reproduce but there are two ways for individuals to pass their genes to the next generation—either directly, by producing their own\noffspring, or indirectly, by enhancing the offspring production of their relatives.  \n(theory of kin selection)\n\n6)  \nUtilitarian reasoning creates the rules that are a necessity to organize society.\n\nUtilitarianism -- Biological, intrinsic, original \nDeontology -- Cultural, extrinsic, derived\n\n7) \nPeople who don't behave morally may be considered outliers or people who behave amorally. Maybe they could be considered egoistic hedonists viewed as a degenerate form of utilitarians.\n\n8) \n It's understandable when thinking about how things ought to be to \"want\" that we all behaved according to some norms. In practice, we speculate that deontological principles are more useful and transmissible than the utility principle itself.",

    "description": "This video is part of the debate playlist, where we analyze popular discussions. The goal is both to refine and distill the, sometimes quite long, debates we look at and also to critically review their contents. In particular, we focus on how arguments are created and how they can be logically contested, important skills to have for the proper functioning of our society.\n\nSlavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher, a researcher at the Department of Philosophy of the University of Ljubljana Faculty of Arts and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. He is also Global Eminent Scholar at Kyung Hee University in Seoul and Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University. He works in subjects including continental philosophy, psychoanalysis, political theory, cultural studies, art criticism, film criticism, Marxism, Hegelianism and theology. \n\nJordan Bernt Peterson is a Canadian professor of psychology, clinical psychologist, YouTube personality, and author. Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University. After teaching and research at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.\n\nIn the debate, Žižek and Peterson will touch upon the problems of Capitalism. Then they will embark on a discussion on labels and Postmodern Neo-Marxism.To conclude, they will discuss Peterson's focus on personal responsibility (put your room in order) present in his self-help advice.\n\n\nOther Personal Thoughts:\n\n1) It appears possible, as philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti does, to acknowledge that one should not be well adjusted to a messed up society, but before venturing out to change the society, he ought to have his ideas formalized in rigorous order and act coherently with respect to them (he should be in order).\n\n2) Peterson and Žižek mentioned happiness a couple of times in the debate, they both said, in some shape or form, that there needs to be something more than happiness: a meaning. A Hedonistic Utilitarian would simply say that one needs a meaning because it brings happiness, so, in some sense, meaning is already incorporated in the happiness Utilitarians aim to achieve.\nThis is the reason why I prefer talking about Eudaimonia or well-being instead of happiness. The word happiness tends to evoke a narrow hedonistic conception of utility instead, it encompasses much more.\n\n3) I'm thinking of doing a video on Postmodern Neo-Marxism where I give my complete thoughts on the matter.\n\n\n\nLinks and Citations:\n\n\nThe complete debate of Peterson and Žižek:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4\n\nCitation for the first little excerpt :\nRefutation by Parallel Argument, André Juthe, Argumentation (2009).\n\nThe answer to Jordan Peterson's criticism of Marxism given on CCK's philosophy youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2hhrUHSD6o\n\nAn introductory video on Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttnlS8lyZ5w\n\n\n►SOCIALS\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Mon037895046",

In particular, moral issues allow for a wide array of complicated questions and a moral theory should provide an answer, at least in theory, to all of them. A coherent, nuanced moral theory will then naturally tend to capture some complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\n\n1) As a theoretical framework Utilitarianism is not really that complex if we look at other theories.\n\n\n2) The way we defined R is more rigorous than before but it's still a simplification, one could take into account other aspects.

    "description": "This video is part of the Descriptive Utilitarianism playlist where we argue that Utilitarianism is prominently present in Human behavior. As a matter of fact,  Utilitarian tendencies can be found cross-culturally and at all observed time frames of human existence.\nMaybe the emergent empirical phenomenon we call human morality could be largely explained under the utilitarian paradigm? \n\n\n\n\nAbstract: \nMost anthropologists believe that every human society has adopted some form of religion. Furthermore, every religion seems inexorably tied to the ethical sphere. In this video, we propose a Utilitarian interpretation of the origins of religion and argue that it could have been engineered as a scheme to achieve the perceived greater good. \nIn particular, the invention of divine rules simplifies moral issues and plays on the fabric of human nature leveraging the tendency of humans to unconsciously copy members of the same community. In addition, the invention of an all-seeing God could have been a powerful incentive to behave lawfully in societies where law enforcement was scarce. From the precepts to the rituals, most aspects of religion have purposes more relevant to the increase of human well-being than the divine.\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\n\n1) Nothing of real substance for now, I think I could have done a couple of things better but that is always the case. Maybe I should have explained more why rules seem to mesh nicely with human features; aside from being easier to understand and spread, societal rules are unconsciously adopted by humans (even by those who care little about morality) this makes them an extremely powerful tool to influence human behavior. \nRules can make people, who have no will or time (or predisposition) to reason on moral issues, act in their own interest and that of society. They can do a lot of good if specified correctly.\n\n\n\n2)  The video is speculative in nature as is all the descriptive utilitarianism playlist. It's nice (and fun) to try our hand at inferences but they should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\n3) The video is hard to grasp if one does not appreciate the importance of rules in a utilitarian framework. Of course, religion is readily associated with deontology since the precepts are deontological in nature but they could have been specified in such a deontological way for utilitarian reasons. Argh! what I am saying is probably hard to understand but I think I have said what I mean as clearly as I can!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations:\n\nGod is not One, Stephen Prothero, 2010.\n\nThe Bible.\n\nReligion and Crime Studies: Assessing What Has Been Learned,\nMelvina Sumter, Frank Wood, Ingrid Whitaker, and Dianne Berger-Hill, Religions, 2018.\n\nReligious Coping Among Diverse Religions:\nCommonalities and Divergences\nHisham Abu-Raiya Kenneth I.

In defense of Utilitarianism, we provide the two most popular compelling rebuttals that have been explored in the literature.\nThe first questions our moral intuitions on the matter while the second expands on the Utilitarian framework.\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\n\n1) Other than being unelegant thresholds can have their own problems.\nSee http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/\n\nfor an explanation of the issue.\n\n\n2) There might be something to be said for the abstractness of the setting even in the case of the hangnails for torture counterexample, but because we have already stressed how abstract counterexamples can be dismissed (many) other times we chose to focus on other rebuttals.\n\n\n3) Another possible rebuttal I was thinking about while making the video is that simply knowing that a person is being tortured could preclude one from achieving the highest levels of eudaimonia. So a single person being tortured could negatively affect everyone else more than a speck of dust in their eye. Even worse would be if one had the knowledge that a person was tortured to prevent him from getting a speck of dust in their eye.\nIf one were then to assume that the torture was performed in secret the stochastic nature of our world would make it hard for it to be perfectly concealed forever.\n\n\n\n4) We use ordinals numbers to give an intuitive and quick example of a way to introduce thresholds. This may be equivalent to imposing a lexicographic ordering even though there might be some issues related to the fact that the canonical definition of addition on the ordinals is not commutative. Anyway, utilizing ordinals is non-standard, so be wary.\n\n\n5) We should probably choose which rebuttal we think is best. The choice is difficult so maybe tomorrow we will decide. \n\n\n\n\n\n6) Also, there might be something to be said about the fact that, in a real-world scenario, somebody has to \"set up\" the torture, and this \"setting up\" of the torture could carry negative utility than would be in addition to the suffering of the person being tortured.\n\n\n\n\nCitations:\n\n\nLarry S.

    "description": "This video is part of the applied Utilitarianism playlist, where we take Utilitarianism as our moral theory of choice and explore its implementation in the real world.\n(in particular, in this video, we are also assuming that Utilitarianism descriptively guides the creations of norms, a thesis we have defended here \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKGMbOlBuOM)\n\n00:00 Moral intuitions are unreliable\n01:23 We confuse societal norms with morality\n03:00 Felicific calculus\n04:55 Two little sidenotes\n\n\nAbstract:\nJust as our senses before them, our moral intuitions also appear to be fallible, subject to a host of biases, as modern research confirms. From a Utilitarian perspective, we focus on one of these biases: the purported mistake of confusing morality with societal norms, a misunderstanding that creates conflict and flames tribalism.\n We then highlight how easy it is to commit such an error citing some modern studies that statistically analyze the issue.\n To conclude, we propose an initial corrective: reasoned self-questioning. By engaging with critical thinking one may be able to recognize the mistake (if he is \"morally dumbfounded\") and correct it.\n\n\n\nOther thoughts or comments:\n\n\n1) In the first study cited philosophers are subject to the actor-observer bias in the opposite direction than non-philosophers.\n\n\n2) initially, I wanted to explore the idea that biological biases are similar to the mistake of identifying morality with rules by seeing biological biases as rules we can't update (or can update very slowly). Indeed, we know that most of our biological biases would have been useful to us millennia ago.\n\n\n3) The purpose of the video is not to debate whether the rule against incest creates happiness or not, or to advocate for the decriminalization of incest (I am an only son :) ). One can make (Utilitarian) arguments one way or the other.\n\nThe example is simply used to introduce the study on moral dumbfounding. We hypothesize that the reason why in Scotland it is illegal for a half-brother and sister to have sex even if they meet as adults is that the case is so rare it probably escaped regulation.\n\n\n4) For many examples and citations we are taking with full hands from J.

A first way to refute it is to limit the Utilitarian framework to the natural world as we know it; this would be the way of Jhon Rawls. We propose even a second, more forcing way, that consists in imposing directly in the definition of utility the law of diminishing marginal utility and assuming a similar relationship between wealth and happiness for all beings. By doing so, the utility monster can no longer outcompete a human at converting resources into happiness.\n\n\nSome thoughts\n\n1) Imposing the law of diminishing marginal utility in the definition of utility may appear as a hack, but it's allowed. One can do it if he so wishes to. It seems like many people would be more inclined to accept the Utilitarian theory with such an \"assurance\". In fact, assuming the same relationship between happiness and wealth for everybody seems \"moral' to many.\nShowing such a way of proceeding is meant to be provocative and highlights the richness of the Utilitarian theory.\n\n2) Yes, we have stated that, in our framework, we care only for the happiness of humans (to keep it simple...for now). Of course, for the sake of engaging with the example, we are proceeding as if we cared about the happiness of any being.\n\n3) Yes, Jhon Rawls was a deontologist. That does not mean we can't respect his thought and agree with some (or most) of his points.\n\n4) In the future, we will expand the range of the eudaimonic function to include even ordinal numbers, it will prove useful when dealing with the \"Dostoevskij counterexample.\"\n\n5) The role of positive psychology would also be that of aiding in refining the definition of eudaimonia more and more. Included in the definition there should also be an altruistic notion, in the sense that one's aspirations should be useful to others (as is usually the case).\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations:\n\n\nThe utility monster was first described in \n\n\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia, Robert Nozick, 1974.\n\n\nDerek Parfit's words are taken from:\n\n\n“Overpopulation and the Quality of Life.”, Derek Parfit, in P.

As a matter of fact,  Utilitarian tendencies can be found cross-culturally and at all observed time frames of human existence.\nMaybe the emergent empirical phenomenon we call human morality could be largely explained under the utilitarian paradigm? \n\n\n\nThe Utilitarian theory is canonically a normative model of morality. In this video, we analyze its explanatory power by considering it as a Descriptive model. This results in an encompassing historical interpretation of the evolution of our norms and moral beliefs. We then consider some immediate criticisms of this account.\n\n\n\n\nRemarks:\n1)  The account is simplified in many ways for the sake of the exposition of the main idea: the utility principle is not simply given out but may result from evolutionary processes, The reasons why humans group together is also tied to biology and we do not delve into the utilitarian calculations behind each norm, etc., etc.\n\n\n2)  Of course we were assuming that the humanoids have similar traits to the humans, like apophenia: the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things.\n\n\n\n3) The information set can also be \"increased\" with education because it is not enough to discover new things if the rule-makers don't know about the discoveries or (sadly) don't believe them. \nOf course, in a democracy, the information set assumes even more relevance. \n\n\n\n4) A mad emperor can institute some useless law like building 100 statues in his honor, this would be an example of a law escaping the paradigm but would it really count as a norm if it lasts for a short period and no one agrees with it? Maybe we could rigorously define the term norm in a way that excludes these cases.\n\n\n5) Personally I like fantasizing that everyone is born with \"a connection\" to the Utility principle and some factors can strengthen or weaken \"the connection\" (more on this in the future).\n\n\n6) We could have also included a fourth arrow in the norm creation process with \"biological biases\" as a factor but it kinda seems redundant in a sense.",

    "title": "Trolleyology, would you push a person in front of the train-tracks to save 3?",
    "description": "The ninth video of the playlist: \"In Defense of Utilitarianism\". This playlist is meant to be a lighthearted and informal introduction to the Utilitarian theory, with some bad humor, in which we analyze some of the strongest counterarguments and counterexamples that have been made against it. \nThe novelty and complexity of the playlist will scale up with the video number.\n\n\nIn the video, we apply our theory to some cases derived from the trolley problem. In these cases, the act utilitarian model we are using seems to match most people's moral intuitions. In particular, we examine the difference between pulling the lever in the standard trolley problem and pushing a person on the train tracks. Originally the video was meant to tackle only the difference between footbridge push and the standard trolley problem, so I just had to overcomplicate it by adding the footbridge switch case.\n\nSome comments:\n\n1) The ending comes off a bit strong. Of course, this little video proves nothing.\n\n2) I wish to clearly say that the video does NOT recite the paper of Greene et all. . The paper deals with experiments examining the effect of personal force on people's moral intuitions, and of course, it is way more precise and serious than the video. Quite interesting too.  \n\n3) Why trust our moral intuitions here? To keep the video brief and thought-provoking. Indeed, they might simply be wrong in holding in such high regard the \"do not use personal force rule\". One can disregard the fact that most people's moral intuitions align with the eudaimonic calculus and simply take the video as an application of the Utilitarian framework. In the future, we will discuss possible mistakes of our moral intuitions more.\n\n4) I have the feeling that the doctrine of double effect is a good principle, at least in the sense that we want the shortest causal link possible performing an action that has both a good and a bad effect. Reason being that, as humans, we deal with the stochastic nature of our world. So we never really know if a foreseeable good event will actually come to fruition. We need to socially discourage this \"end justifies the means\" behavior because, on average, it produces bigger losses of utility than gains.\n\n5) Of course, unconscious realism could play a role in the perceived moral difference in the three scenarios, as said in the video. Also, when pushing a person you aren't really sure on the trajectory he will take, while a trap door seems better suited to place a person right in front of the train.\n\nOk, enough rambling.\n\n\nCitations: \nPushing Moral Buttons: The Interaction between Personal Force and Intention in Moral Judgment JOSHUA D.

It is hard to paint the full picture. I hope I managed to provide some value anyway.\n\nMy views on the matters discussed:\nAlthough I am absolutely ignorant about the topic, it was nice to hear this discussion. I feel like I trust Chomsky more than Buckley for any factual claim on the matter simply because he is a (genius level) scholar. So I would have a hard time thinking he would lie on factual happenings, nor do I ever recall him doing so. On the other hand, I can appreciate Buckley's points while disagreeing with their implications regarding the Vietnamese war (with my limited knowledge of what transpired).",

If the action erodes a rule that, in general, is creating happiness then we add a negative utility component to the calculations.\n\n\n\nSide note:  During the making of this video, I discovered Harvard Professor Joshua Greene and his writings which I would highly recommend.\n\n\nCorrigendum:  \nForgot to say that intentions get included in our considerations through the rule erosion component, this is clear in the counterexamples to consequentialism video.

The grids might exist, but they pile on top of each other nicely (they extend more than they destroy). \n\nI disagree with Chomsky on the fact that a need for creative work is a fundamental part of human nature.\n\nI was impressed by how articulate and coherent the two academics were.",

The intent is instructive; let's learn to recognize when a debate has substance and when it does not.\n\n\n\nThe subject is the Kenosha unrest shooting:\n\n\nOn August 25, 2020, amid the Kenosha unrest, Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, shot three protesters during multiple confrontations at two locations. He was armed, allegedly illegally, with an AR-15 style rifle and one of the protesters was armed with a handgun. The protesters had been chasing him and were physically confronting Rittenhouse at the time that they were shot. Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Silver Lake resident Anthony Huber, 26, were killed, while West Allis resident Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was injured.
