In terms of multipliers to human ability, being able to turn a fiber into twine (and then, from there, thread, rope, baskets, knots, binding, textiles, clothes, etc etc) had impacts on pretty much all human abilities (including stone tools being connected to hafts.) \n\nOf course there's no way to objectively measure this, but certainly when it comes to the space between how much the average person thinks of it as a foundational technology and how foundational it actually is...the fiber to cordage to textiles is certainly a top foundational technologies of humanity. \n\nThanks so much to Virginia for having a nice long chat with me!

    "description": "In May of 2023 I was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma. I responded to this in two ways. First, during moments when my brain was working OK, I read a LOT about cancer...basically, I tried to focus my fear into curiosity. \n\nSecond, when my brain wasn't working well, I played Marvel Snap and watched stand-up comedy. Comedy was amazing because, unlike even a sitcom, it doesn't really matter if you drop in or out. I got kinda obsessed with how comedy works...how comedians perform...how they control an audience, what happens when they lose control, the flow from explanation to joke, to roll, to emotional payoff back into explanation. \n\nSo I hired  an amazing local comedian, Sarah Aswell, to be my coach to help guide me...to tell me what I was strong at and what I needed to focus on. I treated it like a job for about six weeks and, at the end of that, I had a special. I toured it for a while and then my friend Sam from Dropout.tv told me that they were doing a new live comedy thing on their platform and, perhaps, they could record my special.\n\nIt was the best possible outcome, even though I was kinda sad I couldn't keep touring it after the special came out. But I did ask if, perhaps, they'd let me put it on YouTube a year after it went live on Dropout and they agreed. So now I get to put it here!! I hope y'all enjoy.",

    "description": "Go to https://ground.news/hank for a better way to stay informed. Subscribe for 40% off unlimited access to world-wide coverage through my link.\n\nI recorded this video months ago, I think it was about something a YouTuber tweeted but then I had to sit on it for ages so it didn't seem like I was talking about specific things some people were angry with me about. It felt like I made the video come true!! Even now I'm worried about putting it out because I don't think anyone is particularly good at teasing out bad faith critiques from the good, necessary critiques. It all gets lumped together into one big feeling. I definitely haven't finished teasing this all out, but having experienced both good and bad faith critique from both the mainstream press and various groups of individuals on the internet, I have only able really been able to make my way through it by understanding that, culturally, I am more than just a guy. \n\nPeople feel like they're throwing rocks at a big, powerful robot, but often those rocks connect with soft flesh. I don't want to get through by building up armor and turning my power against those critiquing me, which I have seen others do (sometimes in really dehumanizing and brutal ways), I want to get through by taking the blows and trying to remain human. We'll see if that remains possible! So far so good???\n\nEdited by Nies: https://bsky.app/profile/nies.bsky.social",

    "description": "The track I mention in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OeM02cKEoc&list=RD5OeM02cKEoc&start_radio=1\n\nI have spent a fair amount of time with RFK Jr.'s work at this point and it really started out as a mystery to me. I had a really hard time reconciling how effective he seemed to be at understanding some statistics while a paragraph later he would be completely misundestanding something. At first I chalked that up to confirmation bias. \n\nBut then I kept having a hard time figuring out if he really believed the stuff he was saying because of his various biases and his desire for attention or whether he knew he was lying and manipulating people. \n\nWhat I've realized is that that's actually just the same thing for him. Lying and manipulaiton doesn't seem to be different from belief. The thing that really fixed it for me was moving from my frame (a YouTuber...a career that largely operates inside of the attention economy) to his frame (a lawyer who operates inside of the courtroom.)\n\nUnderstanding RFK Jr. as a lawyer who is trying to win a case, and who knows that winning a cases (regardless of why you win) is the ultimate version of success, everything about him makes so so so much more sense. The fact that he can interpret some statistics correctly while others he interprets wildly incorrectly, the fact that he is always referring to his sources as the highest level of expert in whatever field he's discussing, the fact that he picks the scariest possible topics to cover (a secret cabal of people are getting wealthy by poisoning your children) all start to make perfect sense. \n\nMakes my stomach hurt...but it makes sense. \n\n\nThanks to Nies for the help with the edit https://bsky.app/profile/nies.bsky.social",

Don't buy new (lease or buy a recent car instead...unless you're rich)\n2. Don't buy range without considering your use\n3. Don't charge at fast chargers when you don't need to\n4. Don't charge to 100% all the time\n5. ESPECIALLY don't charge to 100% at a fast charger...charge to the amount you need to get to where you need to go. \n6. You do still do need to do maintenance...just not as much. \n7. DONT DRIVE FASTER IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT RANGE \n8. Don't rely on the in-vehicle navigation for figuring out your route. Use \"A Better Route Planner.\"\n9. Efficiency still matters!!\n10. If you're a 2 car household, you don't need 2 road trip cars!",

    "description": "Thanks a ton to Mikey for spending a little time chatting with me about this. Right now, there is a great deal to focus on, and that's a real problem...it's also by design. I think it makes sense that a lot of focus is on Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia right now. The fact that he is already out of the US in a prison he was not meant to be in and that the Trump administration seems ready to defy the supreme court's request to bring him back is very specifically worrying and I am very moved and disturbed by that story.\n\nBut reading Mohsen's story also deeply disturbed me and we need to be active and pushing from as many angles as possible to make it clear that you cannot defy the laws of this country openly without some pushback. \n\nIf you'd like to call your elected representatives about this, here are some talking points:\n\n1. Mohsen Mahdawi is a pacifist who only ever peacefully protested and went viral for pushing back against people who were saying anti-semetic things. \n2. He has not been accused of a crime, which is because no one things he committed a crime. \n3. In America, we have the right to speak our minds and actions like revoking someone's greencard because they helped organize peaceful protest is deeply unamerican.",

Dire wolves are probably not that closely related to gray wolves, though Colossal says that's not true, they haven't produced anything to back that up.\n2. Dire wolf-like animals will never be ecologically important to our current world because they ecosystems they existed inside of do not exist anymore. \n3. Collossal's goal isn't de-extinction, is creating new species to fill in niches left behind by extinct species, which is an idea worthy of debate! But it's not what you think of when you hear \"de-extinction.\"\n4. There's lots of really cool science here, which does include maybe kinda creating the frist large mammalian synthetic species.",

Anyway, we know cars are adding a ton of microplastics to the environment, but the transition to EVs only increases that negligibly if at all, and we should focus on the problem itself rather than some vague hope that we can somehow force Americans to start riding bikes and taking mass transit as we transition away from gas-powered vehicles!!!",

    "description": "Check out https://good.store/ today!\n\nHaving thought about this more, I think that the Biden admin might be saying \"expungement\" when they mean \"pardons act kinda like expungements in the eyes of most of society\" which they should not be doing. I think they're doing that as a way to pre-empt the \"Biden's pardons didn't actually free anyone\" because pardons do deliver benefits outside of getting freed from jail.\n\nI think that's dumb and they shouldn't do that, but possibly I am missing something. \n\nI think, by far, re-scheduling marijuana and making it MUCH LESS ILLEGAL to possess marijuana is the biggest deal here and it's weird that it wasn't discussed at all.\n\nThis video was edited by Milo!

I thought the weirdest part would be giving over some editorial control, but Milo made pretty much all of the same decisions I would have. The actual weirdest part is that I've always imagined it as part of my job, and I'm trying to figure out what it means for it to not be my job!",

    "description": "Get 60 days of Headspace for free with my link: hthttps://headspace-web.app.link/e/HG30 - HANKGREEN30D. Offer expires January 2nd 2024. Thanks to Headspace for sponsoring this video!\n\nI remain fascinated by the tools these companies use to control or change the behavior of creators. One of the things that’s always seemed interesting about YouTube is that they just share a percent which, to me, says “We want people to build little media businesses here in whatever way they want.”\n\nTikTok and Meta have always seemed much more “we want creators to help us achieve whatever our current company objectives are, which is very different. \n\nThough I guess youtube did do that with the Google + integration…Maybe part of why it went over like a lead brick. \n\nThanks again Headspace!!",

    "description": "TIMECODES\n0:00 - Intro.\n2:38 - How is Quarantine\n3:07 - What parts of the business are hardest during lockdown?\n3:41 - How are you communicating with staff?\n4:15 - What's YouTube's Role during the Pandemic?\n6:19 - How does youtube decide what content is credible?\n8:26 - Do these tools we see, like trusted information cards, actually do any good? Do you study that?\n11:18 - Dangerous fake health information isn't new on YouTube, why are you taking action now, and how is that different form other quackery.\n12:49 - How do you find these dangerous or harmful things things as the pop up?\n13:27 - Someone has to be making these calls I guess, but if a small group of people are deciding where the line is, is that just too much power in one place?\n14:57 - Unplanned conversation about user-generated vs. platform-generated content.\n16:03 - What do you admire about TikTok?\n17:25 - Any other platforms and competitors you're looking to for inspiration right now?\n18:27 - How many people are making five to six figures on YouTube?\n19:46 - YouTube is like our government and we have to pay our taxes.\n21:32 - What are the most effective ways for creators to influence YouTube?\n23:15 - Who are YouTube's stakeholders? What groups take up most of your attention?\n24:53 - Talking about where viewership comes from (more than 50% is creators.)\n26:12 - We continue to have a somewhat heated discussion about creator platform dynamics.\n28:43 - To what extent are advertisers just running out of other options?\n30:51 - My Twitter survey found that CPMs are down, on average, 20%, what can you tell us about that?\n33:45 - Patreon has not been as fickle as advertising. Are you still investing in non-ad products?\n36:20 - I lecture Susan briefly (like a total asshole) that she should have included employees.\n36:20 - I also ask if she considers society a stakeholder.\n39:09 - Let's talk about education on YouTube! Where is it going? What role does YouTube have to play?\n44:05 - YouTube once gave big grants to creators to help them build their businesses, why doesn't it do that anymore? Is there space for YouTube economic stimulus grants?\n49:53 - Can we have a subscription product that does not include music? (The context for this conversation is that music is expensive and it drives the price of Premium way up.)\n\n\nI feel like this conversation should have been several hours longer because it is very hard to get deep into anything in such a short chat. YouTube, the company, has a massive amount of power, not just over viewers and creators, but over society. It's easy to say that there's plenty of competition in this world, but I do want to say that, first, that's not really true. And second, it does not mean that they don't have a massive amount of power...only that, I suppose, it may be eventually possible for them to lose it. \n\nRegardless, I appreciate Susan taking the time to talk with me, I think we got to a lot of good stuff, and I think it's really important for all of us to be spending time thinking about big stuff in these times.",

    "description": "Basically...\n1. People don't hire people to create jobs, they hire people to do jobs. \n\n2. The method through which economic opportunity and job creation occurs is complicated and involves many many people, not just the person who starts or owns or runs a business. \n\n3. Entrepreneurship is not charity, it is only a public good if the business does good work and treats it's employees fairly. \n\n4. None of this is to say that business people aren't totally dope and don't work very hard at stressful jobs that need to be done. I'm just happy with that role being defined by more accurate terms like CEO or entrepreneur or small business owner. \n\nI dunno...all of this stuff is complicated, but I am wary of stories with one hero. One thing I can say for sure...the people who support SciShow and Crash Course on Patreon are job creators if anyone is...so thanks to everyone who does that.",

    "description": "In this year's census, I had a field for messages people wanted to put out publicly. That turned into like 97 pages!!!\nBut it's good stuff. I would suggest going here:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+between+1+and+97&oq=random+number+between+1+and+133&aqs=chrome..69i57.4358j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\n\nAnd getting an random number between 1 and 97 and then starting there so we spread our reading around: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLMukaNI7SNXUepXgO_tkTfSIrUg4Gwv7ibY5kRGeVk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThere was a lot to think about this year. Definite shifts in viewing and discovery habits on YouTube...a lot about how demographics specify and how people seem to be watching less variety and more inside categories. And, of course, now we have more years to compare between, so that slows things down. I tried to edit out some of the most boring parts but, let's be honest, it's still gonna be pretty boring!\n\nThanks for spending the time! I hope you enjoy watching as much as I enjoyed going through it!\n\nHank",

There isn't a simple solution, but an important part of moving forward is that platforms need to be aware that making advertisers happy and making creators happy are not always the same things.\n\nAnd since advertisers are having no problems exercising their levarage against YouTube, creators need to do the same. We need features for us, and we need to keep YouTube from being a bland place full of well-dressed, friendly white guys tousling Donald Trump's hair.",

I know this isn't going to be for everyone, and it's very long, and also you can get it directly into your podcast app in a much less weird format, but I wanted to share it here. \n\nFor an atheist, I'm weirdly into organized religion. So Bart (a guy who used to be deep into organized religion, and had a bit of a break-up with God) is a really fascinating guy for me to talk to. I listened to his podcast a lot just after the election and it was super helpful for me. I think there is a great deal that non-religious people have to learn from religious people...and one big on is to let go of individualism a bit. Not entirely, just a bit. Because it is too dang hard for people to do things together in this world.\n\nOK, well, this is weird. I hope it's useful to some people.",

    "title": "10th Anniversary Wood Cuts",
    "description": "https://store.dftba.com/collections/vlogbrothers\n\nFor our 10th anniversary, we worked with Claire Emery, a Missoula-based artist, to create a series of wood-cut prints celebrating Nerdfighteria. I've been a fan of Claire's work for years and when we were trying to figure out an exciting and one-of-a-kind way to celebrate this moment, she was the first person who came to mind. \n\nThese images are created by hand-cutting a piece of wood with the image, painting on some ink, and then running it through a press. After a a certain number of runs, the wood starts to break down and the prints can never be made again, so these will be very limited. \n\nThe color ones are hand-colored by Claire (which is why they're so expensive.) We aren't making any money on these, the entire cost goes to the artist for her time and materials. We wanted to make these little pieces of art as accessible to Nerdfighteria as possible.\n\nThanks to Michael Aranda for editing this! Shot by Tyler Grutsch",

    "description": "Thanks for coming over here to see this. I felt really bad cutting stuff out of the video on Vlogbrothers, but I felt compelled to make that video punchier and more focused. But this is more real and nuanced and thanks for watching it. \n\nJust to be clear, it was always (and remains) unlikely that Superintendent Juneau (a gay American Indian democrat) would defeat Ryan Zinke, who (an incumbent republican former Navy Seal) in Montana. But the fact that she has polled within the margin of error a couple times is pretty dang remarkable. \n\nYou can find out more about Denise Juneau here:\nhttps://denisejuneau.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/denisejuneau/",

Yes, this community is changing and maybe there are fewer uber-engaged, active Nerdfighters than there once were. But that is not something that upsets me. Communities might even get more interesting as they get smaller. I'm so pleased to continue being a part of this with such a fantastic community, especially as people begin new stages of their lives.
