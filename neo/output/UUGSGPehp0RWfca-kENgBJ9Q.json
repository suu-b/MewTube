    "description": "Full interview with ex-deputy mayor of Ottawa: https://www.patreon.com/posts/questions-asked-73617390\n\nSpecial thanks to Brody from TV Broadcasting at Algonquin College for getting some of the best footage of the Spectacle!\n\nHttps://www.Instagram.com/greg.guevara\nHttps://www.twitter.com/mc_swm\n\nMISSION STATEMENT FOR PRESS: Mainstream journalists viewing this video may be confused as to the motivation of our supporters (which number in the thousands in this city and the hundreds of thousands across the world). The theme of this event was “Common Ground,” an opportunity for both mayoral candidates to come together and respectfully debate each other’s positions. My movement does not support politics being run in this manner; the only people delighted by the two mayoral options really being friends, going for drinks after, sharing a beaver tail, really only disagreeing over one percent or two percent increases are people with no fundamental stakes in the system we live in. Radical change and big ideas are needed, and they’re needed now; THAT is why we are doing what we are doing.\n\nWell, okay, mostly it was because we were bored. I don’t really know about any of that other stuff I said. Have you tried living in Ottawa Ontario? Not a lot goes on around here",

I did not invent the words post-irony & meta-irony or ironic layering. I did however invent irony. \n\nTHE IRONYSPHERE\nThe Philosophers Meme (my forefathers): https://thephilosophersmeme.com/\n(one of the founders is playing with irony on linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/seongyher/)\n\nI am working on an article with The Philsopher's Meme about this. \n\nOlisunvia (well-done and humble analysis of zoomer culture through ironic lens): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1LyTThf7V0\nTimmy M (great examples throughout channel): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yso4rK3x5ow\nIdubbbz doco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jTdu3FI7vo\n\nOrigin video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsuSveDAlpI\n\nI never want to make another reaction video again\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/jreg\nhttps://www.twitter.com/mc_swm\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jreg",

I have always been uncomfortable with being viewed sexually, especially as it is at odds with my faith. Seeing lewd things featuring my characters has always made me uncomfortable, but with the full-on NSFW stuff rearing its head here I figured it was time for a statement. \n\nWhile some YouTubers might appreciate all this attention as a boost to their self-esteem and save all the hentai in a folder on their computer to look at every night as they're a clicks-fueled narcissist whose moral code has slowly degraded to the point where pornography featuring themselves is the only thing they can get off to anymore, but I’m not one of them. Seeing these images revolts me and makes me feel ill. I hope you guys understand. \n\nI don’t blame anyone who drew these images and wrote these stories, but I do ask that you stop immediately. \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/jreg\nOnlyFans: no\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/mc_swm\n\nEditing this video was physically painful\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/greg.guevara\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Jreg\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/post-ironic-wear\n\nyo can you believe this video is demonetized wtf\n\nSeriously tho this is the last time I acknowledge this \n\nThanks to my boy Hartvigen for vetting if YouTube would let me get away with this: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnq5UPLhlAEttKl8sszFmvw",

Ok cool. Wanna hear me ramble about this video? Alright.\n\nThe first video I made that ever had random strangers watch it was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEwrYUZQ96c \n\nBasically an abrasive character insults the audience while explaining misanthropy because he is a misanthrope. I didn't make it clear I was playing a character so everybody thought I was saying I hated the audience. I figured that meant I had to exaggerate the abrasiveness of the character even more, to show that it was a joke, so I made this.\n\nMaking content for the internet kind of feels like screaming into a void. You do it for years and you're not sure why you do it cause nobody hears you. But then sometimes someone shouts back \"hey it's not utter garbage\" and then that gives you the motivation to keep yelling. \n\nI appreciate all of you who enjoyed the video and want to stick around let me know what you'd like to see more of.",

    "title": "How YouTube Monetized Underwater Basket Weaving (and other \"\"\"worthless degrees\"\"\")",
    "description": "\"Worthless degrees\" and interests like art history are now more valuable than ever thanks to YouTube. Philosophy and film degrees can lead to amazing content. And that's a good thing. \n\nScript: \n\nTen years ago if you told someone you were getting an art history degree — or any degree that doesn’t immediately land you in an air condition cubicle right out of university — the response would be pretty predictable. “OhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHH cool, cool, what are your career plans for that?”\n\nThe idea would be that your vast wealth of knowledge accumulated in your given subject would ultimately result in you flipping burgers at McDonalds. But something has changed in the last decade — now you won’t be getting a job at McDonalds, you’ll be replaced by a burger-droid which does that for you haha just kidding.\n\nThe idea before was that you were a hopeless fool who needed to be broken in by reality before you came to your senses and got a computer science degree or something. And for all intents and purposes, that conventional wisdom was mostly right. But something odd happened. Something very odd. Something that practical knowledge hasn’t really caught up to yet. And that odd thing is this.\n\nWhen it’s time for me to relax, I don’t turn on the television. Nobody does that. I open my laptop, go to YouTube and browse through my subscription feed. And I don’t know about you, but my subscription feed on a casual glance looks like this. We have philosophy majors explaining the ethical questions raised in television shows, we have animators explaining the mechanics of what makes good animation between animations of their own, and one of my favourite new YouTubers is basically just a talking art history degree, all of whose content I regularly consume, all of whom I support by watching the ads on their videos, none of whom I support the Patreon of but SOON AS I GET SOME DOSH I’LL THROW IT YOUR WAY FAM\n\nI have never read an academic essay for fun, but I regularly consume video essays on everything from anime to particle physics. If someone can make complex concepts digestible you KNOW I’m gonna digest it and ask for more. And that’s where YouTube comes in because never before has your obscure knowledge been more interesting, more valuable or more monetizable.\n\nWhich is to say if you’re adept at turning the English essay into a video essay, if you’re half-decent at editing, heck if you’re really good at playing video games or even just average but have an appealing personality you can make money doing what you love. It’s not guaranteed, heck it’s still not even likely but you have less of an excuse than ever to not follow your dreams (provided you put “Logan Paul” in the title of your video).\n\nWhich is why degrees that represent what people love rather than what people think will make them the most money now actually contain some value if you well applied. “Underwater basket weaving” is a somewhat condescending term used to describe degrees like art history and 1600s German Polka that previously had no real life application. Nobody wanted to listen to you drone on about how 16th century Russian poetry really was very different from 17th century Russian poetry. Now make a YouTube video essay, talk really fast, use colourful metaphors and slap some stock footage of polka and find some way to tie it to Donald Trump and you can literally reach more people than an entire television show, seriously. \n\nWhereas before someone would have good reason for telling you “you are never going to be able to monetize underwater basket weaving,” nowadays people can ask themselves if they find value in watching someone underwater basket weave. And the answer to that question is yes, of course you want to watch someone weave a basket underwater that sounds really cool. \n\nSo imagine  the confusion of people who ten years ago were right in scoffing at people who followed their passion rather the economy when the underwater basket weaver is now selling the baskets they weaved on Amazon, raking in YouTube ad revenue with their family friendly content and having hundreds of faceless people fling money at them every month to sustain their Patreon account. \n\nI’m not saying that you need to quit your job, go back to school and invest in that sweet sweet underwater basket weaving degree. That’s a terrible idea. You are still safer off following the economy than your heart, and if your heart happened to follow the economy then more power to you. What I am saying is that if you have decent video editing skills, the persistence to keep making videos through the ups and downs of YouTube algorithms and the ability to make genuinely interesting content, whether that be about philosophy, art history, or yes even underwater basket weaving.",

    "description": "This is on Spotify and everywhere else: https://open.spotify.com/album/1QPZUnbMygJFjTq7rxbdy6\n\nA song about a good fleeting feeling. \n\nA collaboration with KLOY. http://www.soundcloud.com/KLOY\n\n\n\n~words~\nSometimes\nWhen I'm all alone\nI hear a tone\nThat starts off low\nThen slowly grows\n\nIn my head the song starts\nThen it moves towards my feet\nThen it spreads into my heart\nThen they both begin to beat\n\nIt's a steady beat, a melody\nA sound, a tune, a theme, a\nA symphony, a, a cacophony? \nPlaying just for me\n\nIt's an orchestra [1]\nI hear an orchestra play\nI don't hear this very often\nSometimes every few days\nSometimes every few months\nSometimes just once a year\nAnd when it leaves me I fear\nIt will never reappear\nBut it does because\nit's always there\nI hear an orchestra play\nBut the song is so rare\n\nAnd it sounds like\nHearing again and and and \nAnd it feels like\nFeeling again and and and\nAnd I know I\nI can breath again \nI can speak again\nI can scream again\n\nMost days\nI just hear silence\nBut when it plays \nI know that I am\nGonna be okay \nI know that  I am\nDeserving of some sympathy\nDeserving of a symphony\n\nAnd\nIt sounds like\nFacing my worst fears\nAnd it sounds like\nAll of my worries disappeared\nAnd it sounds like\nMy future just became clear\nThe music blasts away my tears\nI hear the audience cheer\nCause\nThe conductor is here [2]\nI hear his commands\nThe music ebbs and flows\nWith the sway of his hands\nAnd I demand that he stay\nKeep the band here today\nBut I fear I will never understand\nWhy some days I hear the band\n\nAnd some days I just hear white noise\nAnd it is drowning out my voice\nDo I hear this song by choice? [3]\n\nIt's so easy to hear no music at all\nTo live a life without sound\nSo muted and small \n\nBut right now I hear an orchestra play\nAnd right now I know the right words to say\nI hear an orchestra play and my mind is in bliss\nI hear an orchestra play and it sounds like this\n\nI hear an orchestra play and my heart starts beating\nI hear an orchestra play but the sound is fleeting\n\nI wanna hear the song all night\nI wanna hear it every day\nBut it plays too short a time\nAnd then\nIt goes away\n~\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n~footnotes~\n[1] Hopefully it's clear but the orchestra basically represents a good feeling that comes, stays for too short a time and then leaves.\n[2] The conductor is whatever it is that brings the orchestra in the first place. Unlike the speaker, the conductor has control over the music. The conductor could be God, the speaker himself, or whatever it is that brings the music in the first place.\n[3] Does the song come and go for no reason? Or is there a reason that some days I wake up feeling good and some days I don't?\n\nThx for watch'n. If ya liked it, comment or share it or like it or subscribe or whatever.",
