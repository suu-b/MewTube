But as with any quick introduction, there are details that I gloss over for the sake of brevity. To learn these details rigorously, I've listed a few resources down below.\n\n(a) ELLIPTIC CURVES\n\nThe book \"Elliptic Curves: Number theory and cryptography\" by Lawrence Washington is really good for self-study. It also has tons of numerical examples, making it good for self-study. The subject only really clicked for me after I read this book, so I'd highly recommend reading it.\n\nProfessor Alvaro Lozano-Robledo also has a wonderful YouTube playlist which explains all the details of the subject rigorously: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYpVTXjEi1oe1OeAllJpNhFoI4B7Ws8Yl\n\n(b) MODULAR FORMS\n\nFor modular forms, a great book is \"Modular Forms: A Classical And Computational Introduction\" by Lloyd Kilford. It also has plenty of numerical examples and you can also code up a bunch of the sections as well, which makes it nice to work through.  \n\n(c) EICHLER SHIMURA THEORY (how to go from modular forms to elliptic curves)\n\nThe book \"Elliptic Curves\" by Anthony Knapp (see Chapter 11: \"Eichler Shimura Theory\") contains the main content of this video with the integrating and lattices and all that. This is a dense book, but it is really beautifully written. The first chapter contains an extended numerical example that illustrates how to go from modular forms to elliptic curves. I wouldn't read this book as an introduction, because it's very comprehensive and can be a little overwhelming. But rather, it's great as a second pass after reading the intro books I mentioned at the start. \n\n(d) STRATEGY OF WILES' PROOF (how to go from elliptic curves to modular forms)\n\nThe book \"Elliptic Curves, Modular Forms, and the Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem\" edited by John Coates and ST Yau has a full rigorous explanation of Wiles' proof in the first chapter. It is very dense, and it requires a solid grounding in algebraic number theory (see the last video in this channel for resources to learn this). The chapter describes all the new techniques that Wiles invented essentially from scratch to tackle Taniyama-Shimura. The key to Wiles' approach was a technique called a \"modularity lifting theorem\". This is not easy reading: it is aimed at graduate students and researchers in number theory. But it is beatifully written and by far the clearest rigorous exposition of FLT I've seen so far.\n\nIf you really want to know: what are the 'curved arcs' from 2:40? The rigorous definition is: the \"curved arc\" is really a geodesic connecting two cusps that are equivalent under the action of Gamma_0(11). Equivalently, it is a homology class (with integral coefficients) in the modular curve X_0(11). These are the details you would find in \"Elliptic Curves\" by Knapp, see part (c) above.\n\n-----\n\nMUSIC CREDITS:\nThe song is “Taking Flight”, by Vince Rubinetti.\nhttps://www.vincentrubinetti.com/\n\nTHANK YOUs:\nExtra special thanks to Davide Radaelli and Grant Sanderson for feedback and helpful conversations while making this video.\n\nFollow me!\nTwitter: @00aleph00\nInstagram: @00aleph00\n\nIntro: (0:00)\nEichler-Shimura: (2:04)\nFrom Lattices to Number Theory: (3:21)\nCounting Solutions: (5:00)\nTaniyama-Shimura: (7:21)",

These videos are *very* well made and they have all the core intuitions in them. I personally loved how visual they are; they make the concepts feel a lot more visceral.\n\nPREREQUISITES: The prerequisites for learning Algebraic Number Theory are: group theory, ring theory, and Galois theory. It's possible to get a basic non-rigorous feel for the subject without these prerequisites, which is what I tried to do in this video. But if you want to know the details (for example: you might have asked: what *exactly* is a number ring?), then these prerequisites are essential. To learn these prereqs, check out the previous video on this channel, \"How to self study math\", where there are a bunch of resources to learn these prereqs.  \n\n(b) IWASAWA THEORY \n\nIntroduction to Cyclotomic Fields by Lawrence Washington: This book is AMAZING! To see Iwasawa theory in action, skip directly to chapter 13, Iwasawa's theory of Zp extensions. (You don't need to read the book in sequential order because the chapters are largely independent.) The proof of this theorem is just miraculous. \n\nPREREQUISITES: Algebraic Number Theory (that is, the previous section). \n\n-----\n\nWORKS CITED\n\nThe data of class numbers for the cyclotomic number rings was from here: \nhttps://oeis.org/A055513\nThis list is only for cyclotomic number rings (Z adjoin a p-th root of unity) where p is a *prime* number.\n\nThe two examples of class numbers (class numbers 100 and 2000) was from the L-functions and Modular Forms database:\nhttps://www.lmfdb.org/NumberField/\n\n-----\n\nMUSIC CREDITS:\nThe song is “Taking Flight”, by Vince Rubinetti.\nhttps://www.vincentrubinetti.com/\n\nTHANK YOUs:\nExtra special thanks to Davide Radaelli and Vivek Verma (@vcubingx) for helpful conversations while making this video. you guys rock!!\n\nFollow me!\nTwitter: @00aleph00\nInstagram: @00aleph00\n\nIntro: (0:00)\nNumber Rings: (1:41)\nIdeals: (4:46)\nUnique Factorization: (8:55)\nClass Numbers: (11:41)\nIwasawa Theory: (14:53)\nThank you!: (18:37)\nLearning Resources: (18:49)\nPatreon: (19:45)",

The first few chapters give historical background, and the remaining chapters lay out the key theorems and applications.\n\n“Galois Theory for Beginners” by Jorg Bewersdorff explains the insolvability of the quintic in intuitive terms. It doesn’t assume any prior background knowledge, and all chapters but the last can be understood without group theory. The last chapter formulates the theorem using the language of groups and field extensions, but it explains all the definitions as it goes along.\n\nThis playlist on Galois Theory by Professor Richard Borcherds is a gem. It explains Galois Theory from the ground up, rigorously, in almost complete generality.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yHsr3EFj53Zxu3iRGMYL_89GDMvdkgt\n\n__\nSOME NOTES ABOUT THE VIDEO CONTENT:\n\nGalois Theory is normally introduced at the end of a course in abstract algebra, and for good reason. There’s a lot of technical machinery involved, and I’ve deliberately omitted certain parts that I felt were not immediately relevant towards the insolvability of the quintic. If you’re interested in seeing how the ideas in this video differ from the standard treatment, read on.\n\n1) (The Galois Group.) In this video, we define the Galois Group of a *polynomial*. In the modern treatment, however, we normally talk about the Galois Group of a *field extension* (not a polynomial), and we define it as the set of all automorphisms of the top field that fix the bottom field pointwise. When I refer to the Galois Group of a polynomial, I am referring to the Galois Group of its *splitting field*, viewed as a field extension of the rational numbers. But obviously, that’s quite a mouthful. That’s why I took the route I did; I felt that introducing all this machinery – automorphisms, splitting fields, etc. – would have obscured the main point of the video.\n  \n2) (Normal Subgroups.) We observed in the final example that the subgroup partitions the group table into squares, and many of the squares had the same elements, just in a different order. A subgroup that splits the group table into squares so that any two squares are either equal or mutually disjoint is called a “normal subgroup”. \n\nThis is a non-standard definition of a normal subgroup – although, it is equivalent to the standard definition. I felt that this definition of a normal subgroup was a lot more intuitive than the standard definition (which, for the record, I still find quite mysterious, even after having taken a course in group theory!) \n\n___\nMUSIC CREDITS:\n\nMusic: https://www.purple-planet.com\nSong: Thinking Ahead\n\nSOFTWARE USED:\nAdobe Premiere Pro for Editing\n\nFollow me!\nTwitter: @00aleph00\nInstagram: @00aleph00\n\nIntro: (0:00)\nField Extensions: (0:48)\nGalois Groups: (3:22)\nThe Insolvability of the Quintic: (8:20)",

    "title": "Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms | The Proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem",
    "description": "Elliptic curves, modular forms, and the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture: the three ingredients to Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.\n\nThis is by far the hardest video I've ever had to make: both in terms of learning the content and explaining it. So there a few questions I don't have answers for. If you're up for it, feel free to answer these as a YouTube comment or on Twitter (@00aleph00)!\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n1. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture seems really contrived. We made a weirdly specific sequence from elliptic curves. We made a weirdly specific sequence from modular forms. And behold, the sequences match! It seems manufactured to work. What’s profound about it?\n\n2. Why do we care about elliptic curves of all things? It’s described by, again, a weirdly specific equation: why is it the darling child of number theory?\n\n3. Does the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture also guarantee uniqueness? That is, does it say that for every elliptic curve there is a *unique* modular form with the same sequence as it?\n\n4. We defined how a matrix from the group SL2Z “acts” on a complex number. Does anyone have a geometric picture for this? Does a matrix act on a complex number just like how it would act on a vector in R^2 (i.e: by rotating it)? \n\n5. This is a more advanced question. Most elliptic curve books encode the sequence m_n of a modular form using something called a Dirichlet L-function, a generalization of the Reimann Zeta function. More precisely, instead of associating a modular form to a *sequence*, we associate it to a modified version of the Riemann Zeta Function, where the n_th coefficient of the series is the term m_n. (This is sometimes called the Hasse-Weil L-function of a modular form). This seems unnecessary. What is the benefit of doing this? \n\n6. Does anyone understand Andrew Wiles’ paper?
