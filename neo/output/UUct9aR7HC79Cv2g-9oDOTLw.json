CREDs are behaviors that people use to demonstrate their genuine commitment to a belief, value, or principle. These displays make the beliefs seem more credible and trustworthy to others, thereby enhancing the likelihood that observers will adopt similar beliefs or practices.

It's a time when it's believed that restless ghosts roam the earth. During this festival, people pay homage to these deceased ancestors and other wandering spirits, seeking to appease them. Families often prepare offerings of food and drink, and make ritualized items such as joss paper (hell money) and incense to honor the departed souls. These offerings are meant to satisfy the 'hungry ghosts,' preventing them from bringing misfortune to the living. Performances, including opera and puppet shows, are held to entertain both the living and the spiritual guests.\n\nBibliography:\nStephen Teiser, \"The Ghost Festival in Medieval China,\" 1988.\n\nMu-Chou Poo, \"Ghosts and Religious Life in Early China,\" 2022.\n\nIngmar Heise, \"For Buddhas, families, and ghosts: the transformations of the Ghost Festival into a Dharma Assembly in southeast China,\" in \"Buddhist Funeral Cultures of Southeast Asia and China,\" 2012.\n\nHong Yin Chan, \"The Hungry Ghost Festival in Singapore: Getai (Songs on Stage) in the Lunar Seventh Month,\" Religions 2020. 11(7), 356.\n\nSelect footage and images courtesy of Getty",

    "description": "Thank you to Wondrium for sponsoring today's video! Signup for your FREE trial to Wondrium here: http://ow.ly/tRaf50LVqFM\n\nWuwei is a core concept in Daoist philosophy that involves letting go of control and letting things happen naturally. It's often translated as \"non-action,\" but it's not about being inactive or passive. Instead, it's about aligning with the flow of the universe and acting in a way that is effortless and harmonious. In this video, we explore the meaning and significance of wuwei and how Daoist philosophers interpreted it. Whether you're familiar with Daoism or just curious about this ancient Chinese philosophy, this video will provide a deep understanding of wuwei and its role in cultivating a balanced and fulfilling life.\n\nJoin our Patreon community!: https://www.patreon.com/religionforbreakfast\nOne-time donations here!: https://www.paypal.me/religionforbreakfast\nCheck out my favorite religious studies books by following this affiliate link to my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/religionforbreakfast",

Despite the obscurity of these characters, early Christians in the 2nd century and onward wrote texts featuring these characters.

It touches every aspect of human civilization—our art, politics, history, and culture. It has inspired some of our most ethereal music. It has motivated some of our greatest leaders. And, yes, it has also sparked some of our biggest wars and social injustices. But for something that is so important to human history, how much do we really know about religion? \n\nIn order to navigate the pluralism and complexity of the 21st-century religious landscape, Religion for Breakfast strives to boost our religious literacy by producing high-quality educational videos on a variety of religious studies topics. Our topics range from ancient Christianity to modern religious theory, though we hope to expand our offerings as the channel grows. \n\nWe handle each topic with the utmost respect, recognizing that discussions about religion often evoke powerful emotions and opinions. This, however, proves the vital importance of religious literacy. If we care so much about this topic, we better know something about it! To that end, we invite you to pledge financial support for Religion for Breakfast. With your help, we can raise the level of conversation about religion on YouTube!",

    "title": "Why is Christmas on December 25th?",
    "description": "Everyone assumes that early Church authorities chose December 25th for Christmas to coincide with the already popular Roman holiday of Saturnalia. This may have some basis in reality, but there is another theory: That Christians believed Jesus was conceived and died on the same day (sometime in March or April). When you calculate 9 months forward from that purported day of conception, you get December 25th or January 6th. \n\nFor more reading, see: http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/\n\nTwitter: @andrewmarkhenry\nBlog: www.religionforbreakfast.com\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod incompetech.com\nGraphic Design: Chris Maghintay, http://www.chrismaghintay.com/\nAnimation: EC Henry, www.echenry.com",
