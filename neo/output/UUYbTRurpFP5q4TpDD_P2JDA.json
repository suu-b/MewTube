This time we discuss an invited paper he wrote on the problem of other minds--which he originally wrote as an undergrad senior thesis under John Searle (which is pretty cool). Huemer argues against analogy and perceptional solutions to the problem of justifying our knowledge of other minds and puts forth an inference to the best explanation instead. We also get into whether or not ants, dogs, and robots have minds and how we might go about deciding.

We discuss two different approaches to solving the problem of infant consciousness (the problem of determining that they are in fact conscious): the behavioral/neurobiological markers approach and the theory approach. After we discussed the former we dove into 2 philosophical theories of consciousness and 2 scientific approaches. We then go deep into the philosophy of AI and how we might be able to tell if and when they become conscious.

And I fear the course that too many divines take this way, by resolving all into the testimony of the Spirit, in a mistaken sense, hath much wronged the Scripture and church of God, and much hardened pagans and atheists against the truth: I know that the illumination of the Spirit is necessary: a special illumination for the begetting of a special saving belief, and a common illumination for a common belief. But this is not so properly called the testimony of the Spirit; the use of this is to open our eyes to see that evidence of scripture verity which is already extant; and as to remove our blindness, so by farther sanctifying, to remove our natural enmity to the truth, and prejudice against it, which is no small hinderance to the believing of it; for all the hinderance lieth not in the bare intellect.\n\n      But it is another kind of testimony than this, which many great divines resolve their faith into: for when the question is of the objective cause of faith, how know you Scripture to be the word of God; or why do you believe it so to be? They finally conclude, by the testimony of the Spirit: by the Spirit’s illumination being only the efficient cause of our discerning, and the question being only of the objective cause or evidence, they must needs mean some testimony besides illuminating, sanctifying grace, or else not understand themselves: and, therefore, even the great Chamier calleth this testimony ‘the word of God,’ and likens it to the revelations made to the prophets and apostles, dangerously, I think. (Tom. iii. lib. 13. c. 17.) To imagine a necessity, first, either of an internal proper testimony, which is argumentum inartificiale, as if the Spirit, as another person, spoke this truly within me, ‘The Scripture is God’s word;’ or, secondly, of the Spirit’s propounding that objective evidence internally in the soul, which is necessary to persuade by an artificial argument, without propounding it first ab extra; thirdly, or for the Spirit to infuse or create in a man’s mind an actual persuasion that Scripture is God’s word, the person not knowing how he is so persuaded, nor why; or of any of the like immediate injection of the intelligible species; I say, to affirm that the Scriptures cannot be known to be God’s word, without such a testimony of the Spirit as some of these, is, in my judgment, a justifying men in their infidelity, and a telling them that there is not yet extant any sufficient evidence of scripture truth, till the Spirit create it in ourselves, and, withal, to leave it impossible to produce any evidence for the conviction of an unbeliever, who cannot know the testimony of the Spirit in me: and, indeed, it is direct expectation of enthusiasm, and that as ordinary to every Christian.\n\n-- The Saints' Everlasting Rest, in William Orme, ed., The Practical Works of Richard Baxter, vol. 22 (London: James Duncan, 1830), pp. 248-49.",

    "description": "\"Trinititarians are charged with at least two contradictions. First, the Father is God and the Son is God, so it seems to follow that the Father is the Son. Trinitarians affirm the premises but deny the conclusion, which seems contradictory. Second, the Father is a God, the Son is a God, and the Holy Spirit is a God, but the Father is not the Son, the Father is not the Holy Spirit, and the Son is not the Holy Spirit. This argument seems to entail that there are three Gods. Again, Trinitarians affirm the premises but deny the conclusion.\" Dr. Chris Tweedt helps me think through these two problems for Trinitarians and provides a novel solution to them which is compatible with divine simplicity. \n\nFind more from Dr. Tweedt here: https://christweedt.com/\n\nIf you like this podcast, then support it on Patreon for $1, $3, or $5 a month.

    "description": "In this episode of the Parker's Pensées Podcast, I'm joined once again by Dr. Michael Huemer. This time we discuss two of his recent papers in which he argues that the probability we are reincarnated given the infinity of the past and the future is 1, and that we are immaterial souls!  Huemer is a non-religious philosopher who argues for substance dualism and reincarnation! It's wild, but he's super sharp and provides really strong arguments for his conclusions. \n\nFind more from Huemer here: https://fakenous.net/\n\nIf you like this podcast, then support it on Patreon for $1, $3, or $5 a month.

    "description": "In this episode of the Parker's Pensées Podcast, I'm joined by Dr. Victor Reppert to discuss his work on the Argument from Reason against naturalism. Roughly, in order to rationally affirm naturalism, we need to have the ability to form beliefs for good reasons, which requires logic inference. But if naturalism is true, then we form beliefs due to the laws of physics rather than the laws of logical inference. So if naturalism is true, you can't believe naturalism is true. So, don't believe naturalism is true. \n\nGrab Dr. Reppert's book, C.S.

These turtles were in a bad way, being commercially harvested for Campbell's turtle soup and for the turtle meat market when John stepped in and saved over 1,000 adults from the market and began reproducing them for conservation and for the turtle hobby. The more people became educated about these beautiful beasts, the less they wanted to eat them and the more they wanted to study them.

    "description": "In this episode of the Parker's Pensées Podcast, I survey three answers to the question \"can God make a dog that is too big for Him to walk\". Historically, this problem is known as the omnipotence paradox or the paradox of the stone. I go over a univocal, an equivocal, and an analogical answer respectively and I ultimately side with the analogical answer. I will explain why. If you have no clue what any of that means, no worries, you will by the end of the podcast. Enjoy! \n\nIf you like this podcast, then support it on Patreon for $1, $3, or $5 a month.

    "description": "In this episode of the Parker's Pensées Podcast, I go over my reasoning behind the name of the podcast and then try to justify how I could ever feed mice to my giant African bullfrogs.
