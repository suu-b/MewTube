I really like how it turned out. It's about like??? Kissing the homies??? Making art??? Being sad??? Idk man it's fun though. You can hear more songs like this https://www.raccoontour.net\n\nLyrics:\n\nI've got a pet snake who is physically incapable of love\nHe's like my best friend who would kiss me when we got sh*tf@ced on his dr%g$\nHe'd pull my shirt over my head, I lean in close and kiss him back\nI say \"I've dreamt of this since I was 15,\" man how corny is that?\n\nI knew a gecko who would stick to walls but always bit my hand\nShe's like the mad spiteful consistency of songs made for my band\nWhy can't I make a good foundation, making songs that bring me joy\nInstead of immortalizing things that make me feel hopeless and annoyed?\nLike you give one rat's ass\n\nI've got three months left inside me\nAfter that, man, I don't know\nI've grown up, I've picked my poison\nGive the blame where it is owed\n\nA Burmese Python, I'm a nuisance in a place I don't belong\nBut moving to Portland won't solve all your problems, I've known all along\nI moved to the east coast to write lyrics that are both cutting and so clever\nLike \"They say the good die far too young, you know you're gonna live forever!\"\n\nYou've heard that one before\nJust shut up and perform\n\nI've got two months left within me\nAnd it's hard to fathom more\nYou were right to leave without me\nI'd just weigh you to the floor\n\nKomodo Dragons, we're the apex on a tiny chunk of land\nBut drop me in a bigger scene, you'll watch me falter where I stand\nI'll eat what remains of my friends, sell my soul, and then cash out\nAnd when I'm dying in my 80's, it'll be inside an empty house\nJust alone with my pets\nIt's not like they love me back\n\nI've got one month left before me\nCross my T's and dot my I's\nAfter all your best intentions\nI still spend all day inside\n\nI've got one month (One month, one month)\nI've got one week (One week, one week)\nI've got one day (One day, one day)\nFeed my snake after I'm gone\nI've got-\n\nCREDITS\nWritten by Nate Burr\nGuitar, bass, engineering, mixing, and produced by Matt Graham (AKA Mattstagraham!)\nMastered by Bill Henderson at Azimuth Mastering\nDrums by Randy McCurdy\nVideos provided by Storblocks (Good footage but man it was pretty spendy at $65 for one month)\nYou can find us on I Surrender Records\n\nAnd of course, the tags for the big scary algorithm: #RaccoonTour #AReptileDysfunction #newmusic \n\nOh I also gotta dump a frickload of keywords in here so the YouTube search algorithm knows where to send this: indie rock, indie punk, pop punk, folk punk, alternative emo, midwest emo, sad indie songs, DIY music, emo lyrics, bedroom pop punk, The Front Bottoms, Modern Baseball, emo revival, new emo bands, underground emo, Raccoon Tour, A Reptile Dysfunction, snake song, east coast emo, modern emo bands, acoustic emo, male emo vocals, alt punk indie, emotional punk rock, indie folk punk band",

I am only human. I'll have a dedicated video about him someday.\n\nThe descriptions on videos are important factors that YouTube uses to find and sort content and all that jazz. It's actually more beneficial to put keywords in here. If I were to do something so cloying and desperate, I'd probably include terms like Childish Gambino concert, live performance, Donald Glover, concert experience, music puritanicalism, Rick Beato critique, music vs performance, live show effects, concert lighting design, concert visuals, artist creativity, modern music, digital music production, backing tracks live, analog vs digital music, live show storytelling, Gorillaz, Covey, St Terrible, concert set design, Rick Beato rant, DIY band performances, mixing music genres, evolving music industry, old vs new music, concert special effects, music and art fusion, new music appreciation, arena concerts, multimedia music experiences, immersive music, live music innovation, passionate songwriting, emerging artists, livestream, music culture rant, artistic expression, musical purism, evolving performance art, live performance storytelling.

Take a look: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7rQxh55n2zNGQgKB6TyH4u?si=d1c9893144bd44d9\n\nDiscussing concerts, Twenty One Pilots, and the meaning of life… all stemming from a bizarre phenomenon of folks camping for weeks on end for a 2 hour concert.\n\nHierarchies, rules, lots of crying, etc. It's all a bit much. But dig a little bit deeper and you find the classic story of humans being confronted with forms of chaos and insisting they can enact control over it. Three guesses how successful it often turns out.\n\nI know it's a little corny to still be making videos dedicated to Twenty One Pilots at the ripe old age of 24... but man lemme cook here I think I'm onto something.\n\nIdk man toxic fandom culture drives me crazy. Always has. Yikes and a half. I like venting and complaining.\n\nOh uh apparently YouTube likes it when you list keywords in the description to boost visibility and stuff like that for their Lovecraftian algorithm. Specific words like Twenty One Pilots, fan experience, Blurryface, Vessel album, live show, concert culture, fandom, mental health, ARG, self-actualization, band community, music fandom, fan hierarchy, concert camping, general admission, fan behavior, concert experience, live music, GA pit, concert line leader, venue rules, fan dedication, Tyler Joseph, Josh Dun, fan expectations, concert preparation, pit strategy, fan culture, nostalgia, music fan, concert chaos, fan hierarchy, music memories, fan relationships, band obsession, live performance, fan anticipation, emotional connection, music community, concert frustration, music and mental health, Twenty One Pilots fanbase, fan experience storytelling.\n\nI hate that I need to do unnatural and strange things like listing out dozens of nouns for any semblance of sustainability, but unfortunately this is the post-capitalist hellscape we live in. Please forgive me.\n\nA playlist of the videos I shamelessly stole footage from: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAN-fSrVvqecdGLH8fC2Zg65cV_YvSEhJ\n\n-\nhttps://NateIsLame.com\nhttps://RaccoonTour.net",

    "description": "TRIGGER WARNING for some pretty heavy and frank discussions about mental illness and all the dark serious stuff that comes with it.\n\nHere's a playlist of songs inspired by this video: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/15HV2QOQoiVDkLCjjAppjt?si=f1d11d73ddde46bc\n\nThe song featured at the end of the video is TEETH by St. Terrible, which you can find in the playlist above. Thanks to the band for supplying me with an instrumental mix to use. St. Terrible is one of my favorite bands ever and you should listen to them.\n\nThis topic has always been something that really bothered me and I'm finally getting around to why I think this gesture is not healthy, a bit toxic, and kinda needs to be addressed seriously.\n\nI'm a huge fan of bands like Twenty One Pilots, My Chemical Romance, the Used, Motion City Soundtrack, and tons of other artists who explore heavier topics in their lyrics and messaging. However, with them comes a type of fan that tends to go overboard with their adoration of the project. While there's a humanity in the claim that a band \"saved someone's life,\" I think it's misguided. What makes me worried is that it's mostly teenagers with this mentality.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are your own hero and the fact that you're here watching this video and reading these words are proof enough. You owe it to yourself to give credit where it's due, and that's not to anyone but yourself. You're awesome.\n\nI'll make less existentially terrifying videos soon I promise, I just needed to talk about this. It's been bugging me for months.\n\nI hope you're doing well. You know what phone numbers to call and what people to talk to if things are in crisis mode right now.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:07 - You Are the Only One Responsible For Yourself\n3:35 - Don't Build Foundations of Stability on Strangers\n4:27 - Don't Make It Weird Bro\n6:25 - You Deserve All Credit\n\n-\nhttps://NateIsLame.com\nhttps://Linktr.ee/RaccoonTour",

I wish this trend would come back.\n\nThis video is also me signaling that I'm gonna make an effort to wake the channel back up. I go pretty into detail about how and why I let it kinda slip into neglect. I hope y'all stick around. ❤️\n\nDang this is a pretty vulnerable video. Be pretty weird if my parents watched it. It's kinda weird that it can be easier to open up to thousands of strangers than to your family huh?

Steve Harwell dying today made me really sad, despite some unsavory stuff he did toward the end of his life. I made this to honor 21 years of Smash Mouth in my life.",

    "description": "To pre-order this album on vinyl, click here: https://linktr.ee/RaccoonTour\n\nCome to the album release party on December 10th at the Shredder in Boise Idaho to see us perform ALL of these songs! Doors at 6, music at 7. All ages. $10 will get you admission and a free copy of the album.\n\nAfter 7 years of writing, recording, re-recording, mixing, and mastering, it's finally here: The Dentonweaver. Raccoon Tour's debut album that was first announced in 2018.\n\nHere it is: The album I've spent most of my life working on in one form or another.\n\nThis dumb album followed me through most of my high school years and is deeply inspired by the melodramatic antisocial adventures I went on with friends. They're personified here, all taking place in a fictionalized version of Converse County.\n\nDentonweaver is a huge anthemic crash course through the different sounds and vibes in the album. Mt. Hekla is a synthy pop song about being in love during the end of the world. Converse County is a monstrous and sad behemoth. Trophy Street is a cold and melancholy ditty. Nightmare Eyes gets spooky and dreamy. Mischief Night is a tight-knit pipe bomb. Horrorshow is a collaboration with underground legend Heccra. F#%$ is a petty and self deprecating breakup jam. Sofarinrunning is a nostalgic ballad. Funeral Song is a slow-build catharsis with an explosive ending. I find that when I have an idea of what to look for, consuming full albums becomes easier. I dunno. I worked hard on this. Let me be excited right here.\n\nAll artwork done by the amazing Sarah Reiners.\n\nThank you to the folks who made the hundreds of memes on Instagram about how this would never come out. The ball is now in your court.\n\n00:00 - Dentonweaver\n04:19 - Mt. Hekla\n08:24 - Converse County\n12:15 - Trophy Street\n13:55 - Nightmare Eyes\n17:10 - Mischief Night\n18:50 - Horrorshow (feat.

    "description": "Happy spooky season y'all.\n\nVisit https://linktr.ee/RaccoonTour to pick up some fun limited edition merch before our big release on October 29!\n\nHere we have a few tips on how to make the horror movie viewing experience enjoyable as well as a boat load of recommendations.\n\nI mean this video is pretty much a ton of recommendations essentially. Some of them get pretty serious towards the end of the video. I had a rough time editing this and revisiting some of them, too. Hot dang.\n\nI have this theory that horror movies can be described with any combo of 2 of these 4 descriptors: Spooky, gory, goofy, and Ruin Your Day. That pretty much introduces 6 microgenres:\n\nSpooky/Goofy is fun silly Halloween stuff that's lighthearted.\n\nSpooky/Gory is a bit more violent and vicious with strong supernatural elements.\n\nSpooky/Ruin Your Day is pure misery where the ghosts are out to kick your dog, burn your house down, ruin your credit score, and THEN dispatch you and your family.\n\nGoofy/Gory is where all the gleeful and sometimes satirical body horror lies.\n\nGoofy/Ruin Your Day is... weird. You'll see.\n\nFinally, there's Gory/Ruin Your Day which is unadulterated vicious stimuli to make you feel bad for 2 hours. This is intense stuff.\n\nProceed with caution. This video is a bit more intense than my others.\n\nAlso did I mention my band is releasing our debut single on October 29? You should definitely check it out and see us live in Boise, Idaho on the same day if you're in the neighborhood.\n\n----------------\r\n\r\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\r\nor bit.ly/NateStore\r\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame666\r\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\r\nit's bad for your health.",

    "title": "Reviewing Scaled and Icy by Twenty One Pilots dRUNK",
    "description": "YO! Visit isurrenderrecords.com to grab some sick limited edition Raccoon Tour merch. Ever heard of that band? They're pretty good. My mom likes them.\n\nYou can also support my fun little music project by visiting raccoontour.net. You'll be hearing about an album from us very shortly. We're just a few baby steps away from being done and ready to announce.\n\nAlso visit my friend Ezra on Instagram @FearOfSubsisting. They're pretty cool.\n\nSometimes I have kids tell me that their teachers play my videos in their classrooms and stuff. It's my job to make sure that never happens again.\n\nScaled and Icy was a super divisive and controversial album. I weigh in with my own thoughts with my best friend Ezra. Together we make fools of ourselves and ramble about nothing or like 25 minutes.\n\nThe original footage was 90 minutes. Trust me, you're not missing much.\n\nAlso just a lil PSA, if ur gonna be dumb like us and get intoxicated and stuff, always make sure you're in a safe and secured place with people you trust. Never ever get into a vehicle under the influence. No exceptions. While getting inebriated like this certainly isn't the most responsible thing to do, I'll always make sure to set an example by doing so safely.\n\nBy the way, that TOP burrito was super good. Ate the whole thing, which I'm never able to do with Chipotle burritos. Those things are thicc.\n\nI'm just now realizing that this is my first video in like... 5? 6 months? Yeah what a grand comeback video huh. I'd love to make more fun videos like this, just gotta beat out those sweet sweet depression vibes.\n\nFun fact: YouTube tends to like it when you litter your description with tags and relevant terms. For example, for this video, I could write Twenty One Pilots, Trench, Blurryface, Stressed Out, Tyler Joseph, Josh Dunn, Ukulele, Clique, Fueled By Ramen, Shy Away, Choker, Saturday, DEMA, Lyrics, Review, Music, Quarantine, Review, and so on and so forth.\n\nAlso, man, it has been a while. I hope you're doing okay. Family doing alright? Friends and health and stuff going fine? I hope so. You're a good noodle, you deserve nice things like that. I've been doing meh-so-so. Got a full time job that sucked my energy and motivation to do anything except work and sleep. Cut down my hours so I can work on YouTube videos and music more often.\n\nOh yeah, Sophomore Year video will be coming out this summer hopefully. It's turning into a monster of a video.\n\nBy the way, I make quite a few jokes in here at Twenty One Pilots' expense. Please know they all come from a place of love and adoration. This is such a special and phenomenal band, even when I think they slip up a little bit. Never mean to hurt anyone's feelings if anyone associated with the group personally happens upon this. Just having a goof and a gaff poking fun at the members.\n\nMan I also poke fun at Brad Taste in Music too. I love him very much. His videos are wonderful, his reactions are always insightful, whether I agree with him or not. It's always a blast goofing with him because he knows it also comes from a place of admiration and love. No actual bad vibes to him. They're just jokes in the video. Tee hee ha ha. Hi Brad. Congrats on 100k. Enjoy that silver play button. They're nice, dude. Easy way to win the respect of any 13 year old you meet.\n\nYeah I always try to make it a goal to fill my descriptions as much as possible so YouTube can send this video out to as many people as possible. That's called SEO, search engine optimization. Google it! It's cool.\n\nHere's time codes for every section of the video by the way!\n\n00:00 - Quick ad!\n00:12 - TOP Chipotle Burrito Review\n01:44 - SAI Review Intro\n02:55 - Initial thoughts\n04:41 - Good Day\n06:19 - Choker\n08:27 - Shy Away\n10:00 - The Outside\n12:01 - Saturday Oh No\n16:49 - Never Take It\n17:47 - Mulberry Street\n19:53 - Formidable\n20:38 - Bounce Man\n22:11 - No Chances\n23:50 - Redecorate\n26:02 - Closing thoughts\n26:49 - Hopes for the Future\n28:44 - Goodbyes\n29:15 - End Card Yeehaw\n\nToy store footage for Choker can be found here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du54RnrPeRo\nGas station stock footage is Arco Gas Station At Night by Chhoun Chan Rasmey (ccrzone.com)\nMiami drive footage can be found here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvcjI6lBLHs\nMonke throw raccoon video can be found here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs7u2TTPXFE\n\n----------------\n\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\nor bit.ly/NateStore\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\nit's bad for your health.",

Whether or not these things are worth your time or attention is for you to decide, I don't make the rules.\n\nHere's a link to that song at the end of the video.

It also DIRECTLY supports me so I'm not poor anymore lol.\n\nI also have some wonderful merch with the incredible CROWDMADE! Check out our stuff at https://crowdmade.com/collections/nateislame.\n\nCheck out iilluminaughtii's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/iilluminaughtii\n\nIt's about time I make a sophomore year survival guide, don't you think? 10th graders need some TLC sometimes, too.\n\nEverything is covered, from class selection to friendships to romances to even partying. These are the most legit tips on the internet, yo.\n\nThis is part 1 of a 3 part series to cover every year of high school. By the end, this will probably be over an hour of content yikes. Thanks again to the Ridge for helping make this possible. The lord knows I'd never be able to do this solo.\n\nAlso, shout out to the folks watching this who AREN'T in high school anymore. You guys are weirdos. I mean, I kinda still watch high school survival guides since it's a fun time to remind myself of all the shenanigans I would get into with my friends but... It's kinda sad, ya know? To take time and reminisce about something you'll never experience again?\n\nTo be fair though, most of this advice is applicable to pretty much everyone. Kinda common sense, you know? Or at least it should be.\n\nAlso, hello scared teenagers who are entering sophomore year of high school! How are you? I dunno, I got a lot of requests from folks asking me to make this video but??? You're a sophomore. You already know the drill. You've been in school long enough.\n\nIt'd be such a waste of my time to walk sophomores through the ins and outs of being in school. You kids should be pros already. Instead, I think it's more useful (and fun to watch) to focus on the soft skills like cheating on homework and whatnot.\n\nThat's kinda what the rest of this series will be: Lots of soft skills for kids.\n\nBy the way, a fun fact about YouTube: They use the descriptions of videos to optimize them for searches. Basically, if I fill this description up with buzzwords and stuff, it'll do better on the analytics. Pretty handy dandy if you ask me. That's entirely why I'm rambling like a buffoon here.\n\nAlso, did I mention you should check out Ridge Wallet?\n\n----------------\r\n\r\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\r\nor bit.ly/NateStore\r\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame666\r\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\r\nit's bad for your health.",

    "description": "THINGS ARE SCARY RIGHT NOW! If you're fortunate enough to be in a position where you can support artists, perhaps visit my wonderful merch store? It's at Crowdmade.com/NateIsLame.\n\nMy videos can be a lil sad sometimes, but it's sometimes important to put everything into perspective and really reflect on the nature of everything. In this special lil meditation on existential nihilism and Terror Management Theory, I try my darned hardest to answer a really easy question: Why do anything?\n\nI know this is some pretty intense and heavy subject matter, but I really hope you watching this will come away from this feeling energized and motivated rather than bummed and stuff. Everything kinda does suck for everyone, especially right now. But that's kinda more the reason to continue tricking yourself that it doesn't.\n\nAll we have is our perception of the world and our day to day experiences. Why throw that away, ya know?\n\nThe brilliant song at the end is \"Nothingness Vs. The Optimistic Spirit\" by St. Terrible, my favorite artist in the northwest United States. Check it out on Spotify and stuff if you can.\n\nBy the way! I kinda tasked myself with a challenge for this video: I wanted movement in EVERY SINGLE SECOND of this project. No still stick dudes running through lines like a Powerpoint. I'm kinda experimenting to make my videos a lil more visually interesting. If you thought this was a neat lil thingiemabobber, please let me know. I'm very self conscious and nervous about trying new things.\n\nBY THE WAY SOME DISCLAIMERS!\n\nThis video is kinda approaching this topic from a secular perspective. If you're like \"but the Bible says sdfjkahfkjdhaskfdh\" we're not gonna get anywhere. We're on two very different planes of information to compare and contrast. I talk about religion stuff more in-depth in my other video, \"My Thoughts on Religion.\"\n\n\"But Nate, we don't completely know if-\" Listen dude, you're free to think whatever you'd like. That's cool. I'm not here to change minds or anything, I'm just here to think out loud and draw silly stick people and whatever. But when you assert some level of uncertainty on the very fabrics of reality, our understanding of the laws of nature, and so on so forth... You're kinda going toe-to-toe with brilliant scientists who have dedicated their lives to understanding, testing, and experimenting with this stuff. The scientific method is never 100% certain on anything, but it's often 99.9% sure about most of the stuff it asserts. Just because you don't completely understand how something works doesn't mean it's untrue. It's your responsibility to educate yourself.\n\n\"But Nate, the meaning of life is a test! We're put here to make our own decisions, to be good people! Choosing between good and evil, free will, so on so forth!\" This is not a very well thought-out assertion like... at all dawg. It basically comes down to this: If God is omnipotent, he's in control of whether or not injustice is a necessary foil to extract obligatory meaning out of anything. He also knows the outcome of all moral situations he throws his creations into. Either god is bound to pre-existing ideals or he's evil. But again, this video is also kinda assuming we're on a secular basis of understanding with each other. I'm just throwing this disclaimer in here since I know there are gonna be hundreds of 14 year olds trying to argue this in the comments, and it's gonna blow up my phone for months on end after I've posted this video.\n\nWow you actually read all this? I'm impressed. You get a banana Laffy Taffy for your efforts.\n\n----------------\r\n\r\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\r\nor Crowdmade.com/NateIsLame\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame666\r\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\r\nit's bad for your health.",

They've made such an incredible album and it deserves all the success in the world. It would make a huge difference to them if you checked them out on Bandcamp and maybe even bought their music wow holy cheese\n\nCheck them out here: http://bit.ly/2TJV7Ox\n\nShout out to MrIronPotato for his stellar hilarious amazing video \"Samesies\" that I used as a quick gag. It's one of the funniest videos on the internet. You can watch the video here: http://bit.ly/2w3RgCZ\n\nBy the way, thanks for sticking around, giving these artists some love, and reading through the description. Not a lot of folks take time out of their day to read this stuff and sometimes when I'm writing this, I wonder, \"Will anybody read this? Will anybody acknowledge all these things I'm writing down here?\"\n\nLesser YouTubers would take this opportunity to drop a lot of keywords down here for sake of search engine optimization, but I'm above that.

Even though it can be an internal struggle... I mean... On one hand I want this video to show up in people's feeds and get some attention and hopefully provide me with a basis of support and financial stability but on the other hand I don't want to come across as a poser.\n\nIt's a bit of a conundrum if you ask me. YouTube is riddled with moral and ethical dilemmas and it can be exhausting sometimes. At least I'm not Jake Paul or something. Remember that debacle by the way? With the forest and stuff? That was a mess lol.\n\n----------------\n\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\nor bit.ly/NateStore\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame666\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\nit's bad for your health.",

I worked darn hard on the sound mixing and it sounds pretty good in my humble opinion.\n\nAlso, be warned, this video delves a bit into the paranormal, the afterlife, and there are some shocking horrible OPINIONS that are associated with those topics. Please don't get your jimmies rustled. I don't wanna hear about it unless you have something funny to say. This is a meme-only workplace.\n\nHalloween is a magical time of year for kids to explore their neighborhoods and participate in ancient customs.\n\nUntil you become an adult, that is.\n\nIn Halloween 2018, I found myself without plans for Halloween. My girlfriend and I decided to attend a local scary story time with some local authors.\n\nA psychic came up to the podium and things took a turn for the worst.\n\nOut of respect for the people involved in this, I won't be revealing the names of anyone mentioned. That's rude and not super cool. \n\nThis was a pretty memorable spooky scary existential Halloween story, and this was a ton of fun to work on, too.\n\nI'm well aware this is my first real video in quite some time, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. There's gonna be a lot more cool stuff like this down the road.\n\nThank you for sticking by for all this time. It truly means the world to me, and I'm glad to be back in the swing of things. c:\n\n----------------\n\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\nor bit.ly/NateStore\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame666\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\nit's bad for your health.",

    "title": "Reviewing Trench by Twenty One Pilots dRUNK",
    "description": "COME SAY HI ON PATREON! Patreon.com/NateIsLame\n\nOh boy this is a very serious and legitimate review of the new Twenty One Pilots album \"Trench.\" I pirated it a few days early and have been bopping it ever since.\n\nI think it's the best thing since Betty White. I say \"Betty White\" because she's literally older than sliced bread. You can Google that. So instead of saying \"Best thing since sliced bread,\" we should say \"Best thing since Betty White.\"\n\nAll of these songs are so good holy cow. I mean I know I rip into a few of them but, let's be honest here, I wasn't in the best headspace reviewing this album.\n\nOn Twitter, I did a song by song reaction for this album. I'm going to post it in its entirety so this description will be long and the SEO score will be better.\n\nJumpsuit- We already know this song is radical. It hits HARD and is a lot more intense than any of their other music. I want a punk band to cover this.\n\nLevitate- Sick flow. Clever lyrics. But not single quality and it's certainly not a stand-out. Almost feels like an overstuffed skit.\n\nMorph- WOW. Old timey Twenty One Pilots sound with new and improved lyrics. The callbacks to Nicholas Bourbaki were SUPER clever and almost fourth wall breaking. The ties to the DEMA website were subtle and rewarding for fans and not annoying for casuals. EXCELLENT JAM.\n\nMy Blood- Feels like a darker MGMT in the chorus. This track has grown on me since I first heard it. A fun arena banger and sick dichotomy of dark and grimy and the clean, polished, and spacey chorus. I'm digging it.\n\nChlorine- Intro bit gave me chills. Chill urban vibe almost. Lyrics are dark as FRICK and the gleeful delivery is genuinely spooky. This is boundary-pushing for them. This would be fantastic on ukulele. This would benefit from piano tho. THE BRIDGE AND OUTRO WOW!! Favorite so far.\n\nSmithereens- CUTE. Very cute. The spacey vibe is starting to become defined and distinct. But... the first song on the record that doesn't really super immediately stick out? I didn't like it as much as Tear in my Heart, the other song for Jenna. The DEMA theme is fading.\n\nNeon Gravestones- H O L Y F R I C K . This hit hard. My god. I feel like I'm 14 again. This is a powerful message, an important deviation from the common message spread throughout society. The sound, the atmosphere, and the powerful verses at the end. This is important and truly masterful musical craftsmanship. It's self-reflective and it feels real. This no longer feels like Twenty One Pilots the band, but rather Tyler Joseph feeling tinges of guilt for the culture he's created for mental illness. It's sad, inspiring, and remarkable. 10/10.\n\nThe Hype- A great breather from the last track. UNEXPECTED UKULELE! Fantastic bridge. EXCELLENT LAST CHORUS! Piano, synth, layered vocals, excellent lyrics. Feels like a natural progression, taking the best elements of Blurryface and Vessel. Awesome outro. God I love this album.\n\nNico and the Niners- Probably my least favorite thus far, and that's pretty remarkable since this song is still pretty fun. The DEMA thematic material feels out of place now though, since the album has barely discussed it up until now. The lyrics are bizarre in context of Trench.\n\nCut My Lip- I'm waiting for this song to take off. It's not really going anywhere. It feels like a long intro that keeps evolving and not changing. Poor dynamics. Waiting for the bridge to save things. It didn't. Neat interlude though. The song kinda went nowhere. Least fave.\n\nBandito- NOT how I imagined it'd sound. Vibey. Atmospheric. Builds nice and evenly. It feels as if something is festering under the song waiting to be released. In the true spirit of Self Titled but much more restrained. Gorgeous bridge and haunting vox. Beautiful last 2 minutes.\n\nPet Cheetah- What are these lyrics? The Trench formula and sound is starting to show its strings with this song. I'm sure there's some deeper message here, but there should definitely be a more serious way to express it. Horror dubstep? What??? Not fantastic but not awful.\n\nLegend- Already kinda heard this through a Twitter leak. Fun, has Vessel vibes. Ukulele! Heartbreaking lyrics. Wow. Serious bummer material. Sounds happy but is really sad. What a novel concept. Jon Bellion vibes toward the end with the synthy horn. The outro is CRUSHING.\n\nLeave The City- Heartfelt, written to be played live. This song is a grower. A dark and unexpected ending for the DEMA concept. I just wish the theme surrounding the album was explored and concluded a bit more tactfully. It's pretty and nice, but doesn't really do much.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, good job. This is a big description. I bloated it for better search engine optimization. We should hang out sometime. You seem cool.\n\n----------------\n\nwhatever you do, don't go to bit.ly/NateIsLame.\nor bit.ly/NateStore\nor Twitter.com/NateIsLame666\nor instagram.com/NateIsLame666\nit's bad for your health.",

He's a cool dude who's worth a google search.\n\nThis video is dedicated to all of the student and school staff who were appalled by our antics.
