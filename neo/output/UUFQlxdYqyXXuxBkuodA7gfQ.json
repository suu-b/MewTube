    "description": "Get access to The Backroom (Almost 90+ exclusive episodes) on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OneDime\n\nIn this episode of 1Dime Radio, I am joined by American sociologist Musa al-Gharbi to discuss his book \"We Have Never Been Woke\" which is by far the most scholarly work on the topic of “wokeness.” Al‑Gharbi provides a materialist theory of the economics and social dynamics that drive what we call \"wokeism\" and the great disconnect between what he calls “symbolic capitalists” (the section of the Professional Managerial Class within discourse/symbol generating industries like Media, Academia, Art, and Entertainment) and the rest of society. Al-Gharbi's book provides rigorous empirical research on social attitudes, class structures, and identifies four patterns that he calls \"the great awokenings\" which are driven by \"elite overproduction\" and liberals and leftists appear the same to so many people.\n\nIn The Backroom (on Patreon), Musa and I continue the conversation by connecting Musa’s materialist socio-economic theory of Wokeness and Symbolic Capitalists to Tony’s Genealogy of Wokeism essay.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00  Changing Minds vs Material Conditions (The Backroom Preview)\n00:05:34  An Empirical Theory of Wokeism \n00:14:41  The Symbolic Capitalists\n00:23:55  Top 20% not just the 1%\n00:33:45  Elite Overproduction and Intra-Elite competition\n00:53:58  Is “woke” dead?

This episode is a heavy one! \n\nThe conversation delves into the complexities of immigration and why the left needs a better response to mass migration and how the far-right captured many working class people across the world. We address topics such as the assimilation, social cohesion, demographic change, brain drain, declining bargaining power, and  the socio-economic impacts of immigration, globalization, and neoliberalism more broadly.

We take up the concepts of state power and revolution, and how the history of liberalism is often misinterpreted by modern activists. \n\nIn The Backroom on Patreon, Ross and I examine Losurdo and Rockhill's critique of \"Western Marxism\" and what they get wrong. We explore just what is “Western Marxism.” Is there a widely agreed upon definition? To do this, Wolfe and I have to unpack its origins, and the polemics by Losurdo, Gabriel Rockhill and others.

In the public episode, Studebaker and I break down the situation in Venezuela, US aggression, and unpack the history of Venezuela as a case study of petrostates and Why Nations Fail while others get rich. We also analyze Trump’s regime change ambitions and the risk of war, the rise and unraveling of Chávez and Maduro, the oil curse that wrecked Venezuelan socialism, and why so many post-colonial petrol states get trapped between getting rich and falling apart. Along the way, we break down how nations really become wealthy or fail, debunk popular myths about development and decolonization, and map the structural traps that still ensnare countries in the Global South.\n\nIn The Backroom exclusive episode on Patreon, we discuss the limits of anti-imperialist politics,  Israel-Palestine, and the tragic legacy of decolonization in Africa, then dive into more niche political theory debates where I introduce Ben to my early ideas about “The Will and the Spirit” and debate the question of political influence and what we can actually DO to change anything. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00:00  The Backroom Preview: Imperialism and Anti-Imperialism\n00:06:27  WTF is Happening Between Venezuela and the USA? \n00:08:35  Petrol states 101, Dutch Disease, and US Sanctions\n00:22:48  War Powers and the Imperial Presidency\n00:30:33  Hugo Chávez, the Bolivarian Revolution, and Maduro\n00:35:28  Hyperinflation, Corruption, and the Militocracy Trap\n00:44:02  Libya, and The New Regime-Change Playbook\n00:49:21  The Guyana border crisis\n00:55:09  Gulf monarchies, migrant underclasses, and “successful” petrol states\n00:59:26  Trump’s military build-up and scenarios for war\n01:04:58  Do Sanctions even Work? \n01:06:47  Eastern Europe democratization vs Middle East Interventions \n01:17:17  Cartels, Mexico, Argentina, and the Latin American security order\n01:35:07  The Truth about Maduro and Venezuelan democracy\n01:50:03  Pseudo-activity and limits of anti-imperialist activism \n01:54:09  Palestine, anti-imperialism, and what counts as politics (The Backroom Transition)\n\nGUEST:\nBenjamin Studebaker - political theorist, PhD in Politics from the University of Cambridge.\n\n• Substack: https://bmstudebaker.substack.com/  \n• Blog: https://benjaminstudebaker.com  \n• X/Twitter: https://x.com/BMStudebaker  \n\nFOLLOW 1Dime\n• Substack (Articles and Essays):** https://substack.com/@tonyof1dime  \n•X/Twitter: https://x.com/1DimeOfficial  \n• Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/tonyof1dime\nigsh=MWNuMjhpMHoxbHBwZg%3D%3D&utm_source=qr  \n• Check out my main channel videos: https://www.youtube.com/@1Dimee  \n\nOutro Music by Karl Casey\n\nLeave a like, drop a comment, and give the show a 5-star rating on Spotify, Apple, or wherever you listen to this.",

We explore burnout vs. purpose, streaming as pseudo-activity, theory vs. practice, and get a little bit into psychoanalysis & political philosophy. \n\nIn The Backroom on Patreon, Ben and I discuss our political maturations, psychoanalysis as a toolkit for left politics, and how postmodern theory became an entry point for many while class analysis got sidelined.

We dive deep into the crucial distinction between drive and desire, how fantasy structures our reality (and why realizing our fantasies would be the worst thing that could happen), and why repression actually manifests on the surface rather than buried deep within. We also discuss how these insights help us understand everything from capitalism's engine of perpetual dissatisfaction to why shows like Mad Men and The Sopranos perfectly illustrate psychoanalytic concepts.\n\nIn The Backroom on Patreon, Todd and I discuss Hegel's most popular yet most misunderstood concept—DIALECTICS—and how it connects to psychoanalytic thinking.

The conversation takes a controversial turn as we examine the left's embrace of subsidized childcare, with Benjamin arguing that this merely accommodates capitalism's dissolution of the family.\n\nIn The Backroom segment on Patreon, Benjamin and I talk about Ezra Klein’s “abundance” movement.

    "description": "Get access to The Backroom Exclusive podcasts by becoming a Patron: ⁠⁠⁠https://www.patreon.com/OneDime⁠\n\nIn this spicy episode of 1Dime Radio, I am joined by Simone & Malcolm Collins, known as the “pronatalist” power couple who went viral following media attacks on “The Pronatalist Movement” - a response to the global fertility crisis and how birth rates are rapidly declining everywhere, especially in Asia and Latin America. @SimoneandMalcolm host the podcast called “Based Camp” and are the founders of “The Pragmatist Institute.” Together, they have published multiple books, such as “The Pragmatist's Guide to Crafting Religion” (Being the only one I read).  \n\nSimone & Malcolm Collins consider themselves to be part of “The New Right” - a pro-tech progressive conservative movement that is anti-racist, pluralistic, tolerant of sexuality, yet pro-religion and quite socially conservative for today’s standards. So, full disclosure: even though Malcolm & Simone Collins are quite unconventional conservatives, they still see themselves as part of the Right and are trying to reform the Republican party. In this episode, after getting Simone & Malcolm Collins to clarify their political positions, I try to challenge views on Capitalism, Socialism, and contemporary American politics in general. \n\n In The Backroom on Patreon, I challenge Malcolm Collins’s views on the modern Conservative movement and his belief that the Republican Party is the lesser evil.

Quite a lot, actually.

In it, I ask Adnan's opinion on my hypothesis (articulated in a paper that will eventually get published) that Ibn Khaldun's apparent \"contradictions\" and instances of \"Platonism\" (which problematize his generally materialist system) may not be unaccounted contradictions, but deliberate acts of \"esoteric writing\" to avoid persecution, a method of reading texts \"between the lines\" popularized by Leo Strauss in his seminal text \"Persecution and the Art of Writing.\" Check it out at ⁠patreon.com/onedime⁠ !\n\nFollow Adnan Hussein on Twitter: ⁠https://twitter.com/adnanahusain⁠\nMy Twitter: ⁠https://twitter.com/1DimeOfficial⁠\n\nRead more texts faster with Speechify: ⁠⁠https://speechify.com/?source=fb-for-mobile&via=1Dime",

We discuss Marxist crisis theory/ “breakdown theory” and Karl Marx’s theory of the “tendency of the rate of profit to fall” in capitalism, elaborated by Henryk Grossman. Ted Reese discusses the “final contradictions” of capitalism, such as automation, the ecological crisis, and the “everything bubble” that could lead to the final breakdown of capitalism. Ted explains why Keynesian Social Democracy and the Green New Deal can’t solve the root problem and prevent capitalism’s inevitable tendency towards crisis.\r\n\r\nIn Part 2 of the podcast (for Patrons) we discuss the Socialist/Communist alternative and viability of various specific solutions to the climate crisis, such as “overpopulation”, degrowth, and different forms of clean energy and sustainable resources such as Hemp. In this bonus episode, we also discuss the particularities of a communist transition and what stages of socialism could look like. This involves questions regarding the logistics of democracy, communism, labor, distribution, planning, dealing with poverty, transitioning away from the capitalist mode of production, and preventing counter-revolution. We think it is important to think seriously about the big questions regarding alternatives to capitalism and how to get there, which can be quite challenging to envision.\r\n\r\n\r\nFind Ted Reese on Twitter: ⁠https://twitter.com/Grossmanite⁠\r\n\r\nMy Twitter: ⁠https://twitter.com/1DimeOfficial⁠\r\nEmail 1dimeman@gmail.com for inquiries\r\n\r\nRead more faster with Speechify: https://speechify.com/?source=fb-for-mobile&via=1Dime",

Daniel Tutt shares insights into Nietzsche's influence on leftist thought, emphasizing how his theories can be both valuable and problematic. The discourse explores Nietzsche's impact on left-wing thinkers ranging from Gilles Deleuze, Georges Bataille, and The Bolsheviks to Huey Newton and Jack London. Tutt draws on some critics of Nietzsche, such as György Lukács and Domenico Losurdo's book Nietzsche: The Aristocratic Rebel. In this dialogue, we dissect Nietzsche's views on politics, culture, class, slave morality, resentment, otium, truth and and the will to power.  \n\nTutt's upcoming book calls for a 'parasitic' interpretation of Nietzsche, in which we should take Nietzche as a challenge to the left and learn from his ideas while acknowledging that he is an enemy of the left rather than trying to domesticate his reactionary politics to reinterpret his philosophy as being compatible with a Marxist emancipatory politics. \nThese past two podcasts on Nietzche are my attempt to foster dialogue between left-Nietzchians, who believe a synthesis between Nietzche and Marx (or socialist policies more broadly) and left more skeptical thinkers, and see Nietzsche more as an enemy/challenge to the Left who should still be studied, rather than a thinker whose politics can be reconciled with a socialist/communist politics. Regardless of your views, Nietzsche and his philosophy are incredibly relevant in the age of late capitalism.\n\n\nRead WAY MORE books faster using this dope app I use: https://speechify.com/?source=fb-for-mobile&via=1Dime\n\nThe Emancipations Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/@study_groups\nCheck out Daniel Tutt: https://linktr.ee/danieltutt\n\nOutro Music by Karl Casey \n\nBe sure to like and leave a comment if you enjoyed!",

In his article, Andrew argues that much modern therapy functions as “ideology” for contemporary capitalism, and he critiques popular psychology figures such as Jordan Peterson, Gabor Mate, and Phil Stutz, Jonah Hill's therapist, popularized in Jonah Hill's latest Netflix documentary titled \"Stutz\" , which is about the life and psycho-therapeutic techniques of Jonah Hill's therapist, Phil Stutz. In his talk with Theory Underground, Andrew has an illuminating ⁠critique of Phil Stutz⁠ as the embodiment of popular therapy today from a Lacanian psychoanalytic perspective. \n\nIn this episode,  Andrew and I discuss the limitations and misconceptions associated with contemporary therapy practices, also known as “therapism”,  while contrasting it against the intricate theories of psychoanalytic therapy developed by Sigmund Freud and further elaborated upon by Jacques Lacan. He delves into the societal manifestation of therapism, critiquing figures in pop psychology, and key concepts of psychoanalysis such as the death drive, trauma and the role of sexual repression in personal problems. Andrew talks about the pervasive issues of the overly simplistic approach of many psychological therapies currently championed in the mainstream and emphasizes the significance of the unconscious, language and desire in psychoanalysis.\n\nTimestamps\n\n00:00 Introduction and Guest Introduction\n01:27 Therapism and Pop Psychology\n06:30 Psychoanalysis and its Importance\n08:41 The Death Drive\n11:42 Understanding the Role of Psychoanalysis in Society\n17:30 Modern Therapy Culture\n24:20 Critique of Popular Psychology Figures\n29:15 The Unconscious \n34:43 The Importance of Language in Psychoanalysis\n39:06 The Real in Lacanian Psychoanalysis\n44:31 The Ego, Ego Ideal, Ideal Ego\n48:48 Desire vs Drive in Psychoanalysis\n54:41 Trauma in Modern Therapy\n01:05:30 The Symbolic Order\n01:09:59 Lack  and the other\n01:15:23 “Repression” in Psychoanalysis\n01:19:38 The Death Drive (again)\n01:25:37 Identification with the Symptom\n01:30:26 “Law” and Prohibition \n01:40:37 Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\n Check out Andrew and the Young⁠ Žižekians: https://youtu.be/vO4ztWebQEE?si=Yk_EgU4KWhCIVgbL\nThe Big Sigorelli: https://www.youtube.com/@The_Big_Sig/videos\nCheck out ⁠Underground Theory Vol⁠ 1 (which includes some big names like Slavoj Zizek, Alenka Zupancic, and some smaller names like Andrew and myself): https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Theory-David-McKerracher/dp/B0CH2CXSGN\n\nIf you want to help support the show and my work, you can become a Patron at https://www.patreon.com/OneDime (you get extra content)",

What causes Inflation? Does printing money lead to hyperinflation?  What caused Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany and Venezuela? Find out in this podcast debunking myths about Inflation, Weimar Germany, and The Origin of Money. Modern Monetary theory (MMT) can provide nuance to a very confused debate. That is why I decided to get a special guest.\n\nIn this episode of 1Dime Radio, I interview Dr. Phil Armstrong, an MMT economist who co-wrote a an important paper with Warren Mosler (MMT founder) on the real causes of hyperinflation in Weimar Germany. Contrary to popular belief, insane money printing was the consequence of rising prices (hyperinflation), not the cause of it. \n\nYou can find the research paper on hyperinflation in Weimar Germany here: http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Weimar-Republic-Hyperinflation-through-a-Modern-Monetary-Theory-Lens.pdf\n\nThis begs the question, what really causes inflation and hyperinflation then? What even IS inflation? Does printing money cause inflation? \n\nIn this episode, we answer all of the most common questions regarding inflation and Phil Armstrong shows us how Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) can gives us a more nuanced perspective on what causes inflation and what does not. Before diving into inflation, Phil also goes over core MMT concepts regarding fiat currency, the real purpose of taxation and the origin of money.  Phil also answers common misconceptions about interest rates, exchange rates, and their relation to inflation/rising prices.\n\nTimestamp:\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:20 Guest Introduction\n6:05 The MMT Money Story\n18:47 What is Inflation Really? \n23:53 What is Causing Inflation Now? \n31:41 Money Supply and Inflation\n51:17 Unlearning Ideology\n56:27 Commodity Money Vs Fiat Money\n1:10:11 Weimar Germany Hyperinflation\n1:27:47 Venezuela? \n1:35:00 Price Setting and Controlling inflation\n1:45:01 Interest Rates and Inflation\n1:57:20 Exchange Rates Vs Inflation\n 2:19:19 Learning MMT\n\nWe hope you enjoy this podcast and if you want to learn more about MMT I highly recommend the following videos, lectures, books, and articles for further learning: \n\n-The Deficit Myth: The Biggest Lie in Politics\": https://youtu.be/75udjh6hkOs\n-L.

    "description": "Exclusive Episodes on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OneDime\n\nThis podcast episode featuring David from the YouTube channel @TheoryPhilosophy is about the post modern theorist Jean Baudrillard (the \"high priest of postmodernism\") and his highly misunderstood concepts of Simulation, Hyperreality, Illusion, and the nature of reality. David is an academic who has wrote extensively about Baudrillard and has covered most of Baudrillard's texts on his podcast and channel @TheoryPhilosophy (such as Simulacra and Simulation , The Perfect Crime , Symbolic Exchange and death , etc..). \n\n Baudrillard is often associated with The Matrix film (which he did not think highly of), but he is a  highly misunderstood thinker and most YouTube videos and podcasts seem to get a lot of his core ideas completely wrong, such as the faux \"Simulation vs Reality\" distinction. David and I attempt the difficult task of trying to break down Baudrillard's ideas in simple terms and debunk misunderstandings about them.
