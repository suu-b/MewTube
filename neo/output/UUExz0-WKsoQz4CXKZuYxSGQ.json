The discussion also touches on the normalization of antidepressant use in society, the challenges of prescribing practices, and the complexities of withdrawing from these medications.

    "description": "#vote  #voting #uk \nSome of the things 16 year olds are not allowed to do:-\n\nBuy alcohol\nBuy cigarettes or vaping products\nBuy lottery tickets or participate in gambling\nGet a full driving licence for cars\nJoin the armed forces without parental consent\nGet a credit card or sign most contracts\nRestrictions on Work\nGet married without parental consent\nWork full-time without restrictions\nPurchase knives \nGet a tattoo or body piercing without parental consent\nPurchase or rent adult-rated video games, films, or DVDs\nBe tried as an adult in a criminal court\nOpen a bank account with overdraft or credit facilities\nHold a full adult passport\nApply for most loans or mortgages\nConsent to medical treatment without parental consent (in some cases)\nBuy or use spray paint legally\n\nThe reasons for opening the legal vote to 16 are purely political. We know amongst actual adults, this is one of the most hated govt. in modern history in the UK. So they want to open up a new pool of voters. But the reality is it won't make much difference, they could lower the voting age to 10 year olds and most would have the sense to not vote for this govt. This is pure desperation.\n\nSubscribe to my channel for more content!",
