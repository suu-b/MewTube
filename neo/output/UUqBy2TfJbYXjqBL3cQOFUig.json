    "title": "Classical Theism DEBUNKED by Finite Theist (with Philosophy of Language)",
    "description": "Does philosophy of language give us reason to think that God, if he exists, is more like us than classical theists expect? I’m joined by philosopher of language Joseph Lawal to discuss an argument from his paper, 'God An Alien or An Alien God?' His argument aims to push us away from the strongest versions of divine simplicity and aseity, but is also potentially a problem for theistic personalists who affirm God's timelessness. The argument, which focuses on the *otherness* of God (on non-finitist views), leads us to the conclusion that ordinary theological language is either false or meaningless on classical theism. (E.g., “God loves you” would either be false or meaningless.) This poses a major problem for the religious theist and destroys their ability to make predictions and inferences about God based on his attributes. This would not only undermine natural theology, but also harm the sorts of inferences we make about God in ordinary life. \n\n*In the conversation, I use the word “prediction” at a few points where it probably would have been clearer to use the word “inference” instead. \n\n**There is a lot of information packed into this episode; it may be beneficial to listen more than once. \n\nJoseph's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ldsphilosophy6015\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO JOSEPH NIED FOR THE MUSIC FOR THIS EPISODE \n\nSupport the show: https://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "description": "Ralph Stefan Weir and Ben Watkins debate whether there is a sound argument from mental causation to materialism. The argument goes roughly as follows: Our minds cause bodily movements. Bodily movements are material effects. Every material effect has a sufficient material cause. Bodily movements are not caused twice over by distinct sufficient causes. Therefore, our minds are material and there is no room left for an immaterial soul. \n\nWatkins, a materialist, believes that the argument above succeeds. Weir disagrees, arguing that at least one key premise in the causal closure argument for physicalism is unjustified, and that interaction between soul and body is not a serious problem for dualism. \n\nMy interview with Dr. Weir on substance dualism: https://youtu.be/Sw53gH2cq0o?si=44SBHAFM3BlGTMws\n\nDr. Ralph Stefan Weir is the author of The Mind-Body Problem and Metaphysics: An Argument from Consciousness to Mental Substance.

While I agree that we can't have ultimate responsibility for our actions, I think we can be responsible for our actions. Being the author of one's actions doesn't require anything magical, just that we are (in some sense) the source of what we do and that we (in some sense) could have done otherwise. As long as we have sourcehood and the ability to do otherwise, I think we have free will; and I think determinism is fatal to neither of these criteria. In defense of alternative possibilities, I appeal to Kadri Vihvelin's dispositional compatibilism, the thesis that \"the most fundamental free will facts are facts about our causal powers (for instance, our power to decide on the basis of deliberation) and that our causal powers differ in complexity but not in kind from dispositions like fragility, elasticity, and flammability.\" \n\nFREE WILL PLAYLIST https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCsHWkb9NYseXilnODg310qKxXCJSdWZ&si=Zz5tpDqqrnsrYwst\n\nKadri Vihvelin on Dispositional Compatibilism https://vihvelin.typepad.com/vihvelincom/2015/02/dispositional-compatibilism.html\n\nInterview with Kadri Vihvelin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ow737DVIhE\n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps / \n00:00 Intro \n01:21 Alex's Position \n05:30 You Can't Will What You Will \n15:10 Dispositional Compatibilism",

    "title": "Aetherism: A New Theory of Consciousness",
    "description": "We explore Paul Draper's \"psychological aether theory\". In addition to gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak interactions, there is a fifth fundamental interaction: A field of consciousness, a world-soul or mental aether that interacts with our brains. \n\n\"How does the brain produce the mind? It doesn't. Instead, mentality exists quite independently of the brain.\" \n\nDraper's recent work on aetherism is a refinement of a view proposed by William James in his 1898 Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality. James doesn't deny that thought is a function of the brain. Rather, he challenges the assumption that the function in question is one of production. He defends what he calls the \"transmissive function\" view over the theory that thought is produced by the brain. For James, consciousness pre-exists, with our brain giving finite human shape to experience, like the pipes of an organ shape the trembling air as it escapes from the organ's air-chest. Aetherism can explain the tight correlation between mental and physical states while allowing for their conceptual and ontological distinction, and dispensing with the need for any spontaneous production of consciousness de novo by the brain. \n\nBoth Draper and James recognize that aetherism leaves the door open to an afterlife, as well as certain psi phenomena. As Draper puts it, \"perhaps William James was right to challenge the confidence that most philosophers and scientists have that there is no life after death. For if we don't know that aetherism is false, then we don't actually know that the subject of our psychological properties does not continue to exist after our bodies are destroyed.” \n\nWilliam James - Human Immortality https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jlawler/courses/phi280/assets/documents/Human%20Immortality%20by%20William%20James.pdf\n\nPaul Draper - Psychological Aether Theory https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DraperAetherismJamesLecture2018.pdf\n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps / \n\n00:00 William James \n23:02 Paul Draper\n29:47 My Thoughts on Aetherism",

    "title": "The Demand of Theism",
    "description": "We shouldn't be surprised by a world containing pointless suffering if it’s not set up with the welfare of conscious creatures in mind. But there’s a deeper problem with theism and its demands. Affirming theism requires moral judgments, as it entails endorsing the permissibility of suffering allowed by a benevolent God, which feels like a betrayal of those who suffer, such as animals or children, without apparent justification. I find theistic explanations of evil often shallow or morally insensitive, and I think that belief in God demands either ignoring or excusing suffering, potentially corrupting our moral faculties. Perhaps theism could be morally acceptable only if sufferers themselves understand and approve of their pain’s purpose, but this would require contentious theological commitments like universalism and an animal afterlife, which theists typically reject. \n\nAlthough our world is ambiguous enough to lead me to agnosticism, I have a much harder time ignoring, excusing, or otherwise downplaying the evidence against theism, since it feels like I’d be doing something morally wrong. In particular, I’d be doing something wrong to those who have paid a terrible price living in creation. Countless animals have suffered horribly in evolutionary history. To affirm God’s existence would be, implicitly, to say “God, who is morally perfect and all-powerful, permitted those things to happen. Ultimately it must be okay that all those animals suffered like that.” One the one hand, I could excuse horrendous evil as no big deal in light of some (implausible) theodicy, which seems wrong — it feels like a betrayal and abandonment of those who suffered. (Not to mention, becoming the kind of person who can excuse it as no big deal would be stultifying. That is, it would be bad for me to dull my moral faculties to that point.) Or I could close my eyes and pretend it’s not there. The answer is “Don’t think about it.” Just look at all the wonderful aspects of creation and sweep the rest under the rug. This route seems morally suspect for the same reasons as the first. \n\nTheism’s demand, it seems to me, is to either close your heart or close your eyes — you can either stop caring or stop looking. That’s the choice I’d have to make when it comes to the suffering on earth. How could I live with myself knowing that I’m doing one or both every moment I affirm the existence of God? \n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "description": "Folks, the skeptics are not sending their best. Today, we're discussing three arguments that purport to demonstrate that ghosts are not real. I was unimpressed by these \"refutations\" and wanted to explain why I think they miss the center of the spectral target. While I don't positively believe in ghosts, I don't think pretending weak arguments are decisive is very productive. \n\nIn short, these arguments rely on dubious assumptions about the nature and behavior of ghosts, assumptions which are ultimately little more than speculations on the part of skeptics. In response, I offer a few speculations of my own, which can serve as undercutting defeaters. At best, the skeptic succeeds only in refuting a narrow subset of ghostly hypotheses. While these arguments are interesting and notable, they fall short of being conclusive refutations. \n\nDUALISM PLAYLIST https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCsHWkb9NYvJN4Yq-qMyOJilAVsdY2b9&si=6IEro1Yf_ZBmeuWJ\n\nTwitter thread where I first encountered Wang Chong https://x.com/echetus/status/1861192727892832762\n\nWang Chong - IEP https://iep.utm.edu/wangchon/\n\nPHILOSOPHY ON THE FRINGES - Ghosts and Hauntings https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ghosts-and-hauntings/id1670780660?i=1000674793925\n\nDale Allison Interview - Encountering Mystery https://youtu.be/YpMiprlCx-o?si=ESsxm9cwNEjWDMMX\n\nGreenbrier Ghost - Jimmy Akin’s Mysterious World https://youtu.be/Vy6q4FF997M?si=jJvg-yTHwgbad4Qg\n\nMusic for this episode was performed by yours truly (except the drums).\n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n00:00 Intro \n\n01:29 Argument from Physical Shape \n\n05:32 Argument from Population \n\n16:24 Argument from Ghostly Efficacy \n\n21:36 What are ghosts?",

    "description": "This is me losing my patience. Two Christian apologists reviewed my video on the moral argument for God and I recorded my own counter-response shortly thereafter, but thought it was best to keep it behind a paywall. Generally speaking, it's good to remain dispassionate in these online spaces, but I let my frustration get the better of me in reviewing their low-quality video. However, I changed my mind. I trust that you in the audience can discern why I'm reacting as I do in the episode. My exasperation was entirely the product of their errors, oversights, and misunderstandings — all of which were completely avoidable, had they put one-tenth of the effort into their video that I put into mine. Their mistakes were not exclusively philosophical. In many instances, they simply misunderstand what is being said, for what purpose it's being said, and even who is saying it. All in all, it was an extremely tedious video to review, but I hope that my commentary makes it interesting, occasionally informative, or at least entertaining. \n\nRefuting the Moral Argument playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCsHWkb9NYvcIbqiGo7gL6hQ1L8aKT0s&si=qPcwwZPU01xv_uf3\n\nThe Collapse of the Moral Argument for God https://youtu.be/0CwX6mNWBXk?si=oKgcKTHwtb3bx-FF\n\nTheir review of my video (Democracy of the Dead) https://www.youtube.com/live/wR_J1pmnaE8?si=ESd-a_LuLqnC5iXG\n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "description": "I critique Mel Gibson's claim on the Joe Rogan Experience that \"nobody dies for a lie,\" which many apologists have used in the past to argue that the martyrdom of Jesus' disciples supports the truth of the resurrection, as they wouldn’t die for something they knew to be false. \n\nFirst, I challenge this by questioning the historical evidence for the apostles' martyrdom, noting that accounts are late, based on oral traditions, and often embellished with legendary elements, such as milk flowing from Paul’s severed neck. Even if the apostles were martyred, the reasons for their martyrdom are uncertain due to the difficulty of establishing motivations and crucial details surrounding the apostles' deaths, like whether it would have mattered if they'd recanted. I further undermine the apologist's slogan by proposing scenarios where someone could die for a known lie, such as being falsely accused and coerced into confession under torture; and by highlighting human irrationality, like people confessing to capital crimes they didn’t commit. Finally, Matthew Hartke recounts the story of the Millerites, alerts us to the shortcomings of folk psychology, and explains how cognitive dissonance could explain Christian origins. \n\nUltimately, \"nobody dies for a lie\" fails under scrutiny, as history and human behavior are far more complex than the claim allows. \n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nMatthew Hartke - How Cognitive Dissonance Explains Christianity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x8SB_gy8jg @MatthewHartke \n\nShameless Popery - The Hidden Danger of Mel Gibson https://youtu.be/NDDrIn9ul2k?si=6ctEAhJf5JQNFFhP @shamelesspopery \n\nBart Ehrman - Were the disciples martyred for their belief in the resurrection? https://ehrmanblog.org/were-the-disciples-martyred-for-believing-in-the-resurrection/ \n\nJoshua Schachterle - How did the apostles die? https://www.bartehrman.com/how-did-the-apostles-die/\n\n00:00 Who would die for a lie? \n2:47 Do we know the apostles were martyred? \n9:41 How To Die For A Lie \n14:02 Folk Psychology & Irrationality \n17:00 The Millerites \n23:53 Outro",

    "title": "Am I Agnostic?",
    "description": "The world is religiously ambiguous: It can be interpreted in various incompatible ways, and the interpreters are not necessarily violating any standards of rationality in doing so. As for me, I can’t say that I  feel any position being forced on me by the evidence. My best efforts to judge the total balance of evidence weighing for and against theism leave me thinking that no one has a decisive case; and the main way to give the impression of having a decisive case is to ignore the total evidence, focusing solely or primarily on the facts that support your position. Put a spotlight on the things that favor your view, and minimize or cast aside the things that don’t fit. \n\nOver time, I've come to appreciate the force of some of the evidence against the hypothesis of indifference and in favor of a \"value selection hypothesis\", e.g. psychophysical harmony, fine-tuning, and the axiological trajectory of the universe. These, along with a few other considerations that favor theism more directly, have gradually moved me to more of a middle position on theism vs. atheism. (Today, I don’t dive into a full-fledged defense of those arguments.) \n\nThere are plenty of sources of epistemic uncertainty that have increasingly led me to hold on to my beliefs more loosely. How am I supposed to alter my confidence in light of peer disagreement? How should I set my priors? How am I supposed to reckon with the inescapable contingency of my beliefs? Richard Rorty often spoke about a certain kind of philosopher with “radical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently uses, because she has been impressed by other vocabularies, vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered” (1989). Rorty goes much further, in ways that I can’t get behind. But what can I say? I’m impressed by many of you. The problem is that you have mutually exclusive, incommensurable worldviews. At least for me, at this point, agnosticism seems like the most honest reaction to my epistemic situation. (Of course, God could settle this whenever he likes: https://x.com/waldenpod/status/1749836106973970860?s=20)\n\nRelevant video from Philip Swenson: https://youtu.be/MZR-PoFIRsw?si=jpuq9HaDYORRQHyN\n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps / \n\n00:00 Religious Ambiguity \n6:37 The Value Selection Hypothesis \n8:45 Theism and Evil \n12:46 Psychophysical Harmony and Physical Complexity \n14:29 Axiological Arc of the Universe\n17:05 Two Pretty Good Value Selection Hypotheses\n18:38 Is that you, God? \n20:00 Common Consent Argument\n22:46 Agnostic?",

    "description": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali recently announced her conversion to Christianity. But has she only adopted a form of cultural Christianity? I examine her reasons for becoming a Christian and draw some parallels between Ayaan and another political convert: Andrew Tate. \n\nI think her reasons for adopting Christianity are quite clearly explicated, even though some Christians have been trying very hard to ignore them. She argues that Christianity can sustain the liberal values of the Enlightenment that she cherishes so deeply. Those values are under attack, she says, from Islam, Russia, China, and woke ideology. Every purely secular strategy tried in response has been insufficient. Christianity, on the other hand, could function as a far more effective weapon against her political enemies in this existential clash. But why does it matter that the west prevails over its cultural and geopolitical foes? Christianity can help with that, too – not just on a civilizational level, but individually as well. It's the antidote to nihilism, the heart of the Enlightenment, a panacea for wokeness and illiberalism. These considerations together lead her to adopt Christianity, even if she doesn't think it's actually true.\n\nMaybe in the future, she'll affirm something more than cultural Christianity. Until then, I'm honestly inclined to see Ayaan’s “conversion” as further vindication of the death of God: even the converts don’t really believe anymore. A good deal of true believers are apparently so desperate for a morale boost, they're willing to look past that. \n\nAyaan's guiding light is liberalism, the Enlightenment, and western civilization. She is a positively zealous believer in what the west represents to her, and this is absolutely crucial to understanding her conversion to Christianity. She may not believe in the literal resurrection of Jesus, but she believes in western civilization. She believes this is the best way – perhaps the only way – to save it from withering.\n\nAyaan Hirsi Ali - Why I am now a Christian https://unherd.com/2023/11/why-i-am-now-a-christian/\n\nShadi Hamid - Embracing Islam to Own the Libs https://www.thefp.com/p/embracing-god-to-own-the-libs\n\nRandal Rauser on Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s conversion https://randalrauser.com/2023/11/ayaan-hirsi-ali-and-the-celebrity-conversion-with-the-weak-apologetic/\n\nRod Dreher - A Christian of Convenience? https://europeanconservative.com/articles/dreher/ayaan-hirsi-ali-a-christian-of-convenience/\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/ayaan-hirsi-ali-and-the-rise-of-political-conversions/\n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n00:00 Introduction \n02:13 The Nature of Her Conversion \n08:56 Arguing from Meaning \n18:10 The Political Convert",

    "title": "The Case Against Epiphenomenalism",
    "description": "Epiphenomenalism is the view that mental states have no effect on anything. The feeling of pain, counterintuitively, does not cause your aversion, mentally or physically. Beliefs don’t cause behavior. None of our actions occur in virtue of our thoughts, feelings, or sensations.\n\nInspired by Matthew Adelstein’s post defending epiphenomenalism, I want to explain my opposition to the view. A few times, he referenced a podcast episode / blog post of mine from 2020, which I hadn’t read since it was first posted. I found a few things to disagree with in my own episode, so I thought I’d respond to Matthew and try to offer an updated critique of epiphenomenalism in the process. While epiphenomenalism is probably less wrong than physicalism, the causal efficacy of our mental states is as evident as anything, so the view should still be rejected in favor of panpsychism or interactionist dualism. As Paul Draper once put it, “wild ideas are needed” to explain consciousness, but I don’t think epiphenomenalism is the right wild idea.\n\nAfter responding to a few key points from Matthew, I offer a few reasons to reject epiphenomenalism:\n\n- Epiphenomenalism is self-defeating.\n- The evidence that supports the causal influence of mental states is the exact same kind of evidence for causal influence in other cases. This not only supports mental causation, but also raises the threat of undermining the epiphenomenalist’s claim that the physical has causal powers.\n- The phenomenal powers view as defended by Mørch (2017, 2020) is plausible and entails the falsity of epiphenomenalism. In short, there are plausible examples of causal necessity in the mind.\n- Among metaphysical theories of consciousness, epiphenomenalism is the most vulnerable to the problem of psychophysical harmony.\n\nLINKTREE https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps /\n\n00:00 Introduction \n00:43 What is epiphenomenalism? \n02:27 Conservation of energy, Libet experiments\n07:42 Self-Defeat\n16:44 Evidence of Causation & A Dilemma \n23:20 The Phenomenal Powers View\n28:00 Psychophysical Harmony \n32:24 Epiphenomenalism is Counterintuitive \n40:02 Summary",

    "description": "Alex Strasser and John Buck debate the merits of finite theism, the view that God is limited in power. Theistic finitism is less vulnerable to the problem of evil than perfect being theism, but are there other trade-offs that make the notion of a finite God less defensible overall? \r\n\r\nJohn is defending the view that strong versions of omnipotence avoid problems of vagueness, arbitrariness, ad hocness, lack of predictive power, and complexity that limited models of God suffer from. John also thinks that a new problem of evil arises that is particular only to limited views of God. \n\nAlex will give a cosmological argument and fine-tuning argument for finite theism, and further argue that omni-theism is not a fruitful research program due to serious issues with coherence and the analysis of omni-properties. Theistic finitism is rarely discussed in the philosophy of religion, and Alex wants to invite us to take finite theism more seriously and to investigate it carefully. \r\n\r\nSummary of theistic finitism: https://www.britannica.com/topic/theism/The-idea-of-a-finite-God \r\n\r\nPrevious limited god debate: https://youtu.be/K8f5gensQF0?si=SjGkdvxlaWH01MVs \r\n\r\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n\n/ timestamps / \n\n00:00 Introduction \n03:41 John's Opening \n22:00 Alex's Opening \n39:16 Problem of Evil \n1:02:51 God's Power \n1:16:26 Miracles & the Bible \n1:22:22 Simplicity as a Theoretical Virtue \n1:29:53 Fine-tuning Redux \n1:55:19 Biblical & Theological Constraints \n2:03:30 Necessity \n2:06:30 Worship & Hell \n2:17:46 Parting Thoughts",

    "description": "Today I’m speaking with Dr. Dale Allison, historian and author of many books, including The Resurrection of Jesus, The Historical Christ and the Theological Jesus, and our subject today, Encountering Mystery: Religious Experience in a Secular Age. \n\nThe subtitle of the book notwithstanding, the unusual experiences we discuss are not explicitly religious. They’re usually interpreted through a religious lens (often without any reflection), but almost all of them needn’t be, which is something we return to quite a bit. Flatly disputing the phenomenon is not the only option available to atheists.\n\nWe talk about paranormal and parapsychological phenomena (e.g., clairvoyance, levitation, visions of dead loved ones, etc.) as well as two major sources of skepticism towards things that fall into those categories. On the one hand, of course, there’s materialism, conservative naturalism, skepticism (as in, the skeptic community), etc. But Protestant Christianity, I was surprised to learn, has also been a skeptical force in history due to their drive to debunk Catholic miracle stories, or even just extraordinary events documented by the Catholic Church that explicitly or implicitly were used as evidence for Catholicism. \n\nOne thing I forgot to mention during the interview: In addition to Dr. Allison’s book, there are a couple podcasts that regularly discuss cases like the ones that came up today in greater depth. “Otherworld” and “Jimmy Akin’s Mysterious World” come highly recommended from me. \n\nEncountering Mystery https://www.amazon.com/Encountering-Mystery-Religious-Experience-Secular/dp/0802881882 \n\n#paranormal \n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "title": "Widespread Theistic Belief is Evidence for Theism",
    "description": "I joined @DryApologist and @johnbuck4008 to speak about the common consent argument, which is typically dismissed as fallacious without much consideration. However, I think the fact that most people in recorded history have believed in something godlike is some evidence favoring the existence of the divine. We discuss why that's the case, as well as the only good response to the argument: the evolutionary debunking response. \n\nDefending the argument from widespread theistic belief: https://youtu.be/lF6Z7uKiHpQ (There are plenty of objections you may have thought of that didn't come up in this video. They're probably discussed in the longer video linked here ^ )\n\nHow did religion evolve? https://youtu.be/ARPxNYNgiSc\n\nFull conversation with Dry Apologist, John Buck, and Chris Rhodes: https://www.youtube.com/live/NgwBQ0EwXU8?feature=share\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n. . . \n\n“[Ad populum] is the ‘fallacy’ of believing something because most people believe it. But what exactly is supposed to be wrong with that? . . . Maybe the idea is that most people believing p is irrelevant to whether p is true. I.e., if most people believe it, that doesn’t mean it is more likely to be correct. Problem: This is obviously wrong. If most people believe something, that obviously does make it more likely to be correct than if most people don’t believe it. If most of our beliefs weren’t true, the human species would die out pretty much immediately. Sometimes, people elaborate on this ‘fallacy’ by citing examples of beliefs that were once widely held but were false – e.g., that the sun orbits the Earth. So let me now just mention a few typical examples of beliefs that are widely held: Dogs exist. It’s generally lighter in the daytime than at night. The sky is blue, not red, green, or yellow. There are more than three human beings in existence. Human beings commonly have beliefs and desires. Putting your hand in a fire hurts. Six is more than two. The Earth has existed for more than five minutes. When you drop rocks near the surface of the Earth, they generally fall. . . . I’m sure you can extend that list for a long time. Now, which would you say there are more of: Widely-held beliefs that are true, or ones that are false?”\n\nMichael Huemer (Knowledge, Reality, and Value)",

    "title": "Addressing Popular Forms of Theism vs. the Best Forms",
    "description": "Here's my defense of philosophical atheism (or whatever you want to call it) against new atheism (or whatever you want to call it) and my proposed truce. \n\nSo, should atheists address popular and harmful versions of theism? Or should we address the most defensible versions of theism? To explore the question of God’s existence, we must engage with the best forms of theism, not the worst. As Michael Huemer put it, “Who cares if you can refute the craziest version of a view? … The way to learn is to address the most interesting defensible views, not to spend our time discussing trivially false ideas.” Even if those trivially false ideas are widespread, wield lots of influence in the world, and are positively dangerous, they’re still trivially false. At worst, it’s deeply dishonest to refute the worst version of an idea, stop there, and act as if the entire idea has been refuted. \n\nDepending on one's goals, however, addressing the strongest forms of theism might seem like a waste of time. If you're primarily concerned with atheist activism, helping others, and reducing the harm brought about by religion, why spend any time on things that have no significant influence in the world? The activists are generally more concerned with attacking the truth of influential beliefs that make the world worse. Philosophers are generally more concerned with addressing the best versions of each side, since that’s the best way of figuring out whether we should be theists, atheists, or agnostics. Though both are valuable and worthwhile projects, the main issue with the activist crowd is that they seem to think they’re the best at both, despite never engaging with the strongest versions of the view they reject. \n\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2023/01/25/addressing-popular-forms-of-theism-vs-the-best-forms/\n\n\n/ Counter Apologetics /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0xp05xgyg04BWh0U1tCZ0z\n\n\n/ Walden Pod /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/waldenpod\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5It3kjkrB9CTDen1Sx3aGl?si=fZ6MENZ4TdSLDPLAJ_6dAA&nd=1\n\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "description": "When did consciousness first evolve? If physicalism is true, we’d expect it to have evolved gradually, just as other complex biological phenomena evolved gradually. But the transition from feeling nothing to feeling something couldn’t have been gradual. No matter how minimal a conscious experience is, if it’s “like something” to exist – anything at all – it’s not like nothing at all. On reflection it seems hard to imagine anything other than a sharp border between non-experiential reality and experiential reality. On the other hand, complex physical states are not sharp: they admit borderline cases. If we remove one atom at a time from a given brain state, it will eventually be vague or indeterminate whether or not the organism is still in that physical brain state. So if consciousness is just a kind of physical state, we’d expect consciousness to follow suit. Since it seems impossible that there could be a borderline case of consciousness – it’s either like something for a creature or like nothing – we have reason to think that physicalism is false. \n\nLinktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n1000 Word Philosophy - Vagueness https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2019/03/11/vagueness/\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2022/12/16/the-vagueness-argument-against-physicalism/\n\nMichael Tye - Vagueness and the Evolution of Consciousness https://academic.oup.com/book/39910\n\nDavid Papineau’s review of Vagueness and the Evolution of Consciousness in NDPR https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/vagueness-and-the-evolution-of-consciousness-through-the-looking-glass/\n\nNino Kadic - Phenomenology of Fundamental Reality https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/phenomenology-of-fundamental-reality(ea85e9fa-6b07-4018-9c54-a54407d16f35).html\n\nFollow on twitter @waldenpod @onpanpsychism\n\nSupport the podcasts at https://www.patreon.com/counter or https://www.patreon.com/waldenpod \n\n/ timestamps / \n00:00 The vagueness argument \n03:59 Which creatures are conscious? \n06:55 The sharpness of consciousness \n09:20 The vagueness of biological phenomena \n11:51 The sharpness of consciousness (cont.) \n19:25 Weak emergence \n20:52 The advantage of vagueness arguments",

    "description": "The participation theodicy holds, reasonably enough, that it would be good to create an ideal world. Since it would be good for God to do so, it would also be good for us to do so (as well as any other beings). The goodness would only be multiplied through our participation and contribution to the creation of an ideal world. The defender of the participation theodicy doesn't deny that God could've created a much better world than ours -- or even created us in heaven -- and that this would be a good thing. Rather, they compare the goodness of creating a heavenly world ex nihilo to the goodness of creaturely participation in the creation of the same heavenly world. A unilateral divine act of ex nihilo creation would preclude the creative activities of other creatures. To quote my guest today, \"The best sort of thing God could do would be to create the very best type of world for creatures to inhabit. But for creatures to be spontaneously generated in an ideal state of the world would be for them to miss out on helping God bring about that ideal world. So God, being generous, would have good reason to initially create creatures in a non-ideal state of the world, so that they could contribute towards bringing about its idealization, so that they too could do the very best type of thing that they could have done.\" \n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nFollow us on Twitter @waldenpod and @WriterJohnBuck\n\n\n/ Counter Apologetics /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0xp05xgyg04BWh0U1tCZ0z\n\n\n/ Walden Pod /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/waldenpod\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5It3kjkrB9CTDen1Sx3aGl?si=fZ6MENZ4TdSLDPLAJ_6dAA&nd=1\n\n\n/ Timestamps /\n\n0:00:00 Introduction \n\n0:02:00 The Participation Theodicy \n\n0:18:37 Divine Hiddenness \n\n0:22:54 Teleological Evil \n\n0:32:47 Is it worth it? \n\n0:34:26 What would disconfirm your theory? \n\n0:39:34 Is knowledge of participation necessary? \n\n0:45:30 Evil we can't eliminate \n\n0:54:37 Is our participation meaningful?

    "description": "I’m joined by Counter Apologist and Ryan from Real Atheology to discuss eternal conscious torment. \n\nFirst, we take a look at the views of William Lane Craig, who famously denies the possibility of an actual infinite in the context of the kalam, yet seems to affirm the existence of an actual infinite in his defense of everlasting torment. Craig grants that finite sins merit finite punishment. But since rejecting a relationship with God is *not* a finite sin, eternal conscious torment is justified. (Craig seems to hold that our *guilt* is an actual infinite, not our punishment, which is a potential infinite.)\n\nWe also touch on free will, postmortem salvation, the rejection of God, religious diversity, universalism, guilt, and David Bentley Hart's case that everlasting torment is morally indefensible. \n\nClarification: When it comes to rejecting God, I used the words “ignorance or limitations/imperfections” several times (e.g., “No one would reject a relationship with a being of perfect love without some ignorance or imperfection”). “Ignorance” in this context would include lack of knowledge of God’s existence or his exact nature. “Imperfection” or “limitation” was usually intended to refer to our rational faculties. So if a person is rejecting a being of perfect love, I think that person must be lacking information or ability to assess that information, most likely. As David Bentley Hart argues, “no rejection of God on the part of the rational soul is possible apart from some quantum of ignorance and misapprehension and personal damage.” \n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nSubscribe to Real Atheology: https://www.youtube.com/realatheology\n\nSubscribe to Counter Apologist: https://www.youtube.com/CounterApologist\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealAtheology https://twitter.com/CounterApologis https://twitter.com/waldenpod\n\nMy Hell playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgCsHWkb9NYtUnr7hNK_ar8MEJiosUcDm",

By contrast, moderate naturalists differ from conservative naturalists in that they expand their conception of the natural world so as to include abstract objects (e.g., propositions, properties, possible worlds, etc.). Finally, liberal naturalists differ from moderates and conservatives in that they not only admit into their ontology of the natural world the abstracta of the moderates, but they also allow for concreta that have more properties and powers than the conservatives and moderates allow. Examples of liberal naturalism include Spinozism and Russellian monism (also known as panprotopsychism).\"\n\nIs God the Best Explanation of Things? Felipe Leon & Joshua Rasmussen (p. 91)",

Universalism, in conjunction with a handful of other views, seems capable of smoothing over some of my biggest reasons for rejecting theism.\n\nThis is a clip from a longer interview on Adherent Apologetics. We didn't plan on covering this subject, but I was asked near the end of the interview about what I considered to be the most viable form of Christianity. Universalism has been on my mind a lot in the past month or so, and this seemed like a good way of kicking off the exploration on this podcast. If we're to steelman Christianity and attack it at its best, this is to my mind the version that deserves our attention.\n\nWatch the full interview here https://youtu.be/2kKpU1hBBJc\n\nDavid Bentley Hart - That All Shall Be Saved https://www.amazon.com/That-All-Shall-Saved-Universal/dp/0300246226/ref=asc_df_0300246226/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=380023963566&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1170020017093075017&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052678&hvtargid=pla-660695896024&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=81214940321&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=380023963566&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1170020017093075017&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052678&hvtargid=pla-660695896024\n\nKeith Derose - Universalism and the Bible https://campuspress.yale.edu/keithderose/1129-2/\n\nElenore Stump - Closer to Truth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqHegHsveLE\n\nJoe Schmid w/ Trent Horn - Is explicit knowledge of God necessary for a relationship with him? https://youtu.be/cFuDDAg_EyI?t=2663\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0xp05xgyg04BWh0U1tCZ0z\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "description": "There are many famous examples of unintelligent design in nature, but what about malevolent design? Some natural systems are aimed at producing suffering: they cause suffering by acting in accordance with their natural purpose, function, or design plan. Why would we infer a benevolent, omnipotent designer from malevolent design?\n\nThe fact that predation – a striking example of teleological evil – is a prominent feature of the biological order is very surprising on theism. Predation isn’t a feature of the biological order because animals are acting against their design plan – exactly the opposite. The fact that animals must savagely kill and devour each other in order to survive is strong evidence against the hypothesis that nature was designed, directly or indirectly, by an unsurpassably great being of perfect love and goodness.\n\nThe Problem of Teleological Evil – Felipe Leon https://exapologist.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-problem-of-teleological-evil.html\n\nAn Atheological Argument from Evil Natural Laws – Quentin Smith https://infidels.org/library/modern/quentin-smith-evil-laws/\n\nJustin Schieber of Real Atheology interviews Quentin Smith (2017) https://youtu.be/mvkghIrF7XY?t=385\n\nThe Best Argument Against God?

    "description": "If epiphenomenalism is true, mental causation is an illusion. Even if pain and pleasure were inverted, you’d go on behaving the same way you do now, since your conscious states have nothing to do with determining or motivating your physical behavior. This is counterintuitive, to say the least. But it also leaves us completely unable to explain why our conscious states line up appropriately with our actions. We typically think that natural selection molded our mental profile: that which aids in survival and reproduction is incentivized by experiences with a positive hedonic valence, and vice versa. Thus, we have an evolutionary explanation of harmonious correlations. But on epiphenomenalism, this can't be the right explanation, since experiences play no causal role at all. If they have no causal influence, they can't make any difference to genetic fitness. So how is it that harmonious correlations evolved if experiences are invisible to natural selection?\n\nPsychophysical Harmony w/ Dustin Crummett https://youtu.be/GHbemF3jy2M\n\nTwitter @waldenpod @OnPanpsychism\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2022/05/07/william-james-evolutionary-argument-against-epiphenomenalism/\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n\n/ Counter Apologetics /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0xp05xgyg04BWh0U1tCZ0z\n\n\n\n/ Walden Pod /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/waldenpod\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5It3kjkrB9CTDen1Sx3aGl?si=fZ6MENZ4TdSLDPLAJ_6dAA&nd=1\n\n\n/ Timestamps /\n\n00:00 Pain/Pleasure Inversion\n01:24 Epiphenomenalism\n01:59 James' Evolutionary Argument \n07:41 An argument for theism?\n08:31 Conclusion",

Though psychophysical harmony is evidence for theism, it may be equally good evidence for non-theistic hypotheses that I find interesting, like axiarchism and natural teleology.\n\n**In the initial presentation of the argument (the first ten minutes or so), we assume that epiphenomenalism—the idea that consciousness has no physical effects—is true, but this is just for convenience, as psychophysical harmony is a puzzle for all (or nearly all) metaphysical views of the mind. \n\nThe argument in a nutshell: https://youtu.be/GHbemF3jy2M\n\nPsychophysical Harmony: A New Argument for Theism (Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion) https://philarchive.org/rec/CUTPHA\n\nJoshua Rasmussen & Philip Goff - The Nature of the Cosmic Mind https://youtu.be/oQLsYCy4joQ\n\nPhilip Goff - Axiarchism, cosmopsychism, the fine-tuning problem (Aeon) https://aeon.co/essays/cosmopsychism-explains-why-the-universe-is-fine-tuned-for-life\n\nA Christian Philosopher Answers Common Objections to Same-Sex Marriage - Dustin Crummett https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vgS8lAYtXs\n\nIn Defense of Socialism | Dr. Dustin Crummett https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFgGE5iLcKg\n\nApplied Ethics: Abortion & Gun Control | Dr. Dustin Crummett https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdLhc-8wa6c\n\ndustincrummett.com http://dustincrummett.com/\n\n/  /  /\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n@waldenpod @OnPanpsychism \n\n/ Counter Apologetics /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0xp05xgyg04BWh0U1tCZ0z\n\n/ Walden Pod /\n\nConsider supporting at https://www.patreon.com/waldenpod\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/5It3kjkrB9CTDen1Sx3aGl?si=fZ6MENZ4TdSLDPLAJ_6dAA&nd=1\n\n\n/ Timestamps /\n\n00:00 Introduction\n\n01:26 The Argument in a Nutshell\n\n12:57 God of the Gaps\n\n15:54 Multiverse\n\n17:37 Natural Selection I\n\n18:55 Non-epiphenomenalist views don't escape the problem\n\n36:12 Natural Selection II\n\n47:17 Spooky Naturalism & “Theism-adjacent hypotheses”\n\n50:18 Error theory doesn't solve the problem\n\n55:36 Contingent normative roles objection\n\n1:00:36 Low priors & Bayes\n\n1:10:34 God's Mind: The Revenge Problem\n\n1:14:38 Theism vs. \"Theism-adjacent hypotheses\" / Spooky Naturalism \n\n1:24:00 Why panpsychism is (maybe) better off\n\n1:27:04 What about disharmony?\n\n1:42:57 A *new* argument for theism?\n\n1:49:29 Other arguments from consciousness & fine-tuning \n\n1:55:40 Final thoughts on the paper and Dustin's other work",

    "title": "How I Became Disillusioned with the Skeptic Community",
    "description": "Many leaders in the skeptic community have proven themselves to be untrustworthy sources of information on the topics they speak about. They’ve misled me often about what others believe and why. Moreover, genuine skepticism seems far less important to the skeptic community than the kind of conclusions one comes to. Failure to adopt the required list of beliefs disqualifies one from being a real skeptic, it would seem. In today’s episode, I talk about how my atheism caused me to gravitate towards the skeptic community, and how the same subject caused me to drift away. We also discuss a few ways in which skeptics mishandle the subjects of theism, parapsychology, the JFK assassination, 9/11, and aliens.\n\nFor the record, this should not be seen as a comprehensive treatment of the topics raised (e.g. conspiracy theories). My framework was the following: Skeptics told me conspiracy theorists believed X for reason Y, but they were often wrong on both counts. I used a few examples, but I wasn’t aiming to provide a full account of what 9/11 truthers believe, or what alien abductees think, nor was I trying to defend a rejection of the Warren Commission. I especially shied away from that last topic, since it’s a bit different from the others for me. In the case of the JFK assassination, I’m more solidly on the side of the conspiracy theorists. Along with the majority of Americans, I don’t accept the Warren Commission.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n\nFor a more accurate picture of what these common skeptic targets believe and why:\n\n\n/ JFK\n\nOliver Stone’s documentary JFK Revisited: Through the Looking Glass /or/ JFK: Destiny Betrayed [longer version of same doc] \n\nMark Lane interviewed on JFK assassination (1992) https://youtu.be/HCsupa7DzCk\n\n\n/ 9/11\n\nThree-part article in CovertAction Magazine - Peter Dale Scott, Aaron Good, Ben Howard https://covertactionmagazine.com/2021/09/11/the-twenty-year-shadow-of-9-11-u-s-complicity-in-the-terror-spectacle-and-the-urgent-need-to-end-it/\n\nThe Road to 9/11 (University of California Press) Peter Dale Scott https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520258716/the-road-to-9-11\n\n\n/ Theism\n\nKenny Pierce defends theism against Graham Oppy (Dialogue) https://philpapers.org/rec/PEAITA-5\n\nJoshua Rasmussen defends theism against Felipe Leon (Dialogue) https://philpapers.org/rec/RASIGT\n\n\n/ Parapsychology \n\nMitch Horowitz: A parapsychologist’s take on James Randi https://boingboing.net/2020/10/26/the-man-who-destroyed-skepticism.html\n\n\n/ Aliens\n\nNick Pope w/ Michael Shermer on UAPs and UFOs https://www.skeptic.com/michael-shermer-show/nick-pope-on-uaps-ufos-conspiracies-cover-ups/\n\nAvi Loeb w/ Michael Shermer on alien life and oumuamua https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rykjXX6OhU0",

    "description": "Emerson Green (atheist) and Tarik D. LaCour (Mormon) compare the Latter-day Saint worldview to other forms of Christianity.\n\nTarik is a Ph.D. student in philosophy and an M.S. student in psychology. He is a philosopher and cognitive scientist whose primary research interests are in the philosophy of psychology, cognitive science, and bioethics. He also writes about politics “from a conservative point of view,” and also on religion, from his perspective as a member of the LDS Church. Here’s an excerpt from a profile in Public Square Magazine entitled “A Latter-day Saint Empiricist”:\n\n“LaCour is a growing figure in the Latter-day Saint intellectual community, no doubt largely due to the unexpected nature of his takes on almost everything. His social media leaps from brooding observations on science and philosophy to deadpan quips about politics and sports. In fact, the way LaCour evades easy categorization is surely part of his draw. He’s pessimistic, but not cynical. He cares about social justice but frequently deviates from popular narratives. … He’s a devout member of the Church, but openly embraces scientism (his Twitter handle is @realscientistic).” (Full article: https://publicsquaremag.org/dialogue/consciousness-isnt-real-an-interview-with-tarik-lacour/)\n\nTarik and I discuss the LDS worldview and how it differs from other forms of Christianity. Mormons have deep disagreements with other Christians about the nature of God, soteriology, the afterlife, and much else. Further, these differences may provide philosophical advantages that favor Mormonism relative to other versions of Christianity.

    "title": "The Meager Moral Fruits Argument",
    "description": "Does Christianity bear the kind of fruit one might expect if it were true? Does naturalism or Christian theism better predict the moral fruits and lack thereof that we actually observe? Naturalists would expect Christianity to produce a mixed bag, like any other man-made institution. Christian theism leads one to form loftier expectations.\n\nThere’s much more to say about this argument than we cover today, but we manage to lay out the essential core of the argument: a Theological Premise, an Empirical Premise, and a Moral Premise. The Theological Premise is, roughly speaking, the claim that Christianity should bear appreciable moral fruit, and that Christian theism and naturalism make different predictions: they lead us to form different expectations about the world. The Empirical Premise is meant to establish some relevant fact about the world. The Moral Premise affirms a moral fact or normative judgment. We defend each of these premises and work the meager moral fruits argument into a cumulative case for naturalism.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nConsider supporting the podcasts at https://www.patreon.com/counter or /waldenpod\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0xp05xgyg04BWh0U1tCZ0z\n\nFollow on Twitter @waldenpod @OnPanpsychism\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2022/03/17/the-meager-moral-fruits-argument/\n\n/ timestamps / \n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:51 Three Moving Parts\n07:08 Is Christianity Supposed to Bear Fruit?\n15:13 Factoring MMF Into A Cumulative Case\n17:04 Conclusion\n18:31 Goodbye",

    "description": "Full video here: https://youtu.be/PCxEhj25qQQ\n\nSkeptical theists maintain that gratuitous suffering is an illusion. Yet, we commonly trust our moral faculties to distinguish between suffering that is necessary and unnecessary -- we often judge that the elimination of certain cases of suffering wouldn’t prevent any higher goods or bring about any greater evils. In other words, we make the judgment that it would be unambiguously good to eliminate some specific cases of suffering in our world. But skeptical theists must maintain that we are wrong in every single judgment of this kind. This implies that humans suffer from a powerful and pervasive cognitive bias. Our faculties misfire in this way all the time! This is certainly a strange and unexpected way for God to design our faculties. But to make matters worse, the mirage of moral randomness has led legions of nonbelievers away from God and salvation. The appearance of gratuitous suffering -- which would supposedly disappear if God had instead designed our faculties to be aimed at truth -- contributes immensely to the apparent moral randomness and seeming indifference of the world. Skeptical theism is predicated on the idea that God has created our minds such that the world would seem morally unintelligible to us. This means that legions of unbelievers have missed out on salvation because God decided to create this pernicious illusion.\n\nWe haven't begun to scratch the surface of the conflict between skeptical theism and the notion that we have trustworthy moral faculties, and I hope to expand on the ideas in this clip sometime soon.\n\nExcerpt from CA81 Skeptical Theism.

    "description": "Compatibilism is the thesis that free will is compatible with determinism. In other words, a compatibilist is someone who doesn’t have a quarrel with using the term “free will” and who doesn’t think we need to run around with our hair on fire if determinism turns out to be true. I think free will skeptics and libertarians are entirely wrong about the dramatic consequences that would follow from not possessing libertarian freedom. \n\nAs you may have gathered, I’ve finally migrated from the free will skeptic camp over to the compatibilist camp. Years ago, learning about determinism and moral luck for the first time rocked my world. But as the dust settled, I wondered if I had been too quick to reject the entire notion of free will. How much does it matter that we don’t have libertarian free will? How much has actually changed?

    "description": "Can we be ultimately responsible for what we do? No one denies that we can be the proximate cause of our actions. I made this episode because I wanted to. But merely being the proximate cause of an action is compatible with determinism – no determinist in their right mind would deny that I made this episode because I wanted to. So is there a deeper sense of responsibility that can be attributed to human beings? One which absolves God, the world, ancestors, luck, and society of what we choose to do?\n\nThis deeper kind of responsibility, which Nietzsche disparagingly called “‘freedom of the will’ in the superlative metaphysical sense,” and which is often ascribed to human beings by the religious, arguably requires one to be causa sui – to be the ultimate cause of oneself. Since this is impossible, we can be sure that we do not possess the kind of responsibility that so many seem convinced we have. You can’t be radically self-creating in a way that gets you beyond a compatibilist notion of responsibility.\n\nIt’s unclear whether our lack of ultimate responsibility for our actions is a problem for libertarian free will. Do libertarians unanimously impute this degree of responsibility to humans? No – some do, some don’t. Regardless, the attacks on free will “in the superlative metaphysical sense” from Nietzsche and Strawson convincingly show that our responsibility for our actions is quite limited.\n\nep. 46 of Walden Pod - Free Will \"in the superlative metaphysical sense\" https://audioboom.com/posts/8034400-46-free-will-in-the-superlative-metaphysical-sense\n\n.\n..\n...\n..\n.\n\nGalen Strawson - Your Move: The Maze of Free Will https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/your-move-the-maze-of-free-will/\n\nTamler Sommers & Galen Strawson - You cannot make yourself the way that you are https://believermag.com/an-interview-with-galen-strawson/\n\nThe Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast - The Galen Strawson Interview https://thepanpsycast.com/panpsycast2/strawson1\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2022/02/21/free-will-in-the-superlative-metaphysical-sense/\n\nConsider supporting the show https://www.patreon.com/waldenpod or /counter\n\nFollow on Twitter @waldenpod and @OnPanpsychism\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n.\n..\n...\n..\n.\n\n\"The causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has been conceived so far, it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with just this nonsense.

    "title": "Hell: Eternal Conscious Torture",
    "description": "Eternal conscious torment (ECT) leads to absurdities, but theists can easily avoid these absurdities by abandoning ECT. For example, a believer in ECT must defend the following proposition: \"A perfectly good, merciful, just, and loving God superintends the eternal conscious torment of human beings.\" This proposition is incoherent simply in virtue of the meaning of those words. (The word “superintend” implies responsibility without suggesting that God is directly involved in the minutia of operations.) If a being oversees the eternal torment of humans, that being is not perfectly loving, good, merciful, or just. But these divine attributes are far more central to theism than ECT. Since ECT leads to conflicts with core aspects of theism, and since ECT is not itself a core aspect of theism, theists should not believe ECT.\n\nSo, either God doesn't exist, and there isn't anything to worry about; or God exists, and we shouldn't fear eternal conscious torment precisely because the God of theism exists. If God’s nature is anything like theists have traditionally affirmed – good, merciful, just, and loving – eternal conscious torment is not a feature of the world. \n\nWhether atheists or theists are right, there is no reason to be afraid of eternal conscious torment.\n\nSupport at https://www.patreon.com/counter or /waldenpod\n\nFollow on Twitter @waldenpod \n\nGlenn Peoples vs. Ben Watkins on Hell, Annihilationism, and Universalism https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksh889aYQoM\n\nBen Watkins - Brief on Hell https://twitter.com/SpeedWatkins/status/1481677866777649160\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2022/02/06/hell-eternal-conscious-torment/\n\nListen to and review Counter Apologetics on iTunes / Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nMusic by ichika Nito & Whalers.

    "description": "Recently I learned that H.P. Lovecraft had undergone a surprising and dramatic political transformation in the final years of his brief life. I wanted to read a few of Lovecraft's letters and discuss his views on capitalism, socialism, and the influence of the profit motive on artistic expression. (In the middle part of this episode, I also indulge in a bit of culture war stuff, so consider yourself warned.) In these letters from the last several years of his life, his notorious racism seems to fade, and he explicitly rejects the reactionary political ideology he held prior to 1931. He ruthlessly critiques capitalism, speaks glowingly of Marx, and warns us that our only options are socialism or barbarism. Anyone familiar with the author knows how out of kilter this feels compared to the absurdly reactionary person who most of us know as Lovecraft.\n\nFirst episode on Lovecraft https://youtu.be/t2DPGROfCsQ\n\n@waldenpod https://twitter.com/waldenpod\n\nLovecraft Letters:\n\n1937, Catherine Moore https://github.com/punchmonster/Lovecraft-Letters/blob/master/19370207-Catherine-L-Moore.md\n\n1936 Arthur Sechrist https://github.com/punchmonster/Lovecraft-Letters/commit/b7a7248e4bcc8fadc4164ef6ed347d3e8aa11006\n\n1934, Helen Barlow https://github.com/punchmonster/Lovecraft-Letters/commit/5188e8dc2fde4551b84108276e096a95054677d6\n\nLovecraft Audiobooks:\n\nDagon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncTdn6Aakxo&list=PLG8klsjxFY-P3ITpqoMqvTyRDd7qg7RVK&index=1&t=2s\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM9Z39D1yyI&list=PLG8klsjxFY-P3ITpqoMqvTyRDd7qg7RVK&index=17&t=159s\n\nAt the Mountains of Madness https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2iSmE129uQ&list=PLG8klsjxFY-P3ITpqoMqvTyRDd7qg7RVK&index=14\n\nThe Shadow Over Innsmouth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gviofDcypzE&list=PLG8klsjxFY-P3ITpqoMqvTyRDd7qg7RVK&index=12&t=495s\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n02:53 Flawed Characters, Real and Fictional\n09:30 Letter to Catherine Moore (1937)\n13:00 Letter to Helen Barlow (1934)\n15:32 Letter to Arthur Sechrist (1936)\n17:23 Art & the Profit Motive\n19:52 The Shadow https://youtu.be/pXSBiGoVr7g?t=874\n\nTranscript & References https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2021/10/18/h-p-lovecrafts-1931-radical-political-transformation/",

    "description": "Human beings seem cosmically unimportant. Though certainly from God’s perspective, we are more important than stars, rocks, vast stretches of empty space and time, and other things that don’t seem to possess any value in and of themselves, the latter group seems to have been afforded the lion’s share of the cosmos. Human beings, presumably the jewel of God’s creation, don’t seem to be the main event. So, does this favor naturalism or theism? Is the unimaginable vastness of time and space, and the lack of human centrality therein more probable on naturalism, or on theism?\n\nIf the universe is indifferent to human life, it’s no surprise that humans seem cosmically unimportant, not occupying a position of centrality or significance in an incomprehensibly vast ocean of space. The reality of our situation is sharply contrasted with the one our ancestors imagined themselves to be in. As William Lane Craig put it, “on the cozy, pre-Copernican cosmology—what C. S. Lewis called ‘the discarded image’ of the cosmos—theism seemed vastly more probable than atheism. Like a Fabergé egg, the little universe centered on the Earth, with the spheres of the planets and fixed stars revolving about it, cried out for an explanation in terms of a Cosmic Designer.”\n\nWe also discuss the “symmetry of evidence” and get a bit into the weeds of Bayes’ theorem.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nSupport on Patreon here https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2021/10/05/the-argument-from-scale/\n\nFollow me on Twitter @waldenpod https://twitter.com/waldenpod\n\nMusic by ichika Nito & Whalers.

    "description": "Dr. C.M. Lorkowski offers his criteria for accepting a miracle claim. Atheists do not rule out miracles by definition, though this is often how Hume's anti-miracles argument is caricatured. A miracle must be examined by skeptical, qualified observers; the miracle must accomplish something; the chain of testimony must be highly credible; and the miracle must not occur near the cutting edge of science. Unless these criteria are satisfied, a naturalistic explanation will be superior to a miraculous explanation. You can read about arguments from miracles and the criteria for accepting them as legitimate in greater detail in Dr. Lorkowski's 2020 book, Atheism Considered.\n\nFull interview on Real Atheology's channel: https://youtu.be/fJ6k6P-4XDg\n\nAtheism Considered: A Survey of the Rational Rejection of Religious Belief https://www.amazon.com/Atheism-Considered-Rational-Rejection-Religious/dp/3030562077\n\nRA Patreon https://www.patreon.com/RealAtheology\n\n@waldenpod @RealAtheology\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps /\n\n00:00 when does a miraculous explanation become the most plausible explanation?\n\n04:51 the preference for naturalistic explanation shared by theists and naturalists\n\n08:00 the sheer number of miracle claims\n\n11:29 the prior probability of theism",

    "description": "“I am moved by strange sympathies; I say continually 'I will be a naturalist.'\" \n- Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nNaturalists, according to David Papinau, believe “that reality is exhausted by nature, containing nothing ‘supernatural’.” Naturalism “has no very precise meaning in contemporary philosophy” beyond this, along with an emphasis on science as a means to understand the natural world.\n\nNaturalism is the view that there is only the natural world—reality is exhausted by nature. I defend this simple conception of naturalism, ward off a few criticisms, and argue that there’s a kind of parity between the terms “theism” and “naturalism.” In other words, if you don’t have a problem with the term “theism,” you shouldn’t have a problem with “naturalism.”\n\n/ References /\n\nLuke Roelofs - Combining Minds: How to Think about Composite Subjectivity https://www.amazon.com/Combining-Minds-Composite-Subjectivity-Philosophy/dp/0190859059\n\nIs God the Best Explanation of Things?

    "description": "A forbidden religion, originally composed of only a few devoted followers, eventually swept the western world. Believers think that the rise of Christianity was miraculous, and they argue that the stunning growth and eventual size of their religion is evidence that God really is on their side.\n\nI argue that Christianity's spread is primarily due to its “memetic fitness” in a Roman pagan environment. Christianity's combination of evangelism, exclusivity, and novel ideas about the afterlife made for a fierce competitor to inclusive Roman polytheism. Christianity, in effect, created a zero-sum game with its pagan competitors and won that contest. Notably, its 3% average annual growth rate was humming along before Constantine converted. Christianity's success was not due solely to Constantine, but to its adaptive fitness, as well as its location: Christianity formed in the dominant Roman empire, ancestor to the modern western world.\n\nThe exclusivity of monotheism, the hope of heaven and the fear of hell, and the evangelism of Christianity gave it an adaptive edge over polytheistic, inclusive paganism.\n\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n\n\nCounter Apologetics: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nWalden Pod: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172\n\nSupport at Patreon.com/counter or /waldenpod\n\nTip Jar https://account.venmo.com/u/emersongreenpodcast\n\n\nThe Spread of Christianity http://counterapologetics.blubrry.net/2018/04/27/ca26-the-spread-of-christianity/\n\noriginally released via podcast (04/27/2018) \n\n\n\ntranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/the-spread-of-christianity/\n\nBart Ehrman's The Triumph of Christianity https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Christianity-Forbidden-Religion-Swept/dp/1501136704\n\nEhrman interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGIEKvkOHEM\n\nHitchens clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD_WptjCMPI\n\nPew religious data https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/05/christians-remain-worlds-largest-religious-group-but-they-are-declining-in-europe/\n\nEstimating the number of people who have ever been born https://www.prb.org/articles/how-many-people-have-ever-lived-on-earth/\n\n\n\n00:00 introduction\n\n02:05 one-third?\n\n8:08 does it all hinge on Constantine?\n\n10:48 memetic fitness: evangelism, exclusivity, the afterlife\n\n17:12 the only sadistic literature in the ancient world\n\n20:27 in summary\n\n22:47 goodbye\n\n#apologetics #atheist #counterapologetics #atheism #christianity #thespreadofchristianity",

    "title": "Tunnel Vision Reductionism",
    "description": "We discuss poetic naturalism and its nemesis, tunnel vision reductionism. Tunnel vision reductionism takes one description of reality and declares it to be the “real” description of reality to the exclusion of all others. At the very least, the given lower level of description is considered “more true” than higher-level descriptions.\n\nThe basic problem with tunnel vision reductionism is that it has a narrow and inconsistent notion of the real. Neurons are taken to be real, but emotions are illusory (or at least, less real than neurons). Both are emergent, higher level phenomena, but for some reason, the former is the true description. But if love isn’t real because it’s a higher level description, then neurons aren’t real either. Neither are chemicals like oxytocin. But of course, higher level descriptions are real. There are many legitimate theories, models, vocabularies, stories, and ways of talking about the world. As poetic naturalist Sean Carroll puts it, “if a particular way of talking turns out to be sufficiently accurate and useful, the elements in its corresponding vocabulary deserve to be called real.” If we describe the biochemical correlates of love, we haven’t described everything there is to know about love, nor have we given the “real” description of love.\n\n“But all this only works if we reject reductive materialism, right?” No! This is true especially if one accepts reductive materialism. On reductive materialism, the feeling of love and oxytocin are both real in exactly the same way.\n\nhttps://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2021/05/13/tunnel-vision-reductionism/\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/36-tunnel-vision-reductionism-is-love-just-chemical/id1474408172?i=1000521940443\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "title": "William Lane Craig’s Four Facts about the Resurrection",
    "description": "“Any responsible historian, then, who seeks to give an account of the matter, must deal with these four independently established facts.” William Lane Craig has four non-negotiable, “established facts” that we apparently need to explain as non-believers.\n\n(1) Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea in the tomb.\n\n(2) On the Sunday following his crucifixion, Jesus’ tomb was found empty by a group of his women followers.\n\n(3) On different occasions and under various circumstances different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive from the dead.\n\n(4) The original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe that Jesus was risen from the dead despite their having every predisposition to the contrary.\n\nAll four of these claims are possible to dispute. In fact, they’re not that hard to cast doubt on. But does it even matter? These four facts don’t go a long way. If we grant all four of Craig’s facts for the sake of argument, a resurrection is probably not the best explanation.\n\nListen to the podcast on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417?mt=2\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps /\n\n00:00 WLC's four minimal facts\n00:48 One\n05:56 Bad faith?\n08:24 Two\n12:30 The empty tomb\n14:00 Three\n17:25 Four\n18:27 Who would die for a lie?\n22:18 Four pointless claims",

    "description": "Arthur Schopenhauer developed a fascinating version of dual-aspect monism, according to which from outside, the world appears as representation, but from inside, it appears as will: ontological monism and epistemological dualism. To Schopenhauer, desire-driven will is what we are from inside, and he goes on to argue that we should think of the underlying reality of all appearance in the same way. You represent my will as a body, but there’s an underlying reality to your representation that’s experiential in character. Schopenhauer thinks the basis of this dual-aspect character of reality pervades the natural world, organic and inorganic. Why? Because this is our only form of insight into—or acquaintance with—anything as a thing in itself.\n\nWe also discuss the connection between Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, whether Schopenhauer is an idealist or a panpsychist, and explore a couple arguments for panpsychism.\n\n“[O]n the path of objective knowledge, thus starting from the representation, we shall never get beyond the representation...We shall therefore remain at the outside of things; we shall never be able to penetrate into their inner nature, and investigate what they are in themselves…So far, I agree with Kant. But … we ourselves are the thing-in-itself. Consequently, a way from within stands open to us to that real inner nature of things to which we cannot penetrate from without.  It is, so to speak, a subterranean passage, a secret alliance, which, as if by treachery, places us all at once in the fortress that could not be taken by attack from without.”\n\nSHOWNOTES, LINKS, & REFERENCES: https://audioboom.com/posts/7758773-33-schopenhauer-on-mind-matter\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2020/12/23/schopenhauer-on-mind-matter/\n\nFollow on Twitter @waldenpod and @OnPanpsychism\n\nListen to Counter Apologetics here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417?mt=2\n\nListen to Walden Pod here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172\n\n/ timestamps /\n\n00:00 Schopenhauer's personality \n\n02:23 Will and Representation \n\n10:15 Panpsychism and the key to movement\n\n16:46 A subterranean passage\n\n20:27 Different sides of the same mountain",

He argues that the meager moral fruits of theism, mind-brain dependence, evolution, the biological roles of pain and pleasure, tragedies, divine silence during tragedies, and religious confusion are not what we would expect to find if theism were true.

    "title": "The Argument from Biblical Confusion",
    "description": "The existence of Biblical, Koranic, or Talmudic discord (and therefore soteriological confusion) is not easy to square with an omni-god who inspired, dictated, or otherwise controlled the contents of his holy book. The Bible is long, vague, contradictory, ambiguous, and has no obvious message. There are about as many interpretations of the Bible as there are readers of the Bible. Why should this be the case? Wouldn’t god want to make her message as clear as possible, especially since these issues are literally life and death? If god is omniscient and omnipotent, she would know exactly how to make her message impossible to misunderstand, leaving no room for misinterpretation or confusion. In her omniscience, she would see all the strife, bloodshed, and damnation that would result from her lack of clarity; if she was omni-benevolent, she would want to avoid this and make her message clear. How is it possible that two sincere believers, approaching god’s word in good faith, can come away with clashing interpretations of the message that leaves one of them destined to burn for all eternity?\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/argument-from-biblical-confusion/\n\nThe Argument from Biblical Confusion against Christianity - Jonathan Garner https://jonathandavidgarner.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/the-argument-from-biblical-confusion-against-christianity/\n\nquote from Christian Smith's \"The Bible Made Impossible\" https://jamesmacmillan.wordpress.com/2018/04/14/the-single-reality-that-has-most-shaped-the-organizational-and-cultural-life-of-the-christian-church/amp/\n\nListen to and review Counter Apologetics: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen",

    "description": "Jordan Peterson is an unusual Christian apologist. Beyond a few of the standard apologetic tropes (we need god to be moral, atheists aren’t really atheists, Judeo-Christian values created Western civilization, atheism leads to communism), Peterson defends god by adopting a pragmatic conception of truth that allows him to circumvent traditional arguments about god’s existence. He claims to be a Christian, but his Christianity is not one most Christians would recognize. And yet, many have tried to claim him as their own.\n\nWe explore Peterson’s notion of Jesus, God, and truth, and touch on his belief that atheism is corrosive to civilization and to morality itself. We also discuss the utility of fiction, the future of Christianity, and psychonautic Shaman biologists.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\nTranscript https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/02/the-god-of-jordan-peterson/\n\nRelevant citations and links in shownotes can be found here: http://counterapologetics.blubrry.net/2018/08/19/ca36-the-god-of-jordan-peterson-pt-i/ \nand here: http://counterapologetics.blubrry.net/2018/09/02/ca37-the-god-of-jordan-peterson-pt-ii/\n\nSupport the podcast at https://www.patreon.com/counter\n\nDownload and review Counter Apologetics here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/counter-apologetics/id1273573417\n\nListen to our sister show, Walden Pod, here: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/walden-pod/id1474408172",

Isn’t panpsychism unfalsifiable? \n\n11:03 (3) Isn’t physics entirely on the side of materialism? \n\n17:33 (4) Wouldn’t panpsychism force us to add a particle to the standard model? \n\n24:50 Interlude — a few advantages of panpsychism\n\n27:13  (5) Pan-nifty-ism. Dan Dennett’s reductio cuts to the heart of the issue: is Nagelian consciousness reducible? Is what-it-is-like-ness analogous to élan vital or fluidity? \n\n29:38 (6) Mysterianism. Should we even expect consciousness to be rationally intelligible?\n\n33:36 (7) The woo accusation\n\n35:29 (8) Is [insert inanimate object here] conscious?\n\n36:19 (9) Won’t science eventually solve consciousness?\n\n38:47 (10) Doesn’t panpsychism open the door to parapsychology and other pseudoscience?\n\n42:31 (11) The Combination Problem. Widely considered to be the most serious difficulty facing panpsychism, the Combination Problem deserves a little extra time. The exact nature of the problem depends on your view of fundamental reality (the parts that are being combined) and the self (what is being formed through combination). We also discuss Galileo, the fusion view, Giulio Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory, and a few other related issues.",
