Currently, the mainstream \"news\" networks are slanted, overproduced (e.g., lack spontaneity and authenticity) and overly-controlling in terms what views or people they will allow. We're working on growing a truly non-partisan platform that allows for raw, unedited takes on the big questions of our time. \n\nIf this resonates with you, consider joining us in carrying out this vision:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/ModernDayDebate\n\nPayPal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ModernDayDebate\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nOUR PODCAST\nApple: apple.co/2LpVzR2\nSpotify: spoti.fi/3nJwiOA\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOUR SOCIAL MEDIA\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/moderndaydebate\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Qp7VtZ2\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ModernDayDebate (@ModernDayDebate)\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ModernDayDebate\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDISCLAIMER The views shared by guests on Modern-Day Debate are not necessarily representative of the views of Modern-Day Debate, James, or any university he has or has had any affiliation with.

There was a bit of confusion regarding wither the debate was on whether evil should reduce our probability of theism more broadly (even if there is evidence for theism as Dr Brown argued) or whether there is an theistic explanation for a specific argument (Alex's argument in this case). Thus, if it seemed as if the speakers were talking past each other, this was my (James') fault and something I should have discerned and communicated prior to the debate with the speakers. I'm sorry for that.\n\nLinks to speakers:\n\nDr Malpass: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwbA80IQy8pfbil09XiBKfw?fbclid=IwAR093u49hzRvSeydxH8aOb1e9asMkl1jdXKVWKmDNjdreUjQcnbp6Dkzz9s\n\nDr Brown: https://www.youtube.com/user/AskDrBrownVideos\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nOur (MDD) story: My name is James Kunz and I'm a doctoral student in psychology in Colorado, US.
