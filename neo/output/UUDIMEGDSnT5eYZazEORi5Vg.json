Lots of smarter YouTubers have talked about this film more intelligently, but I didn't want to not make a video about it.

Until then, thank you for your support. \n\nI'd also like to add an addendum here thanking my subscribers and especially my patrons and donors who support me, as well as my friend Cincosechzehn for helping me find one of the sources I used for this video. She's a gem. Thank you also to Demon Mama for reacting to and boosting this one. It's always a trial making a passion project that a lot of people don't see.

    "description": "I could have kept working on this for another half of a year, to be honest, but sometimes you have to know when to move on from a project, and I was trying so hard to get it down to around 3 or 4 hours. Oh well, maybe next time. This upload took forever to do thanks to my low tech setup and poor connection. I'd like if the audio quality and editing were better, but I'm just one person. \n\nThis video was inspired by Demon Mama's stream attempts to beat the Dark Souls and From Software soulslikes for her audience, and by the immense passion that this community has inspired in me for these games. Aside from the wonderful creators I referenced in the video, my fabulous contributors and the amazing writers I quoted from, I would also like to dedicate this video to my former professor, Dr. Rejack, who first inspired me to start taking new media studies seriously. It is because of him that I have attempted with seriousness and anything resembling rigor to understand games and gaming on a deeper level. \n\nEDIT: The Bibliography is finally available in the description after a ~48 hour gap. The video has had some functionality and editing errors. Apologies again for the extra wait. One error in particular bears mentioning here. Readers should note that unfortunately in the visuals on screen, Greg Costikyan's last name was spelled incorrectly/inconsistently and has a \"C\" and not a \"K\" in it in the Bibliography. Apologies to the wonderful Mr. Costikyan for the error.\n\nMusic at the end during the credits has been muted (now partially, perhaps eventually fully) due to (false!) copyright claims on behalf of a record company which owns the rights to a hip-hop artist who sampled the Dark Souls track in question for a skit on their album. This is obviously an atrocious and blatant misuse of YouTube's Content ID system, but as there is no mechanism for disputing claims on the grounds that the claimant does not in fact own the disputed audio, I have opted to mute the video as opposed to losing 100% of what little revenue I gain to false claimants. Please understand. \n\nThis video features the voices of the following creators who read the poetry sections!

    "description": "Note to present and future patrons: as this video is over a week late, it contains patron names and thanks from yours truly that was due for the month of March. Further patron rewards will be forthcoming. Get in touch with me in DMs on Twitter if you have any questions or a reward you're interested in!\r\n\r\nThis is a defense of the Hobbit trilogy, and a little more besides. I would find it most touching if you all would listen and consider what I have to say before telling me what your thoughts on all this are. Consider also viewing Lindsay Ellis' three part video series on the Hobbit trilogy, it's quite good. \r\n\r\nSupport this channel via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CH4R10T\n \r\nCreated with Movie Studio Platinum",
