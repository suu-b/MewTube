    "description": "What makes us human?\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more fluent, capable, and eerily human-like, this question takes on new urgency. Is being human just about sentience, intelligence, and memory — qualities a machine can mimic — or is there something deeper?\n\nIn this long-form philosophical essay, I explore what it means to be human through the insights of Pascal, Montaigne, Descartes, Hobbes, and Locke, and ask how AI forces us to rethink ourselves.\n\nAlong the way we’ll consider:\n\nPascal’s haunting claim that we only love one another for “borrowed qualities.”\n\nMontaigne’s vision of the self as always in flux and contradiction.\n\nHow early modern thinkers used primary and secondary qualities to define reality.\n\nWhy AI may look human on the surface, but lacks the inner opacity of lived experience.\n\nThis is not a video about how close AI is to being human — but about how AI helps reveal what we already take for granted about ourselves.\n\n📌 If you’re interested in philosophy, theology, and the big questions raised by new technology, you’re in the right place.",

    "title": "Should We Care About AI Welfare?",
    "description": "Can artificial intelligence have welfare? Could a machine deserve care?\n\nIn this video essay, I explore Anthropic’s recent move to let its Claude models end abusive conversations: a design choice framed as a “low-cost safeguard” in case AI systems turn out to have morally significant states. But this isn’t just about the future of AI — it’s about us.\n\nAlong the way we’ll meet:\nMedieval pigs on trial and Athenian axes banished for murder 🐖⚖️\nBurberry and brand personality 👔\nThomas Hobbes on personation, Foucault on askēsis, and Paul Ricoeur on the “as if” 🤝\nAugustine’s Confessions, where love itself is a gravitational force 💫\n\nThe question of “AI welfare” isn’t science fiction. It’s about what kind of moral ecosystem we are building now — through our speech, our habits, and our social fictions.\n\nSo: should we treat AIs “as if” they matter, not because they are persons, but because of what such practices do to us?\n\n#AIethics #Philosophy #AnthropicClaude",

    "description": "🎥 We Need to Talk About Hierarchy: Jordan Peterson, Tim Keller, and Jacob’s Ladder\n\nWhat happens when you fall—and no longer have the strength to climb?\n\nIn this video we explore a striking juxtaposition: Jordan Peterson's existential interpretation of Jacob’s ladder from Genesis 28, and Timothy Keller’s gospel-centered reading of the same passage. One sees the ladder as the call to ascend—through moral striving, order, and responsibility. The other sees it as the architecture of grace—a vision of a God who descends.\n\nDrawing on two remarkable talks—Peterson’s conversation with John Vervaeke and Jordan Hall, and Keller’s 2001 sermon “The Openness of Heaven”—we investigate what these two thinkers reveal not only about the biblical text, but about two profoundly different understandings of human nature, morality, hope, and the shape of ultimate reality.\n\n📌 In this video, we reflect on:\n* Why hierarchy is such a powerful—and dangerous—metaphor for the moral life\n* How Peterson’s vision of truth, responsibility, and ascent has given meaning to many adrift in a chaotic world\n* Why Keller’s vision of grace, descent, and divine initiative might offer a deeper, more stable foundation\n* The psychological, theological, and existential implications of trying to “earn” your meaning\n* How the Bible overturns every worldly ladder—moral, social, and spiritual—by proclaiming a God who comes down\n\nThis is not just a theological debate—it’s a deeply human question: Are we meant to climb our way to wholeness? Or are we meant to be carried, even when we cannot climb?\n\nWhether you’re a Peterson enthusiast, a Keller admirer, or just someone thinking seriously about meaning and morality, you’re warmly invited into this thoughtful exploration.\n\n📖 “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.” — Genesis 28:16\n\n[00:00] Introduction to the video's theme: hierarchy and its impact on our worldview\n[00:16] Setting the scene for Jacob's ladder in Genesis 28\n[04:16] Reading of Genesis 28:10-22\n[08:10] Jordan Peterson's interpretation of Jacob's ladder\n[14:45] Peterson's view on hierarchies and their role in human existence\n[16:30] The concept of high and low in Peterson's thinking\n[19:19] Peterson's perspective on the political left and right regarding hierarchies\n[24:07] The pervasive influence of hierarchies in our lives\n[33:11] Timothy Keller's interpretation of Jacob's ladder\n[39:31] Comparison of Peterson's and Keller's views on the meaning of life and moral ascent\n[43:05] The consequences of building life on ascent, according to Keller\n[53:50] Keller's perspective on sin and atonement\n[58:39] Jesus's use of the image of Jacob's ladder in the New Testament\n[01:03:03] Keller's view on God's interaction with worldly hierarchies\n[01:13:44] The concept of subversive fulfillment in the Bible\n[01:14:25] The role of the cross in Keller's theology\n[01:26:04] Peterson's implicit reliance on concepts that Keller explicitly addresses\n[01:34:32] The contrasting roles of the individual and Christ in Peterson's and Keller's narratives\n[01:35:50] Conclusion and reflection on the question of \"What happens when you fall?\"\n[01:43:00] Final thoughts on Jacob's story and the message of grace\n\n#JordanPeterson #TimKeller #JacobsLadder #Genesis28 #Christianity #Grace #Hierarchy #Theology #Philosophy #FaithAndCulture #MoralLife #Gospel",

    "title": "Jordan Peterson, Russell Brand, and the modern quest for a unified self",
    "description": "What does it mean to be a unified self? In a recent conversation, Jordan Peterson and Russell Brand wrestled with one of the most pressing philosophical and existential questions of our time: how do we integrate our scattered, divided selves into something coherent and whole?\n\nPeterson and Brand offer two answers—one rooted in desire and power, the other in voluntary self-sacrifice. But is there a third, deeper, and more transformative way? This video takes their discussion further, revealing a richer, more existentially satisfying path that challenges the assumptions underlying both their positions.\n\nDrawing from Nietzsche, Freud, Descartes, Montaigne, and Augustine, this analysis uncovers the hidden logic of power at work in both hedonism and self-discipline, and explores how the Christian tradition offers an alternative not based on possession, but on dispossession—a paradoxical path to true selfhood.\n\nTopics discussed include\n🔹 The dangers of defining the self through desire or self-sacrifice\n🔹 How Descartes’ rationalism and Montaigne’s skepticism mirror Peterson’s two models\n🔹 Augustine’s radical vision: unity through doxological dispossession\n🔹 Why true selfhood isn’t about maximizing power, but about transcendent transformation.\n\nThis is not simply a critique of Jorddan Peterson and Russell Brand, indeed there is wisdom in much of what they say. It is a response to their provocation, an invitation to rethink what it means to be a self, to move beyond the logic of control and power, and to embrace an identity shaped not by the parts of our selves we privilege, but by a wholeness we receive.\n\nJoin us as we explore the profound implications of this debate for philosophy, theology, and the modern search for meaning.\n\n👉 Like, comment, and subscribe for more deep dives into philosophy, theology, and culture!\n\n#JordanPeterson #RussellBrand #Philosophy #Christianity #Identity #Selfhood #Existentialism #Nietzsche #Augustine #Theology",

I am not claiming that the ideas I discuss were intended by those who originally commissioned or wove the tapestries but that, viewed from a modern perspective, the series unfolds a powerful commentary on the symbolic and material commons, enclosure, and the intricate relations between the common, the public and the private.",

    "description": "An introduction to the book \"The State of Nature and the Shaping of Modernity: Tracing the Roots of Colonialism, Secularity, and Ecology\", forthcoming with Cambridge University Press in 2025.\nIn this video, the first in a new series and rather longer than the others, I read the book's Introduction, entitled \"The State of Nature We're In\", setting the scene for its context and argument.\n\nThe Introduction explores the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a cornerstone of modern Western thought, influencing how the West perceives human nature, colonialism, secularity, and ecology. Examining foundational theorists like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, I argue that the state of nature reflects the fragmented, contradictory narratives that shape Western modernity, and takes us to the heart of contemporary culture wars. Hobbes depicted the state of nature as chaotic and brutal, while Rousseau saw it as idyllic but corrupted by society, and these diverse views underpin contemporary debates, revealing deep cultural tensions about identity, legitimacy, and progress. The book aims to dissect the state of nature motif, highlighting its ongoing ideological and cultural significance.\n\nChapters:\n10:25 Whose state of nature? Which Modernity?\n14:19 Hobbes Lite\n29:47 Rousseau Lite\n40:12 No State of Nature \n55:09 Western Modernity en abyme in the State of Nature \n1:04:52 The Argument of this Book",

I show that his thought has a distinct character and power that stands alongside contemporaries such as Derrida, Deleuze and Foucault in its importance, but distinguishes itself from them in its approach and potential. I identify three ways in which Serres's thought is distinctive, and frame them in terms of the three images of a path, a window and a cave, corresponding to the ideas that he thinks combinatorially rather than analytically, ecologically rather than dualistically, and prepositionally rather than substantively. After describing each image I briefly sketch how Serres’s way of thinking offers crucial and unique insights into some of the most important issues we face today.",

With Marko's permission, I took a video of his lecture and post it here. I found it to provide a depth of understanding about current events that is rare in the daily news cycle, and Marko's reflections on the implications of the Russian invasion for Arts and Humanities faculties were particularly illuminating and challenging.\nThe video of Marko's lecture is followed by audio of his response to a question I asked about the particular role for arts and humanities scholars in responding to the invasion.\n\nAbstract: \nIn this talk I’ll try to combine two rather disparate things. The first is a description of the Russian-Ukrainian War as it appears to me on the day of the seminar, together with ambitiously brief sketches of the relevant short-term and long-term antecedent contexts and of already existing and potential repercussions.The second is an account of some of the questions that have posed themselves to me as I have tried to balance my personal intellectual and emotional investment in the issue, the ideal of objectivity, the media imperatives of brevity and clarity, and my ongoing inner debate about the ethical grounds of postcolonial studies.Then we can all go to breakfast.",

    "description": "This is a recording of a paper given at the Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy Conference, December 2021.\n\nPaper title\n\"Artificial state of nature: how an aporia of myth shapes our experience of emancipation and the market\"\n\nAbstract\nThis paper argues that there are two contradictory modern Western understandings of nature, vividly captured in the social contract theories of Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau respectively. These theories borrow the logic of the theological \"fourfold state\" of humanity, but we are no longer clear today how we can be saved. These very different concepts of nature give rise to two incompatible paradigms for engaging with the natural world, two incompatible accounts of the modern West's most fundamental value: freedom, and two radically different views of the market, which itself acts like a second nature. The paper argues that we must both recognise this incompatiblity, and that we will de facto make a choice between these concepts. Perhaps a way of reconciling them can be found by returning to the theological narrative on which they both draw.",

    "description": "This is a recording of a paper I gave at the 2021 Australian Society of French Studies Conference.\n\nPaper title\nSiting Rousseau’s state of Nature\n\nAbstract\nRousseau’s account of the social contract relies, both logically and rhetorically, on his reconstruction of the so-called “state of nature”, a supposed pre-contractual condition of human life. There is much debate about whether or not Rousseau intends his state of nature to describe a historically and geographically “real” situation, but this paper argues that focusing on the question of the state of nature’s historicity misses both its power and its danger. The paper argues that the more important question is how the state of nature, as a non-site, serves to construct a social imaginary in which certain political relations become possible and desirable. Approaching the Rousseauian state of nature as a site, a topos, the paper reflects on the power of non-sites to shape social and political spaces today, drawing on contemporary reaffirmations and rejections of the state of nature idea. The state of nature is a site that continues to influence debates about ecology and the colonial legacy. The argument has implications for other contemporary non-sites such as the perfectly free market, the society of radical equality and the dystopia of looming Fascism.",

    "description": "This is a paper presented at the 2020 SEP-FEP (Society for European Philosophy and Forum for European Philosophy) conference: https://sep-fep.com/\n\nAbstract:\nOne of Michel Serres’s best-known works in the anglophone world is The Natural Contract, in which he argues that our current social contract dangerously neglects the non-human and needs supplementing with a new settlement that incorporates ecological interests. Prescient when it was first published in 1990, this paper argues that The Natural Contract is an indispensable document for making sense of the increasing calls in the wake of COVID-19 for a new social contract. How can Serres’s natural contract specifically, and his thought more broadly, help us to come to terms with the historical moment in which we find ourselves? This paper will use Serres’s reflections both on the social and natural contracts across a number of works to help us understand what a social contract is (and isn’t!), how it can be a tool both for change and exclusion, and how we can best respond to contemporary demands for its renewal.\n\nYou can find my interview on \"Michel Serres, Philosophy and the Contemporary World\" for the conference here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73C9UzHQzYw\n\nFor more content on Michel Serres, see https://christopherwatkin.com/category/michel-serres/\nFor more reflections on the social contract, see https://christopherwatkin.com/category/social-contract/\n\nCan you tell that the paper was recorded at midnight Melbourne time?!",

    "description": "This video introduces the 'Ends of Autonomy' colloquium co-hosted by Prof Oliver Davis (Warwick) and Dr Christopher Watkin (Monash), 7-9 July.\n\nThe colloquium, and the broader research project of which it is part, analyse how new social, scientific and technological realities are changing our understanding of freedom, and explore how we can develop new accounts of freedom that empower citizens to make informed decisions about their liberty. The dominant modern concept of individual autonomy was not designed for today’s world of extremism, surveillance, big data, climate change and global public health, all of which complicate its emancipatory axis of oppression and liberation. Yet a sense that we have been freed from past oppressions remains fundamental to our self-construction as individuals and to the collective identity of modern Western societies.\n\nthis project brings together a cross-disciplinary group of researchers from the arts, humanities and social sciences to investigate how concepts of freedom have developed historically and to consider whether they can and should continue to change in response to emerging social challenges and if so, how. \n\nThe four foci for the project are:\n(i) the history of freedom, autonomy, emancipation and liberation\n(ii) the impact of technology (including AI, big data, and 'algorithmic governmentality')\n(iii) sustainability, climate and freedom\n(iv) surveillance, extremism and freedom\n\nIf you would like to be added to the mailing list for future 'Ends of Autonomy' announcements, including news about the December 2020 Zoom conference and videos of selected talks from the July event, please DM @DrChrisWatkin.\n\nhttps://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/modernlanguages/research/french/currentprojects/beyondautonomy",

    "description": "This is the first look at an app I'm developing to help people who want a simple and effective way to capture thoughts, quotes and insights on the go. \n\nYou can rank your thoughts in an upvote knock-out tournament, and as your library of ideas grows your most important insights will always remain on top.\nYou can import and export groups of thoughts or quotes, and archive old thoughts.\n\nEASE OF USE\nThoughtCatcher is built on two simple principles:\n     - make it as easy as possible to record a new thought, quote or insight right from the start screen\n     - make it as quick and fun as possible to rank thoughts and remember the most important ones.\nThat's it. No complex hierarchies. No folder structures. No color coding. Just you and your thoughts, ranked by their importance to you.\n\nORDER BY UPVOTING\n* Reviewing and ranking thoughts is as easy as one tap. \n* Your ideas are automatically grouped in pairs, and you tap one thought from each pair to go through to the next round. However many thoughts you have, eventually you end up with one most important one on top, and a pyramid in descending order of importance to you. \n* Your thoughts remain ordered in one simple hierarchy at all times, and adding new thoughts is always straightforward and hassle free.\n* It's a knock-out tournament for your creative mind, and each review and ranking helps you remember your most important thoughts.\n\nPERSONAL GROWTH\n* Use ThoughtCatcher to grow and organise your collection of personal development quotations, and to cultivate the discipline of recording your insights about your life, work or the world.\n\nINSPIRATION\n* Feed your inspiration by importing one of the banks of famous thoughts from christopherwatkin.com [coming soon]\n\nFLEXIBILITY\n* Catch your thoughts by typing, by cutting and pasting from websites, or through text-to-speech dictation on your smartphone.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n* Importing or exporting ideas in bulk is as easy as cut and paste. Transfer thoughts from other apps with ease, without the need for complex file formats. And you can always get all your data out of ThoughtCatcher whenever you want.\n\nPRIVACY\n* ThoughtCatcher is completely private. The only copy of your thoughts is on your own device, until you choose to export them. No servers, no data sharing. You are in control of your own data.\n\nhttp://christopherwatkin.com/ThoughtCatcher/",

    "title": "Not more of the same: Michel Serres and Alterity. 2020 version",
    "description": "DEAKIN UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY SEMINAR, August 29, 2017\n\nThe themes of difference and alterity are commonly thought to characterise French thought in the second half of the twentieth century, with canonical thinkers such as Lévinas, Derrida and, latterly, Nancy elaborating diverse ethical positions that nevertheless each accord a privileged and positive place to otherness. In recent years, however, a new philosophy of sameness has emerged, most prominently in the thought of Alain Badiou, claiming that the ethics of alterity is bankrupt, disingenuous and dangerous, and that it is identity and sameness, not difference and alterity, that are of positive ethical value. In this talk I introduce into this debate the thought of Michel Serres, in the light of which we can see that Badiou shares more in common with his supposed opponents than either he or they are ready to admit. For all that distinguishes Badiou’s position from that of his antagonists, they share the fundamental assumption that either identity or difference should be coded positively, but not both equally. In a move more radical than Badiou’s own intervention, Serres offers a different account, one in which neither sameness nor difference is ethically privileged over the other. Couched in the language of asymmetry, parasitism, inclination and enantiomorphy, Serres’s approach shows us how we can move on from the conflict between identity and alterity to a more scientifically informed and, I argue, more ethically compelling account of the relation between identity and alterity.\n\nIn this new 2020 version I have improved the sound quality of the video, which is the original 2017 recording.\n\nPDF handout: https://christopherwatkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Chris-Watkin-More-of-the-Same-Michel-Serres-and-the-Question-of-Alterity-in-Recent-French-Thought-handout.pdf\n\nLink to video on my website: https://christopherwatkin.com/2017/08/30/youtube-video-paper-michel-serres-question-alterity-recent-french-thought-improved-audio/",

    "description": "I made this lecture for my students in the Literature and Modernism unit at Moansh University. Beckett came at the end of the course, after weeks on André Breton, Jean Cocteau, Leonora Carrington, Lu Xun, Eileen Chang, Ding Ling, and Jean Rhys.\nThere is talk in university circles these days of the lecture format being dead. I think that's a naive view, like saying radio is dead because of the invention of television. \nSo in addition to helping my students understand Beckett, I wanted to see what I could do with a 50 minute \"lecture\" slot under lockdown. I gave myself an afternoon and an evening to produce the finished product (which encoded overnight and was uploaded the next morning) from notes I had written in a previous year.\nAfter receiving feedback from students who watched the \"lecture\", I'm more convinced than ever that \"young people\" today are more than capable of sitting for 50 minutes and consuming information, providing it is presented with some thoughtfulness. \nTo abandon the 50 minute concentration span is, in my opinion, to concede too much territory to a troubling ideology that assumes a thinking elite will manage the attention of the rest of the population for their own ends. Teaching students to have their attention managed by other people is a problematic way to prepare them to thrive in a world in which attention is a commodity that is viciously and expertly hoarded.\nTeaching students to manage their own attention and to focus for extended periods is, perhaps, one of the most empowering life lessons we can teach during their time with us, providing them with a significant bulwark against being manipulated in the years beyond university.",

    "description": "A talk given by Dr Christopher Watkin in the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, Stanford University, Thursday 30 January, 2020.\n\nAfter a long period of under-appreciation, Michel Serres's prescient and unique writing is now beginning to receive the attention it has long deserved. This talk explores the distinctiveness and contemporaneity of Serres’s thought, paying particular attention to the  \"figures\" that distinguish not only the themes he addresses, but also the way he approaches and passes between them. What emerges is a picture of a body of work radically distinct from that of his contemporaries Derrida, Deleuze and Foucault, and a set of concerns the timeliness of which is only now becoming evident.\n\nDr Christopher Watkin is a Senior Lecturer at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, where he teaches across French and Literary Studies. He is the author of a number of books in modern and contemporary thought, including Phenomenology or Deconstruction? (2009), Difficult Atheism (2011), and French Philosophy Today: New Figures of the Human (2016). His latest monograph, Michel Serres: Figures of Thought, is due to be published with Edinburgh University Press in early 2020. Chris is currently working on a project interrogating the concepts of freedom and liberation in contemporary thought and society in the light of what has been called the Western “emancipation narrative”. He blogs about philosophy and academic research at christopherwatkin.com, and you can find him on Twitter @DrChrisWatkin.",

    "description": "\"Foundations for Cultural Engagement\". Apologetics.com radio show from 30/05/2018, discussing Christopher Watkin's book Thinking Through Creation.\nOn this episode of the Apologetics.com Radio Show we discuss the importance of developing a biblical theory, or framework, with which to understand and engage the important cultural issues of our day. In it we discuss Christopher Watkin’s book, “Thinking Through Creation”, which brings the doctrine of the Trinity into the forefront of this conversation. With host Jason Gallagher and guests Bob Parucha and Patrick Parks.\n“If Christians do not articulate how the Bible explains all other stories in terms of its own story and how it provides a positive vision for society, then other stories will step in to explain the Bible in their own terms and provide that vision in its place.” Christopher Watkin\nPodcast home: https://apologetics.com/radio/?sermon_id=191\nMore information about Thinking Through Creation: Genesis 1 and 2 as Tools of Cultural Critique: https://christopherwatkin.com/thinking-through-creation-genesis-1-and-2-as-tools-of-cultural-critique/",

    "title": "Derrida's ethics",
    "description": "In this second of three episodes in the \"Philosophy for Theologians\" series I talk very briefly about the growing willingness to accept, from the mid 1990s onwards, that deconstruction is indeed ethical, before tackling the myth that Derrida is a relativist. I unpack the phrase “tout autre est tout autre” (“every other is wholly other”) from Derrida’s reading of Kierkegaard on Genesis 22 and then introduce the notions of double bind and aporia in relation to Derrida's Force of Law. In the second half of the episode I reflect on “tout autre est tout autre” in relation to Colossians 1:16-17, and on the difference between law and justice in the context of absolute personality theism.\n\nYou can explore these and related questions further at audialterampartem.com\n\nOriginal \"Philosophy for Theologians\" blurb: French intellectual Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) was one of the most important contributors to the post-modern philosophical movement. He was also one of the most notoriously difficult philosophers to understand. In this second episode of a three-part series, Dr. Christopher Watkin helps us understand Derrida’s moral philosophy. Dr. Watkin is senior lecturer in French Studies at Monash University, Australia.\nOriginal link http://reformedforum.org/pft22/\n\nPhilosophy for Theologians aims to look critically at the problems of philosophy by considering everything in light of God's revelation. The program not only wants to address philosophical questions but also to equip you with a way to think about these questions.",

    "title": "Western Cultural Overview  The Death of God, Modernism and Existentialism",
    "description": "This session of the 2011 European Leadership Forum in Eger, Hungary, considers Nietzsche’s account of the \"death of God\" in his parable of the madman, exploring what it means (and what it doesn’t mean!) that \"God is dead\" in Western culture. We see how the death of God leads to the death of meaning, man, and the author. We then follow this current through the modernism of the early twentieth century to the heyday of existentialism on the Parisian left bank of the 1950s, picking up themes from the thought of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. No prior philosophical knowledge is assumed, and the session is introductory in nature. Most of the material will be familiar to those who have studied these areas at university level. Each of these sessions will include a \"toolbox\" section on how to appreciate and engage with the ideas covered from a Christian point of view, as well as time for discussion.\n\nA talk outline is available here:\nhttp://foclonline.org/sites/foclonline.org/files/outline_57.pdf\n\nDate recorded: 22 May 2011\n\nOriginal link: http://foclonline.org/talk/western-cultural-overview-death-god-modernism-and-existentialism",
