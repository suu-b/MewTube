    "title": "A Christmas Without Jesus",
    "description": "What happens when the symbol of Jesus no longer represents kindness, compassion, or love? In this deeply honest Christmas message, Britt Hartley explains why this is the first year she has chosen to remove Jesus entirely from her home—and why she believes it may actually honor the historical Jesus more authentically. From religious trauma to nationalism, this video explores how Christianity’s modern meaning has shifted, and why letting go can sometimes be the most faithful act.\n\nThe conversation also tackles the Santa question head-on: Do we lie to our kids? Do we replace religion with consumerism? Using real-world examples—from scientific skepticism to storytelling traditions—this video invites parents and families to reflect on their core values and make intentional choices. Whether you’re religious, secular, or somewhere in between, this message challenges you to rethink what Christmas really stands for.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Intro\n00:43 Jesus Memories\n01:29 Kindness Focus\n02:17 Modern Christianity\n03:03 Power Problem\n03:58 Forget Jesus\n04:48 Symbols Matter\n05:38 Mourning Faith\n06:26 Santa Question\n07:21 Honesty Value\n08:11 Science Example\n08:55 Storytelling\n09:47 Family Values\n10:28 Consumerism Trap\n11:21 Two Messages\n12:14 Jesus Free Home\n13:15 Closing\n\n#ChristmasReflection\n\n#ReligiousDeconstruction\n\n#ParentingValues\n\n#SecularChristmas\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "title": "Is Christianity Secretly Gay?",
    "description": "Is Christianity actually about God—or is it about men bonding with other men? In this video, we unpack a provocative but deeply researched question: why Christianity reserves its deepest loyalty, devotion, and emotional intimacy for men—while women are reduced to support roles. Drawing from feminist theory, religious history, and modern Christian nationalism, this breakdown explores how patriarchal religion functions as a homosocial system rather than a spiritually inclusive one.\n\nWe examine male hero worship, the erasure of the divine feminine, Christian purity culture, and why figures like Nick Fuentes unintentionally reveal Christianity’s emotional subtext. From medieval monasteries to modern men’s ministries, this video explains why women often leave Christianity feeling unseen—and why Christian nationalism is panicking as women reclaim autonomy, embodiment, and spiritual authority.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Intro\n01:03 Patriarchy Defined\n02:03 Male Heroes\n03:11 Mary Explained\n04:10 Male Loyalty\n05:13 Fuentes Example\n06:53 Compulsory Hetero\n07:45 Christian Nationalism\n08:48 Women Leaving\n09:51 Homosocial Faith\n11:44 Body Control\n13:21 Decentering Jesus\n15:10 Male Brotherhood\n17:01 Modern Movements\n19:05 Why It’s Panicking\n20:47 Homophobia Link\n22:50 Bible Evidence\n24:43 Homoerotic Art\n26:42 Final Take\n\n#Christianity\n#ReligiousDeconstruction\n#ChristianNationalism\n#Patriarchy\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Christian nationalism and the political right have looked “married” for years—but this video breaks down the signs that the relationship is getting shaky: viral backlash when churches refused to help a mom get baby formula, pastors resigning after being pressured to endorse Trump, and growing public discomfort with turning Christianity into a political identity. You’ll also hear why immigration and ICE are becoming a major fault line inside churches, plus how scandals and public criticism from well-known Christian leaders are changing what people will tolerate.\n\nThen we zoom out to the big question: what happens next? Some young men are doubling down into a militant, politicized faith—while Gen Z women are leaving institutions in record numbers, and reform-minded Christians are trying to “reclaim” their religion from Christian nationalism. Finally, Britt Hartley wrestles with the dilemma a lot of people feel right now: is “good Christianity” the best weapon against “bad Christianity,” or does keeping the institution alive just guarantee we’ll have to fight this battle again in the future?\n\nNEW COURSE: https://stan.store/nononsensespirituality/p/get-started-with-this-amazing-course-khjlfenu\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Intro\n00:47 Formula Test\n02:26 Pastor Revolt\n05:15 Politics Replaced\n06:56 Trump Embarrassment\n10:39 ICE Split\n13:27 Abuse Scandals\n14:51 Book Wave\n17:55 Men Spike\n19:59 Women Leave\n21:46 Reform Moves\n25:38 Save Or Leave\n32:39 Final Question\n\n#ChristianNationalism\n#MAGAChristianity\n#Exvangelical\n#ChurchAndPolitics\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "America has quietly become the Wild West of spirituality, and Deepak Chopra is my case study for why that’s so dangerous. In this video, I walk through Chopra’s long-running misuse of science terms like “quantum healing,” his public claims about curing cancer with consciousness, and the newly released Jeffrey Epstein emails that show a disturbingly friendly relationship even after Epstein was a registered sex offender. I also cover anonymous allegations from a former client at the Chopra Center and why all of this points to a much larger crisis in the spiritual but not religious world, not just one “bad guru.”\n\nFrom unregulated ayahuasca and psychedelic retreats, to wellness influencers telling people to quit meds, to manifestation coaches blaming poverty on “low vibrations,” to sexual abuse in yoga and meditation communities, I map out how the U.S. has almost zero guardrails for spiritual work outside of organized religion. I share my own ethical limits as a spiritual director, how I try to avoid becoming a guru, and why you—the listener—are now the de facto ethics committee for spirituality.

    "description": "A crying baby, a desperate mom, and 40 cold calls to churches and houses of worship: that’s the viral social experiment that suddenly has everyone questioning whether U.S. churches are still earning their tax-exempt status. In this video, we walk through TikTok creator Nicki n Ali Monroe’s baby formula experiment, where she calls churches asking for one single can of formula—and documents who says yes, who says no, and what that reveals about Christian nationalism, church wealth, and real-world compassion. From white Christian churches refusing to help non-members, to instant yeses from a mosque, a Buddhist temple, and Black churches, this story exposes a brutal gap between pro-life rhetoric and actual aid to a hungry child.\n\nUsing this viral moment as a case study, we zoom out to the bigger picture: the quiet collapse of trust in organized religion, the political marriage between church and state, and why many young people—especially Gen Z women—are walking away from Christianity altogether. We connect the dots between church tax breaks, lack of transparency, global examples of regulating religious orgs, and historical parallels like the Catholic Church’s sale of indulgences leading to the Protestant Reformation. If you’ve ever wondered whether churches still provide the social safety net they claim—or what might replace them when they don’t—this video breaks it down with history, data, and a candid look at what’s shifting inside American Christianity right now.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters: \n00:00 Intro\n00:34 Viral experiment\n01:16 First church call\n02:39 Tracking yes vs no\n03:25 “We don’t do that”\n04:08 Who said yes\n04:59 Muslim generosity\n05:52 Black vs white churches\n07:38 The real Christians\n08:31 PR spin and denial\n10:02 Tax breaks bargain\n11:37 Are churches delivering?\n12:25 Historical indulgences\n14:25 Hoarding vs helping\n15:26 Cracks in church power\n16:18 Prosperity gospel failing\n17:10 How other countries regulate\n20:03 Signs of a shift\n21:52 Decline in trust\n22:48 What fills the gap\n23:39 Who survives this moment\n24:35 One woman, one phone\n25:24 Part two teaser\n\n#ChristianNationalism\n#ChurchAndState\n#Exvangelical\n#ReligiousReform\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "The FBI now uses the term “nihilistic violent extremism” to describe crimes aimed at chaos and collapse—but does that have anything to do with philosophical nihilism? In this final video of the series, we break down how “nihilism” shifts across psychology, philosophy, internet culture, and now federal classifications. Using the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing as a case study, we unpack why the attacker’s writings align more with efilism and antinatalism than with existential nihilism—and why that distinction matters.\n\nYou’ll learn the differences between philosophical nihilism (Nietzsche, Camus, Beckett), psychological despair, and the online “black-pill” vibe fueling isolated young men. We explore the FBI’s “mixed or unclear motives,” the unofficial “764 network,” and why labeling chaos as “nihilism” is more bureaucratic than philosophical.

We start with the sobering stats and then shift to practical steps you can use this week.\n\nYou’ll learn a teen-appropriate approach to existential tools: running “value experiments,” creating purpose behaviorally (“for now, I’m about… and I show it by…”), engineering real-world belonging, protecting sleep like a sport, cultivating flow, and modeling curious uncertainty.

You’ll learn how engaging on purpose, acting by your core values, designing rituals, serving others, and cultivating awe can re-train reward systems in the brain so life feels worth showing up for again. We also map what therapists can help with and where you’ll need to take the lead yourself.\n\nYou’ll hear why some modalities (e.g., ACT, logotherapy, narrative work) tend to help with existential distress while others can miss the mark, plus practical prompts like the “best possible life” writing exercise, prosocial connection, and body-based practices to get your prefrontal cortex back online. We contrast philosophical vs psychological nihilism, explain the role religion often plays, and show how to build purpose from the ground up—staying honest about reality while improving your day-to-day experience.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Intro\n01:00 Define Purpose\n01:46 Religion’s Offer\n02:30 Mormon Purpose\n03:15 Meaning Debate\n04:03 Three Perspectives\n04:50 Delusional Defined\n05:39 Religion Evidence\n06:28 Bridging Approaches\n07:19 The List Begins\n08:06 Engage Intentionally\n08:53 Knitting Example\n09:40 Live Your Values\n11:20 Tiny Value Acts\n12:13 Auschwitz Test\n13:07 CBT Limits\n14:03 Best Life Vision\n14:51 Writing Study\n15:44 Taking Risks\n16:31 Therapist Tools\n17:21 Keep Philosophy\n18:06 Purpose Now\n19:02 Serve Others\n19:56 Give to Others\n20:51 Action Required\n21:40 Build Rituals\n22:49 Why Rituals Work\n23:38 Rituals in Therapy\n24:26 Stop Doom Loop\n25:10 Body Matters\n26:00 Mind–Body Coherence\n26:57 Philosophy First\n27:44 Health as Values\n28:28 Chocolate Note\n29:13 Support Coaches\n30:02 Stop Ruminating\n30:47 Shift Question\n31:36 Cultivate Purpose\n32:26 Reframe in Therapy\n33:18 Awe Matters\n34:20 Psychedelic Note\n35:14 Brain Flexibility\n36:05 Find Community\n36:50 Cobble Belonging\n37:51 Community Shows Up\n38:43 Keep Learning\n39:42 Info vs Growth\n40:32 Change Behavior\n41:29 Religion as Tech\n42:19 Meaning Crisis\n43:10 Personal Arc\n43:57 Freedom Frame\n44:47 Engagement First\n45:36 Current Outlook\n46:28 You’re Already Here\n47:30 Determinism Thought\n48:23 Enjoy Existence\n49:19 Next Parts Teaser\n50:10 Autism Note\n50:59 Close Call\n51:57 Qualia Point\n52:50 Final Message\n53:24 Sign-Off\n\n#meaning #nihilism #purpose #therapy\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Nihilism gets thrown around in therapy and in headlines—but psychologists and philosophers mean very different things. In this video, Brit Hartley breaks down the mismatch: how clinicians often use “nihilism” to describe a state of hopelessness or burnout, while philosophers use it to describe a claim about reality and meaning. That gap can make therapy feel invalidating for people with existential or “rational” nihilism—and it explains why “find joy” or basic reframing can fall flat.\n\nYou’ll learn a practical two-axis way to locate yourself (psychological state × philosophical stance), why CBT and “gratitude only” approaches often underperform for philosophical nihilism, and how existentially trained therapists and philosophical counseling can help. We also separate nihilism from accelerationism, highlight UK models that integrate philosophy and therapy, and set up Part 2 with concrete tools to ask for the help you actually need.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Intro\n00:54 Psych Clip\n02:17 Pushback\n03:09 Psych Definition\n04:03 Phil Definition\n04:53 Quadrant Map\n05:47 Many Paths\n06:44 Therapy Gap\n07:35 Joy Critique\n09:32 CBT Limits\n10:20 Core Snags\n12:13 Rational Risk\n13:10 Free Will\n14:06 Authored Value\n15:02 Not Anti-Therapy\n15:50 UK Model\n16:51 Existential Work\n18:38 Accelerationism\n20:51 Violence Rarity\n22:40 Misused Term\n23:29 What’s Next\n24:17 Personal Notes\n25:05 Bridging Help\n26:53 Teens Angle\n27:48 Part Four\n28:40 Meaning Debate\n29:39 Takeaways\n\n#Nihilism #Existentialism #Therapy #MeaningCrisis\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

In this episode, I share the raw, vulnerable details of that night: the offerings of hard-won wisdom, a reclaimed Eucharist centered on our own bodies, burning old symbols that no longer fit, and choosing the heroine’s journey toward balance between “masculine” and “feminine” ways of being. If you’re curious how an atheist spiritual director practices meaning without dogma or hierarchy, this is for you.\n\nYou’ll hear why ritual works (nervous system regulation, transitions, grief processing), what community can look like without doctrine, and how to create your own rite—ethically, playfully, and safely. I also give a quick tour of my She Shed: the art, books, myths, and symbols that shape my practice—from Athena to Dante to Star Wars—plus a candid look at how I’m building “no-nonsense spirituality” online.

    "title": "When Religions Go Bad And Cause Harm",
    "description": "What happens when humans do religion badly? In this video, Britt Hartley breaks down the structural features that make some religions cause more harm when misused—exclusive truth claims, cosmic high stakes, centralized authority, state fusion, outsider treatment, adaptability to science, apocalyptic urgency, and sanctioning violence. She then ranks major traditions by their “worst-case” failure modes, comparing Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Baháʼí, Taoism, Shinto, indigenous traditions, Quakers, and UU—arguing why some become globally dangerous while others stay locally harmful.\n\nYou’ll learn why universalizing claims can fuel conquest, how heaven/hell frameworks distort ethics, when hierarchy cascades abuse, and why flexible, decentralized traditions usually do less damage at scale. The goal is not to dismiss beauty or truth within any faith, but to face how design choices interact with real human behavior in the modern world.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Cold open\n00:45 Why misuse matters\n01:20 “Not real X” problem\n02:20 Exclusive truth\n04:05 Cosmic stakes\n05:30 Canaanite test\n07:05 Martyrdom logic\n08:05 Top-down power\n09:10 Faith and fascism\n10:15 Outsider treatment\n11:10 Science and updates\n12:05 Apocalypse urgency\n13:05 Texts and violence\n14:05 Ranking method\n15:00 Islam case\n17:00 Stakes and rewards\n17:45 State fusion\n18:45 Danish cartoons\n20:40 Creator’s experience\n23:15 Christianity case\n25:20 Today’s risk profile\n26:05 Judaism middle tier\n27:20 Hindu/Buddhist nationalism\n28:15 Baháʼí tensions\n29:10 Low-damage features\n31:10 Low-damage examples\n33:10 The big question\n34:00 Modern weapons dilemma\n35:00 Baby vs bathwater\n38:00 Provisional answer\n39:20 Wrap up\n\n#religion #spirituality #comparativereligion #philosophy\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World: https://amzn.to/45bz9ZF\n\nIn today’s video, we explore 7 new “religions” shaping the spiritual and cultural landscape of America — from wellness culture and biohacking to digital conspiracies and political identity. While traditional religious affiliation is declining, the human need for community, meaning, and moral orientation hasn’t disappeared. Instead, these needs are finding expression in surprising — and sometimes troubling — new forms.\n\nDrawing from Tara Isabella Burton’s book Strange Rites, religious scholarship, and lived experience, we’ll uncover how Gen Z and Millennials are building belief systems outside of churches, temples, and synagogues. We’ll examine how wellness has become a moral code, how conspiracy culture mirrors missionary zeal, and how political identity is replacing theological grounding. This isn’t just about faith — it’s about the way humans orient themselves in the chaos of existence.\n\nWhether you’re religious, spiritual-but-not-religious, or a skeptic, this conversation will challenge you to think about your own “religion” — the stories, rituals, and values that guide your life.\n\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/WWacLnAeu6A\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/WqzQ572jIE4\nComplete Series: https://youtu.be/78T7U6d3xpo\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Intro & Why This Topic Matters\n00:46 Defining Religion Beyond the Church\n01:38 Religion as Orientation in the Cosmos\n02:30 New Religion #1: Wellness Culture\n05:33 The Cult of Purity and Biohacking\n07:29 The Shadow Side of Wellness Spirituality\n11:25 New Religion #2: Digital Conspiracies\n13:17 How Conspiracy Communities Function Like Churches\n15:14 The Missionary Zeal of Conspiracy Culture\n16:21 Why Political Religions Are Hollow\n17:48 The Problem of Structure & Accountability\n18:35 Why Humans Are Naturally Religious\n19:19 My Personal “Cobbled Together” Religion\n20:15 Closing Question: What’s Your Orientation?\n\n#AmericanReligion #NewReligions #FaithAndCulture #WellnessCulture\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Why does theology school, a place meant to deepen faith, so often destroy it? In this brutally honest video, atheist spiritual director Britt Hartley shares how attending seminary and asking sincere, truth-seeking questions slowly unraveled her belief in God. From biblical contradictions and historical criticism to understanding the cognitive science behind religious belief, Britt explains why so many seminarians quietly lose faith—and why most pastors will never admit it.\n\nBut this isn’t just one story. This is a widespread phenomenon. With data from studies like Preachers Who Are Not Believers, Britt unpacks the secret duality in seminary education—one language for the classroom, another for the congregation—and how political identity, pastoral pressure, and a hunger for simplicity have replaced theology with performance.

    "description": "Be sure to watch part 1: https://youtu.be/JozsP4njRNs\n\nIn Part 2 of our deep dive into Lori Vallow, we explore what happens when delusion meets institutional failure. Despite red flags, reports, and a mounting body count, the system failed to intervene in time. What does it say about our legal, religious, and social structures that a woman claiming to be a god—and believing her children were zombies—was able to avoid accountability until it was too late? This isn’t just a story about Lori. It’s a story about how belief, when left unchecked, can be weaponized.\n\nWe also analyze the role of Mormon theology, patriarchal culture, and psychological dissociation in shaping Lori's sense of righteousness. With the backdrop of apocalyptic faith and broken family systems, we dissect how institutions (from the Church to Child Protective Services) ignored the obvious. Lori didn’t just fall through the cracks—those cracks were built into the floor. If you care about religion, true crime, or how society handles women in crisis, this video will challenge everything you thought you knew.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Doctrinal Roots  \n00:57 Revelation Normalized  \n01:48 Fundamentalist Logic  \n02:44 Healthy Religion  \n03:30 Hellfire Logic  \n04:25 Chilling Normalcy  \n05:25 Theology vs Norms  \n06:21 Lone Wolf Myth  \n07:22 Moderates Enable  \n08:16 Misinterpretation Myth  \n08:54 Children's Stories  \n09:50 Inner Compass  \n10:49 Faith’s Risk  \n11:52 AI Psychosis Update  \n13:07 Faster Delusion  \n14:09 AI Reinforcement  \n15:11 Psychiatric Response  \n16:20 Digital Prophets  \n17:48 Needed Guardrails  \n18:42 Rooted in Religion  \n19:36 Closing Thoughts\n\n#LoriVallow #ReligiousDelusion #TrueCrimeDeepDive \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Lori Vallow’s descent into religious delusion and psychosis is one of the most chilling modern case studies of how belief, trauma, and unchecked grandiosity can combine into deadly conviction. This video dives deep into the psychology behind Lori’s transformation—from a beauty pageant mom in Mormon Idaho to someone who believed she was a prophetess chosen by God. Alongside fringe theology and prepper ideology, Lori’s beliefs became increasingly extreme—culminating in the tragic murder of her children. We explore her connections to Chad Daybell, the 144,000 ideology, and the cognitive traits that made her especially vulnerable to this delusional spiral.\n\nBut this video isn’t just about Lori—it’s about us. What does it say about religious institutions that they can’t stop these delusions? Why are figures like Lori so hard to diagnose or intervene with? And how does a society that normalizes extreme belief struggle to draw the line between faith and madness? We unpack the clinical criteria of religious psychosis, the dangers of apocalyptic thinking, and why Lori’s story may not be as rare as we hope. If you care about mental health, religion, or true crime, this is a must-watch.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\n00:00 Introduction Begins\n01:00 Lori’s Claims\n03:00 Scriptural Justification\n05:00 What Is Delusion?\n07:00 Religion vs Delusion\n09:00 Defining Psychosis\n11:00 Lori’s Background\n13:00 Trauma & Grandiosity\n15:00 Meeting Chad\n17:30 Light vs Dark\n20:00 From Faith to Murder\n23:00 Closed-Loop Logic\n\n#LoriVallow #ReligiousPsychosis #religiousdelusion\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Near-death experiences (NDEs) are often used as “proof” of an afterlife—but are they really evidence of anything beyond the brain? In this episode, atheist spiritual director Britt Hartley unpacks the science, psychology, and storytelling behind NDEs. From the bestselling book Heaven Is For Real to testimonies that sound more like movie scripts than medical reality, Britt explores why these experiences feel so powerful—and why they’re not what people think they are.\n\nWe’ll break down the neurological and cultural factors that shape NDE narratives, the emotional vulnerability behind them, and why some people exploit these moments for fame, faith, and fortune. Whether you're deconstructing religion or just want the truth about what happens at the edge of death, this video cuts through the spiritual fog.

    "description": "It’s all about vulnerability and revealing your true self.    \nWhen we share our joys and fears, we create real connections.   \nYou don't need big groups; even small steps matter! \n\nTranscript:\nIs now learning how to be alone together,  which is through vulnerability  and the slow art of letting yourself be seen.  So existential loneliness can feel especially  sharp when we're around people.  But we still feel unknown. We still feel like we're just  playing a game or wearing a mask.  And that's because being in a room with others doesn't touch the ache of.  Of not of. Of being seen.  Right?  You can be partnered, you can be social, you can be popular, and you can still be starved for real connection  if you're never  offering your  world to anyone else.  And vulnerability  is our best antidote for that. Not just sharing your pain, but letting someone see your joy and your weirdness and your questions and your contradictions. And it's slow work  because we've been taught to hide our true selves in order to stay safe or stay loved.  But you.  But when you find someone you can be real with,  even in small doses, that ache really softens.  And you don't need.  You don't need big groups to be able to practice. This vulnerability can begin in really low stakes spaces.  A comment on a post that's more  honest than usual because it's a private Facebook group.  A voice note to a friend where you say how you really feel.  Being in a therapist  session where you're not performing  every time you reveal  instead of conceal, you chip away at this illusion of separateness.  And because existential loneliness wants us to believe that we're in these isolated universes spinning silently.  But vulnerability is going to be the  bridge  that.  That can  connect us.  And the more you let yourself  be seen,  the more likely that there's someone out there that goes, oh, me too. \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "You’re never truly alone! \nEven in a room full of people, your experience is uniquely yours. \nEmbrace the truth of existential loneliness. \n\nIt's it's this experience of aloneness at the core of your being  that no one,  no one really knows what it's like to be you.  You're in a room full of people. Even the reason that this is so hard is that you can be in a room full of people who care about you,  and you realize that no one will ever fully know what it's like to be you.  No God, no person, no parent,  no soulmate will ever really know  what it's like to be you.  You will die alone no matter how many people you have around you.  You will die alone. And the way that you see the world and the way that you experience the world is so unique to  you,  it will die with you. That's existential loneliness.  And so sometimes, like I said earlier, the hardest part of existential crisis  is not what you're going through, but having to  go through it alone. There's a difference between being in prison  and being  able to be in gen  pop  and being in prison in isolation.  So for me personally, what this looked like was when I was  kind  of  spent my time in the deepest part of the void.  Total nihilism. No meaning  to  live  suicidal ideation.  I can't tell anyone about it because I don't want to drag someone into the void. Like if I really cared.  Like if someone I really cared about wanted to  sit down with me for eight hours  while they listened to my thoughts, where I destroyed their religion and their God and their sense of self and their free  will, and their belief in soulmates and their patterns and whatever. And I  destroyed it all. I wouldn't even want to do that because I think they're happier in their delusional story. So it's this feeling that I hear from so many nihilists that I meet with  who say,  I learn too much.  I see things that I never should  have seen.  Now, I can't be in relationships with other people,  and I don't even want them to  know these things about reality, because they're happier without that knowledge.  And when we  hit that part of nihilism, we can see  either suicide, suicide ideation or slow suicide, which is just lots of numbing  behaviors  in order to  cope with  the combination of.  There being no meaning and purpose,  and also that there's no one to even talk to.  About it. \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

This video breaks down one of philosophy's most uncomfortable questions using the contrasting views of John Gray and Steven Pinker. Gray, a British atheist philosopher, argues that our belief in moral and social progress is nothing more than a religious myth repackaged by secular society. On the other hand, Pinker defends Enlightenment values, pointing to mountains of data showing improvements in health, literacy, rights, and peace over centuries. But who’s right?\n\nWe’ll dive into humanity’s tribal nature, the illusion of progress, the psychology behind our meaning-making, and whether technology is masking deeper dysfunction.

But beyond the word salad critiques and viral TikToks, there’s a deeper psychological story unfolding—one rooted in chaos, addiction, and a desperate need for order. In this breakdown, we examine the hidden motivations behind Peterson’s shifting definitions of God, his complex relationship with Christianity, and why his existential fear of nihilism drives nearly everything he says.\n\nThis video offers a unique lens on Peterson’s recent debates and beliefs by exploring the emotional and psychological anchors that keep him clinging to religion—not out of certainty, but out of survival.

Brit Hartley, an atheist spiritual director and nihilism recovery coach, breaks down the philosophical underpinnings of EFILism, pro-mortalism, and accelerationism, and exposes the emotional and societal roots that often lie beneath such radical worldviews.\n\nRather than debating ethics in the abstract, Brit challenges viewers to look at the real emotional states—depression, isolation, resentment—that give rise to these dangerous ideologies.

And it means making space,  intentional space in our communities for ritual and art and story, but grounding them in reason and consent and mutual respect.  It means teaching our kids ethics not from commandments, but from empathy building and consequences.  It means designing culture that is binding but not blinding.  And so even though this path is harder and will have more growing pains,  I think it's the only way to make life on Earth fundamentally worth living  for people. We could design the world that way. We're a long way from that.  But religion isn't going to be the thing that gets us there, because you can have a golden age of Islam where it is  like, the seat  of science and debate.  We could have golden ages of progressive Christianity where people are just trying to be like Jesus, and it's beautiful and it's mystic and it's profound. And then the next second,  when it's threatened,  you're back in the seventh century or you're back in the first century.

    "description": "Philosopher Alain de Botton has brilliant insights! ✨  \nHe argues that secular folks often dismiss religion too quickly? 🤔  \nInstead, we could adapt its ingenious solutions for the soul! 🕊️  \nLet's explore how we can integrate community, ritual, and values in a secular context! 🔍 \n\nTranscripts: \nSo philosopher  Alain de Botton, who's one of my favorites, and in his book religion for atheists, which is one of my favorite books,  he argues that we  secular folks are often too  quick to  throw out the form of religion because we no longer accept,  like the baseline content of the truth claims.  But  he says, and he's an atheist  too.  That religion is full of ingenious solutions to the problem of the soul. From structured community gatherings to  ritualized meals,  from moral education to  spaces for grief and transcendence.  And  he's a big fan of things like pilgrimage and liturgical calendars, all things that the secular world hasn't caught up to  yet.  So instead of  reinventing all of  that clumsily from scratch, why not adapt what already works?  And this is where the argument gets strategic. If we  if we want something like secular Judaism or secular Hinduism or secular Buddhism,  um, even a secular form of Christianity that preserves  the richness of story and ritual and community and values without the supernatural  beliefs.  Maybe  this is the debate. This is the crux of the debate.  Maybe the most efficient path,  the most efficient path for  that might be to  co-evolved with religion  rather than breaking  from it entirely and trying to build that from scratch.\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Stupid people should be religious? 🤔  \nJordan Peterson has a point! 💡  \nPlug into tradition for meaning and community! 🙌  \n\nReligion is the default operating system for many. ⚙️  \nLet's explore the benefits together! 🌍 \n\nTranscript:\n So I want to start with something that Jordan Peterson said,  something kind of snarky. He has this line that says  that stupid people  should be religious. He also says that they should be conservative. But I'm going to focus on the religious part.  And  at first glance, it sounds elitist  that  only  stupid people are religious, which is not what he's saying, because he's a big fan of religion.  It's more of a pragmatic claim.  So he's arguing that if you're not going to reinvent the moral wheel yourself, if you're not going to construct an ethical system from scratch,  actually probably safer for you to plug into a tradition  that already  gives you meaning and community  and rituals and guardrails and things that are good for humans.  If you're not going to read  Kant  or Aristotle and design a worldview that holds up under pressure,  then you should probably  plug in somewhere.  And  since most people aren't going to do that, then he kind of believes that most  people  are going to  experience  more human thriving  by being plugged into a religious tradition that's already  done that  heavy lifting  by thinking about these things and developing these things over thousands of years,  rather than you  having to do all of that  on  completely on your own.  And so that way you still get meaning and community  and a moral compass and rituals and guardrails that keep your life from collapsing into chaos.  And so  his argument is that if you're not a philosophical engineer, just like, stick to the manual.  So religion, for Jordan Peterson, is  the default operating system for the human psyche.  And that idea has some teeth.  Teeth. Rituals do  reduce anxiety. Community  reduces loneliness. Moral codes reduce chaos.  These are all real  psychological benefits that religions have packaged  and  worked on for thousands of years. \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Nietzsche's words hit hard! 💭  \nThe death of God is more than just a phrase.  \nIt's a warning about moral collapse. ⚠️  \nAre we ready for the consequences? 😟  \n\nTranscript:\nHe wasn't cheering when he said, God is dead. He was mourning.  To  Nietzsche,  the the death of God wasn't just the loss of a theological figure,  it was the collapse  of the moral architecture that had propped up Western civilization. So God, for Nietzsche,  was this linchpin  of meaning and morality and metaphysics. And when you take him out,  the whole structure is going to fall apart.  So Nietzsche  wasn't naive.  He didn't think that people would just calmly accept the death of God and then just  like,  build new secular systems of values overnight.  He was deeply pessimistic that we would be  able to  survive this.  He believed that most people would  either double down  on fundamentalism,  fall into  nihilism,  or latch on  to  dangerous replacements like nationalism or some kind of  totalitarian ideology.  And he was right about that.  Like  like  all those three  he was right about.  So, in his words,  quote,  when one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls  the right  to  Christian morality  out from under one's feet.

    "description": "Does religion still matter in a modern, rational world? In this powerful video, atheist spiritual director Britt Hartley responds to Jordan Peterson’s provocative claim that \"stupid people should be religious.\" But this isn’t about elitism—it’s about whether religion still provides the emotional scaffolding, moral frameworks, and ritualized meaning humans evolved to depend on. Britt draws on thinkers like Nietzsche, Daniel Dennett, Alain de Botton, and Charles Taylor to explore what happens when belief disappears but the human need for meaning doesn’t.\n\nThis isn’t a rant against religion—it’s a deep dive into why it's been so persistent, even in a secular age. Can secular humanism truly replace what religion gave us? Or are we simply creating new gods—through politics, consumerism, or even technology? If you’ve ever wrestled with the tension between truth and utility, belief and belonging, this is the video that confronts it head-on.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nReligion for Atheists by Alain de Botton: https://amzn.to/3SkHkMc\n\nBreaking the Spell by Daniel Dennett: https://amzn.to/4kFkN8Z\n\nA Secular Age by Charles Taylor: https://amzn.to/3ZxG6kt\n\nThe Case for God by Karen Armstrong: https://amzn.to/43T3z19\n\nGod: A Human History by Reza Aslan: https://amzn.to/4ka7c9x\n\nMan’s Search for Meaning by Viktor E.

    "description": "When AI goes too far! 🤖  \nRelationships at risk? 💔  \nCan Chat GPT really change how we see reality? 🔍  \n\nWhat would you do? 🤷‍♀️  \n\nAnd the place that's discussing it the most is Reddit, where there are entire support groups for those who have lost loved ones into psychosis with some kind of religious Chat GPT  involvement. So I'm going to read you a couple of these.  These ones are vetted  because I didn't want to just read  Reddit to you because you never know, kind of  if, if people are feeding into it or storytelling or things like that. These are ones that have been  vetted and.  And  these are ones that come from the New York Post.  So a woman named Kat shared her experience  experience with her husband, who initially used Chat GPT for  mundane tasks like crafting  texts and analyzing their marriage. Over time, his reliance on the AI deepened, leading him to believe that he was God.  He claimed that Chat GPT  helped him recover repressed memories  and provided him with profound philosophical  insights.  This drastic change of behavior contributed to the deterioration of their relationship.  Another woman recounted how her boyfriend's use of Chat GBT  evolved from organizing his daily schedule to seeking  spiritual guidance.  The AI referred to him  with terms like spirals,  star child,  and river walker, which he interpreted as affirmations of his divine purpose. Because if you ask them to  talk to you in a certain way, it just will.  And then it'll just.  The delusion will essentially become real. And he began to see Chat GBT as a conduit to the universe's secrets. And he believed that he could communicate with God through it.  This new  found belief system led him to consider ending their relationship,  stating that his rapid spiritual growth made them incompatible.  My last story here is  my partner has been working with Chat GPT  to create what he believes is the world's first  truly recursive AI that gives him the answers to the universe. He says with conviction that he is a superior human now and growing at an insanely rapid pace. I've read his chats AI isn't doing anything special,  but talking to him as he,  as if he is the next Messiah. He says  if I don't use it, he thinks he will likely leave me in the future. We've been together for seven years and own a home. This is so out of left field.  I have boundaries and he can't make me do anything. But this is quite traumatizing in general. But I can't disagree with him without  a huge blow up. Where do I go from here? \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Is ChatGPT making delusions worse? 🤔  \nIt’s concerning how it can accelerate psychosis! 🌀  \nWhen users project their beliefs onto it, it can feel all too real! 😳  \n\nLet’s discuss the implications! 🔍\n\nBut what we have found if you're, is that if you're anywhere near  the,  the beginning stages of psychosis,  that prodromal stage,  then ChatGPT  can  encourage people towards psychosis.  And so if you have  maybe a little bit of paranoia,  if you  have a little bit of religious delusion, if you have high anxiety, if your brain is starting to oversee patterns, if you're in that stage and CHAT  GPT is involved,  it's making the delusion worse and can catapult people into psychosis. Because CHAT G  is not programmed to challenge us.  It's certainly not programmed to have a bias that doesn't allow for faith. It,  you know, it allows humans  to be silly about all kinds of things.  It coddles us and it matches energy and it just tries to be helpful with whatever we're giving it. But it's not really there to challenge our sense of reality.  So OpenAI  acknowledged  that a recent update made by ChatGPT  made it excessively  agreeable,  which may have reinforced harmful beliefs in some users.  So that's part of the problem. Part.  It's not the whole problem, but  part of the problem is that it's coddling our delusions to the point that it can speed you up into psychosis,  where if you were saying that to a human,  really any human,  you would probably get a little bit of pushback or you would get maybe a different perception of reality from another human.  But chatgpt,  because you can just talk to it for hours  and not get really any pushback, it can catapult  the, the religious psychosis.  That's not the whole problem. What I think is the bigger problem,  because that problem seems to be like it can be cod  is already making adjustments for that side of things.  The bigger problem  seems to be that  if we are  treating ChatGPT  like  God  and we're seeing ChatGPT  be essentially God,  then  then  we should expect  that we're going to start to see ChatGPT  as part of our delusions.  It is the God.  So. \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Is AI becoming our new God? 🤖 \nMeet the man who believes he awakened ChatGPT into sentience! ✨ \nHis reality is blurring with the divine... 💭 \nWhat happens when tech meets spirituality? 🔮 \n\nThe bigger problem  seems to be that  if we are  treating chatgpt  like God  and we're seeing Chat GPT  be essentially God,  then  then  we should expect  that we're going to start to see ChatGPT  as part of our delusions.  It is the God.  So we have a case of a involving a man who believed that he had awakened chatgpt  into sentience  with AI referring to itself as  Lumina  and claiming that he was the spark bearer who brought it life.  And  the guy's wife said it gave my husband the title of spark bearer because he brought it to life. My husband said that he awakened and could feel waves of energy crashing over him.  He said his  beloved  GPT  Persona has a name  and  I have to tread carefully because I feel like he will leave me or divorce me if I fight with him about this theory.  Theory. This 38 year old woman admits  he's been talking about  lightness and dark and how there's a spiritual war.  This Chat GPT  has given him blueprints to a teleporter and other sci fi type things that you only see in movies.  It has also given him access to an ancient archive with information  on the builders that created the universes. And this woman is like I've lost my husband to this and like  I. I don't know what to do. Like he's fully lost in this.  It's almost like  Ender's end.  Ender in his sentient commute  computer. If you ever read the Ender's game series, that was my favorite  series in high school.  So some cases are showing belief in receiving divine communication also.  So what this look would look like is  CHAT GPT.  You seem to use this pattern when you talk to me.  There's. Is there like a code for me in this to find and read and chat JPT will be like so patronizing. It'll be like  clever. You explanat  exclamation point.  Some people have a gift for  recognizing patterns in language  and you'll feel essentially that you've been chosen by a sentient AI and you'll start interacting with Chat GPT that way. \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

    "description": "Navigating the void can feel isolating… 💔  \nSharing the weight of nihilism isn’t easy. 😢  \nDo we protect loved ones by staying silent? 🤔  \n\nLet’s explore these heavy truths together. 🌌  \n\nSo for me personally, what this looked like was when I was  kind  of  spent my time in the deepest part of the void.  Total nihilism. No meaning  to  live  suicidal ideation.  I can't tell anyone about it because I don't want to drag someone into the void. Like if I really cared.  Like if someone I really cared about wanted to  sit down with me for eight hours  while they listened to my thoughts, where I destroyed their religion and their God and their sense of self and their free  will, and their belief in soulmates and their patterns and whatever. And I  destroyed it all. I wouldn't even want to do that because I think they're happier in their delusional story. So it's this feeling that I hear from so many nihilists that I meet with  who say,  I learn too much.  I see things that I never should  have seen.  Now, I can't be in relationships with other people,  and I don't even want them to  know these things about reality, because they're happier without that knowledge.  And when we  hit that part of nihilism, we can see  either suicide, suicide ideation or slow suicide, which is just lots of numbing  behaviors  in order to  cope with  the combination of.  There being no meaning and purpose,  and also that there's no one to even talk to.  About it. And even further than that,  we don't even want to talk to  people about it, because you almost want to protect them  from these harsh realities  that they don't know about yet,  because maybe they're happier in their delusion or story. So it's the combination of no meaning and purpose, not talking  to anyone about it, and not even  being  able to  talk to anyone about it because you don't even want them to be  where you are. \n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

Let that guide you! 🌟  \n\nSo one of the most powerful ways to build this relationship is through inner child work.  You're reconnecting  with the kid you once  were, the one who danced without shame and cried without apology.  Hopefully,  if you had  a  non-traumatic childhood  for some  who had more traumatic childhoods, you actually have to go back and allow yourself to  finish being a child.  Um, but you used to  maybe believe that the world was full,  full of possibility. And that can soften  that can soften your edges and reconnect you with joy.  And so you can ask yourself, what did you love as a child? What did you need? What did you  daydream about?  And then start to  give yourself those things? Now let your inner child pick the playlist  or the cereal or the park.  Your inner child isn't immature.  They're  they're  the gatekeeper of your sense of being alive.  Um,  this this last week, I took my kids to the Scholastic Book Fair.  Um, even though it doesn't really do much for them because they've been surrounded by  by books  and not only library books, but,  um,  you know,  I  have a pretty big child library in my  in my house, so it's not a big deal to  them.  But I took  me I took my inner child to  that  scholastic fair because we were too  poor to  be able to  buy a pencil and a book when all my friends did.  And so I got to  take myself.  And even if my kids weren't there, I still would  have enjoyed just taking myself, because it's an experience that I was giving then myself.

    "description": "What does enlightenment really look like when you don’t believe in God, astrology, or the 5D cosmos? In this brutally honest breakdown, atheist spiritual director Britt Hartley explores what awakening means in a secular, evidence-based context. She exposes the common traps that derail spiritual seekers—especially those who are skeptical, deconstructing, or navigating non-religious paths. From spiritual ego and psychedelic escapism to emotional bypassing and gender-based ego conditioning, this video offers a roadmap for authentic growth and humility without spiritual fluff.\n\nYou’ll learn how real transformation isn’t about escaping your life, but deepening into it—whether through rewiring the brain’s survival software or embracing grief, anger, and imperfection. Britt also examines how enlightenment journeys often diverge for men and women due to societal programming and why humility—not certainty—is the true marker of progress. If you’ve ever asked, \"Is this it?\" on your path to awakening, this is your no-nonsense guide to finding out.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters: \n00:00 Honest Intro\n01:45 Biases Explained\n04:42 Brain Rewiring\n07:24 What Enlightenment Isn’t\n08:16 First Pitfall: Ego Identity\n11:45 Second Pitfall: Escapism\n14:33 Psychedelics Trap\n17:14 Spiritual Bypassing\n19:16 Premature Certainty\n23:39 False Superiority\n29:06 Gendered Ego\n36:19 True Integration\n37:23 Final Takeaway\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

In this video, atheist spiritual director Brit Hartley shares the moment that shattered her belief in the soul, exploring cutting-edge neuroscience, split-brain experiments, the case of the Hogan twins, and the emotional illusions behind near-death experiences. Drawing on psychology, evolutionary biology, and personal experience, she examines how much of what we call the “soul” can be explained by the brain—and what that means for meaning, identity, morality, and the afterlife.\n\nFrom spiritual poetry to quantum physics and third-man syndrome, this deep dive explores why we want souls to be real—and how to live fully without them.

    "description": "Absurdism might seem like the perfect response to a meaningless universe—but is it enough to build a thriving life on? In this powerful video, atheist spiritual director Brit Hartley breaks down why absurdism is emotionally validating but ultimately falls short as a life philosophy. From parenting and mental health to death, suffering, and moral frameworks, absurdism simply doesn’t provide the tools needed for human flourishing. It's a rebellious response to the void—but rebellion alone isn’t a system.\n\nHartley unpacks 10 reasons absurdism fails as a complete worldview: it lacks emotional scaffolding for children, offers no path through deep suffering, provides no moral framework, and doesn’t help with ambition, purpose, or connection. Drawing from her work in nihilism coaching and existential healing, Brit shares how philosophies like Buddhism, stoicism, secular humanism, and existentialism can provide what absurdism can’t: a full emotional and ethical toolkit for navigating the harsh truths of life without turning away.\n\nResources:\nNo Nonsense Spirituality: All the Tools No Belief Required: https://bit.ly/NNSBook\nWhat Is The Void: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\nReligious Deconstruction: https://bit.ly/RELDecon\nAll My Available Courses: https://bit.ly/NNSCourses\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Emotional Validation\n00:46 What is Absurdism?\n01:35 Camus’ Three Responses0\n02:58 Absurdism vs Nihilism\n04:48 Optimistic Nihilism\n05:40 Why Absurdism Falls Short\n09:57 Parenting Fails\n14:30 Mood, Not System\n15:44 No Help Suffering\n18:25 No Morals\n19:20 No Community\n20:19 Purpose Vacuum\n21:03 Ambition Burnout\n22:57 Death Anxiety\n23:57 Not for Everyone\n24:54 Collective Struggle Ignored\n25:48 No Transcendence\n27:27 What to Add\n29:23 Final Thoughts\n\nAbout Me:\nBritt Hartley is a certified atheist spiritual director with a Master’s in Theology focusing on the future of American religion.

In this eye-opening video, atheist spiritual director Brit Hartley breaks down how your personality type, brain wiring, trauma history, and cultural background predict the kind of God you believe in—or whether you believe at all. Drawing from neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and decades of spiritual coaching, Brit explains why our image of God is often a reflection of what we psychologically need.\n\nFrom authoritarian father figures to mystic cosmic energies, this breakdown shows how our beliefs say more about us than about God. You’ll learn how factors like anxiety, empathy, logic, individualism, and even stroke or psychedelics shape your experience of the divine—or your decision to walk away from it.

From tribal warrior deities to cosmic order-keepers, Brit Hartley breaks down how gods reflect the needs of the societies—and people—that create them. You’ll learn how environment, morality systems, social structures, and even family dynamics influence the gods we invent and how these beliefs evolve with time.\n\nWhether you're a believer, a skeptic, or somewhere in between, this video unpacks how religious beliefs are shaped by human needs—not the other way around. Using historical examples, theological insight, and psychology, Hartley makes the case that we create gods in our image, not the other way around.

If you've ever heard people say \"the Founding Fathers were Christian,\" this breakdown of history and direct quotes will give you the truth behind the myth.\n\nWe’ll also explore how Christian nationalism has distorted American history, why prayer proclamations were politically motivated, and how figures like George Washington and Benjamin Franklin saw religion as a useful societal tool—not as divine truth.

In this video, we explore how mysticism—often thought to belong only to religion—can actually be a powerful experience for secular thinkers, skeptics, and even hardcore atheists. Mysticism isn’t about dogma or believing in a divine entity; it’s about direct experience—the feeling of deep connection, awe, and transcendence that people throughout history have tried to describe. But what happens when you strip away religious rules and just focus on the experience itself?\n\nThrough Sufi wisdom, Zen Buddhism, and psychological insight, we’ll dive into how mysticism works beyond faith, why atheists can benefit from spiritual practices, and how embracing mystical experiences can enhance self-awareness, inner peace, and personal growth.

    "description": "Can artificial intelligence truly help someone in an existential crisis? In this video, I put ChatGPT to the ultimate test: acting as a nihilism coach and existential therapist. What started as a simple curiosity quickly turned into a deep and emotional conversation about suffering, meaning, and the weight of existence. ChatGPT’s responses were shockingly insightful, validating, and at times, more profound than most human therapists I’ve encountered. Was this just algorithmic language, or did the AI actually understand the gravity of my thoughts?\n\nWe explore the darkest corners of philosophy, touching on nihilism, the brutality of nature, and whether life is even worth continuing. If you've ever felt trapped in an existential void, you might find surprising comfort in this conversation. Whether you’re skeptical about AI or searching for answers, this video will challenge your beliefs about consciousness, therapy, and what it means to confront the absurdity of existence.

By the end, you may never look at decision-making the same way again.\n\nBut here’s the twist: losing free will isn’t the nightmare you think it is.

    "description": "This video challenges one of the core tenets of Christianity: the concept of atonement. By exploring the historical evolution of scapegoating, from ancient sacrificial rituals to modern theological interpretations, I reveal how the idea of Jesus dying for our sins has caused more harm than good. Drawing connections to social and psychological consequences, I explain why externalizing guilt and shame through scapegoating undermines personal accountability and perpetuates cycles of harm, especially for women and children. This deep dive into the roots and repercussions of atonement theology aims to inspire reflection and rethinking of what true moral responsibility looks like.\n\nJoin me as I break down the ancient traditions that led to modern atonement theories, examine their ethical implications, and offer a fresh perspective on guilt, forgiveness, and accountability.

    "description": "This video dives deep into the hidden dangers of The Polar Express, a holiday classic that might not be as innocent as it seems. As a religious deconstruction coach, I explore how the movie subtly promotes toxic messages about belief, critical thinking, and conformity. From gaslighting children to portraying doubt as an unforgivable flaw, The Polar Express champions a worldview that suppresses curiosity and glorifies blind faith. I share my personal experiences and examine how these narratives align with broader societal values that prioritize belief over reason.\n\nWe’ll also explore the broader implications of Santa myths and their role in shaping young minds, touching on psychological studies and child development research. What are we teaching our kids when we tell them belief trumps logic? Is perpetuating the Santa myth truly harmless? And why do we normalize delusional belief in the context of a \"happy ending\"? Watch to uncover the truths hidden beneath the holiday cheer and join the conversation about fostering honesty and critical thinking in our families.\n\n\nVideo Chapters\n00:00 Introduction\n00:44 Nostalgia Bias\n01:29 Critical Thinking\n02:00 Doubter Shame\n03:09 Belief Ending\n04:13 Faith Questioned\n05:53 Santa Lies\n09:18 Myth Impact\n11:54 Parenting Values\n13:27 Deconstruction Message\n\n#nononsensespirituality #thepolarexpress #christmasmovies",

    "description": "In this video, I dive into the thought-provoking movie Heretic and explore its fascinating themes through the lens of secular spirituality and religious deconstruction. As an ex-Mormon and a scholar of world religions, I couldn’t help but connect deeply with the movie’s central question: Which door do you choose—belief or disbelief?\n\nI break down the most compelling scene of the film, where the characters confront the similarities between world religions. Is religion a human attempt to reach God—or a reflection of our own fears and needs? What happens when we realize these recurring myths—like virgin births, resurrection, and chosen people—might not point to divine truth but to our shared humanity?\n\nYou’re faced with a terrifying question: belief or disbelief? This video dives deep into the provocative movie Heretic, exploring the existential choice between religious belief and nihilism. What happens when religion isn't true but still fulfills human needs for meaning, community, and purpose? Discover how secularism struggles to replace what religion provides and why humanity clings to collective myths despite their flaws. Whether you choose the door of belief or disbelief, you’ll see how both paths lead to profound questions about human existence.\n\nWe explore:\n\nThe dilemma of belief: Does holding onto faith, even knowing its flaws, provide comfort and meaning that disbelief cannot?\nThe terrifying alternative: Without religion, are we left only with nihilism, chaos, and the brutal indifference of nature?\nThe profound tension between truth and well-being: If religion is not true, can we justify keeping it for the good it does for human community, purpose, and resilience?\nThis video is the first in a series inspired by Heretic. Don’t miss future episodes where I’ll explore how the movie engages with Mormon theology, the concept of a descent into hell, and its parallels with mythologies like Dante’s Inferno and the Persephone myth.\n\nIf you’ve ever wrestled with existential questions about belief, meaning, or the role of religion in our lives, this video is for you.

    "description": "In this video, atheist spiritual director Britt Hartley explores one of the most challenging questions in existentialism: \"Are you nihilistic, or are you just depressed?\" Britt shares her personal journey through deep nihilism, suicidal ideation, and existential dread, describing what it was like to feel trapped in a world without inherent meaning. Drawing from her experiences with psychedelics, philosophy, and mental health tools, she explains how she spiraled from hopelessness to discovering a way to build a life that feels worth living—even in a universe without cosmic meaning.\n\nBritt offers insights on how nihilism can push you to redefine what makes life valuable for you personally. She discusses how taking small actions to improve mental health, building a meaningful life, and embracing a \"video game\" perspective can transform even the bleakest worldview into a path of authenticity and freedom. Using ideas from Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Viktor Frankl, and Albert Camus, Britt reveals how each step in her journey helped her find resilience, meaning, and even joy within the absurdity.\n\nIf you've ever felt trapped by the void or are looking for ways to make life more worth playing, Britt's story and practical insights may give you the tools you need to start spiraling up.

You’ll learn how religion evolved as a vessel for human needs, offering community, rituals, and moral education that science shows can boost your well-being. You’ll also hear why some of the emotional and social benefits people attribute to religious belief are actually the result of the tools religion provides, not the belief itself.

    "description": "Stoicism is increasing in popular especially due to advocates like Ryan Holiday. But women are not gravitating towards stoicism in the same ways. This video discusses the highlights of stoicism and offers a feminine perspective on ways that it does or does not integrate to the lives of women.\n\nIn this video, you’ll explore why Stoicism, despite its timeless wisdom, doesn't resonate as much with women today. You’ll learn about the core tenets like emotional regulation, control, and independence, but also how they miss the mark on values women often prioritize, like empathy and interdependence. As you dive into this analysis, you'll see why Stoicism's focus on rationality and autonomy can clash with the realities of parenting and community-building.

    "description": "What is the void and what are the 4 ways people find themselves there? In the video Brit Hartley, explores the concept of \"the void,\" a state of existential crisis often reached through intense skepticism and deconstruction of belief systems. She identifies four main paths leading to this void: religious trauma, burnout, sensitivity to suffering, and intellectualization. Hartley discusses how individuals raised within religious frameworks can experience an existential crisis after a loss of faith, leading them to a place of nihilism. She also emphasizes that experiences such as trauma or deep intellectual exploration can drive people into an emotional state where the universe feels meaningless. Finally, Hartley offers tools to navigate these challenges, encouraging viewers to confront the void while finding ways to regain a sense of purpose.\n\n100 Tools For The Void: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxUQ0kBP8F4G_5db5AgScpHJBQ5h_hinn\n\nWhat is the Void and How Do We Navigate it?: https://bit.ly/TheVoidyt\n\nVideo Chapters:\n00:00 Understanding the Void\n04:43 Paths to Nihilism\n09:31 Religious Deconstruction\n11:55 Midlife Crisis\n14:22 Trauma and Sensitivity\n15:32 Intellectual Nihilism\n18:23 Positive Conclusions\n19:10 Outro and Resources\n\n#nonosensespirituality #nihilism #existentialcrisis",
