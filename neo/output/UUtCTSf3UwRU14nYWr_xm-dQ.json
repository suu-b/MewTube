    "description": "This was September 2025's patron video that we decided to make public. Thank you to my supporters.\nI explore the question of free will, drawing on the insights of St. Maximus the Confessor. While thinkers like Sam Harris argue that free will is an illusion and always contingent on material circumstances, I show how the Christian understanding reframes freedom—not as arbitrary choice, but as submission to the good. True freedom is not transgression, but moving toward higher and higher goods, where life becomes more natural and effortless.\n\nThe Symbolic World Enters Paradise\nJoin me and Deacon Seraphim Rohlin this November in our course on Dante's Paradiso.\n-Course length: 5 weeks, 15 hours\n-Dates of live classes: Wednesdays, November 5th to December 3rd, 2025\n-Time: 2-5 pm Eastern Time\n-Cost: 190 USD (Involved patrons can get 10% off)\n-Register today: https://www.thesymbolicworld.com/courses/dantes-paradiso\n\n💻 Website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n🔗 Linktree: https://linktr.ee/jonathanpageau \n🔒 BECOME A PATRON: https://thesymbolicworld.com/subscribe \n\nOur website designers: https://www.resonancehq.io/ \nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson: https://matthewwilkinson.net/",

We explore why marriage is a crucial civilizational cornerstone rooted in divine order, not only from a Christian perspective, but universally in all flourishing societies. We discuss how it compares to and co-exists with monasticism and the meaning of marriage and the wedding ceremony not just as a gate to self-fulfillment and a joyful experience, but also as self-sacrifice. We also discuss how rediscovering the beauty of marriage can help restore sanity in our fragmented secular world.\n\nThis conversation is also a preview of the upcoming Marriage Conference in Riverside, CA (Oct. 10–11), where I’ll be speaking alongside Father Josiah, Archbishop Cordileone, Dr. Brad Wilcox, and others.

If you’ve ever wondered how texts like Jubilees, Enoch, or the Lives of Adam and Eve connect to Christian theology, this conversation is for you.\n\nNEW COURSE: Jubilees and the Nephilim, by Fr. Stephen De Young\n- Catch the early bird special of 15% off with code: EARLYJUBILEES, valid until 11:59 pm EST (midnight) of August 8th.\n- Price: 180 USD (Discounted to 158 USD)\n- Register now: https://www.thesymbolicworld.com/courses/jubilees-and-the-nephilim \n- Course Length: 6 Weeks, 12 Hours\n- Dates: Live classes are on Tuesday at 7 - 9 pm Central Time, starting August 19th through September 23rd, 2025\n- Participants will be given access to lesson recordings.\n- The course is hosted on the Symbolic World Circle Community platform. Sign up as a free member before making your purchase. \n\nStep into the strange and revelatory world of the Book of Jubilees, an ancient retelling of Genesis that shaped ancient Jewish thought and still echoes through Christian tradition. In this course, Fr. Stephen De Young guides students through the book’s expansion of biblical history, unveiling the significance of the fall of the angels, the rise of the Nephilim, and the heavenly origins of the feasts of the Old and New Testaments. Along the way, he'll explore how Jubilees reinterprets creation, demonology, and the prophetic structure of time, and why these themes mattered not only to Second Temple Judaism, but to later Christian understandings of the unseen world.\n\nVisit https://www.rapunzelbook.com to pre-order our new fairy tale story, Rapunzel and the Evil Witch.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 - Coming up\n00:55 - Intro music\n01:20 - Introduction\n02:11 - Jubilees\n05:08 - A different way of doing theology\n15:23 - Why do we have peripheral stories?\n22:34 - The twelfth apostle\n24:16 - Blood libel\n27:09 - Adam's skull\n31:19 - Sacred geography\n34:09 - The sacramental reality\n39:01 - The modern trade\n41:52 - UFOs, psychedelics, and materialism\n44:43 - Reading extra-biblical texts and Jubilees\n47:53 - What can extra-biblical traditions offer us?\n\n💻 Website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n🔗 Linktree: https://linktr.ee/jonathanpageau \n🔒 BECOME A PATRON: https://thesymbolicworld.com/subscribe \n\nOur website designers: https://www.resonancehq.io/ \nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson: https://matthewwilkinson.net/",

    "description": "In this episode of Universal History, I sit down with Deacon Seraphim (Richard Rohlin) on the 4th of July to explore the topic of fairies and titular spirits, especially as it relates to the US. We discuss America’s founding, the myth of Oedipus, heroes and monsters, boundaries of identity, stories of water spirits and crossing into territories, all to ask the question of whether fairies can be saved.

    "description": "I was invited to give this talk on Robin Hood in Nottingham—just a stone’s throw from Sherwood Forest—on the feast of Pentecost. What began as a reflection on a beloved folk hero opened into something deeper: a meditation on rebellion, trickery, legitimacy, and the strange holiness that's possible for jesters and outlaws. In this talk, I explore how Robin Hood, the Green Man, King David, and even figures from Islamic tradition and Arthurian legend, all point toward a surprising truth—that the margins of society can conceal servants of the true King.

    "description": "In this talk at the Orthodox Arts Festival of 2025, I share my vision for a renewal of Orthodox Christian art rooted in meaningful participation and true celebration. We are living through the collapse of modern aesthetics—art has become propaganda, entertainment, and distraction. But this cultural decomposition presents an opportunity for something truly transformative.\n\nOrthodox art offers a profound alternative: not art as consumption or rebellion, but as participation, celebration, and enlightenment. Drawing on my work in children's literature, icon carving, and popular storytelling, I explore how we can reintegrate beauty, memory, and the sacred into every level of artistic creation—from liturgy to fairy tales.\n\nIf you're an artist, a parent, or simply someone longing for a more meaningful creative world, I invite you to join me in rediscovering what art is really for—and how it can lead us back to God.\n\n🕯️ Discover our books, courses, and more at http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n📖 Get early access to Rapunzel and the Evil Witch: https://www.thesymbolicworld.com/rapunzel-and-the-evil-witch\n\nNEW COURSE: Scripture: The Key to Reality, presented by Seraphim Hamilton\nThis course is designed to help students appreciate the unique role the Bible plays in helping us step into the world as it truly is: a symbolic revelation of the Infinite God.

Amidst thousands of voices focused on policy and economics, we stepped aside to ask a deeper question: what does it mean to renew civilization through beauty?\n\nTogether, we explore how architecture, music, and the arts shape our perception of the world—and how the recovery of beauty might be essential for healing both culture and soul. There are no scripts here, just a shared sense of wonder, frustration, and conviction. We speak of cities and forests, temples and toasts, tradition and imagination… and what it truly means to see rightly again.\n\n💻 Website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n🔗 Linktree: https://linktr.ee/jonathanpageau \n🔒 BECOME A PATRON: https://thesymbolicworld.com/subscribe \n\nOur website designers: https://www.resonancehq.io/ \nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson: https://matthewwilkinson.net/\n\nkeywords:\nARC Conference, art, architecture, civilization, beauty, human experience, Christian culture, symbolism, design, architecture, music, art, beauty, creativity, orthodoxy, healing, abstraction, civic engagement, human experience",

    "description": "Several years ago, I coined the phrase “watch the fool,” because in a world turned upside down, the fool can strangely point to what’s coming and in some ways play a role in restoring order —for good or for ill. For April 2025’s patron video, I reflect on how Kanye West has continued to play this role. He is not a prophet in the traditional sense, but a kind of tuning fork, embodying the contradictions and transformations unfolding in our culture before they happen.

    "description": "This is a talk I did a few years ago for the Jung Society of Montreal. In it I explore the creation story in Genesis not just as myth, but as a fractal map of how identity, being, and purpose function. In breaking down the symbolism I also make a case for why intelligence isn’t an accident, why rituals matter, and why participation of intelligent beings is foundational to reality. In the Q&A section we touch on group identity, exclusion, dreams, and the meaning of the Last Judgment among other topics.

We explore how politics is shaping the trajectory of technological development—and how, in turn, emerging tech like AI begins to shape us. \n\nWe talk about the deeper philosophical and spiritual undercurrents of transhumanism: the ego behind the machines, the myth of the disembodied mind, and the subtle seductions that come with promises of power and control. From AI warfare to Elon Musk, from Project Stargate to the eerie direction our culture is headed, we raise some uncomfortable but necessary questions.

    "description": "The world is changing rapidly, and the transformation we’re witnessing—especially within the Church—has been astonishing. Across America, Orthodox churches are growing at an unprecedented rate, and cultural shifts that once seemed impossible are now unfolding before our eyes.  \n\nFor this week's video, we revisit my very first public event with Jordan Peterson, at The Resurrection of Logos event, which took place at the University of Toronto in March 2017. At the time, many of the ideas we now take for granted were just beginning to emerge. It was a moment when culture seemed to be collapsing under the weight of ideology, yet seeds of renewal were being planted.  \n\nLooking back, we can see both the opportunities and the dangers that have since taken shape. On one hand, faith is more openly discussed, and the roots of Christian civilization are being rediscovered. On the other, we face the risk of faith becoming overly weaponized. The balance between these forces is more crucial than ever.  \n\nThis talk, which didn’t gain much attention at the time, now serves as a fascinating snapshot of what was happening in that critical moment. Watch it with fresh eyes and see how far we’ve come.  \n\n=====================\nNEW COURSE: The Symbolic World Goes to Middle-Earth\nJoin us for an in-depth study of J.R.R.

    "description": "For the past few decades we have heard from the new atheists just how horrible religion is, that religion is responsible for all these terrible things like the inquisition and witch burnings - but what if I told you that there are patterns or structures behind this kind of behaviour that are simply human, and are not unique to religious people, nor to your ideological or political opponents, but exist fundamentally in all identities.\n\n==================\n\nThe Symbolic World Goes to Middle-earth!

Read more here: https://www.thesymbolicworld.com/courses/tolkien-and-universal-history \n\nIn his famous Letter #131 to Milton Waldman, J.R.R. Tolkien described his Legendarium as an attempt to create a vast cycle of stories. These stories would be dedicated to his home country and as such this concept has often been described by Tolkien scholars as a “Mythology for England.” This course will take this concept a step further by examining the Legendarium as an attempt at a work of Universal History, one which uses both ancient and modern storytelling genres to reconcile conflicting visions of English, European, and Western identity. We will then apply those methods to contemporary storytelling efforts, revealing how Tolkien opens the way to a return to cosmological and legendary Christian storytelling tradition.\n\n==================\n\n💻 Website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n🔗 Linktree: https://linktr.ee/jonathanpageau \n🗣 Join The Symbolic World Community for discussions about symbolism: https://thesymbolicworld.com/subscribe \n🔒 BECOME A PATRON: https://thesymbolicworld.com/subscribe \n\n📱 SOCIAL MEDIA  \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld \nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nOur website designers: https://www.resonancehq.io/ \nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson: https://matthewwilkinson.net/",

They explore the significance of this book in understanding Lewis's thought, its mythic elements, and the interplay between paganism and Christian themes. The discussion also touches on the evolution of Lewis's writing style, the role of myth and fairy tales, and the complex themes of mimetic desire and sacrifice present in the narrative.

    "description": "Fr. Stephen De Young is back on the channel to discuss his latest book, St. Paul the Pharisee. St. Paul is at the core of many modern misunderstandings about Christianity; Fr. Stephen presents how we can understand St. Paul’s writings within the context of who he was, when he lived, and who he was addressing in his epistles, ultimately bringing us closer to the vision Christ Himself gave us.\n\nBuy Fr. Stephen’s book on the Ancient Faith Store - Saint Paul the Pharisee: Jewish Apostle to All Nations: https://store.ancientfaith.com/saint-paul-the-pharisee-jewish-apostle-to-all-nations/ \nOn Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Saint-Paul-Pharisee-Apostle-Nations/dp/1955890706\n\n==========Book description==========\nThe centuries after the Protestant Reformation brought about a radical reinterpretation of the epistles of St. Paul, disconnected from any historical reality. But Paul operated, during his entire life, as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In Saint Paul the Pharisee: Jewish Apostle to All Nations, Fr. Stephen De Young surveys Paul’s life and writings, interpreting them within the Holy Tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by De Young’s interpretive translation of St. Paul’s epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in first-century Judaism, De Young hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.\n\n==========NEW SYMBOLIC WORLD COURSE==========\nJoin us for Annie Crawford's course on C.S.

    "description": "Paul Kingsnorth gave a provocative talk for First Things' Erasmus Lecture of 2024, titled \"Against Christian Civilization\". In this video, we discuss the essence of his argument, delving into the fundamental tensions between Christianity and civilization. How does faith interact with culture? What is the Biblical narrative around cities and governance? Are we misusing Christianity as a tool for cultural preservation over pursuing true spiritual transformation? Is Western Civilization as we know it even salvable at this point?\n\nPaul Kingsnorth’s First Things talk: \"Against Christian Civilization\" | 2024 Erasmus Lecture: https://www.youtube.com/live/Y3hMSZqatHI?si=bmT1rqPyEF-LvR0_ \nWritten article version of his talk: Against Christian Civilization, January 2025: https://www.firstthings.com/article/2025/01/against-christian-civilization \n\n==========NEW SYMBOLIC WORLD COURSE==========\nJoin us for Annie Crawford's course on C.S.

    "description": "For this interview I have a great discussion with organist, pianist, conductor, arranger, and recording artist Matthew Wilkinson, who also happened to put together the Symbolic World intro music. We delve into the symbolism of music, particularly focusing on Bach's organ works. The discussion also touches on the evolution of musical styles from the Baroque period to the Classical, modern and postmodern eras, the historical context of music, from the music of the spheres to modern dissonance, and how these concepts reflect broader ideas about hierarchy and opposites.\n\nSupport Matthew Wilkinson's wonderful work: \nCheck out his website and buy his CD: https://matthewwilkinson.net/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/24DSGAdbVt7by0JHEqTwMh?si=ZJlpdMkcSg6SfMvz7YbkFg\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/@matthewwilkinsonmusic?si=m1gbZgTSpOALVdq5\n\nJoin us for Annie Crawford's course on C.S.

    "description": "Rod Dreher and I had a great discussion about his latest book, Living in Wonder. We discussed re-enchantment, UFOs, AI, attention, the internet, and more. Enjoy!\n\nGet Rod's book - Living in Wonder: Finding Mystery and Meaning in a Secular Age: https://www.amazon.com/Living-Wonder-Finding-Mystery-Meaning/dp/0310369126\n\n===========Book description===========\nThe West has become \"disenchanted\"--closed to the idea that the universe contains the supernatural, the metaphysical, or the non-material. Christianity is in crisis. People today are leaving the Church because faith has become dry and lifeless. But people aren't leaving faith for atheism. They are still searching for the divine, and it might just be right under their noses.\nIn Living in Wonder, thought leader, cultural critic, and New York Times bestselling author Rod Dreher shows you how to encounter and embrace wonder in the world. In his trademark mixture of analysis, reporting, and personal story, Dreher brings together history, cultural anthropology, neuroscience, and the ancient Church to show you--no matter your religious affiliation--how to reconnect with the natural world and the Great Tradition of Christianity so you can relate to the world with more depth and connection.\nHe shares stories of miracles, rumors of angels, and outbreaks of awe to offer hope, as well as a guide for discerning and defending the truth in a confusing and spiritually dark culture, full of contemporary spiritual deceptions and tempting counterfeit spiritualities.\nThe world is not what we think it is. It is far more mysterious, exciting, connected, and adventurous. As you learn practical ways to regain a sense of wonder and awaken your sense of God's presence--through prayer, attention, and living by spiritual disciplines--your eyes will be opened, and you will find the very thing every one of us searches for: our ultimate meaning.\n\n===========Other books mentioned===========\n- Passport to Magonia: https://www.amazon.co.za/Passport-Magonia-Folklore-Flying-Saucers/dp/0987422480 \n- Free version: https://archive.org/details/passporttomagoni0000vall_m8g5\n- American Cosmic, by D.W.

It's related to the same message of the opening ceremony; I argue that gender ambiguity is being weaponized against the public to challenge societal boundaries, gaslight, win a supposed moral upper hand, and thereby perpetuate the culture war. It's important to be able to see these patterns in public discourse and not to get carried away in our opposing camps.\n\nSymbolism Explained: The Olympics Opening Ceremony is Worse than You Thought: https://youtu.be/rckBhO23cIA?si=5Yew13kVoDsyhgI4\n\nDon't miss my and Richard Rohlin's new upcoming course on Dante's Divine Comedy.

The duality of Pentecost explains several strange moments in Scripture and the apocryphal texts, most notably the laws of Noah, the covenant of Abraham, the scandal of Lot, and of course the Tower of Babel itself.\n\nPrevious episode on the Tower of Babel: https://youtu.be/wj9EK0QAW54?si=ClSLEQzKUaSFjeRl \n\nContent mentioned:\n- Apocrypha: An Introduction to Extra-Biblical Literature by Fr.

    "description": "This is my second interview with Timothy Patitsas on the topic of beauty. We also discuss filmmaking, the work of Dr. Iain Mcgilchrist, life as liturgical, and social renewal as part of the fruits of a beautiful life.\n\nTimothy G. Patitsas has been the Interim Dean of Hellenic College since January of 2020 and the Assistant Professor of Ethics at Holy Cross since the Fall of 2005. In 2019 he published The Ethics of Beauty, an attempt to recover one of the most ancient emphases of Orthodox spirituality, which is the firm priority given to combating the sensual rather than the intellectual passions. The book shows how this translates into a consoling and liberating Beauty-first approach to Orthodox ethics and life. The work also presents ethical, theological, and scriptural definitions of traumatic experience with a view to aiding recovery.\n\n- Direct and most affordable place to get Ethics of Beauty by Timothy Patitsas: https://www.stnicholaspress.net/ethics-of-beauty \n- Timothy’s film company, Beauty First Films: https://www.beautyfirstfilms.com\n- The documentary film that Jonathan saw: Amphilochios: Saint of Patmos: https://www.beautyfirstfilms.com/amphilochios\n\nSave the date!

The setting of our four terms parallels this arc by beginning in Greece and then moving to Savannah, Georgia. The curriculum unites the most profound and provocative works of literature, philosophy, and art, inspiring and challenging students to approach the human condition with fresh eyes. Yet to cover this ground in a single year of intense intellectual study requires careful steering and selection. For 2024–25, that focus will be provided by the theme of “Nature”: our multidisciplinary curriculum will trace the origins and development of this concept through philosophy, music, architecture, art, and literature.",

Blackwood is the founder and president of Ralston College, a liberal arts college awaiting accreditation in Savannah, Georgia. We met on the Daily Wire+ Exodus panel where he had a lot of amazing insights and we have become friends since. \n\nIn this discussion, we talk about Stephen’s wonderful book, The Consolation of Boethius as Poetic Liturgy, an exploration of The Consolation of Philosophy, a book by Boethius. We discuss Boethius’ role and contribution to the Medieval Western world and the amazing treasury of wisdom and consolation he can still offer us today.

JP also talks a bit more about his journey in the symbolic world, his unique approach to these topics, and what the course will offer. Join other Symbolic World metaphysics enthusiasts to experience a detailed introduction to the metaphysics developed in the Symbolic World over the past few years. \n\nEARLY BIRD COUPON for 10% off for anyone who signs up for the course in the next 24 hours. Use the code EARLY10 at checkout.\nLearn more: https://thesymbolicworld.com/news/symbolic-world-metaphysics-course-with-jp-marceau\n\n----------------------\nThis course will dive into content from Jean-Philippe Marceau's forthcoming book entitled Post-reductionist Christianity: A Way Out of the Meaning Crisis, which will be published by Symbolic World Press in Spring 2024. In the 5-week course, Marceau will provide a detailed introduction to the metaphysics developed in the Symbolic World over the last few years, particularly in discussions with John Vervaeke and Jonathan Pageau. Like in the book, Marceau will explain that nihilistic materialism, symbolized by the zombie, has died at its own hands, and that non-reductive naturalism is currently tracking toward a return to classical metaphysics. Then, he will explain how Christian metaphysics goes further than classical metaphysics and non-reductive naturalism, ultimately shedding more light on reality. Finally, Marceau will present advanced material not covered in the book, such as what distinguishes symbolic metaphysics from perennialist, universalist, or idealist metaphysics.\n\nCOURSE: Symbolic World Metaphysics, with JP Marceau.

    "description": "Dr. Martin Shaw will be a speaker at the Symbolic World Summit next year in Tarpon Springs, Florida. In this conversation we discuss pagan stories, including The Odyssey and The Iliad, our current moment in the West, the return of paganism and a desire for Kleos (imperishable glory) in modern life. We also talk about how much paganism differs from Christianity, wrestling with Scripture as a mythographer, and Martin’s journey to Orthodox Christianity. \n\nDr Martin Shaw is a writer, storyteller, and mythologist.

Stephen De Young is writing an article for our upcoming publication, the Symbolic World Magazine, and he will also join us as a speaker for the Symbolic World Summit in February 2024. He is an amazing writer and speaker and has really helped me reach new heights in my understanding of Scripture.\n\nIn this discussion we specifically discuss certain sexual and revolutionary symbolism in the Bible, starting with when Ham “uncovered” his father, Noah’s, “nakedness”. Understanding this is a key to understanding Genesis 9, and an important aspect of Biblical storytelling.\n\nBio: Rev. Dr. Stephen De Young is Pastor of Archangel Gabriel Orthodox Church in Lafayette, Louisiana.

We also spoke more generally about gender in the meaning crisis, the priesthood, desire, brotherhood, femininity, spiritual warfare and rebuilding culture.\n\nFr. Hans’ service to men began in earnest over ten years ago when a young man approached him asking for help in learning how to become a man.

He studies consciousness, visual perception and evolutionary psychology using mathematical models and psychophysical experiments. \n\nIn this interview we discuss Prof. Hoffman’s work and theories on consciousness and the nature of reality, the limits of space-time, what evolution says about consciousness and how the latest mathematical theories about consciousness reflect positively on many ancient spiritual traditions.\n\nOther relevant interviews:\n- Beyond Materialism: The Matter With Things | with Dr. Iain McGilchrist: https://youtu.be/QyBXqcgLAXs \n- The Priority of Mind | with Bernardo Kastrup (More Christ): https://youtu.be/LglZNsmol58\n\nDonald Hoffman's Twitter: https://twitter.com/donalddhoffman\nWebsite: https://t.co/24aWTvO5am\n\n============================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 - Coming up next...\n00:02:14 - Intro music\n00:02:41 - Introduction\n00:03:56 - Understanding the basics of Prof Hoffman's work\n00:06:57 - What evolution says about consciousness\n00:13:33 - The language we use\n00:17:17 - The continued existence of things beyond phenomenology\n00:21:43 - The existence of higher beings\n00:26:41 - Fractals and mathematics\n00:29:00 - There's no scientific theory of everything\n00:34:55 - The issue of illusion and layers\n00:39:21 - Projection has a reality of its own\n00:46:26 - Different consciousnesses\n00:54:10 - Parasitic agency and false selves\n01:00:41 - The paradox of rock bottom\n01:05:37 - Memory and accounting for evil\n01:11:33 - Interpreting Jesus\n01:17:44 - What the future could look like\n\n============================\n\n- The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n- Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n- The Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n- Carving workshop: https://jonathanpageau.thinkific.com/courses/st-john-baptist\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n- Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n- French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\n- Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n- Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n- Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n- The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n- Website: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n- Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n- Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n- Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n- Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "title": "The Priority of Mind | with Bernardo Kastrup (More Christ)",
    "description": "This is a repost from my conversation with Bernardo Kastrup on the More Christ podcast and YouTube channel. We discuss dissociation and the problem of unity and multiplicity, how the Western mind approaches the world and what we have lost in modernity, banality, heavenly hierarchy and transcendence, crisis in the West and recovering the sacramental life without sentimentality.\n\nBernardo Kastrup is the executive director of Essentia Foundation. His work has been leading the modern renaissance of metaphysical idealism, the notion that reality is essentially mental. He has a Ph.D. in philosophy (ontology, philosophy of mind) and another Ph.D. in computer engineering (reconfigurable computing, artificial intelligence). As a scientist, Bernardo has worked for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the Philips Research Laboratories (where the 'Casimir Effect' of Quantum Field Theory was discovered). Formulated in detail in many academic papers and books, his ideas have been featured on 'Scientific American,' the 'Institute of Art and Ideas,' the 'Blog of the American Philosophical Association' and 'Big Think,' among others.\n\nBernardo’s website: https://www.bernardokastrup.com/\n\nOriginal video:\nMore Christ: Jonathan Pageau & Bernardo Kastrup: Orthodoxy and the Resurrection of the Western Mind, Body, & Soul: https://youtu.be/usFMBUTkaLk\n\nMentioned:\n- The Book of Enoch: Fallen Angels and the Modern Crisis: https://youtu.be/QtmLCK1keFI\n- The Mythical Constantinople | with Dr. Mario Baghos: https://youtu.be/3vGTGBW8CS4\n\n=======================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 - Coming up next\n00:00:50 - Intro music\n00:01:15 - Introduction (More Christ channel)\n00:02:04 - Jonathan opening statements\n00:03:25 - Bernardo opening statements\n00:04:33 - Technical vs religious language\n00:08:49 - Dissociation (kenosis)\n00:10:44 - The Christian answer to multiplicity/dissociation\n00:14:22 - The false dichotomy of unity and multiplicity\n00:16:45 - Engaging the world\n00:19:42 - Life is service\n00:21:14 - Resolving dissociation in a symbolic life\n00:24:32 - An impoverished western christianity\n00:26:57 - Banality and a revival of ritual\n00:28:36 - The reign of banality\n00:31:17 - The new materialistic religions\n00:35:06 - Dante and the hierarchy of being\n00:41:07 - Man at the center\n00:43:40 - Fractals: the universe as a nervous system\n00:45:24 - The daemon/guardian angel\n00:55:54 - What the daemon wants\n00:57:33 - Are principalities pre-existing?\n01:04:49 - The boundaries of identity\n01:07:54 - Extensions of man\n01:10:45 - Do you have a daemon?\n01:17:20 - “What Progress Wants”\n01:19:48 - Philosophy and reasoning is not enough\n01:22:00 - Freedom in service\n01:26:45 - Like in the time of Noah\n01:29:42 - Nietzsche\n01:32:29 - The cosmic structure of a city\n01:39:34 - The hope in crisis\n01:41:55 - The fall and the spiral\n01:43:24 - Romanticizing \"spirituality\"\n01:51:54 - Recovering truth in ritual without sentimentality\n01:55:14 - “A Hidden Life”\n01:57:08 - Outro\n\n=======================\n\n- The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n- Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n- The Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n- Carving workshop: https://jonathanpageau.thinkific.com/courses/st-john-baptist\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n- Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n- French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\n- Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n- Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n- Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n- The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n- Website: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n- Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n- Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n- Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n- Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

There are many different examples of sacrifice, not only killings, but offering and dedication for initiation into a group, as tribute or taxes, remembering the dead, to found a city or a home etc. Finally I talk about how Christianity solves the problem of sacrifice, in particular the problem of mimetic sacrifice of the scapegoat (René Girard).\n\n==================================\n\nIntro music: https://soundcloud.com/cosmos-os/pascal-hymn-synthwave\n\n==================================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 - Coming up next...\n00:00:31 - Intro music\n00:01:02 - Introduction\n00:02:45 - The \"religion\" category\n00:04:46 - The two goals of all beings\n00:07:41 - Why humans kill\n00:10:10 - Why humans act selflessly\n00:13:33 - René Girard: The scapegoat\n00:21:44 - The limits of Girard: other types of sacrifice\n00:23:44 - Ritual sacrifices bind us together\n00:26:48 - The tribute: sacrificing to authority\n00:28:59 - Human sacrifice and war\n00:33:21 - Sacrificing food\n00:34:49 - The sacrifice to found a city or a home\n00:37:34 - Levels of ritualized sacrifice\n00:39:30 - The first born\n00:41:02 - Initiation sacrifices\n00:44:45 - Sacrifice in the Gospels\n00:47:26 - The problem with the scapegoat sacrifice\n00:50:09 - What Christianity reveals\n00:53:20 - The modern world's sacrifices\n00:56:20 - Abortion\n00:58:11 - The elites\n00:59:26 - Final words\n01:01:48 - Outro\n\n==================================\n\n\n- The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n- Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n- The Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n- Carving workshop: https://jonathanpageau.thinkific.com/courses/st-john-baptist\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n- Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n- French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\n- Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n- Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n- Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n- The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n- Website: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n- Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n- Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n- Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n- Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n- Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "description": "In this episode of the universal history series Richard Rohlin and I build on our previous discussion about Groundhog Day and its connection to the Orthodox feast of the Meeting of the Lord in the Temple, which is actually one of four winter feasts (The Entrance of the Theotokos to the Temple, the Nativity, Theophany and finally the Meeting of the Lord in the Temple). Together these four celebrations are a continuation of the Jewish feast of Hanukkah.

I’m very excited to have him on the channel as he’s been an inspiration in the world of iconography and to me personally since I started carving icons. Today we of course talk about his work, not just in iconography but also in liturgical design more generally. We also discuss the difficulty of novelty in the modern world, the artist vs the saint, the possibilities for the sacred informing the secular, dealing with ugliness in our world and future solutions to create more beauty.

We’ve been talking a lot about sacred history and how these religious patterns manifested themselves in terms of how people understood their own identities. But now we move to a more secular Western Europe, where even here there was still a desire people had to connect their own society, through memory and celebration, to different characters in the past.

    "description": "One of the big problems people face today regarding religion or the notion of God, is the problem of what I would call the reality of God VS the reality of the world. This might seem abstract at first, but it ends up manifesting itself in everybody’s life, whether they’re religious or not. It ends up manifesting itself in opposites; on the one hand there is the argument of transcendence; that God is completely above the world. While on the other hand there is immanence; that God completely fills the world. Understanding this problem can help us understand some of the discourse people are using, and how we often feel trapped in extreme opposites. \n\n==========================\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n01:50 Framing of the problem\n09:48 How we are dealing with this\n12:00 The solution\n15:28 St. Dionysius the Areopagite\n21:35 Conclusion\n24:37 Outro\n\n==========================\n\n-The Symbolic World website and blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n-Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n-Orthodox Arts Journal: https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/jonathan-pageau/\n-My brother's book on symbolism - Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n-Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n-Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n-Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n-French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\n-Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n-Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n-Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n-The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n-Webside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n-Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n-Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n-Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n-Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n-Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "description": "In this video I interview Gauthier Pierozak about the amazing work he’s done to rediscover and share the lost work of the 20th century French symbolist, Louis Charbonneau-Lassay. Charbonneau was a Catholic archaeologist who also collaborated with René Guénon, but remained dedicated to approaching symbolism through primarily a Christian lens.

    "description": "The last episode of Marvel’s Loki series took a surprisingly thoughtful look at the problem of opposites. The entire series was about the challenges and opportunities of two extremes, unlimited variability on one side and absolute control and linearity on the other. This whole problem culminates into the last episode, which was brought into an almost theological realm as the entire climax of the series became a play on Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden facing the puzzle of the serpent. In this video I explore the final episode and the general tendency in both the MCU and DC to move towards the trope of the multiverse in their storytelling.

He has been podcasting since 2007 and is host of the Orthodox Engagement, Amon Sûl, Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy, and Roads from Emmaus podcasts, and co-host of The Lord of Spirits and The Areopagus Podcast.\n\nToday we talk about his new book, Arise O God: The Gospel of Christ’s Defeat of Demons, Sin, and Death (see link below). It is a very interesting and succinct introduction to a more cosmic and narrative vision of the Gospel and it captures much of what he and Fr. Stephen De Young have been discussing on the Lord of Spirits Podcast.\n\nWe discuss what motivated Fr. Andrew to write this book, the cosmic VS sales-pitch visions of Christianity, the cosmic reality of demons and becoming “like the angels” and individualism and spiritual progress. In the second half we also talk about Fr. Andrew’s studies of mythology, pagan literature, and modern VS ancient paganism. Enjoy!\n\n-Fr.

    "description": "Kanye West’s new album, named after his late mother Donda, was released on 29 August 2021 and since its release people have been asking me what I think of it and of his controversial collaboration with artists like DaBaby and Marilyn Manson. In this video I take a look at what he seems to be trying to do with this album, looking specifically at one of his Chicago events and the song Come to Life, which includes Kim Kardashian in the music video. As you know I’ve been following Kanye West for a while, keeping an eye on his effects on culture and his conversion to Christianity. I’ve said before that he’s playing the role of the fool who is capable of bridging extremes in culture. In his own particularities he seems to be trying to reconcile many contradictions and bringing that into the symbolism of his music as well as in his collaborations. \n\nLet us know in the comments what you think and whether you think Kanye achieved success with his album or not.\n\n================\n\n-The Symbolic World Website and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\n-Merch: http://www.thesymbolicworld.store\n-Orthodox Arts Journal: https://orthodoxartsjournal.org/jonathan-pageau/\n-My brother's book on symbolism - Language of Creation (Matthieu Pageau): https://www.amazon.com/Language-Creation-Cosmic-Symbolism-Genesis-ebook/dp/B07D738HD8\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\n-Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\n-Apple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\n-Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\n-French Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\n-Bitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\n-Dtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\n-Unofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n-The Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \n-Webside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\n-Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\n-Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\n-Paypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\n-Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\n-Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy intro was arranged and recorded by Matthew Wilkinson.\nMy website designers, Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

We discuss the importance of personhood in culture and the role of the saints, before we dive into different themes in Ethiopian tradition and hagiography that include a focus on the 9 Roman Saints we mentioned last time, the good thief, the saint as punisher, the scandalous aspect of salvation regarding cannibalism and the Eucharist, and much more.

Today we take a look at a few music clips from the album and discuss his inspiration, how we both experienced the talk, Saint Christopher and what he means for the Church, Theosis, garments of skin, encountering the stranger and scientism.

    "description": "This is my second conversation with Dr. Mario Baghos, an Australian scholar and lecturer at St Andrew’s Greek Orthodox Theological College (Sydney College of Divinity). In this talk we explore in much more depth the notion of the Immortal Emperor, the Marble King or the Sleeping King legend that we see in the Byzantine tradition but also in other traditions. Ultimately we tie it in with a discussion about the apocalyptic motif in Byzantine thinking. \n\nThis conversation is a complement to my previous talks with Richard Rohlin on universal history, especially The Apocalypse and the Return of the King (https://youtu.be/TyLFK7Lo0Zw) and the most recent discussion about Ethiopia, titled From Alexander the Great to Ethiopia (https://youtu.be/AkXcay54e6Q).\n\n-Check out Dr. Mario Baghos’ profile page at St Andrew's for links to his work: http://www.sagotc.edu.au/faculty/dr-mario-baghos\n\n-Dr. Mario Baghos’ book (Please feel free to leave a rating and/or review), From the Ancient Near East to Christian Byzantium: Kings, Symbols, and Cities: https://www.cambridgescholars.com/product/978-1-5275-6627-9 (Enter the code PROMO25 to at the checkout to redeem a 25% discount) \n\nOr https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Near-East-Christian-Byzantium/dp/1527566277/ \n\n-Universal History YouTube playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVX4HUUPrIY_M2uZP3yW6EEiod3fGD6FD\n\n=================\n\nMusic mentioned:\nTwo Modern Greek songs about the Marble King, Constantine XI Palaiologos:\n-Xaris Alexiou's 'The Marble King': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG7IA5LLExI\n-Stamatis Spanoudakis' 'Lightning Strikes':https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFZ-Y0u_wkI\n\nBooks mentioned:\n-Apocalypse.

    "description": "In this video I explore the meaning of the Beatitudes in Matthew 5. These famous passages can help us understand how Christ is not only the “top of the hierarchy”, so to speak, but He also fills it, and provides the means for others to participate in creation as microcosms of Himself. It’s also important to understand the surrounding context of the Beatitudes and how they fit into the bigger image of who Christ is.\n\nRemember to like and subscribe if you enjoy these kinds of videos and check out all The Symbolic World links below for more content like articles on symbolism, the clips channel, my French channel and the Symbolic World merch store.\n\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: www.thesymbolicworld.store\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\nApple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nMore videos from The Symbolic World:\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nJoin the conversation:\nUnofficial Facebook discussion group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\nThe Symbolic World Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSymbolicWorld/\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nSocial media links:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "description": "This is my third conversation about universal history with Richard Rohlin, philologist and co-host of the Amon Sûl podcast. We are very excited to discuss Ethiopia and its unique role in the universal history. We draw a lot on Scripture: the Queen of Sheba, Moses' Ethiopian wife and the Ethiopian eunuch mentioned in Acts. This topic is all about the symbolism of the margins, encountering the stranger and the flip that can happen at the end of something. Also relevant is the role of the feminine and in particular the foreign woman.\n\nStay tuned for our follow-up talk where we will see the role of Ethiopia in medieval universal history and its connections with Alexander the Great. \n\nUniversal history playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVX4HUUPrIY_M2uZP3yW6EEiod3fGD6FD\n\n=====================\n\nETHIOPIAN CROSS MERCH:\nEthiopian Cross (WHITE) apparel: https://the-symbolic-world.creator-spring.com/listing/ethiopian-cross-white\nEthiopian Cross (BLACK) apparel: https://www.thesymbolicworld.store/listing/ethiopian-cross-black?product=2\n\n=====================\n\nFilm mentioned:\n-The Ten Commandments film (1956) featuring Charlton Heston: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/\n\nPodcasts mentioned:\n-Fr.

    "description": "I talk with Russian scholar and author, Eugene Vodolazkin. Eugene wrote the amazing and highly recommended novel, Laurus. Laurus won the National Big Book Award and the Yasnaya Polyana Award and was shortlisted for the National Bestseller Prize, the Russian Booker Prize and the New Literature Award. It has been translated into eighteen languages. Set in the fifteenth century, it's remarkable at transporting the reader to medieval thinking and an enchanted vision of Christianity, paving the way for good Christian storytelling.\n\nIn this interview Eugene and I discuss how the perceptions of time and transcendence differed for ancient people compared to today, we talk about how history was viewed in the Middle Ages and the natural connections with the pagan traditions that historically preceded Christianity. We also discuss modern storytelling like that of J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K.

    "description": "I sit down with Rafe Kelley on his podcast called Evolve Move Play (EMP). Rafe is interested in human movement training and parkour. Evolve Move Play “reconnects people to the most meaningful aspects of life and helps them cultivate their character through outdoor movement training with online courses, classes, and retreats.”\n\nRafe comes from a more scientific perspective and has been in conversation with people like John Vervaeke and Paul VanderKlay (https://youtu.be/0p47jSSYXZk). This interview is an attempt to bridge the gap between the symbolic, or mythological, worldview and Rafe’s more materialist presuppositions. We talk about the reemergence of the religious spirit (“re-enchantment), social justice, BLM and veganism etc, the role religion has played evolutionarily, the problem of inclusion and exclusion in group identity, the work of Jonathan Haidt, spirituality, emergence and emanation, the universalist position and much more. \n\n-----------------------\n\nRelated videos:\n-Religion and Materialism - Adam Friended vs Jonathan Pageau: https://youtu.be/JLJd1-tRpiY\n-Rationality Rules - Possibilities and Limits of Metaphorical Truth: https://youtu.be/D2Sdas8_c04\n-Cognitive Science and the Sacred | with John Vervaeke: https://youtu.be/2PGglfl5j_I\n\n-----------------------\n\nFollow Rafe’s work:\n-EMP Website: https://www.evolvemoveplay.com\n-YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Faelcind\n-IG: @RafeKelley - http://www.instagram.com/rafekelley/\n-FB: @RafeKelleyMovement - https://www.facebook.com/RafeKelleyMovement/\n-Twitter: @rafekelley - https://twitter.com/rafekelley\n\n-----------------------\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebsite: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nLinks:\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\n\nThe Symbolic World podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0gI8bUwPtT3gkduHqNh6M5\nApple podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-symbolic-world/id1386867488\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nThe unofficial Facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "description": "I interview Dr. Mario Baghos, an Australian scholar. Dr Mario Baghos is Lecturer in Theology (Patristics) and Church History at St Andrew’s Greek Orthodox Theological College (Sydney College of Divinity). Dr. Baghos has a PhD in Studies in Religion from the University of Sydney (2015). He has written a book called “From the Ancient Near East to Christian Byzantium” wherein he explores the symbolism of the foundations of Constantinople and ancient civilizations. This discussion is a continuation of my first interview with Richard Rohlin (A Universal History: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N5s4n_lwB8&t=567s) where we talked about history through the more mythical, symbolic lens.\n\nIn this interview Mario and I discuss the importance of Constantinople, the “second Rome”, as the first city founded upon a Christian vision of the cosmos, by Saint Constantine the Great after his conversion to Christianity. We discuss the legends around the founding of the city, its forgotten spiritual and cultural influence, its connection with Troy and role in the universal history as well as the preservation of ancient pagan texts and statuary and their place in a Christian hierarchy.\n\nMario’s book, From the Ancient Near East to Christian Byzantium: Kings, Symbols, and Cities: \n-Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Near-East-Christian-Byzantium/dp/1527566277/\n-Cambridge Scholars Publishing: https://www.cambridgescholars.com/product/978-1-5275-6627-9\n\n-\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:02:06 The Founding of Constantinople\n00:19:48 Ancient Cities VS Modern Cities\n00:25:09 The Importance of Constantinople\n00:36:22 The Connection with Troy\n00:43:21 The Issue of Pagan Statuary & the Preservation of Texts\n\n-\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nLinks:\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nThe unofficial Facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "title": "Montero and WandaVision: How Satanism Functions",
    "description": "In today's video I discuss the symbolic coherence in Lil Nas X's controversial music video titled Montero (Call Me By Your Name) and Marvel Studios' miniseries WandaVision. These timely productions make use of powerful and coherent symbolic imagery that can help us better understand what Satanism and witchcraft are and exactly how they subvert their narrative source: a broken Christianity. \n\nSatanism as self-worship is the embodiment, the celebration, of the end of Christianity (self-sacrifice in love for God). Satanism is subversive by nature such that many Satanists don't even believe in Satan - but they don't have to. Satanism has never been about devil worship, rather it's about embodying the revolutionary pattern itself, as we can see in Montero, where he seduces, kills and replaces Satan with himself.\n\nIn WandaVision we are basically told the story of the Matrix, but this time from the perspective of the Matrix itself as the main character. In her own self-concern the witch wants to prevent “incarnation”, normal relationships between people, so that she can manipulate things to fulfil her own dreams. To do this she gives birth to a “virtual reality”, creating a fantasy world for the sake of being with Vision, the embodiment of artificial intelligence, the “perfect man”. The story is framed for viewers to sympathize not with the many people being tortured under Wanda’s totalitarian system, but with Wanda herself as the exceptional and victimized individual.\n\nThese examples give us insight into what the opposite of Christianity is and how Christianity is brought to ruin: the tyranny of the individual in all its idiosyncratic passions.\n\n-\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n02:26 Montero\n10:38 Satanism as Irony Itself\n15:34 The Figure of Satan\n19:30 The Primacy of Narrative\n22:29 Witches Winning the Culture War\n24:53 WandaVision\n29:27 Victimhood and Pride\n32:57 Anti-Christ - the Reverse of Christianity\n\n-\n\nMusic by Vetle Lyckander: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCncwLHnC0rzbeweMJ25E-KA\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nLinks:\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nThe unofficial Facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nThe outro to my videos was written by Matthew Wilkinson\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "description": "In this video we look at the meaning of hybrids: mixtures between categories of identity. With emerging technologies it's become possible to artificially create hybrids of different types of animals, or even to interbreed between humans and animals. A recent development at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California has sparked public debate given their experimentation with a monkey-human hybrid embryo. The ancient word for such a hybrid is chimera. Like the sphinx and cherubim these mixed beings indicate a breakdown and confusion of identity and act as a buffer between existence and non-existence. What can the (quite literal) emergence of chimeras tell us about the state of our world today?\n\nRod Dreher's article on the topic: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/monkey-man-embryos/\n\nSupport this channel: \nWebside: https://thesymbolicworld.com/support/\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nSubscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/jonathan-pageau\nPaypal: http://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nLinks:\nWebsite and Blog: http://www.thesymbolicworld.com\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/the-symbolic-world\nClips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageauClips\nFrench Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanPageaufrançais\nBitchute:  https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pageaujonathan/\nDtube: https://steemit.com/@symbolism\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheSymbolicWorld\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/pageaujonathan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jonathan.pageau\n\nThe unofficial Facebook discussion group: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1989208418065298/\n\nThe outro to my videos was written by Matthew Wilkinson\n\nMy website designers,  Anomalist Design: https://www.anomalistdesign.com/",

    "description": "Expanding on a talk I gave last year called Pentecost for the Zombie Apocalypse, I discuss the meaning of the zombie and the monster in general as a portent of cultural patterns.  \n\nBy examining the traditional vision of the world and by exploring ancient stories. I trace a parallel to the development of modern art and contemporary culture through contemporary authors such as Jacques Derrida and John Vervaeke's recent book, \"Zombies in Western Culture\".   \n\nFinally I explore the positive place of the monster in the figure of St-Christopher.\n\nThis conference was given at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina on March 15th, 2017.  \n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",

The movie is full of symbolic references, but most importantly it is the structure of the movie which gives us most insight about what it is the Wachowski siblings are painting for us, a battle between tyranny and freedom which can also be seen as order and chaos.  In the end, the Matrix still speaks clearly to many of the questions being asked today.  \n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pageaujonathan",

The subject of the conference was The New Media, and the other speakers included Jordan Peterson, Bret Weinstein and Theryn Meyer.  \n\nI spoke of the recent emergence of a new band of media pundits who have rallied around free speech, figures like Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Dave Rubin, Sargon of Akkad, Ben Shapiro, Gad Saad and many others.  I discuss how a world becomes upside down as it exhausts itself and the role of the outliers and tricksters in putting the world back on its feet.  \n\nSupport this channel:\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\npaypal: https://www.paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nwebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/PageauCarvings",

    "description": "With Matthieu Pageau we discuss symbolism in the creation story told in Genesis and how it relates to consciousness, the problem of self-reference and how true symbolism usually appears in a fractal structure of microcosms and macrocosm.  \n\nThe problem of science and rationality is that by emphasizing materiality and reason it often struggles with the paradox of self-reference and self-causality, just as it struggles with the problem of the justification for hierarchical structures of value.  These two issues are related through the fact of consciousness and self-awareness.  Though science struggles to include the consciousness of the viewer in its general calculation, this is something that is done very well in traditional cosmologies through a series of self-replicating patterns which are embedded into each other somewhat like a fractal pattern.\n\nSupport this channel:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/pageauvideos\nPaypal: paypal.me/JonathanPageau\n\nWebsite: http://www.pageaucarvings.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jonathanpageau\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PageauCarvings",

This symbolism is not only present in the content and message, but in the forms, the mediums and the very uses of art. Christian art can be a true and honest engagement within the contemporary world, one which neither ignores the visual and conceptual revolutions of the last centuries nor attempts to paste the Christian message on forms and aesthetics which negate this very message..",
