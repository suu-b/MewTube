We'll demonstrate how Islam's validity collapses under the weight of its own claims and the content of the Bible. By setting the stage with two models of reality—Christianity and Islam—we'll assess the evidence using Bayes' theorem. \n\nWe differentiate between prior odds (initial beliefs) and the likelihood ratio (how well the evidence fits each model). Finally, we calculate the posterior odds to determine which model holds up better against the evidence. Through two runs of the argument, one favoring Christianity and the other Islam, we show that even with a 99% prior probability for Islam, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of Christianity. The video walks through the concept of prior and posterior probabilities, highlights the issues with the Islamic responses to the dilemma, and ultimately demonstrates that the evidence significantly favors Christianity.\n\n00:00 Introduction to the Islamic Dilemma\n00:15 Introducing Bayesian Probability\n01:28 Understanding Prior Odds and Likelihood Ratios\n06:15 Addressing Subjectivity in Prior Probabilities\n08:54 Running the Bayesian Islamic Dilemma\n11:08 Assessing Islam's Submodels\n23:54 Evaluating the Lost Injeel Hypothesis\n28:00 Final Likelihood Assessments\n38:04 Conclusion: The Bayesian Verdict\n_______________________________________________\n\n📖 FREE Trial of Logos Bible Software: https://www.logos.com/inspiringphilosophy\n\nDon't forget to help us create more videos!

Yeah, that myth got wrecked,\nearly Qur’ans don’t even match the text.\nUsed to flex “science,” now you backin’ away,\n‘Cause camel embryo facts don’t hit the same today.\n\nGot the Islamic Dilemma, you can’t solve that,\nEvery “answer” you give makes the problem snap back.\nSay the Bible’s corrupt, but your own book cries,\nbibles Allah’s words — they can’t be revised.\nIf Allah’s words can’t change, then your claim’s a fraud,\nYou just argued yourself against the word of your god.\n\nInjil’s “secret book”? That’s your mystery prize,\nBut the Qur’an said Christians should judge by it — lies.\nThen your crew pulled mutah like it’s just a game,\nRuined her life and trashed a man’s name.\n\nAll that Dawah talk, but when truth appears,\nYou vanish from the chat like it hurts your ears.\n\nChorus\nWithout lies… Islam dies,\nCan’t hide truth, can’t spin those lies.\nWithout lies… Islam dies,\nDawah cries when the facts arrive.\n\nVerse 2 \n“We follow Jesus better” — sure, in your dream,\nWhile cutting out His claims like you’re cropping a meme.\nCrown off His head, toss His cross in the bin,\nThen smile for the camera like you’re still His kin.\n\n“Jesus was a Muslim” — cute little twist,\nRedefine the word so the facts don’t exist.\nIf labels could change what the records prove,\nThen Pharaoh was a Yahweh fan, and Judas stayed true.\n\nMuhammad in the Song of Solomon? Bro, you made your prophet a fruit,\nSnuggled up with Solomon — then came the men of al-Zut.\n\nChorus\nWithout lies… Islam dies,\nCan’t hide truth, can’t spin those lies.\nWithout lies… Islam dies,\nDawah cries when the facts arrive.\n\nBreakdown \n\nYou preach perfect text but the proof ain’t there,\nHafs, Warsh — even your readers don’t care.\nCall the Bible corrupt but still quote it loud,\nTryna find Muhammad just to please your crowd.\n\nSong of Solomon? Yeah, that’s your flex?\nYou just wrote your prophet into Solomon’s bed \n\nThen the men of al-Zut came ridin’ through,\nAll night long — and you say that’s true?\n\n“Jesus was a Muslim” — that wordplay’s dead,\nBy that logic, Pharaoh bowed his head.\nYou twist, you spin, but you can’t disguise,\nThat every Dawah claim is built on lies.\n\nWithout lies….\nWithout lies…\nWithout lies…\n___________________________________\n\n📖 FREE Trial of Logos Bible Software: https://www.logos.com/inspiringphilosophy\n\nDon't forget to help us create more videos!

    "description": "🙏 DONATE: https://inspiringphilosophy.com/give/\n\nPeople don't realize how horribly children were treated in the past.  Children in Pagan societies suffered.  Ancient Roman and Greek laws and customs devalued their lives. This video explores how Christianity revolutionized the treatment of children in the ancient world, where practices like infanticide, child slavery, and sexual abuse were rampant. The introduction and spread of Christian values brought a significant shift, emphasizing the intrinsic worth of every child and fostering protective measures. Early Christian leaders condemned harmful practices, promoted orphanages, and challenged societal norms, gradually improving children's lives. This video also touches on the continued impact of Christian missionaries in various cultures worldwide, who worked to eradicate harmful practices and improve child welfare, illustrating Christianity's long-term positive influence on children globally.\n\n00:00 Ancient Infanticide and Brothels\n01:10 Christianity's Impact on Child Welfare\n01:50 Children's Status in Ancient Societies\n04:31 Infanticide and Child Exposure in Rome\n09:51 Christian Teachings on Children\n16:04 Sexual Abuse of Children and Teens in Antiquity\n24:44 Christian Reforms and Orphanages\n27:04 Global Impact of Christian Missionaries\n29:49 Conclusion: The Lasting Influence of Christianity\n31:06 Support Our Mission\n\nDon't forget to help us create more videos!

Some have been pointing out that the Gospel of John says Jesus admits all authority He has comes from the Father. But remember the context of what I said. I said we don’t see Jesus having to go through a “process.” There is no process where this happens during Jesus’ ministry. In Trinitarian theology Jesus is begotten of the Father, so all things come from the Father but there was never a 'time' when Jesus was given these things. As I said, Jesus always had this authority. So the difference is the disciples went through a process. Jesus did not.",

I forgot the Felire of Óengus did suggest November 1st was the date of Samhain. However, it also doesn’t suggest Samhain was a religious festival or had any rituals associated with it. Samhain seemed to be a calendrical date to indicate the end of summer. Samhain most likely meant “summers end.” Later reliable sources suggest it may have been a time of feasting and games, but there is no reference to any rituals associated with Samhain. Also, considering the celts didn’t use a Gregorian or Julian Calendar, the date of 11/1 is likely a Christian approximation. The celts used a lunar-solar calendar, meaning the date of Samhain would have varied from year to year.",

    "description": "I have a masters in philosophy and I am huge Tolkien nerd. I have read all his books, as well as books like, \"The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy,\" which go deep into the philosophy of Tolkien. In this stream I'll review the Amazon show, \"Rings of Power\" and show where it diverges from Tolkien's philosophical beliefs. Amazon's \"Rings of Power\" actually injects foreign philosophical ideas into Middle Earth that makes it feel unlike the world that Tolkien created.\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why Tolkien does not have Frodo defeat Sauron by casting the ring into the fire? Middle Earth has no heroes who rise up to defeat the dark lord. Why did the Valar only send 5 wizards to Middle Earth and not a whole host of Maiar to deal with Sauron? Why didn't the ents help with the war against Sauron? The reason has to do with the philosophy that was guiding Tolkien's narrative. It is not a world, like Game of Thrones, where heroes rise up to vanquish evil. Tolkien's philosophy is far different than what we see in typical fantasy novels. I'll explain what philosophy was guiding Tolkien and why he wrote as he did. I'll also explain why \"Rings of Power\" fails to capture Tolkien's philosophy.",

    "title": "The Case for Ancient Monotheism Documentary",
    "description": "Monotheism is assumed to have first emerged around 500 BC, but there is an overwhelming amount of stunning evidence monotheism emerged thousands of years ago and may precede all other forms of religion.\n\nA special thanks to James Middleton - \"www.shortfusecreative.co.uk\" for building to the open.\n\nDon't forget to help us create more videos! We need your support:\nhttps://inspiringphilosophy.org\nhttps://www.patreon.com/inspiringphilosophy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5qDet6sa6rODi7t6wfpg8g/join\n\nSo a couple of things to note:\n\nThe first is I would encourage everyone to watch to the end as I will push back on some of Lang and Schmidt's conclusion and actually disagree with them on some things. This is not a video arguing for original monotheism. This is a video on ancient monotheism. That will be made clear at the end.\n\nThe second issue is there is a debate among scholars if the epic, \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\" should be translated to reflect a time in the past. It might be referring to a future event, but for the purposes of this video, it is mainly being used as a hook, not part of my main thrust of evidence.\n\nThird, Schmidt argued the pigmy tribes in central Africa were one of the most, if not the most, primitive culture out there. Many of these tribes have turned out to be polytheistic, but some, like the Batwa, do seem to be monotheistic. \n\nFourth, the terms, monotheism, and polytheism, are probably not the best terms to describe any religion, but they are overwhelmingly accepted by the culture we live so I am working within those parameters. This is why in the video I try to use the term \"monotheistic\" more than saying they were strict monotheists. I hope this becomes clear when you use catholicism as an example.\n\nSources:\nSamuel Noah Kramer - The Babel of Tongues: A Sumerian Version (1968)\n\nEnmerkar and the Lord of Aratta- http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1823.htm\n\nAndrew Lang - The Making of Religion\n\nA.

    "description": "Join us at: http://www.inspiringphilosophy.org\n\nTo help support this ministry click here: http://www.patreon.com/inspiringphilosophy\n\n\nThis is a video introducing the argument behind the evolutionary argument against naturalism developed by Alvin Plantinga. It is a remake of an older video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4QFsKevTXs\n\nSources and Notes:\n \n- The Virtues by Peter Geach\n\n- http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/\n\n- http://www.uffl.org/vol12/moreland12.pdf\n\n- http://www.iep.utm.edu/naturali/\n\n- Breaking the Spell by Daniel Dennett\n\n- http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/plantinga_alvin/naturalism_defeated.pdf\n\n- Untruth and Consequence by Richard Rorty\n\n- Charles Darwin Letter to William Graham\nhttp://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/entry-13230\n\n- Straw Gods by John Gray\n\n- Moral Landscape by Sam Harris\n(Full quote: \"For instance, it is just as true to say that our logical, mathematical, and physical intuitions have not been designed by natural selection to track truth. Does this mean that we must cease to be realists with respect to physical reality? We need not look far in science to find ideas and opinions that defy easy synthesis. There are many scientific frameworks (and levels of description) that resist integration and which divide our discourse into areas of specialization, even pitting Nobel laureates in the same discipline against one another. Does this mean that we can never hope to understand what is really going on in the world? No. It mans the conversation must continue.\") \nI don't see how saying \"the conversation must continue\" avoids the implications of this argument presented in the video. The conversation we would have is not going to track truth to begin with so it doesn't escape the self-defeating circle. To be fair, this wasn't the topic of his book, but his admission in the 'Moral Landscape' is interesting and useful for the EAAN, none the least. \n\n- Journal of Philosophy (LXXXIV, Oct. 87) Patricia Churchland\n\n- Philosophy by Anthony O'Hear\n\n- http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CD8QFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollos.ws%2Fargument-from-reason%2FA%2520Defense%2520of%2520Alvin%2520Plantinga%2527s%2520Evolutionary%2520Argument%2520Against%2520Naturalism.pdf&ei=ZUB1VJq5N-GDiwLa3oGICw&usg=AFQjCNHl-pP-UQ9U-rrdokYJp--5zWwtlA&sig2=6C9RLmXktpcZLrsu_-Az3A\n\n\n\n*If you are caught excessively commenting, being disrespectful, insulting, or derailing then your comments will be removed.

I attempt to clear that up by offering a different perspective than most people know today. The traditional surface understanding doesn't make sense with scripture or the actual text. This new approach will clear up several misconceptions.\n\nIn regards to Job 2:3. It is interesting you brought this up, because this was something I had planned to talk about but left it because I thought I was getting to technical. Commentators like John MacArthur note the Hebrew is the same expression for what Satan uses in Job 1:9, \"for nothing.\" Basically God has turned Satan's own words against him. God is pointing out Satan was wrong that Job only worshipped his stuff. Which is something I pointed out at the end that Satan, Job, and Job's friends were all wrong in this. God is pointing out here Job is not suffering because Satan was right about him in this, but there is deeper thing taking place. Job didn't have his stuff taken away for the cause Satan had thought.﻿\n\nDon't forget to help us create more videos!

Using the work of the Philosopher Isaiah Berlin, this video explains why.\n\n*Disclaimer - Berlin was mainly writing about political philosophy and positive and negative freedom in political thought. However, from reading his work we can easily see how his definitions of different types of freedom can transcend political philosophy and apply to other areas of life and thought. \n\nTwo Concepts of Liberty by Isaiah Berlin:\nhttp://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/wiso_vwl/johannes/Ankuendigungen/Berlin_twoconceptsofliberty.pdf\n\nMusic Credits: Addison Road \"Hope Now\"\n\nDon't forget to help us create more videos!
