Library of America has a two volume set of all of Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle, and that includes both books: https://amzn.to/46JIbuM\n\nThere is a fresh documentary about Le Guin.

Your sense of peace and improved sleep starts here: https://aurahealth.io/jaredhenderson\n\n\n\nIf you want to take great book notes and remember what you read, then I recommend trying out this method. This method centers around creating outlines as if you were going to teach the material to a beginner. I used this when I was teaching undergraduates, but it also works well when I'm taking book notes for my own use.\n\n\nWhile filming, I was told that this was very similar to the Feynman method. Here's a video that explains that method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts (There are a lot of similarities.)\n\nCitation about writing by hand (link to a PDF): https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1003a557abbb5d57aa6016ecc64832fc58bf6b08\n\nApps mentioned were Roam Research (https://roamresearch.com/) and Obisidian (https://obsidian.md/).

I would not call myself a Stoic, but I am someone who has been inspired by the Stoics, and I think that most would benefit from implementing some Stoic practices in their lives. There is a lot of wisdom in Stoicism, and we should make use of it.\n\nIn this video, I go over some recommended books for Stoicism and suggest some Stoic practices for everyone to try. This is a great way to try and live like a philosopher.\n\n→ Support\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Kyj04yISmHr1V-UlJz4eg/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=84329184\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/46T4nSMB\n\n→ Thinker\nMy newsletter: jaredhenderson.substack.com\n\n→ The Classical Mind\nCheck out my podcast where I discuss a great work of literature or philosophy every month: https://theclassicalmind.com\n\n→ Recommended Reading\nMeditations: https://amzn.to/41OQx2M\nWorks of Epictetus: https://amzn.to/3IZjWyK\nLetters from a Stoic: https://amzn.to/3ZmCCzn\nHellenistic Philosophy: https://amzn.to/3JcrvlN\nThe Hellenistic Philosophers: https://amzn.to/41KsfXE\nThe Stoics Reader: https://amzn.to/41Yx7Zo\nHow to Be a Stoic: https://amzn.to/3SSsgEF\n\n→ Music\nOriginal music by The Music Giant\nGet custom music created for your content: https://www.themusicgiant.com/contentcreators\n\n→ Video Gear\nMic: https://amzn.to/3Uw7ZVw\nRecorder: https://amzn.to/3Tz1uQp\nCamera: https://amzn.to/3Ust3MT\nCamera (upgrade): https://amzn.to/3EFGW4e\nLens: https://amzn.to/3WXbAhd\nLens (upgrade): https://amzn.to/3SA49KM\n\nThese are affiliate links with Amazon.

    "description": "As an avid reader, I often get asked about the pros and cons of physical books versus e-readers. In this video, I want to dive into the topic and share my own personal preferences and experiences with both formats.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the appeal of physical books. For me, there's something really special about the physical act of holding a book in my hands, flipping through the pages, and seeing my progress as I make my way through the story. There's also a certain nostalgia associated with physical books, as many of us have fond memories of visiting the library or bookstore as children and picking out a new book to dive into.\n\nAdditionally, physical books don't require any special equipment or technology to read. All you need is your eyes and the book itself, making them easily accessible no matter where you are. Physical books are also often more durable than e-readers, as they don't rely on batteries or electronics that can malfunction or break.\n\nHowever, there are also some compelling arguments in favor of e-readers. One major advantage is the convenience factor. With an e-reader, you can carry around an entire library's worth of books in a device that fits easily in your pocket or purse. E-readers are also often more affordable in the long run, as you don't have to pay for each book individually. You can often find a wide selection of e-books at discounted prices, or even for free through public libraries.\n\n→ Support the Channel\n\npatreon.com/_jared\n\n→ Thinker\nInterested in a free newsletter in which I provide section-by-section commentary on great works of philosophy?

In this video, we will explore how we can become better journalers by following example of the great Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius. This is just one example of taking ancient philosophy and applying it to our modern context to better our lives. \n\nReading the Meditations by Marcus Aurelius teaches us several lessons about how and why we should keep a journal. Ultimately, we are trying to make thinking deeply and philosophically into a habit. We want to become philosophers — not just people who sometimes read philosophy. And following the path of Stoicism might be a way for us to do this. \n\nI'm hoping that in 2023 we can all read great books, write in our journals, and have some great philosophical conversations. \n\n→ Recommended Reading\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius: https://amzn.to/3HDayBz\nRyan Holiday: https://amzn.to/3UYsM3I\n\n→ Video Gear\nMic: https://amzn.to/3Uw7ZVw\nRecorder: https://amzn.to/3Tz1uQp\nCamera: https://amzn.to/3Ust3MT\nLens: https://amzn.to/3WXbAhd\n\nThese are affiliate links with Amazon.

Are there quick tips, life hacks, and secret formulae?\n\nThe truth is, you'll only be a better writer if you practice. I can (and do) give some advice, but writing is hard work.

    "description": "There is a lot of content out there about how to read more. Instead, you should focus on reading better.\n\nHaving a reading goal isn't a bad thing. For many of us, it is a motivator. I usually set a reading goal each year. But I've found that when I set that goal too high, I focus on reading for the sake of meeting the goal rather than reading for the sake of knowledge or self-improvement. \n\nIn this video, I go over why we should focus on reading better — we should focus on becoming better readers. This often means slowing down and reading fewer books.\n\nEnjoy!",
