    "description": "Our friend, Yamil has been working as a contractor on our Building Team for a while now. Over his time with us, he’s become friends with many on staff and has been engaging in conversations about faith with our Building Manager, Ricky. Last week Ricky got to pray with Yamil as he accepted Jesus as Savior of his life. So we gathered some of the staff to celebrate as he put his lightbulb into the cross wall at our 515 location. Getting to celebrate people going from death to LIFE is something we will never get over. Each light bulb represents human hearts that have been changed by the Light of the World and are declaring that Jesus is Life. Let this be an encouragement that the environment you create and the way you treat each other matters. People are watching and we want others to see Jesus by the way we live.\n—\nFor a deeper study of God's Word, plus daily resources for your walk with Jesus, visit https://passionequip.com/.\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

This year has been one of exponential growth around Passion City Church: more death-to-life moments than we have ever seen, the highest number of celebrations in baptism, and more discipleship offered through the different ministries of our House than we could have ever imagined. As we've grown, God has given us the grace to stretch our curtain wide. But, to keep stretching, we have a clear call to deepen our stakes and step into the life of Generosity God has called each of us to.\n—\nIf you'd like to participate in Above + Beyond, you can find more information at https://passioncitychurch.com/above-and-beyond/\n—\nFor a deeper study of God's Word, plus daily resources for your walk with Jesus, visit https://passionequip.com/.\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "description": "It is by faith we follow God and Abraham was a perfect example of this. Pastor Dan Watson walks us through Hebrews 11, showing us that Abraham understood the power of knowing God’s voice despite not being raised to know who God was. We can look to Abraham as a shining example that circumstances are not a reflection of God’s character and that we can prevent ourselves from losing sight on God’s goodness by looking back at all God has done in our lives. \n—\nIf you are interested in participating in Above + Beyond or looking for more information, check out the information here: https://passioncitychurch.com/above-and-beyond/\n—\nFor a deeper study of God's Word, plus daily resources for your walk with Jesus, visit https://passionequip.com/.\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "title": "Hand It Over - Jonathan Pickens",
    "description": "Jonathan Pickens delivers a powerful talk, pointing to three unique and unexpected examples from Scripture. There were three people (or groups) that \"handed over\" Jesus and His mission for the fleeting things of the world and we can learn from their mistake about the deception of our desires. Through Jesus, however, who handed Himself over for us, and by the power of the Spirit, we can walk faithfully without swerving from the truth.\n\nVERSES // John 1, John 6:71, John 12:4-5, John 18:2, John 8:15, John 30-35, John 19:30, Matthew 26:14, Matthew 27:18 \n—\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

As a kid, did you ever have a moment where you nearly scared your parents to death?\n2. Why did Jonathan share the story about his baby girl and her tendencies?\n3. What was the “price” for Judas? We know it was 30 pieces of silver but, beyond the monetary value, what was his “price” to hand Jesus over?\n4. What is the thing, desire, or longing that competes for your commitment to Jesus? What, if anything, could be your “price”?\n5. What was the price for the Jewish leaders of the day? What did they hand Jesus over in order to gain or keep?\n6. What was Pontius Pilate’s price?\n7. What are modern examples of the attitudes of Judas?\n8. What is a modern example of the attitude of the Jewish leaders?\n9. What is a modern example of the attitude of Pilate?\n10. Why did Pickens include Jesus in the list of people who handed Jesus over?",

When did you first hear about Passion City Church? What led you here? \n2. Unpack what Peterson shared about spending and income. He said, “Financial challenge is typically a spending issue, not an income issue.” What did he mean by this?\n3. How is money a “tool to be managed” rather than a lifeline to be loved? How would you explain this concept in your own words?\n4. Philippians 3 contains a passage about the Apostle Paul’s view of abundance. How would you describe how “gain” is “loss” in light of Jesus?\n5. Dukes reminds listeners that “Life doesn’t consist in the abundance of possessions” (Lk. 12:15). What are the things and experiences in life that lead us to forget this principle?\n6. Dukes shares an amazing thought, “We can’t control the economy but we can be good stewards of what God has entrusted to us.” What are some applications you can draw from this truth? What should we concern ourselves with and what should we not be anxious about?\n7. Peterson shares that it is his family’s intention to “Give in such a way that we need God to provide.” What does this approach look like and how might it help you gauge what true generosity is for your life?\n8. 2 Corinthians 8:2-5 is a powerful verse about the generosity of the early Church. Read it again together and answer this question: How did the churches of Macedonia give? What was their attitude?\n9. Dukes shared that it is the hope of Passion City that, while everyone gives, everyone also receives. What are all the things we receive when we live generously?\n10. Peterson closes the gathering by sharing this crucial truth: “God is a giver, not a taker, and we - as His people - are to be imitators of Him.” Take a moment as a group to pray for direction around what God is calling you to invest on Above + Beyond Sunday.",

How would you describe what “Above + Beyond” is to someone visiting Passion City Church?\n2. Why is it important to be a giver not out of obligation but out of inclination?\nIn your own words, describe the balance we are called to maintain, between “abusing grace” and being legalistic?\n3. How is laying aside ‘shame’ up to us? What does it mean that Jesus already did His part in dealing with our shame?\n4. What is your “view of you”? In other words, if you are honest, what do you think about yourself in your best and worst moments?\n5. Can you think of any passages in Scripture that specifically deal with the identity of people as followers of Jesus? In other words, what Scripture can we have on our minds to combat a “low view of self”?\n6. What is the right attitude to have in enjoying the things of life that don’t last - things “in this city”? \n7. In your own words, what should “The Shard” remind us of?\n8. Why is it that thinking about eternity helps us live generously?\n9. Scripture calls us to “present our requests to God” but it also calls us to seek God’s requests for ourselves (Eph. 5:17). Take a moment as a group to pray and ask God to speak to you during the Above + Beyond season.",

    "description": "Pastor Earl McClellan dropped into Passion City to encourage listeners around the story of Paul and Silas’ missionary journey to Philippi. McClellan speaks to all kinds of important truths, from the dynamic nature of God’s will and the importance of the ‘marketplace’ in ministry to the authority given to us and the opportunity to witness in the midst of suffering.\n\nVERSES // Acts 16:6-33\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

What’s a barrier or wall that showed up in your life that you later realized wasn’t “bad” and from the Enemy but actually from God?\n2. What is the significance of this ancient understanding; that ‘days’ actually began at night?\n3. What field or industry in your city can you think of that might be a part of God’s strategy to impact the world?\n4. How do you discern if someone is saying the right things with the wrong intent? To what extent is it your responsibility to evaluate someone’s motive?\n5. Why might God’s vision or dream for your life involve suffering? How can He still be loving if He allows pain? Try to answer in your own words.\n6. Can you think of any other people like Paul and Silas from Scripture - people who have as many battle scars in their stories as they have victories?\n7. What can we learn from Paul and Silas about how we should react in moments of suffering?\n8. What is significant about the fact that the other prisoners were “listening” to Paul and Silas?\n9. With all the craziness at Philippi, who was it that ended up receiving salvation? What made this possible?\n10. Of all the things Pastor Earl touched on, what reminder do you want to ensure sticks with you?",

What is your community timeline? In other words, how has your community been over the years? How is it now?\n2. Would you describe yourself as an avoider of conflict or a head-on kind of person?\n3. What was the point of Jesus’ comment on forgiveness, according to Matthew 18:21-22?\n4. What is the sin of the man in the parable about forgiveness and greed (Matt. 18:23-35)?\n5. How much greater was the debt the king forgave this man than the debt he would not forgive his servant? How does this help you understand the grace of God?\n6. What is the difference between “brushing something off” and offering Christlike grace to people?\n7. What do expectations have to do with forgiveness?\n8. How is the motivation of personal freedom not enough when it comes to the biblically-sound, genuine forgiveness God calls us to distribute?\n9. What is it about forgiveness that leads people to think that it means they must neglect justice?\n10. In your own words, how are forgiveness and justice two sides of the same coin?",

What is something you saw in the text that you had never “seen” before?\n8. Watson shared about the importance of getting away to spend time reading Scripture and praying. When you do this, what is it like from beginning to end?\n9. If you find yourself “maxed out” and without margin, what are the “Veggie Tales moments” of your day where God might speak to you through something unexpected?\n10.Take a moment as you close to pray for a couple specific moms around your lives. Do you know any widows, moms struggling with infertility, moms who have run from God, or mothers who are worn out? Pray for them (they might be in your group).",

    "description": "Pastor Louie challenges listeners by drawing attention to the 'dash' that represents our lives–the tiny mark on gravestones that properly represents the 'mist' of a life we live. Ironically, however, it is the brevity of life that reminds us how precious it is to live and how crucial it is to live for Jesus. \n\nVERSES // 2 Peter 3:8-15, Psalm 90:10-12, Psalm 39:4-5, James 4:13-17, Luke 12:14-21\n—\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "description": "Pastor Louie takes listeners further into a conversation about life and death by addressing the reality of the Great White Throne Judgment. The truth is that believers in Christ will face a post-salvation judgment of their works – not for the sake of admittance into the Kingdom and the presence of God but for the sake of reward. Those who invest in what is earthly will see all their treasure burn up as waste but those who live faithfully, having invested their resources and time into the Kingdom, will reap an eternal reward.\n\nVERSES // Revelation 20:11-15, 2 Corinthians 5:6-10, Hebrews 9:27, 1 Corinthians 2:10-15, 2 Corinthians 5:9-21, 2 Timothy 4:6-8\n—\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

How are good works simultaneously not how we are saved but also how we will be judged?\n6. How was Pastor Louie’s illustration about experiencing his father’s discipline “wrong” (his words)?\n7. If the Kingdom of Heaven has “levels” or “classes” to it, what kind of people will be in the “Upper Class”? Where do you anticipate you would reside if you died today? Would you be \"Upper Class,\" \"Lower Class,\" or somewhere in-between?\n8. What of the investments in your life will be “burned up” if you were to face the believer’s judgement today? Are all of the things that would be burned up “bad”? Take time to answer this. What is the difference between living a wasteful life of materialism and living an investment-minded life, “enjoying” things (1 Tim. 6:17)?\n9. What injustice are you sitting in today, big or small, that will be made right at the Great White Throne judgement?\n10. Explain in your own words how Christians are going to experience judgement and salvation simultaneously.",

    "description": "Easter Sunday is a powerful reminder of the gift we have in access to a holy God. Pastor Louie shares about “God’s terms” to highlight how undeserving we are and how gracious He is in desiring to be in relationship with us. Just as the high priest was—by mercy—able to stand alive in the presence of a holy God, we too have access by the blood of Jesus to a set-apart and glorious God.\n\nVERSES // Matthew 27:45-55, Matthew 28:5-7, Genesis 3:21-24, 2 Chronicles 3:14, Exodus 28, Hebrews 10:19-22, John 17:3\n—\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

Did anyone have any friends or family tag along with them to Easter? Did anything come from their being present?\n4. What was the significance of the first ‘cherubim’ mentioned in Scripture? What did the cherubim represent?\n5. What were the ‘terms’ after the Fall of Man (Gen. 3)?\n6. How is it that the ‘terms’ are still the same despite God making a “way” through Jesus’ death and resurrection?\n7. What is the difference between the Day of Atonement and Passover? Why is it significant that Jesus died at Passover?\n8. To what extent do we celebrate Easter every Sunday? What makes Easter different from a “standard” Sunday?\n9. Who is Eli Shukron and what did he find? What is the Gold Bell?\n10.What did the veil in the Temple represent? If the Temple stood today but properly represented the access Christians have to God, what would the Temple be like? What would worship in the Temple be like?",

If faithfulness is what kills the thief of dreams, how do you gain faithfulness?\n8. Do you have a dream for your life – something that seems like a God-inspired, God-glorifying state of existence for your life? In other words, is there something you have always sought to do – or be enabled to do - for the glory of God?\n9. What is standing in the way of the dream you have for your life? If you are already living in the dream God has for your life, what were the unexpected things that preceded it?\n10.If you feel stuck and you are unsure as to what God might be dreaming and envisioning for your life, allow the group to encourage you with what they see as a possibility for your life. Practically speaking, this looks like telling the people in the group where you see them being most impactful and God-glorifying with their story, gifts, and circumstances.",

    "description": "Inspired by Passion’s recent trip to the Holy Land, Pastor Louie shares a powerful talk on the \"road\" to revitalized dreams. The excavation of the “Pilgrim Road” drove Pastor Louie to share on the importance of God’s timing and His will to draw us into His presence. Under the ruin, the layers of dirt and decay lie a path toward freedom and a relationship with God. It is on this path and in His presence that we regain our ability to dream; to envision our unique life lived for the glory of God and the good of others.\n\nVERSES // Psalm 126, Acts 2:14-21, Isaiah 60:22, Joel 2:28-32\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

Try to recall what was the purpose of the “Southern Steps.” How could the concept of the ‘Ascent’ be replicated today when it comes to meeting with God publicly and privately?\n6. What is powerful about archaeological excavation? Pastor Louie alludes to the importance of “giving God time.” What is his point in sharing this?\n7. Does anyone know of any other faith-affirming archaeological excavations?\n8. Read Psalm 126:5-6. When was the last time you cried and what was it that led you to cry?\n9. Has God ever used the sowing of your tears to reap a harvest? Share that story with your group.\n10.What is the ‘step’ God may be calling you to take right now – to make progress on the pilgrim’s road?",

What resources do you know of (scholars, books, talks, podcasts, etc.) that deal with the topic of apologetics? Are there any you know you can direct people to if they want to learn?\n3. What can we learn from the life and thinking of John the Baptist when it comes to the topic of Skepticism?\n4. Why is it that Strobel calls prayer “the best place to start” in evangelism?\n5. Let’s answer Strobel’s question. If Jesus met you and answered every prayer you prayed in the past week, what prayers would be answered?\n6. Who is the person you have ceased praying for or wavered in praying for? Try to name the person who has often slipped your mind.\n7. Aside from the three points Strobel made, how would Jesus conduct Himself if He lived among us today? How would He act at the grocery store? How would He act at the gym? How would He act at church on Sunday?\n8. What are a couple questions you have about the faith, theology, Scripture, or Apologetics, that you have not sought answers for? What could you begin to investigate? Starting your investigation by presenting that question to the group.\n9. What is the concept behind ‘Ricochet Evangelism’? Do you have any similar stories like the one Strobel shared?\n10.Who are the people that came to your mind during Strobel’s talk? Share those names and plan to keep the group updated on the opportunities God gives you to point them to Jesus.",

    "description": "To close out a powerful collection of talks on the enemy and the weight of anxiety, Pastor Louie leads listeners in a response; to declare Jesus over our circumstances and join in prayer with those who are in the pit of their struggle with anxiety. He shares four crucial words to respond as followers of Jesus to the pressure that comes with our anxious thoughts: Humble, Cast, Lift, and Care. By walking through the process embedded in these words and in this Scripture, we respond as God intended us to respond to fear, depression, and anxiety.\n\nVERSES // 1 Peter 5:6-7\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

What does society point toward to relieve stress and anxiety? Take a quick second to pull out your phones and research what the experts of the day are suggesting.\n2. Of all that is recommended on the internet, what advice can you parallel with the Word of God? In other words, are there any passages in Scripture that suggest something similar to what psychologists and therapists are suggesting?\n3. How do you “Humble yourself”? What practical things can you do to contribute to making yourself a humble person before God?\n4. As a group, try to name 10 experiences that are humbling in nature. To help think of things, try to answer this question ten times: “What is something that makes you feel small, life feel short, or God seem great?”\n5. If anxiety were a physical object, it would be simple to “cast” it but what does it mean to “cast” something nonphysical, like anxiety?\n6. What are practical things you can do to cast anxiety on God (Hint: 1 Pet. 5:1-5; 8-11)? If something you think of seems obvious, still share it with the group because it may be informative to someone else.\n7. Pastor Louie asked the people of our House to raise their hands if they ever had a moment in their life where they “felt like they were actually going crazy.” If you had that moment in your life and you feel comfortable, share as much of the context around that time as you would like to share.\n8. Many people struggle to relate to people facing anxiety and depression. If this is you, and you cannot name a time where you dealt with all that intense an anxiety, what are some of the practices in your life that may contribute to your having a relatively “sound” mind?\n9. If you think you are “sound” in mind, what is your plan to stay “watchful” (1 Pet. 5:8)?\n10.What anxieties are you dealing with currently? If you feel comfortable to share, bring them to the group so someone in the group can pray over your situation. End by praying for each other.",

How do you answer the question, “To what extent do you rely on a doctor when it comes to the need for healing?”? \n2.

What are your thoughts on the article, “The Surprising Joy of Raising Your Gaze”? Were you surprised to hear about these results? \n4. What might physiological and psychological discoveries like these suggest about our faith and the instruction in Scripture? \n5. This may be strange to do as a group – and you will need to do this when it’s dark outside - so feel free to skip this step. Take 10 minutes of group time to get up, go outside, “look up” and find the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, and NorthStar.\n6. Let’s talk about the process toward lifting our gaze. What will you think of when you choose to “remember the narrative we are in”? \nPastor Louie mentioned listening to “Speak Jesus” about 1,000 times during a difficult season. 7. Do you have a season like this? Do you have a song of praise you played through it? \n8. What does it mean to “exercise your right to hope in God”? \n9. Where does your “help come from” in times of need? The biblical answer is “The LORD” but try to unpack just how “the LORD” helps you (Ps. 121:1). For instance, did He use a doctor or therapist? \n\n**If your group has reached a place of transparency, ask this final question.\n\n10. Where has “help come from” that was not a healthy source? In other words, who/what have you turned to for help—in the past or recently—that you should not have turned to?",

Pastor Louie began his talk by mentioning the culture in 1st Century Greece. He said something about how the people of the day valued spirit but not body. Retell this fact and its cultural implications. Can you remember this from history class?\n2. How is the first implication both good AND bad news?\n3. What does it mean to “stop trying” to be good enough for God? What changes when we go from trying to not trying, our actions? Motives? Beliefs?\n4. How is the Gospel something a person “stands on”? What does it typically take for someone to go from seeing the Gospel as something you make a decision about once to being something you “stand on”?\n5. How do you answer the question, “How do you know that you are saved?”?\n6. What do verses 10+11 mean? What is the purpose of ‘grace’ after getting saved? This may be tricky so be encouraged to wrestle with this together.\n7. Why does the Gospel “release you from the grip of religion”?\n8. What popular thinking habits do we let go of because of our priorities?\n9. Who are the lost people you are praying for? How can you take a step toward sharing with them?\n10.Pastor Louie says there are 100 ways to pass on the message of the Gospel. What ways have you “passed on the message” before?",

Our distractions move toward devotion through a vehicle called ‘Discipline’.\n\nVERSES // Luke 10:38-43\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

Pastor Grant started the talk off with a story about hospitality. How is your hospitality this year? What are some hospitality aspirations/dreams/goals you have for your life?\n2. Read back through Luke 10:38-43. Pause for a moment and have someone in the group pray that God will use this text to continue to impact the lives of the people in your group.\n3. What all does it mean and represent to be “at the feet of Jesus”?\n4. What was at the root of Martha’s mistake?\n5. Do you have a story from a time where you were distracted from what is best by something that is good?\n6. Pastor Grant shared about the Mood that is being used in the original Greek verb, “to do.” He went on to suggest that we should never use the ‘imperative’ Mood when speaking to God. What is the “Imperative Mood” and why should we not use it with God? When might be a time where it would be acceptable to use this Mood in speaking to God?\n7. Why did Jesus use Martha’s name twice? What was likely the meaning in this repetition?\n8. Pastor Grant asked a convicting question that requires a little more transparency than normal. Let’s answer it together: “Is there anything in you that is distracting you from what matters most?”\n9. When does serving and working for Jesus lose its meaning? In other words, at what point does it become distracting?\n10.Pastor Grant urged our House to ask and answer this question: “What are you most committed to in life?” Did you write anything down or can you answer if there is something from your daily schedule you need to “start doing,” “stop doing,” or “start doing differently”?",

What are your gifts and how do you intend to use them this year? In what ways will they contribute to your requirements and desires?\n5. Have you ever experienced the overlap of these three areas of your life? What was that like?\n6. What are your primary concerns this month? What continues to come up, interrupting your sleep, work, and life?\n7. What did you learn from Ephesians 2, Colossians 3 and your “current spiritual position”? Is this difficult to wrap your mind around? If so, why?\n8. What for you is getting in that “middle space” – where all three of these categories (requirements, desires, and purpose) overlap?\n9. How do you “find your Father”? Do you “find Him” before everything else you find in the day? How do you start your typical morning?\n10.When was the last time you asked God in the mundane to use you supernaturally? Take a moment now to ask God to remind you in the “natural” moments to think, pray, and ask for the supernatural.",

    "description": "Pastor Brad Jones took our House into our final talk before Christmas Eve by highlighting the theological significance of Jesus’ arrival: When Jesus came, grace came. This reality was of massive significance to a people steeped in religiosity. As people who have received grace, we are now to grow in grace - toward others and ourselves.\n\nVERSES // John 1:14, John 1:1-5, John 1:18, John 1:36-42, 2 Peter 3:18\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God #grace \n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

Who is the most famous person to come to your hometown? If you are from a big town, who is the most famous person you have run into in public?\n2. Why was it a big deal for grace to come? What was the religious context behind Jesus’ birth?\n3. Pastor Brad briefly shared the answer to this important question: What is the best way to tell what God is like?\n4. What is God’s posture toward us, according to Pastor Brad? How is this different from how other faiths portray their gods?\n5. What was your upbringing like when it comes to the subject of grace? Was your household full of grace or was it a graceless place?\n6. In your own words, what does it mean to “grow in grace”?\n7. When Paul sought to have the “thorn” in his flesh removed, Scripture reveals that it was ‘grace’ that Paul needed. Why was it that sufficient grace was what Paul needed in his struggle?\n8. Pastor Brad urges our House to be a people who point others toward grace. If you were to evaluate your character, would you say you tend to lean more toward being a gracious person or a graceless person? How\nso?\n9. If your eagerness to point people to Jesus is a good indicator of your humility and your heart’s purity, then what does your current outlook say about your heart?\n10. How would you describe your current role in the Kingdom of God? Do you ever envy another role – someone at work? At church?",

    "description": "Pastor Louie leads our House into the Advent season by highlighting the miraculous birth of Jesus, through Mary, the “blessed and highly favored” mother of Jesus and instrument for God’s grace-filled work. Pastor Louie directs followers of Jesus to sit long enough under the “flow” of God’s grace to be moved to worship and reciprocate the same great blessing.\n\nVERSES // Luke 1:26-80\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

Pastor Louie reminds us that we are all in “waiting periods,” as a result of the way God works to build our faith. What was the longest “waiting period” you have experienced?\n2. What was Mary’s response to the angel Gabriel compared to Zechariah’s response? You may have to read back through the stories to compare the two figures.\n3. Why did the baby (John the Baptist) leap in the womb? There is not a clear answer in Scripture but that does not mean we cannot postulate!\n4. What is the context behind Mary’s comments about ‘Abraham’? Can anyone explain Mary’s thinking?\n5. Pastor Louie says Mary, the mother of Jesus, “chose the side of faith” in speaking about her response to the angel Gabriel. What does it mean to “choose the side of faith”? What did it mean for Mary?\n6. What are you currently waiting for in life?\n7. How might God be using what you are currently “waiting for” to grow your faith?\n8. What did you learn from Mary’s life as she serves as an example for followers of Jesus today?\n9. Pastor Louie says that an emphasis on God’s grace results in worship. Why does an emphasis on and awareness of grace and mercy lead to worship?\n10. If appreciation for God’s  grace  leads us to worship, then how do you increase your appreciation for grace? Is there anyone that found something helpful or eye-opening in regard to this appreciation?",

Pastor Grant shares stories of his daughters and, in paralleling them to the story of Adam and Eve, he points to the reality that humans tend to run when they are ashamed. Why do you think it is ingrained in people to run in these instances?\n2. Pastor Grant shares, “Grace cannot be lost but it can be forgotten.” What was his instruction to listeners in bringing up this point?\n3. What is the difference between grace and shame, in your own words?\n4. Is guilt a bad thing? Why or why not? Is shame bad? Why or why not?\n5. Pastor Grant uses judiciary imagery to help explain ‘Justification.’ What happens with our evidence in the courtroom scene of God? What evidence are we judged on, if we are in Christ?\n6. Read Romans 8:1-4. What clause most powerfully impacts you? Why?\n7. In your own words, how was it possible for Jesus to take away sins? What qualified Him?\n8. What did Pastor Grant mean in saying, “God did not pardon you”? What is the difference between being ‘acquitted’ and being ‘pardoned’?\n9. How do you “Agree with God”? What stands in the way of “Agreement”?\n10. Which of the different applications were most impactful and why?",

    "description": "Pastor Louie wraps up our current collection of talks, SHIFT, focusing on how you pray. When we pray, he encourages us to make it personal, lead with praise, ask for alignment, tell Him our needs, clear the air, acquaint ourselves with His word, embrace the silence, and have a heart of gratitude.\n\nVERSES // John 5:19, John 8:38, 1 Thessalonians 5:18,24, Psalm 46\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

How personal do you get in your prayers?\n2. What are some of the first things that come to mind when it comes to ‘praising\nGod’ in prayer? What do you speak to God when you decide to praise Him?\n3. Pastor Louie has taken a great deal of time in this collection of talks to urge our House to align with God’s plans. What have you learned about lining yourself up with God’s initiative from these talks on prayer?\n4. What are some of the biggest things you ask of God? What are some of the smallest things you ask of Him?\n5. What does it mean to “clear the air” with God – in your own words?\n6. What was the idea behind the misnomer of a ‘Prayer Life’? How should the Word inform how you speak to God?\n7. What does it mean to “come in hot” in prayer? When are you most guilty of this?\n8. What are three of the most common things you thank God for?\n9. What are three uncommon things you could thank God for, right now?\n10. Pastor Louie shares that prayer is not formulaic; we should not all be praying the same prayer nor should we individually be praying the same prayer all the time. Should you be sitting in silence? Speaking more praises? Giving actual thanks? What is – or should be - your prayer in your current season?",

    "description": "Pastor Brad closes out our ‘Open House’ collection of talks by urging us to live our lives set apart and as a response to the goodness of God toward us. His talk reminds us that our lives—though seemingly ordinary—can be available and used to impact the world, by the grace of God.\n\nBecoming an Influencer - Brad Jones\n\nVERSES // Romans 1:16-17,12:1-21\n\nDiscussion Questions //\n\nPastor Brad begins the talk by sharing about the potential we hold as “ordinary\" people. What \"ordinary” person have you seen do something incredibly impactful?\n\nPastor Brad says 'pride’ is the greatest threat to our church. What does he mean by this?\n\nWhere are you most prideful? In other words, when do you feel the need to exalt your own reputation?\n\nIf you can identify instances where you are prideful, can you identify the source of your pride? What is the reason or the insecurity behind your prideful action?\n\nMaybe you are having a hard time seeing your actions as prideful. How about starting with this question: When was the last time you subtly bragged or quietly boasted in something about yourself?\n\nPastor Brad urges our House to live humbly because humility is attractive to others and it leads to influence. How do you practice humility?\nP\nastor Brad shares, “Honor is INexpensive” and “Jealousy is expensive.” What does he mean by this?\n\nPastor Brad encourages our House to be hope-filled people because it stands out to others. Living with hope is one of the most difficult things we do because it is always paired with hardship. When was the last time you had to focus intently on the hope we have as followers of Jesus? \n\nWhat were you facing in that valley of life?\n\nWhat stands out from Pastor Brads talk? What did you need to be reminded of?\n\nReread the Scripture Pastor Brad references. What did you need to be reminded of in these texts?\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "description": "This past Sunday, Pastor Louie was back with a message about the return that comes with kingdom investment. When we sow into the Kingdom of heaven, we invest in an initiative that reaps unquantifiable return. As we were able to bless numerous organizations through Above + Beyond, He reminds us that our gifts are now launched into the atmosphere and used for kingdom purposes.\n\nWhat God Does When We Let Go - Louie Giglio\n\nVERSES // Matthew 5:14-16,16:24-25, Exodus 2:1-10\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

Pastor Louie talked about MECO, a term astronauts use. What was the idea behind this analogy?\n2. In Matthew 16:24-27 Jesus talks about the danger of “gaining the world.” What does it look like in our day and age to “gain the world”? Is it wrong to “gain the world”? Why or why not?\n3. Pastor Louie pointed out the biblical reality; that when we “release,” miracles, deliverance, provision, and salvation happens. To what extent are these things guaranteed in this life, when we “release”? To what extent are they going to be rewarded in heaven? Talk about this answer with humility, because there is a great deal of mystery in thinking about God’s sovereignty.\n4. What should be our expectation when we give from the resources God has entrusted to us?\n5. What should be our response when we give but do not get?\n6. What was your reaction to seeing the videos of these organizations receiving your gifts? Explain what you felt, desired, were encouraged by, and imagined.\n7. Pastor Louie shared the example of Jochebed. What caught your attention or was new about this story? For instance, had you ever thought much about Jochebed?\n8. One of the calls Pastor Louie gave to our House was to consider further involvement in the organizations we support (Operation Mobilization, Friends of Refugess, etc.). Have any of you ever served with any of these organizations or a similar organization? Share your experience!\n9. Pastor Louie read Jesus’ words; that you should “store up for yourselves treasures in heaven (Matt. 5:16).” What do you think heavenly treasure consists of?",

    "description": "Pastor Grant brought our House back from Sabbath by introducing a new collection of talks, ‘Open House.’ Sharing from Matthew 5:13-16, Grant reiterates that we are here to be a preservative to the goodness that was modeled by Jesus and reflectors of the marvelous light of God. So, we seek reconciliation, not retaliation. We resist greed through generosity. And finally, we submit to authority rather than rebelling against it.\n\nSalt + Light - Grant Patrick\n\nVERSES // Matthew 5:13-16,5:44-48, Genesis 1:3, James 1:17, John 8:12,9:5, 2 Corinthians 4:6, 1 Peter 2:9,3:5, Ephesians 5:8, Hebrews 10:24-25\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

What comes to mind when you hear that there is a call to be generous “with your life”?\n2. What was Jesus’ purpose in sharing a metaphor about salt? What does it mean to be ‘salt’ of the earth?\n3. Why did Jesus share the metaphor about light? What does it mean to be ‘light’ in the world?\n4. Do you have a person from your past that comes to mind in thinking about what it looks like to embody these metaphors?\n5. What do you sense or know is your contribution in conversations? Are you known as a negative person? What is your tendency?\n6. How is it simultaneously true that Jesus is the light of the world and we – the Church – are the light of the world?\n7. Pastor Grant urged us to be people who live as reconcilers. What does this look like and what about reconciliation makes it one of the most difficult things a Christian is called to do?\n8. What does it look like, practically, to “hide a lamp under a basket”?\n9. Pastor Grant shared about the Greek word for ‘light’ – ‘Photos’. What was his analogy about in comparing himself with his dad?\n10. Pastor Grant shared about doing things that make you ‘brighter.’ What is something you need to do to live more brightly?\n11. Is there a person in your life with whom you want to reconcile things? This may be a really difficult step but if you feel the conviction, it might be worth sharing it with the group.\n12. What are the character traits of the people of God, according to Matthew 5?",

    "description": "AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 3, 2023\n\nPastor Brad and Pastor Grant join us as they come around the meaning of Sabbath and why our House is committing to rest. As we observe the Sabbath this year, we are taking these two Sundays to stop, rest, and remember what God has done. We realize the idea of NOT MEETING is a little crazy on the surface, but we are guided by a deeper spiritual belief that God intended to weave Sabbath rest into the fabric of creation. We believe that as we cease from our efforts and celebrate again that God is the source of all we have and need, we will experience renewed strength and vision as a House.\n\nTo find out more about Sabbath at Passion City Church, visit https://passioncitychurch.com/sabbath/.\n\nMusicBed ID: MB01V3LKJVHA52U\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "description": "Launching into Above + Beyond Sunday, we're reminded of the legacy that we each leave behind for generations to come. Looking back to Apollo 11, we see how the first flight in 1903 paved the way for Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong to leave their footprints on the moon. Fast forward a few years, and we are met with the personal story of the Nobles family—the faith of a woman in our House leading to the faith of her daughter-in-law, leading to her grandkids being raised in a home filled with faith. Faith leaves a legacy.\n\n#faith  #christian #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "description": "This is Above + Beyond Sunday–a day where our House gives above our normal giving so that we can go beyond where we normally go. In this talk from Pastor Louie, the invitation–to step into the investment that reaps an exponential return–is extended. This is invitation is about more than what is monetary. It is about surrendering to Jesus and placing our everything in His hands.\n\nVERSES // Romans 7:21-25,8:1-2, Colossians 3:1-4, Mark 12:42-44\n\n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #God\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

What stood out from the Nobles’ story? Do you relate with any of the components in Sarah, Bryson, Janelle, or Michael’s testimony?\n2. Pastor Louie taught, “We are working to overcome something greater, another law, the law of sin and death” in highlighting the Law of Gravity. Read Romans 7 together and discuss this idea. What is the \"law of sin and death\" in your own words?\n3. What excites you about the future of the Church? What excites you about the future of Passion City Church?\n4. Which of the Partners mentioned in the talk interest you and why (God Behind Bars, Operation Mobilization, Convoy of Hope, etc.)?\n5. The video that set up the talk spoke about ‘legacy.’ What comes to mind when you think about your legacy? Are you dissatisfied with what will be your legacy? If not, what are you planning for your future?\n6. Pastor Louie shared about the concept of exponential growth. What was the point of the Bank of America Plaza analogy? What did it make you think about in regards to investing your life in what matters most?\n7. Why is the Gospel a story about generosity?\n8. Does generosity feel like an obligation to you? If so, why? Does it feel like an inclination for you? If so, then when and why did the shift happen for you – from obligation to inclination?",

    "description": "In this talk leading up to Above + Beyond Sunday, Pastor Louie sits down with financial expert, Allison Dukes, to have a conversation about the biblical view and understanding of finances. God wants us to simultaneously live wisely with the resources He has entrusted to us all the while being open-handed and entirely trusting of the One who oversees and allocates every resource. \n\nFind out more about Above + Beyond by visiting https://passioncitychurch.com/above-and-beyond.\n \n#faith #christian #sermon #passioncity #passioncityatlanta #atlanta #passioncitychurch #atlantachurch #christianity #Jesus #god \n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

What previously came to mind about the topic of money and finances before this message?\n2. Let’s answer the same question Allison Dukes answered. Pastor Louie asked, “How was the Kingdom informed your view of the macro ‘global’ economy?” How would you answer this question?\n3. Dukes talked about her note in her desk, “Give more than you get, leave more than you take.” How does this 1 Corinthians 4:7 mentality inform not just your finances but everything you do?\n4. Go around the room and share your thinking in moments of generosity. Think specifically. What is it that you think about when you make a generous decision?\n5. What are your Generosity Goals in life? In other words, what do you dream of being able to give? What organizations, people, or initiatives would you be honored to bless?\n6. Allison Dukes spoke into the subject of the “love of money” and it would help to recall her wisdom in answering the following question (1 Tim. 6:10). What is the difference between “desiring to be rich,” like the Scriptures teach and desiring to be successful – which is a biblically grounded and God-honoring desire (1 Tim. 6:9)?\n7. Allison Dukes said that everything we have is meant to “pass through.” What did she mean in saying this?\n8. While you might not consider yourself “rich,” the odds are that, if you watched this message, you are living as one of the wealthiest people on the planet. It takes a perspective-shift to grasp that reality. Read 1 Timothy 6:17-19 and talk about how this text reinforces what was shared in the conversation between Pastor Louie and Allison Dukes. Regardless of your financial situation, what is the instruction for followers of Jesus that comes from this text?\n9. What thoughts and questions are you wrestling with in responding to the conversation you heard between Pastor Louie and Allison Dukes?",

    "description": "Fight Night happened for the men of our city on Thursday, March 31st at our 515 Location. This was a night to hang out and gather with other guys in Atlanta as we talked about fighting FOR your brother.\n\nLearn more about Fight Clubs at https://passioncitychurch.com/fightclub\n\n—\n\n\"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\"\n-African Proverb\n\nAs men dedicated to living a life that not only starts well but finishes well, longevity can be a daunting or impossible task. Who could stand the test of time? How many men who stood for Godliness eventually succumb to the ways of living that Proverbs describes as clearly leading to demise? Research enough of these tragedies, or experience them yourself, and here is what you will find: lonely men, lacking Christ-centered community, are likely targets for deceit.\n\nThe truth is this, friendships can be challenging to establish and hard to maintain. They require vulnerability and a willingness, to be honest about your needs, desires, and worries. The level of intimacy necessary to spur one another on in faithful pursuit of a wisdom-filled life is even more so. That's why at Passion City Church we have Fight Clubs. \n\nA Fight Club, in simple terms, is an accountability group of 3-5 men—a place where friendship and encouragement is met with regular accountability that helps us stay focused on our goals and avoid the pitfalls that can easily sink our hopes. At its heart is not a Bible Study or discipleship group (although you will most likely talk about the Scripture often), but it is a group of men who share a similar season of life and meet consistently to help each other win the fight.\n\n—\n\n#fightclub #men #brotherhood #passioncity #passioncitychurch #christian \n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 9:30a and 11:45a, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 7p!

    "description": "Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.\n1 Peter 2: 11-17\n—\nThis week, Pastor Louie Giglio walks with us through one of the important ideas in scripture: all of us who call ourselves Christians are on display, living among the lost, and most of us are the only representation of the Gospel that the people in our worlds will ever see. So how are we living that out?

He is our rock, our living stone. \n\nThis is good news because standing on a living rock means we are never alone. He is in the fire with us. And while Jesus is with us in the trials, guess who is watching Him work… the whole world. \n\n—\nGive towards what God is doing through Passion City Church: https://passioncitychurch.com/give-online\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 10a and 1p, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 3p!

    "description": "The story of our House is a Jesus-centered one. It is a story of grace and redemption, of prayer, petition, and provision. Through it all, every heart that has come alive, every need fulfilled, every challenge overcome, Jesus has been weaving together a family of believers built on the goodness of His Gospel and the dedication of His people. The stunning truth is that this story is but a glimpse of God's love for his people, and so we celebrate. This is not just the end of a three-year arc; it is the beginning of the next chapter of our House. Written by the God of immeasurably more, through the generosity of His children, this is ABOVE + BEYOND.\n—\nBe a part of ABOVE + BEYOND at Passion City Church: https://passioncitychurch.com/abovean...\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 10a and 1p, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 3p!

    "description": "Almost nothing is guaranteed, except for two things:\n\nLife is Hard. God is Good.\n\nThat’s it; those are the two guarantees we’re walking away with today. The first one, life is hard, no one ever really had to teach us. The second one is a whole different story. \n\nGod is good… all the time.\n\nSo what happens when that truth faces off against real life? What happens when we are confronted with the truth that the story of Jesus-followers is a story of hardship? How do we reconcile the mountain of victory we’re standing on with the hardship the story of our spiritual lineage holds?\n\nWe embrace it and we look at the life of Paul.\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 10a and 1p, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 3p!

    "description": "These days are hard. They aren’t what we planned, and there’s no end in sight. So how are we supposed to not only live through these days but to live well in the midst of them?\n\nThe answer can be found in the book of Hebrews.\n\nBut recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, (you came out of the blocks strong!) sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. \nHebrews 10:32-36\n\nEndurance, we need endurance.\n\nHere’s the good news. You can have it. \n\nSo how do we gain the endurance we are going to need in order not only to endure the days ahead but to excel in them?\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 10a and 1p, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 3p!

Our searching for God gives Him another chance to put His Glory and His overarching story on display. \n\nBesides, this is hardly a new question. \nOverwhelming? Yes. \nOriginal?

    "description": "What the world needs most today, what our cities and communities need most today, what we all need most today is a spiritual awakening. Here’s the good news. \n\nIt’s possible. \n\nRight now, God is closer to you than you think. \n\nHow close?\n\nTwenty inches. Twenty inches is all that separates you from, “then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” \n\nIt’s the twenty inches between your knees and the ground. It’s assuming a position of kneeling before the mighty God and admitting that you need help. Twenty inches to go from death to life. Twenty inches that change your story from, “I was a victim of circumstance,” to, “I found Jesus, and He stood me up victorious.”\n\nGod is closer than you imagine today, and He’s calling you. Will you answer?\n\n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 10a and 1p, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 3p!

    "description": "\"We have never seen anything like this.\" \n\nHow many times have you heard that this week? We're living in unprecedented times to be sure, but are we on our own? Whenever faced with times of uncertainty, doesn't it feel like we hear people taking one of two stances? Either we believe that our hope and confidence is in a sovereign God who always has and will always have a plan for our good and His Glory, or we can believe that in one way or another faith in God is simply a crutch to lean on when we aren't strong enough to face what is right in front of us. \n\nBut Christianity is not a crutch. \n—\nThis week Pastor Louie Giglio brings a message that is timely to the days we are living in. Teaching out of Mark 2:1-12 Pastor Louie reminds us of a few critical things:\n\n1. Our faith can move the heart of God and impact the eternal destiny of someone around us.\n2. The paralyzed man's problem was bigger than he thought.\n3. Jesus didn't offer a crutch. He healed him. \n—\nWith Passion City Online, you can join us every Sunday live at 10a and 1p, and our gatherings are available on-demand starting at 3p!

    "description": "You can live in freedom.\n—\nThoughts that go unchecked long enough in our minds cause us to stumble and sin against God. It’s the enemy’s plan to let these thoughts fester and grow. However, we must remember that the work of Jesus is FINISHED. Not only has Jesus established a beachhead for us to launch into #Victory—he has provided us with blueprints of the enemy’s plans. In the power of the Holy Spirit and the knowledge of how the enemy operates, we defend our thoughts and break the cycle of sin and temptation! Join us next week as we dive into practical steps to defend ourselves against the enemy.⁣\n⁣\nTo beat the enemy’s plan, it helps to know his thoughts. Look at the seven steps below that lead to the spiral of sin and temptation so that you can fight the enemy.⁣\n⁣\n1. A temptation from the enemy enters our minds.⁣\n2. We act on that temptation and we sin.⁣\n3. There is usually momentary pleasure.⁣\n4. We discover sin’s hook.⁣\n5. We are met by feelings of frustration guilt and shame.⁣\n6. The enemy shifts to a new tactic - condemnation.⁣\n7. We find ourselves vulnerable, weak, isolated, empty and longing.⁣\n—\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/passioncitychurch1\n\nAt Passion City Church we believe that because God has displayed the ultimate sacrifice in Jesus, our response to that in worship must be extravagant.

    "title": "Winning the Battle of the Mind - Louie Giglio",
    "description": "“I’m going to win the battle of my mind because I have the power of the finished work of Jesus. I’m standing on victory and I’m going to move from that victory.” ⁣\n- Louie Giglio\n—\nWe can all relate to the feeling of having to contend for our thoughts, that's why this truth was so encouraging: Jesus has given us victory at The Cross, and through the power of the Holy Spirit the ability take every thought captive for his glory in the fight towards winning the battle of the mind.\n\nRemember, when Jesus died and rose on the third day, he rose to glorious and victorious life both now and forever. When He did, he gave this life to anyone who will put their trust in Him. \n\nThe battle in our minds is real; it's not something we can push away or ignore. We need to arm ourselves with Paul's reminder in 2 Corinthians 10:5, \"We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.\" \n\nThis week, Pastor Louie left us with a  practical challenge. To exercise authority over our thoughts with these five steps: \n \n1. Examine it. Question it. Where did it come from? Does it match up with God's Word?\n\n2. Bind that thought before it binds you. Negative, tempting, or fearful thoughts will capture us if we don't take ahold of them first, rooted in the Word to know what God says about them. Let the Scripture sink in your heart and head so that the enemy can't short-circuit your calling or steal your purpose.\n\n3. Change the narrative. Don't merely bind the bad but begin to think about whatever is pure and good and lovely and praiseworthy (Phil 4:8) and write a new story.\n\n4. Act on that truth.\n\n5. Repeat. What is the thought that is binding you today? Examine it, bind it, and speak the truth in its place and begin walking in victory, the νικος of Christ!\n—\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/passioncitychurch1\n\nAt Passion City Church we believe that because God has displayed the ultimate sacrifice in Jesus, our response to that in worship must be extravagant.

    "description": "In this week's closing talk from our EXTRAVAGANT series, Pastor Louie Giglio shares a message that's for everyone. We have an invitation today—God is seeking worshippers!\n\nLove is what produces worship. The Church owes it to the world to present a decent representation of the person and finished work of Jesus as we gather to worship. Jesus' sacrifice of love for us in the form of radical grace, triggers our echo of extravagant worship to Him! Glory, grace, worship.\n\n1. Has the love and grace of God reached you?\n2. Worship is about the heart that has been captured by God.\n3. There is balance in the House.\n4. Grace has opened the way (this isn't law), but your response to the grace of God may unlock a door for you that takes you into a dimension with God that you haven't even imagined existed.\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT4...\n\nAt Passion City Church we believe that because God has displayed the ultimate sacrifice in Jesus, our response to that in worship must be extravagant.

Will your life be marked by an indecisive mind or an undivided heart?\n\nWith as many as two billion people around the world having never heard the name of Jesus, Pastor David Platt asks us to think about what it is each of us is called to do to proclaim the Good News in our lives. \n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT4...\n\nSee other series from Passion City Church:\nYES - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQAtaxLBfyw&list=PLTKWB5pdvklwKITYarjqP_f-BJhFF2CN7\nThe God You Can Know -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHnT...\n\nFollow @passioncity: https://www.instagram.com/passioncity/\nFollow @louiegiglio: https://www.instagram.com/louiegiglio/\n\nPassion City Church is a Jesus church with locations in Atlanta and Washington D.C.  \nMore info on Passion: https://passioncitychurch.com",

    "description": "Fatherhood matters. It matters to God, and it matters to us. So many of us are growing up fatherless, whether it’s because of illness, absence, or attitude. We carry these wounds with us for the rest of our lives, and even if don’t mean to we attach those same feelings to our relationship with our Heavenly Father. But God is not a reflection of our Earthly father, He is the perfection of him. In this kick-off message to our new series, Not Forsaken, Pastor Louie Giglio reminds us of who we are; loved sons and daughters of a perfect father. \n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Louie Giglio and Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT4...\n\nIn Not Forsaken, Pastor Louie Giglio invites us to understand the character of God in a life-changing way: as a perfect Father who wants you to live under the waterfall of His blessing. You see, God is not the bigger version of your earthly dad, He’s the perfect version of your earthly dad. And He’s inviting you to walk in freedom as His loved son or daughter.\n\nPreorder Pastor Louie’s book, Not Forsaken : https://notforsakenbook.com \n\nSee other series from Passion City Church:\nYES - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQAtaxLBfyw&list=PLTKWB5pdvklwKITYarjqP_f-BJhFF2CN7\nThe God You Can Know -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHnT...\n\nFollow @passioncity: https://www.instagram.com/passioncity/\nFollow @louiegiglio: https://www.instagram.com/louiegiglio/\n\nPassion City Church is a Jesus church with locations in Atlanta and Washington D.C.  \nMore info on Passion: https://passioncitychurch.com",

    "title": "From the Inside Out - Louie Giglio",
    "description": "Friday night and Sunday morning. The account of all that happened that weekend adds up to one truth; that when Jesus died, was buried, and rose, people put their faith in Him. Jesus knew that we were both spirit and flesh, and just as our flesh will fade, sin will lead to the death of our spirit. This is why Jesus did what He did. It’s why He gave His life on a cross, why he gave up His last breath, and why early Sunday morning the stone was rolled away from His grave; not so that He could come out, but so that we could come in and see what God had done.\n\nSee the spoken word piece from Easter Morning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzwCdWxCUao\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Louie Giglio and Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT4...\n\nSee other series from Passion City Church:\nYES - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQAtaxLBfyw&list=PLTKWB5pdvklwKITYarjqP_f-BJhFF2CN7\nThe God You Can Know -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngHnT...\n\nFollow @passioncity: https://www.instagram.com/passioncity/\nFollow @louiegiglio: https://www.instagram.com/louiegiglio/\n\nPassion City Church is a Jesus church with locations in Atlanta and Washington D.C.  \nMore info on Passion: https://passioncitychurch.com",

    "description": "Leading into Holy Week, Grant Partrick reminds us of the ultimate “yes,” that Christ gave in the Garden of Gethsemane. Faced with death, and even worse, separation from His Father for the first time in history, Jesus looked at what was in front of Him and said, “Not my will, but Yours.” Our obedience is measured in the same way. How do we respond to God when our desires come to an intersection with His? What will our response be when faced with a circumstance where what we want isn’t God’s will for our lives? Will we make the same decision Jesus did, will we say to God, “Not my will, but Yours?”\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Louie Giglio and Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT4...\n\nWhat is your most valuable possession?

In fact, in certain situations our best \"yes,\" can actually be a, \"no.\" So why is it so difficult to say, \"no?\" Why is it so difficult to shut down the things that are asking for our attention when they have no right to, and how can we learn to say \"no,\" at the right moments and in the right situations?

As a corrupt tax collector, Zacchaeus was an outsider, someone the people of his town believed would be the absolute last person Jesus would address. Yet, because of his faith and desire to see Jesus, his faith and perseverance were rewarded. We have this same opportunity today, to focus our energy on seeing and knowing Jesus. No matter how far on the outside we may feel, Jesus is looking to bring us into His family if we just open our eyes to who He really is. \n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more messages from Passion City Church: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT4tQfAZEsm_yMql_10dpg?\n\nSee other series from Passion City Church:\nThe God You Can Know - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTKWB5pdvklxlQHn-_cADk9fa1pNZRQ2r\nPassion + Purpose - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9OXNPPcJ5o&list=PLTKWB5pdvklyJwx1cr3lM85x_znk_K4Ut\nChain Breaker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmSZezLHbWs&list=PLTKWB5pdvklzUh1ZokCpBMmRce5keEchd\n\nFollow @passioncity: https://www.instagram.com/passioncity/\n\nPassion City Church is a Jesus church with locations in Atlanta and Washington D.C.

    "description": "Have you felt it? The sense that we’ve lost the wonder? The feeling that we have lost sight of the awesome scale of our God. We’ve decided to look at Him under a microscope, limiting our ability to see a more full picture of who God truly is and deciding on our own which attributes of the Eternal and Almighty God we want to accept. What we need, however, is to open the aperture through which we are willing to look at God in all of his likenesses and dive deeper into His Wisdom, His Holiness, His Mercy, etc, etc, etc…\n\nThis week, Pastor Louie Giglio wants us to focus on God’s Wrath and His Mercy. It’s only by fully realizing the one, that we can appreciate in earnest the other. God’s Mercy only makes the impact on our lives that it should when we have a full grasp of His Wrath that was due us until it was poured upon Jesus that day on Calvary answering the prayers of God’s people: LORD, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds, LORD. Repeat them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy.

    "description": "Our aim is for people to hear about Jesus. \n—\nThis week, Pastor Louie Giglio reminds us of our ultimate goal and shows us how no matter the size of our platform the mission is the same. Take Maya Moore for example. One of the greatest women's basketball player of all time has leveraged her public platform to tell the world about Jesus, and spends her Sundays planted in the body of Christ and leading out in the choir. \n—\nSo, yes we should strive for excellence in our work, to be distinctive in our passion and dedication, to pay the cost to be consistent; but if all of that doesn't ultimately build a platform on which we tell the world around us about Jesus, then we will never live out our calling to it's end goal.",

    "description": "What if one of the most well-known stories in scripture was also one of the most misunderstood?\n—\nMost of us can recite the story of the prodigal son from memory. After all it's a parable about how far you and I have turned from God, how we've ran far away and need his forgiveness... isn't it? Or is it possible, that when Jesus was telling this story He meant for us to focus on the Father? His arms stretched wide open as his runaway son returned. His eagerness to welcome him home with a kiss and a celebration. Maybe the story of the Prodigal Son is actually more about the Father who loved him through it all.\n—\nThis Christmas Eve, Pastor Louie Giglio wants you to know that this isn't just someone else's story; that lost uncle, brother, or daughter. This story is all of ours, and the best part is we have a home and we are most welcome to it.\n—\nGive towards what God is doing through Passion City Church: https://passioncitychurch.com/give-online\n—\nWith Passion City Online you can join us every Sunday for gatherings at 10a + 1p + 5p + 8p!

    "description": "“Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.” Isaiah 6:7\n—\nWhat have you allowed to DEFINE you? Is it who God says that you are, or is it the memory, the guilt, or the shame of your past mistakes? Many of us walk around daily carrying the chain of shame, preventing us from walking in the freedom that was purchased for us at the Cross. But the pathway to freedom is open to all in the covering of Grace. After all, grace redefines us from failure to family.",

We feel as if we aren't good enough, and so we look at people who seemingly have it all and begin to resent both their gifting and our own, along with the God who gave out those giftings.\n—\n\nPastor Aaron Coe wants us to realize the true danger of bitterness, that if we let it in, it will creep into the deepest parts of us and eat away at our soul. But there is good news. Jesus came not only to bring us from death to life but to give us life in the full. He has conquered each and every chain, including the deadly chain of bitterness, and we can look to Him in order to walk free of it forever.",

We want to fight for our walk with God.\n2. We want to fight for our heart and character.\n3. We want to fight for our family (and future family).\n4. We want to fight for our brother.\n\nAfter all, scripture teaches that we have a spiritual Enemy who is warring against us in each of these areas, and we are confident that a Fight Club is our best defense in the battle.

    "description": "\"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.\"\nPsalm 23:5\n—\nJesus has prepared a place for you and Him to be in a relationship. A place where you can come to Him and receive the truth of who He says you are. The trouble is that too often there is a third party at our table. The enemy is constantly prowling around waiting for an opening, an invitation from us to pull up a seat and steal, kill, and destroy us.\n—\nHere's the good news. Even though the enemy longs to sit at your table, our Good Shepherd has laid down His life to be the only one with a right to sit with us. We are so prized and valued by Jesus that He paid everything to be with us, and we have to make sure that we don't extend that same honor to the Enemy.",

In the second part of our EVEN THOUGH series, Pastor Louie Giglio encourages us to build a defiant faith which can stand despite the very visible arrows of our enemies.\n—\nIn 2 Kings 6, Elisha's his eyes were open to see what his servant could not; Elisha had a defiant faith that allowed him to see the unseen protection around them when they were completely surrounded by their enemies. That same protection is ours today, it’s up to us to ask for our eyes to be open and see God at work all around us!",

But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead.” Philippians 3:13\n—\nIt’s not if, it’s when. There will be times when life isn’t working out; when you fail; when disappointment and destructive thinking get the better of you. These are the critical moments where our minds become battlefields and the stakes are so high. \n—\nThis week, ZOE CHURCH Pastor, Chad Veach, has a message for each of us; it is always too early to quit, and it is never too late to start no matter the circumstance. Don’t give up, press on into your giftings and dreams, after all, we serve the God who sees in us who we are supposed to be, and who is calling us into the plans He has for us.",

We agonize over it, stress about what and who we will become one day, and feel useless when our position doesn't match up with the calling we've felt led to.\n—\nBut the truth is this; our ultimate and primary calling is to follow God. That's it. To study His Word so that we can know Him deeper, to fall more and more in love with Him, and to carry His love and compassion to the people around us in order that they might come to know Him as well.",

No matter how old or young we are we find ourselves constantly measuring ourselves against some system designed to give everyone else a metric of our worth.\n\n—\n\nExcept for Jesus. In the Kingdom of Jesus, there is only one ranking system, for each of has been created in the very image of God. Yet each of us has forgotten this about someone, or a group of people, at one point or another. The question we have to ask ourselves is; what is my default reaction when I see a person in need when I see someone created in the image of God, in need?\n\n—\n\nWhen Jesus died on the cross for us the ranking system of the world was shattered, and we have to let those broken pieces fall from our own hands. When we see a need, as Jesus-followers it must solicit a response.",

Filled with the ambient sounds of Earth, greetings spoken in languages from all over the World, and instructions on how to listen to them was it ever found, this record was our message to the stars.\n\n—\n\nFour decades later, we have the opportunity to hear a different message, one that has come from significantly further and at a much higher cost. Through the death and resurrection of Jesus, God has shown us who He is, He has called us loved, child, and prized. He paid for our sin and shame on the cross and rose again conquering even the grave.\n\n—\n\nHis message is clear. Can you hear it?",

This problem has plagued us from the very beginning (see Genesis 3). \n\nHowever, God so loved us, that he paved a way for the relationship that sin tore apart to be bridged in the person of Jesus. We who were once dead because of sin, have been made alive by Christ—that is the topic of this week's message from Passion City Church Student Pastor, Grant Partrick, that is Radical Grace!",
