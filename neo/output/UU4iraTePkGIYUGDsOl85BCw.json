    "description": "Robin DiAngelo is, like all of us, a flawed human being. But she has projected her prejudices outward to the point of seeing racism where it is not, and I make the case in this video that her ideology is not only destructive and backwards in and of itself, but how it skews the perceptions of the the individuals it afflicts.
