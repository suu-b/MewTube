    "description": "In this video I suggest that St. Augustine affirmed the essential content of the Protestant notion of sola Scriptura--that is, the view that the Bible alone is the infallible rule for Christian faith and practice. I first offer a plea not to caricature sola Scriptura, and then work through three passages in Augustine's writings. Finally, I point to similar support of sola Scriptura in John Chrysostom. \n\n\nTruth Unites is a mixture of apologetics and theology, with an irenic focus.\n\nGavin Ortlund (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary) serves as senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Ojai. \n\nSUPPORT:\nBecome a patron: https://www.patreon.com/truthunites\nOne time donation: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/truthunites\n\nFOLLOW:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gavinortlund\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TruthUnitesPage/\nWebsite: https://gavinortlund.com/\n\nMY BOOKS:\nhttps://gavinortlund.com/mypublications/\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:27 - 3 Framing Remarks\n08:11 - Augustine Quote #1\n11:07 - Augustine Quote #2\n13:23 - Augustine Quote #3\n18:01 - John Chrysotom on sola Scriptura",

    "title": "Did Jesus Claim to be God? In Response to Bart Ehrman",
    "description": "A few generations ago C.S. Lewis made the famous argument that there are basically three categories by which we might interpret Jesus of Nazareth: Lord, Liar, or Lunatic. \n\nBut what about another option: legend? Do we have any historical evidence that Jesus claimed to be God?\n\nBart Ehrman, for example, argues that Jesus understood himself apocalyptic preacher heralding the kingdom of God, and possibly as the Jewish Messiah—but not as divine.\n\nIn this video, however, we consider several passages which Ehrman thinks go back to the historical Jesus, in which Jesus seems to assume a weight of divine authority. We also consider how early on in the first-century a high Christology seems to have developed.\n\n\nTruth Unites is a mixture of apologetics and theology, with an irenic focus.\n\nGavin Ortlund (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary) serves as senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Ojai. \n\nWebsite: https://gavinortlund.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gavinortlund\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TruthUnitesPage/\n\nBecome a patron: https://www.patreon.com/truthunites\n\nMy books:\n--Why God Makes Sense in a World That Doesn’t: The Beauty of Christian Theism: https://www.amazon.com/Makes-Sense-World-That-Doesnt/dp/1540964094\n--Retrieving Augustine’s Doctrine of Creation: Ancient Wisdom for Current Controversy: https://www.amazon.com/Retrieving-Augustines-Doctrine-Creation-Controversy/dp/0830853243\n--Anselm’s Pursuit of Joy: A Commentary on the Proslogion: https://www.amazon.com/Anselms-Pursuit-Joy-Commentary-Proslogion/dp/0813232759/\n--Finding the Right Hills to Die On: The Case for Theological Triage: https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Right-Hills-Die-Theological/dp/1433567423/\n--Theological Retrieval for Evangelicals: Why We Need Our Past to Have a Future: https://www.amazon.com/Theological-Retrieval-Evangelicals-Need-Future/dp/1433565269/",
