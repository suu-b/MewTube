    "title": "The Existence of God | Joseph Schmid",
    "description": "In this interview, I talk to Princeton PhD student Joseph Schmid. Joe has done rigorous work in the public and scholarly-level atmosphere of philosophy. He has his own YouTube channel 'Majesty of Reason', there he does lecture videos, hosts discussions, and interviews philosophers as well.\nHe is a well-known agnostic concerning the existence of God. However, he finds a collection of arguments favoring theism and atheism to be compelling. Consequently, I invited him on to talk about some of these arguments and get his thoughts!\n\nJoe's YouTube channel:\nwww.youtube.com/@UCvWRKmcplBTYQS49AVGsLgw \n\nFor more information about Joe, check out his website:\njosephschmid.com",

    "description": "In this interview, I talk with Dr. Eric Sampson about moral realism! Dr. Eric Sampson is an assistant professor at Purdue University. Dr. Sampson's work primarily focuses on defending the existence of objective moral properties.\n\nDr. Eric Sampson was a huge philosophical influence for me because he has been EXTREMELY helpful in bringing these great philosophical issues to my attention.
