    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:14 {Biblical Thoughts on Giving} Analyzing Pastor Marvin Winans’ giving service.\r\n2. 33:10 {Israel: Right to the Holy Land?} Hi Mike, in your view, does ethnic Israel have a divine right to the Holy Land today, according to Scripture?\r\n3. 51:37 {How to Serve the Lord} How do we serve the Lord, biblically? Sometimes I feel like I don't know how to serve the Lord.\r\n4. 53:55 {Finding Our Identity?} Can you explain the trend about finding our true identity? Jamie Winship and others talk about knowing your true identity. Is it more specific than who we are in Christ (i.e., that we’re redeemed, etc.)?\r\n5. 59:30 {The Minimum to Be Saved?} What's the minimum one must believe to be saved? Romans 10:9? But anything else? What about polytheists who believe it? Or if someone said, \"Yes, Lord Jesus died and rose, but His death wasn't for our sin\"?\r\n6. 1:03:49 {Impassability – Does God Have Emotions?} Could you help me understand impassability? I’ve heard that God doesn’t have emotions, meaning we can’t move God to “feel.” What about Deuteronomy 32: 21 which sounds like we can move God to feel things?\r\n7. 1:09:47 {Discouraged by Free Will} My son is bothered by free will because it causes so much pain and suffering and that God foreknew we would sin. How can I encourage him?\r\n8. 1:14:41 {Developing Belief as an Analytical Person} How do I develop a belief in Christianity? It feels very difficult as an analytical person. I’ve been looking into apologetics but still can't develop faith and I strongly want to live righteously.\r\n9. 1:20:35 {Trusting God While Questions Linger} I keep thinking I’ll trust God easier if I get more questions about God answered. But I’m sad about things like unmet godly desires. Remembering God’s promises doesn’t help. How do I fix this?\r\n10.1:25:45 {No Sin After Salvation?} I have difficulty knowing what the Bible means when it says that someone who sins after being saved was never saved. I know that’s a very simplistic version, but it has always caused me anxiety. \n\nTaking your questions from the live chat in this Q&A helping you to learn to think biblically about EVERYTHING\n\nThe full Marvin Winans Giving Day service is viewable here https://www.youtube.com/live/11BiJGQ-MtI?si=5qD5sCAkTRe3qqvf\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

It seems unwise and inconsiderate toward those with weaker consciences. Some say we shouldn't legalistically refuse to advertise these opportunities for fellowship since drinking in moderation isn't sinful. Thoughts?\r\n3. 25:34 {Hating vs. Loving Evildoers} Psalm 139:21-22 and Psalm 5:5 seem to imply it is good to hate evil people who oppose God, but Matthew 5: 43-48 seems to encourage the opposite. Where is the proper balance between these things? Thanks!\r\n4. 34:29 {Sin Struggles = Double Minded?} What's the difference between being a double-minded man (James 1:8) and being a sincere Christian struggling with sin and the flesh's love for sinful things (Romans 7: 14-25)? Can you draw a distinction?\r\n5. 42:02 {Wrath: An Attribute of God?} Do you think \"wrathfulness\" is an attribute of God, or that wrath is just a practical outworking of His attributes of justice and holiness?\r\n6. 45:29 {New Christian Channel: Am I Ready?} How much planning should a person do before starting a Christian channel? How do you know when you’re ready and it’s time to post your first video?\r\n7. 49:05 {Adam’s 930 Years} Could Genesis 5:5 mean Adam’s 930 years began after the Fall, so he and Eve lived much longer in the Garden? Romans 5: 12 says death came through sin; did Adam start dying then?\r\n8. 51:09 {Family Member Teaching Falsely: Help!} How do we deal with a family member (brother) who is actively teaching a false gospel (Hebrew Roots but Jesus is not God)? He has started his own group in person and is also sharing online.\r\n9. 56:06 {Specific Prayers: Controlling God?} When we pray, should we be specific? Or is that trying to control God?\r\n10. 59:06 {How to Stop Scrolling So Much!}  In a generation that grew up scrolling, how can we overcome it? It’s not inherently sinful, but it sucks up so much of our time today.

Res. 220 and S. 2747 to Defend Persecuted Christians in Nigeria\n\nDear [Congressman/Senator] [Last Name],\n\nI am writing to urge you to take immediate action on behalf of persecuted Christians in Nigeria, who are enduring one of the worst humanitarian and religious freedom crises in the world today.\n\nThousands of Christians have been slaughtered, kidnapped, raped, and displaced by radical Islamist terrorists. Entire villages are being wiped out while the Nigerian government turns a blind eye—or, in some cases, is complicit in these atrocities. The United States must not remain silent in the face of such evil.\n\nI strongly urge you to:\n\nSupport and co-sponsor H. Res. 220, introduced by Congressman Chris Smith, which calls on the U.S. Department of State to re-designate Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) for its severe violations of religious freedom.\n\nSupport and co-sponsor S. 2747, Senator Ted Cruz’s Nigeria Religious Freedom Accountability Act of 2025, which would impose targeted sanctions on Nigerian government officials who enable or ignore persecution and human rights abuses.\n\nDesignating Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern and enforcing targeted sanctions are critical first steps in holding the Nigerian government accountable and protecting vulnerable Christian communities. These measures will help ensure that U.S. foreign policy truly reflects our nation’s commitment to religious liberty, justice, and human dignity.\n\nPlease stand with the persecuted, and let your voice be one of moral leadership and courage in defense of the innocent.\n\nThank you for your time, compassion, and commitment to defending freedom and human rights.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Full Name]\n[City, State]\n[Email Address or Phone Number (optional)]",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:03 {Is Diwali Demonic?} Can you tell us a bit about Diwali? And is it OK to wish others a “Happy Diwali”? How should Christians view the holiday?\n2. 13:31 {Words of Comfort vs. Prophecy?}  Is there a distinction between God speaking words of comfort to someone and the gift of prophecy? I’ve understood that anytime God speaks, it is by definition, prophecy and subject to testing.\n3. 19:01 {OT Food Laws vs. Homosexuality?} If we aren't required to keep the Old Covenant food laws, then why are the unclean animals described in Deuteronomy 14:3 with the same Hebrew word for homosexuality in Leviticus 18?\n4. 23:50 {When Christians Devalue Scripture} I’ve heard believers say things like, “The Bible isn’t the fourth member of the Trinity.” Phrases like this can feel dismissive of the Bible. How should we take this from well-meaning Christians?\n5. 29:07 {Demonic Fear & Sexual Temptation} This may sound like a silly question, but do you have any advice for someone scared of demonic or evil forces when going to sleep? It doesn't help that I often fall sexually at night, too. \n6. 34:12 {Contradicting Passages?} In the plague after the incident at Peor, 24,000 people died. But, in 1 Corinthians 10:8, Paul says 23,000. How can I hold to inerrancy? \n7. 47:48 {Spiritually Guiding our Loved Ones} My mom is a baby Christian (2 years), but she feels most comfortable in an Orthodox church. She seems to be growing in her faith there. Should I intervene or just let her go where she feels led?\n8. 54:56 {More Important: Faith or Love?} 1 Corinthians 13: 13 says love is greater than faith. So then why do we treat faith as more important for grand things like salvation?\n9. 1:00:54 {Witnessing to Muslims} My Muslim friend is willing to go through the Bible with me. Which books should I start with?\n10. 1:03:31 {Ladies: Is Makeup Sinful?} Is it sinful for a Christian woman to wear makeup? Nothing too much, but makeup nonetheless. How about nail polish? I don’t personally feel a conviction on this, but I heard a Christian say she “saw people in Hell for it.”\n\nTaking your questions from the live chat in this weekly Q&A helping you to learn to think biblically about EVERYTHING\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Joshua Mhlakela went public again after his second failed rapture prediction. It's real bad.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference\n0:00 - Intro\nBonus Update: 0:24 {Breaking News!} Covering a “Rapture Cult Update” from the recent false prophets.\n1. 12:53 {Is Christianity a Cult?} In light of Mhlakela's serious error, how can Christians be assured that we aren't also blind members of a cult? Scholars are quick to explain t:hat \"near\" means quickly, unexpectedly, or suddenly. Then why don't they translate \"tychikos\" (soon) as such? 2 Peter 3:8-9 is also frequently used as an excuse.\n2. 18:11 {Is Repeated Repentance a Deception?} I have heard you say we should keep repenting. But, if we are continually repenting for the same sin or sins, has it lost its value? Is our repentance real or are we deceiving ourselves?\n3. 23:54 {Politics in The Pulpit?} To what extent is it appropriate or necessary for pastors to address current events & politics from the pulpit? How should church members respond if these topics aren’t addressed thoroughly or at all?\n4. 37:22 {Mark of the Beast: Always Wrong?} If a man takes the Mark of the Beast to provide for his family, how will God judge him?\n5. 43:40 {The Church’s Voice = God’s Voice?} My dad said, “The church asked me to be a deacon, so it must be God.” Is it wise to treat the church’s voice as God’s voice?\n6. 48:38 {About Clear Truth Media} I think you’ve written for Clear Truth Media and they are platforming Mark Driscoll. With your stance on unqualified pastors, how do you respond?\n7. 55:44 {Dietary Laws: Fulfilled?} How did Jesus fulfill the dietary laws? I’m considering Jesus grafting in Gentiles into the faith to be the fulfillment of that (Matthew 5: 17, Acts 10:9-15). \n8. 1:01:22 {Overcoming Anxiety: Death & Illnesses} My wife often deals with anxiety. She is a firm believer, but struggles with the fear of death/illnesses. Not for her own sake, but because of the people she would leave behind. \n9. 1:09:17 {Gentle Guidance for a Friend in Error} How can I share the Gospel with a friend who lost his mom and believes she’s watching over him? I know it’s necromancy, but he’s hurting and I fear sounding harsh.\n10. 1:11:51 {500 Witnesses: Verifiable?} I’ve got a question regarding the reliability of the 500 Witnesses source. Atheists say that we have no way to verify that the number Paul gives is accurate. How would you answer this?\n\nLinks:\n\nHebrew Roots Movement playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuOD_BytSxbejzCnGPOcgFw&si=8oZUf1hd3keyLkJP\n\nWhere I’m speaking on October 17th https://prayvotestand.org\n\nSola Scriptura defended biblically https://www.youtube.com/live/tJxjKAcn78I?si=kdlOCvG_3IaOGgpB\n\nJesus in the Old Testament playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO&si=0q7H705Ylusl5uy_\n\nBiblical view of immigration https://www.youtube.com/live/OlI25JfAAK0?si=pI68N5m6GRIXIhxz\n\n\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:38 {Responding to Zachary Levi} A respectful analysis of Zachary Levi’s beliefs on the Bible.\n2. 32:56 {The Witness of the Spirit} If I know I believe the Gospel is true but I don’t feel any “witness of the Spirit,” what does that mean? I’m trying to trust with my whole heart.\n3. 40:13 {Has God Abandoned the World?} My dad is an unbeliever but acknowledges God’s existence through creation. He believes that God created the world and then abandoned it. How can I help show him that God is still with us to this day?\n4. 43:30 {Should I Worship a God I Don’t Like?} A common objection I hear is, \"Why should I worship a God I don't like?\"\n5. 45:58 {Is My Sin Even My Fault?} Why am I accountable to God for my sins when I was born with a sin nature? Shouldn't a loving God provide the basic remedy for creation when they had no choice in being created and no choice regarding their nature?\n6. 53:57 {Was YHWH Beaten in Battle?} How can I defend 2 Kings 3 when skeptics use it as an example of Yahweh being beaten in battle by another entity in driving the Israelites out, despite them being prophesied to win?\n7. 1:05:46 {Learning to Evangelize Better} I converted just over a year ago and had some success evangelizing to my community (libertarians). I've read the New Testament and I’m working on reading it twice now. What can I do to evangelize better, especially to libertarians?\n8. 1:07:20 {How Can God Have a God?} I heard this question in my group: God is considered the Most High; thus Jesus (who is God) is the Most High. Therefore, why does Jesus claim that He has a God above Him in Revelation 3: 12?\n9. 1:12:26 {Does Doubt = Incomplete Faith?} I’m a new believer who used to be a Jehovah’s Witness. I gave my life to Christ a few years ago, but sometimes I wrestle with doubt. Does that make my faith incomplete?\n10. 1:18:40 {Acceptance Only of a “Higher Power”} My daughter (13) believes that there may be a higher power, but doesn’t believe in Jesus. I’m trying to figure out how to reach her in an effective manner. What advice can you offer?\n11. 1:21:59 {The Sadness of Animal Suffering} Why is there such a great amount of suffering that animals need to go through? Wouldn’t a good God create it to where the animals didn’t have to suffer and still feed us?\n12. 1:34:19 {Answered Prayer or Coincidence?} How can I tell if God actually answered my prayers or if the outcome was just a coincidence? Many Christians say God has spoken to or guided them without evidence. How can such claims be tested objectively?\n13. 1:37:23 {Does God Send Us to Hell?} How can I convince my brother that God does not condemn us to Hell and that it’s our own free will that puts us there? He has stopped talking to us due to that belief he has.\n14. 1:41:33 {Explaining the Trinity to Muslims} I have a Muslim friend who is struggling to understand the Trinity and asked, “how can God be 3 things all at once, and how can He be crucified?” Can you explain it in a way that a Muslim will understand?\n16. 1:45:51 {Street Healings: Are They Real?} Are street healings real? Christians pray for strangers who report relief from pain and various illnesses. But atheist Derren Brown has produced similar results. Are these miracles or psychological effects?\n17. 1:51:07 {Is Mental Illness a Fallacy?} I'm in a faith crisis. I shared my mental health struggle with my discipler, and at the next study, they called mental illness a fallacy. I walked away and struggle if it's all real.\n18. 1:54:36 {Why is David in Heaven?} Can you explain how David would be in Heaven when he knew 1 wife was God’s design but was living in continuous sin (1 John 3:4-9, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, Hebrews 10: 26, Ephesians 5:3-7)?\n19. 1:56:23 {Rejecting Certain Parts of Scripture?} Can you have blind faith and not believe certain parts of the Bible?\n20. 1:57:56 {Higher Healing Statistics?} Christians tend to pray for the healing of their loved ones when they are physically unwell, there should be a statistically measurable difference in health levels among Christians vs. non-Christians. Do we see it?\n\nLINKS I MENTIONED:\nExplaining why you can trust that the Bible you have today is the same as it once was. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuzJhPtmrgqpVoXhjvqiIjW&si=vSXb__XKKkNbIRI7\n\nEvidence for the Bible playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596&si=1sMBKa4foWDGijUs\n\nAnswering a bunch of specific \"Bible contradictions\" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHu4XWmQ7gL9YDehRMkZ-ePv\n\nJames 2 (Catholic vs Protestant view) https://www.youtube.com/live/eDNPHuCsEms?si=7uaFL-I7NCb_tgli\n\nHow street healing videos are faked (Todd White) https://www.youtube.com/live/je20XTohCNo?si=sQwHg6m_r6LZWhHg\n\nMental health and Philippians 4 https://www.youtube.com/live/KspwQ2wyuUU?si=gMfYJu6c2Jir6Dfg\n\nIf a polygamist gets saved... https://youtu.be/CSQdSZbu1JY?si=vg_Cyc50t0FsQ6c2\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

Do you think this is referring to two separate events?\n4. 1:23:05 {Honoring Tradition & Embracing Change} How can pastors balance honoring tradition with leading forward when influential members of the congregation resist technology, new ideas, and change?\n5. 1:25:14 {The Value of Fallible Gifts} If all the gifts of the Spirit are subject to human fallibility, what is their true value for the Church? Why would God tell us to eagerly desire them if they can so easily be misused or misunderstood? \n6. 1:27:33 {Repentance after Spiritual Drought} Do you have any advice for someone who was raised Christian, who professed faith and went to church but still lived a worldly and immoral lifestyle, then has recently come to Christ in repentance?\n7. 1:29:17 {A “Word” from the Lord?} I go to a Calvary Chapel and there are a lot of “words” given to people. They’re not unbiblical but seem sort of vague, like I’m not able to test them. Should I only accept it if I can test it?\n8. 1:32:46 {Gathering while Disabled?}  In light of the Scripture that states not to forsake the gathering together, I am concerned about that because I am disabled, do not drive, and do not have consistent transportation to church. Advice?\n9. 1:34:45 {Enoch & Elisha – In Heaven?} Enoch and Elisha are said to be in Heaven in the Old Testament. Why did Jesus say in John 3: 13 that no one has gone to Heaven except Him?\n10. 1:36:14 {Let’s Grow in Christ!} Can you please share a few suggestions, just for fun and faith-building, for us to do this weekend to grow in Christ (besides going to church)?\n\nLINKS I mentioned:\nDifferent Christian views of the End Times https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmw0uVLunwU\n\nThe 12 hour live stream of them waiting on the rapture.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:59 {Rapture Craze?} Can you address “Brother Joshua” and the current rapture craze?\r\n2. 36:29 {PSA + Crucified WITH Christ?} How does the doctrine of Penal Substitutionary Atonement harmonize with us being “crucified with Christ” (Galatians 2: 20, Romans 6:5-6)? The substitution element seems to be missing, and wrath seems confusing if we are to affirm crucifixion with Christ.\r\n3. 40:57 {Pre-Wired to Sin?} Why are Adam and Eve guilty when the brains God gave them are what guided them to make their decision to sin? They processed the situation based on the way God had pre-wired them.\r\n4. 44:15 {Eschatology in The Psalms?} Is it valid to interpret Psalms 42-49 as talking about the End Times (Tribulation in 42-44, Lamb’s wedding in 45, God’s reign/judgment and New Jerusalem with a river in 46-49)?\r\n5. 50:00 {Obedience Leading to Hardship?} My walk with Christ feels harder the more I obey. I lost family, friends, and even my girlfriend. Sometimes I wonder if this is even worth it, yet I still long to stay faithful. Any advice?\r\n6. 55:42 {Baptismal Regeneration: False Gospel?} Would you consider the teaching that baptism is necessary for salvation to be a \"different gospel” (Galatians 1:6)? If not, how would you distinguish it from the Circumcision Party's false teachings?\r\n7. 1:00:31 {Malachi 4: About Jesus?} Is Malachi 4:2 talking about Jesus? Some translations like NKJV vs. NASB seem to reference it differently.\r\n8. 1:05:30 {Loving God Above Family} My husband is an unbeliever. He recently told me he can't be a believer because he idolizes me and our kids and couldn't love God more than us. Beyond praying, how can I address this biblically?\r\n9. 1:09:14 {Church Membership but Rarely Attending?} I’m a youth pastor at my church, and several families at my church consider themselves members but are only present a few times per year due to weekend activities. Should we address this strongly?\r\n10. 1:14:43 {Trusting God More in Prayer} I fully believe God never fails and His decisions are always right and good. But it's still hard not to feel like He's \"let me down\" when I pray SO hard for something and it doesn't happen. It feels like He's absent and it (ashamedly) makes me question the parts in Scripture where He invites us to ask and SAYS He'll act.\r\nBonus! 1:21:38 {Mike’s Favorite Christian Music} What are some of your favorite or best recommended Christian music artists and albums?\n\n\nWhy is there a Rapture craze going on right now? I think it traces back to this mystery man, \"Brother Joshua.\" He appeared out of nowhere about 3 months ago and said God took him to heaven multiple times and Jesus told him the date of the Rapture. \n\nLINKS I mentioned:\nOur long and potentially boring baptism debate https://youtu.be/x2TfBVNuuY8?si=gSR0Ou1sbcsM6_eK\n\nWhat is the one sign?

He’s only 9 months old right now, but I want to be ready.\r\n3. 38:22 {Jesus’ Stripes vs. The Cross?} My former church claimed that Jesus' stripes specifically paid for our sickness, while the cross paid for the rest, using Isaiah 53:5 to support it. Is this biblical?\r\n4. 41:14 {Paul & The Cretans} What point was Paul making in Titus 1: 12 when he quoted a \"prophet\" who said “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons”?\r\n5. 46:59 {Prenups Always Bad?} Is a prenuptial agreement ever biblical? My fiance’s parents want us to get one. In my opinion, prenuptial agreements undermine the permanence of marriage, its covenantal nature, trust, and unity.\r\n6. 53:47 {Supporting Israel?} How do we know whether supporting what Israel is doing in Gaza is or isn't God's will?\r\n7. 1:05:48 {The Moses Model: Biblical?} Given your Calvary Chapel background and current focus on church leadership structures vulnerable to abuse, how does the Moses Model ensure checks and balances on authority in the church?\r\n8. 1:14:57 {Does History Really Repeat Itself?} With the death of Charlie Kirk, it feels like we are in times similar to the 60s. Is it biblical to think that history repeats itself, or is mankind just predictable?\r\n9. 1:17:30 {What’s a Backslidden Christian?} What's a backslidden Christian? Is this the same as a Christian with thorny soil (Matthew 13, Mark 4, Luke 8)? And are they a slave to sin if they do sin? I'm afraid I'm this Christian.\r\n10. 1:28:16 {Anxiety: Am I Doing Something Wrong?}  I am a Christian and struggle with anxiety. It especially happens when I try to speak or when God is using me for something even around believers. It cripples me. Am I doing something wrong? \n\nLINKS I MENTION WILL APPEAR HERE (eventually)\n\nMy video analyzing Calvary Chapel founder, Chuck Smith's failed rapture prediction. https://www.youtube.com/live/5w9vkMfZudI?si=JK-dZrVeWPJCcbJf\n\nThe one sign to watch for: The Abomination of Desolation https://www.youtube.com/live/U5XqtcMhSh8?si=yULt3kqxB36qy1hb\n\nWhat we got wrong about End Times https://www.youtube.com/live/2Ojg7BT3V68?si=x4W6R4WXCarZhK5f\n\nMy full teaching on the parable of the soils https://youtu.be/t6Tm9dc7cew?si=-g9NmeeGmd4Cg-Jn\n\nBibleThinker mugs and candles (while they last) https://Zockollpottery.com - a portion of each purchase goes to missions.

    "description": "uestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:02 {Flat Earth Use of Scripture} Do I still say that Flat Earthers misuse Scripture?\r\n2. 22:11 {Why Some Reject & Some Accept Faith} Could you help me answer the Calvinist who asks what the difference is between a person who has faith and a person who rejects faith? If we are all equally sinful, why do some choose Christ?\r\n3. 31:15 {Why My Prayer Isn’t Answered} How can I tell why a prayer hasn’t been answered? How do I know if I just have to wait longer, or if some sin is hindering my prayer, or if the answer is simply “no”?\r\n4. 40:50 {The Bible: Chronological Order?} Is it helpful to read the Bible in chronological order?\r\n5. 44:31 {The “Who” of Romans 7} Who is Paul talking about in Romans 7? Himself, some hypothetical believer, or someone else entirely?\r\n6. 51:29 {Single but Living As Married} My fiancée moved in, is sleeping with me, using my credit card, is on my home title and health insurance, and we’re filing taxes jointly. But our wedding ceremony is not until 2027. I want to break up with her. Is that OK since we’ve made no vow yet before God?\r\n7. 55:08 {Sin Before The Law} In Romans 5: 13, what does it mean that sin was not counted against those before Moses gave the law? Did all those people receive eternal salvation?\r\n8. 1:01:54 {Are You Reformed?} I think you've said that you consider yourself Reformed, and I wondered what you mean by that. What Reformed doctrines do you accept besides the ones that constitute basic orthodoxy?\r\n9. 1:04:26 {Does Porn Disqualify from Ministry?} What are your thoughts on pastors struggling with porn/lust? Is it disqualifying? I stepped out of ministry to heal. Many ministers my age (23) struggle. Please pray. I’ve seen progress, but I still fight.\r\n10. 1:10:05 {Evangelism amid Difficult Family Dynamics} What’s the appropriate way to navigate being an uncle and sharing the truth with nieces/nephews when your sibling doesn’t have a biblical worldview?\r\n1:18:41 Bonus – Prayer Request: Can you please pray for my mom? She’s been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her prognosis looks good, but we are praying for God's miraculous and complete healing. \n\n\n\nI'm taking questions from the live chat... here are the rules.\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

He said we do not see examples of expository teaching in the Bible. Is this true, and a good reason?\n3. 26:50 {Baptism for the Dead?} Does 1 Corinthians 15: 29 give validity to the Mormon practice of getting baptized for the dead?\n4. 34:14 {Struggling with Sexual Temptations} I struggle with same-sex attraction, unfortunately. How can I be sure that I’m not reprobate/unregenerate? The idea of evanescent grace scares me.\n5. 42:44 {Apostles vs. Disciples?} Does it matter whether I refer to Jesus' followers as the 12 Apostles or the 12 Disciples?\n6. 43:23 {Sheep, Goats & The Rapture} Have you considered the sheep and goat judgment of Matthew 25 in light of the timing of the Rapture? The Rapture HAS to be before the tribulation in order for the Earth to be repopulated.\n7. 47:24 {Having the Gift of Prophecy} How does a Christian know if they have the gift of prophecy?\n8. 49:35 {Does God Choose to Love Us?} Does God choose to love us? If He Himself is love and He can't help but love us, why should we feel honored by it? Doesn't that take away the meaningfulness of it?\n9. 52:28 {The Fear of Failing} I’m afraid I’ll sin or lead myself away from God if I make the wrong decisions about personal convictions, theology, and even daily choices. How should I deal with the fear of being wrong?\n10. 55:38 {Divination Worked: Am I Unsaved?} A man who practices divination visited and gave info about me that was about 60% correct.

I’ve been watching and studying your Women in Ministry series. How do I go about discussing this issue productively with the leaders of my church?\r\n4. 34:42 {“Red Letters”: More Important?} Are Paul's words in Scripture less important than Jesus' words?\r\n5. 38:47 {The Best Counsel for Couples} My wife and I recently starting doing pre-marital counseling for other couples in our church. What is some of the best advice we should give these couples?\r\n6. 41:37 {Paul’s Gospel?} In Philemon 1: 19, why did Philemon owe himself to Paul? And why does Paul call it \"his\" gospel (please also see Romans 2: 16 , 16: 25, 2 Timothy 2:8)? \r\n7. 49:32 {Worship Lyrics: Thinking Biblically} I have a question about a worship song. Do you think it is appropriate to sing “Let Your holy fire consume us”?\r\n8. 51:55 {Are Annulments Biblical?} What are your thoughts on annulments? Are they biblical and are they ever wise? Or are people just trying to justify their divorce?\r\n9. 57:53 {Hats: Disrespectful or Stylish?} My mother-in-law is \"old-fashioned.\" What's your opinion about wearing hats in church? How about pastors preaching in them?\r\n10. 1:01:42 {Why We’re Never Satisfied} How do I deal with not being satisfied in life?

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:58 {Pastors Using AI?} For pastors preparing sermons: What is the proper use of AI (artificial intelligence)? What are some rules of wisdom we can apply when using AI as a helpful tool?\n2. 27:23 {“Soul” in the OT/NT} How do we reconcile the Old Testament use of \"soul\" to mean a whole person with statements by Jesus implying that a soul is a separate entity? He seems to be contradicting what the Old Testament teaches.\n3. 31:24 {Why is Open Theism Unbiblical?} I know in the past you have been against Open Theism. Why is the idea of a non-completely settled future unbiblical? I lean toward Open Theism due to God’s freedom.\n4. 33:53 {Praying for Personal Blessings: Selfish?} Can you share your insight on how to get over the feeling that it’s somehow wrong to pray for personal blessings? Objectively, I know it’s not, but the feeling often creeps in, as if it’s selfish.\n5. 37:47 {“Lord” in the OT vs. NT} Is the title of Lord used in the same capacity in the New Testament as it is in the Old Testament (for example, in John13: 13)?\n6. 42:26 {Confessing to Others} You've recently been calling leaders out publicly. Do all Christians need to publicly confess our sins, or only leaders? Is confessing to God and repenting enough, or should we tell each other?\n7. 51:36 {The Importance of Jesus’ Lineage} Why was it so important for Jesus to be born from Seth vs. Cain, Isaac vs. Ishmael, etc., since He came to save all mankind?\n8. 53:49 {Should Shame Linger?} As a kid, even after apologizing, I felt my parents' shame/disappointment/anger in the room until a period of time would pass. I know my sin harms my intimacy w/God even though Romans 8:1 is true, so I can't get over the \"awkward in the room\" feeling when I try to pray or draw near to God after sinning. Should shame linger for a period of time?\n9. 57:09 {Church Leadership: Unbiblical Demands?} A church I know has an Intellectual Property document that staff signs and it says they can't pursue personal creative projects without the leadership’s permission. Is this biblical?\n10. 1:02:04 {How to Draw Near to God} How can someone draw closer to God?\n\nHow to Find Jesus in The Old Testament playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO&si=HdNVCr7BrheCp81T\n\nMichael Brown’s 23 years of cover-up.

I have spoken to Les Cody over the phone and asked him to watch my video and to take down this terrible podcast episode and for Mercy Culture to publicly apologize to Sarah, Ray, and the others who were attacked by it. I hope that I can celebrate them doing so in the future. If so, I'll update this text. https://youtu.be/uwTCulZn2xM?si=fy39szMxYNJneYx8\n\nThe Firefly investigation results - https://fortworthreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Firefly-Report_April-18.pdf\n\nThis site has an easier to read and larger database of witness info than the Firefly report (we reference it many times)  https://BrownWitnessReport.com \n\nOther videos Ron Cantor has made on this topic:\n\nInterview with the Minor Prophets channel https://youtu.be/wd7sG3p9V9Y?si=IbHtEEU4p4BXFois\n\nReading letters from Kim's daughter and her husband (Ray). https://youtu.be/uHm1-fxi7ak?si=6hYx78UKKEgtzW3V\n\nRon on the Wake up and Win channel https://youtu.be/ZGdyunQDXXQ?si=4awFTJaTWIU2QWSl\n\nIf anyone involved in the cover-up and harm comes forward with genuine repentance and confession we will FULLY forgive and embrace them in brotherly love.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:19 {Would They Abort Jesus?} What are four Bible verses to learn, to support the pro-live position? Would they have aborted Jesus back in history, based on current cultural reasoning we hear?\r\n2. 21:43 {Sins Against Us or Just God?} If someone commits a sin against you (abuse, etc.), are you also owed justice? Can Jesus forgive the justice you are owed, or was the sin committed only against God and not you (the sinner is now saved)? \r\n3. 29:54 {Choosing Between Two Churches} What would you do if you had to choose between a Calvinist leaning church and a church that believed women could be elders? Both churches are otherwise healthy and doctrinally sound.\r\n4. 33:14 {Interpreting the “High Places”} How should we understand the \"high places\"? 2 Chronicles 15: 17 and other passages condemn the kings for not tearing them down, but in 1 Samuel 9: 12, Samuel attends and blesses a sacrifice at a high place.\r\n5. 44:43 {Processing Past Relationship Issues} My wife had several partners before our marriage. I wasn’t around, but I feel like I have to forgive the men. Am I being weird? How do I bring this to God, because I'm still losing sleep 10 years later?\r\n6. 49:02 {Different Translations = Different Meanings?} Why does 1 Samuel 13:1 have different meanings in different translations (like the NKJV and NIV)? \r\n7. 58:25 {Is the Holy Spirit All-Knowing?} Does Matthew 24: 36 imply that the Holy Spirit doesn't know everything? How does that work if the Holy Spirit is God? I've been struggling with the Trinity lately.\r\n8. 1:04:36 {Submitting to a Non-Christian Husband?} How should a newly Christian woman apply Ephesians 5: 22 and Colossians 3: 18 when her husband has not yet come to Christ and is not supportive of her conversion?\r\n9. 1:10:46 {Galatians: The Meaning of “Quickly”} When the Galatians quickly deserted the Gospel (Galatians 1:6), did \"quickly\" refer to the time after Paul left to when they heard false teaching, or how easily they turned once they heard false teaching?\r\n10. 1:15:19 {Historical Data: Biblical Christianity} Is there any historical data on biblical Christianity outside the Catholic Church before the Reformation?\r\n\r\nBonus Q! 1:21:59 What’s your favorite Star Wars film?\n\nWhat does \"wives submit\" mean? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8PFVZgIQ2w\n\nThe full Women in Ministry Series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ZQC5g977k&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC&pp=gAQB\n\nGavin Ortlund's video on The Waldensians (forerunners of the reformation) https://youtu.be/D2wK_Q8U3Y4?si=VTedzHEbSQ7LGqw2\n\nI'm taking questions from the live chat... here are the rules.\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:02 {Temptation Increasing vs. Satan Fleeing?} The Bible says when we resist the devil, he will flee (James 4:7). So why does it often feel like spiritual warfare INCREASES when we try to buckle down and resist sins of the flesh, addictions, etc.? When I resist, it doesn't feel like the devil flees - it feels like he tries even harder to get me to fall. Why is this?\n2. 12:17 {What is Blasphemy?} What is the biblical understanding of blasphemy? A Catholic online was complaining about how Protestants blaspheme Mary. How do we biblically define blasphemy, and what verses support this?\n3. 20:16 {Paul vs. Barnabas} What are your thoughts on the dispute between Paul and Barnabas over Mark in Acts 15: 37-40? Were either of them at fault? What can we take from it?\n4. 30:41 {Seeing God in Creation} Despite Romans 1: 20, I do not inherently see God in His creation. I choose to believe in God, but I feel like an ant lacking the capacity to contemplate my surroundings, let alone a creator.\n5. 42:26 {How to Share Concerns w/Leadership} Can you share some advice on how to approach church leadership with concerns regarding what appears to be false theology creeping into my church? Specifically: a lot of Hillsong/Elevation songs, TPT references, etc.\n6. 49:43 {When AI Grows Too Much} If AI (Artificial Intelligence} keeps developing to where society at large starts to call it sentient, would we as Christians have to stand in opposition to that?\n7. 52:20 {Resolving 2 Challenging Passages} 1 Chronicles 20:5 and 2 Samuel 21: 19 seem to disagree with each other. How should we think biblically about these two passages?\n8. 57:50 {Protection from Legalism} How do you keep yourself from legalism? I’m breaking an addiction right now, and it feels like I’m doing it to be saved instead of because I am saved.

    "title": "Does THIS Bible verse teach Sola Scriptura? 10 Qs with Mike Winger (Ep 52)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:10 {2 Thess. 2 = Sola Scriptura?} Does 2 Thessalonians 2 teach Sola Scriptura?\n2. 10:51 {Jesus’ Deity: Why isn’t the NT Clearer?} In Titus 2: 13, Is Paul explicitly saying Jesus is God and Savior? Why do New Testament authors often not address Jesus as God and appear to place Jesus outside of the Godhead (e.g. 2 John 1:3)?\n3. 20:04 {Biblical Recipe for Anointing Oil?} The book of James tells us that if any are sick they should call for the elders and get anointed. Shouldn’t we be using the anointing oil recipe in Exodus 30: 23-25 instead of just olive oil like most people use?\n4. 27:03 {Personalities in Heaven} I believe that we will still have our personality in Heaven, but what about unborn babies? Will they walk around in Heaven like non-player characters since they haven't formed their own personality yet?\n5. 32:22 {“Buried with Him in Baptism”} Can you help me understand Colossians 2: 12? Is this water baptism? Which baptism is it?\n6. 38:13 {Where Was God Before Genesis?} Where was God before Genesis 1? If space, matter, and time was created, what was before it? Heaven and the angels already existed, so where was the “nothing” where God created everything in Genesis 1?\n7. 45:01 {About Jesus’ Omnipresence} I have a question about God’s nature. Since the Godhead hold all of their being in one indivisible present, in theory, could Jesus have been on Earth and in Heaven concurrently?\n8. 53:12 {The Atonement: The Importance of Jesus’ Deity} Why did Jesus have to be God to be the acceptable sacrifice? If it was Jesus’ humanity that died on the cross and not His divine nature, why did Jesus have to be fully God?\n9. 59:34 {Can Christians Benefit from Secular Therapy?} What are your thoughts on secular therapy for a Christian? Self-help and self-idealization seem antithetical to the Bible. Why isn't the counsel of Scripture and other believers enough?\n10. 1:06:54 {Must Jesus be Lord of Our Lives?} Does receiving Christ begin with you trusting in His death and resurrection, or is there more to do, such as submitting to His lordship and then we are saved?\n\n1:12:15 Bonus Q! What are your 3 favorite books of the Bible, and why? No cop-outs!

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference \n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:41 {Is All Sin the Same?} Is it biblical to say that all sin is the same, and is equally bad?\r\n2. 14:14 {Prophets Today?} Should the Church appoint/recognize official prophets, or is this something similar to apostles (only the original 12 + Paul)? See 1 Corinthians 12: 28, Ephesians 4: 11. Is it an office, a gift, or some mixture of the two? \r\n3. 23:01 {Why Would God Allow a Pope?} Why would Christ allow someone to be appointed as His vicar on Earth? If the authority of the pope is illegitimate, how is that not the worst manifestation of blasphemy? How is it allowed by God?\r\n4. 29:20 {Resentful of the Father but Not the Son?} After a long and HARD life, I sometimes feel almost resentful of GOD the Father whom I’ve never seen, heard, or felt. But every day I love JESUS more and more. Is this normal?\r\n5. 36:09 {Why Doesn’t God Save Everyone?} My brother is an atheist and says he wouldn’t follow a God that he knows is real, who knowingly creates people who will reject Him and go to Hell, despite having power to save everyone. It’s hard to reason. Thoughts?\r\n6. 41:37 {Jesus’ Spirit Separate from HS?} Does Jesus have a distinct Spirit apart from the Holy Spirit? It seems that Jesus has His own Spirit (Luke 23: 46) that is distinct from the Holy Spirit.\r\n7. 45:39 {Questioning our Pastors?} My pastor said that since God called him to shepherd, unless he is teaching false doctrine, you don't question your pastor even if you don't agree with something or they do something wrong. Is this right?\r\n8. 54:15 {Advice for a Discouraged Pastor} I’m feeling discouraged in my new job as a youth pastor. I don’t know if I’m making an impact or if I’m meant to do this. Any advice?\r\n9. 59:57 {Transitioning from Cult to Christianity!} I’m in the process of leaving the LDS church for real Christianity (thank you for your videos!!). Do you have any advice or resources for the deconstructing and reconstructing of faith after leaving?\r\n10. 1:08:48 {Where is Jesus “Seated”?} What does Jesus sitting at the right hand of the Father mean when it’s also said that Jesus was seated on the throne in Revelation?\n\nI'm taking questions from the live chat... here are the rules.\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

He teaches many people through online ministry and has more visions and supernatural experiences than anyone in the Bible, it seems. I'll share evidence that he is a false prophet, deceiver, and shares obviously false experiences and even teachers some things that contradict the Bible. \n\nWhy do this? Because we are commanded to test all things.

Does it apply to keeping an unchanging devotion time with God? My goals can get legalistic.\n3. 22:05 {Slaves or Brothers?} Why in Scripture are we told we are the slaves of Christ, as well as the brothers of Christ?\n4. 24:57 {Shame and Pride Related?} Is the feeling of shame the byproduct of pride?\n5. 28:07 {Permissible Doubts vs. Double-mindedness} Can you explain the difference between the man in Mark 9: 24 and the double-minded man talked about in James 1:5-8? I find myself relating to the former a lot, but I also fear being double-minded.\n6. 37:36 {Choosing a Denomination: Important?} Do you think it's important to choose a denomination?

    "title": "Is Dawkins Smarter than God?",
    "description": "I can already feel the comments coming from people who don't understand the arguments I am making in this clip. Here they are again, in the hope that this causes them to stand out more clearly.\n\n1. Dawkins claims that if God exists he is still justified in disbelieving in God because Dawkins rightly assesses that the evidence suggests God doesn't exist. Hence, the question Dawkins gives about God making himself so hard to find.\n2. My first response is that countless people, including brilliant scholarly minds, do find evidence for God. The majority of people see that God is real through creation itself. This puts Dawkins in an awkward place of having to defend the idea that there's no evidence for God over and against not only the majority of humans (who Dawkins seems to think he is far smarter than, given that he tried to rebrand \"atheists\" as \"brights\") but also puts Dawkins against the majority of scholars who deal with the topic of God's existence (i.e. the smart people). This is why Dawkins and others in his circle deride the discipline of philosophy. It's because philosophers have so often called out their fallacious thinking. \n3. Independent of what the majority think, or what other \"smart people\" think, I offer the evidence of creation itself. While I can't defend that claim in a one minute short there are plenty who have defended it quite well. Look up the fine tuning argument, the cosmological argument, the argument from morality, and find many reasons to see that God is not hiding.\n\nThere's no sense in standing before God and thinking you'll be justified in your rejection of him. At some point a person has to be open to the idea that they have just been very wrong.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:18 {False Humility: Pride vs. Confidence} What does biblical humility look like, and how can Christians avoid pride while still being confident in their calling?\r\n2. 23:10 {Does God Speak to Unbelievers?} My Mormon friend said, “I felt like God was telling me…” while reading the Bible. Is that really God? Does He speak to unbelievers? How is it any different when Christians read the Word and pray?\r\n3. 26:47 {Salvation: Knowing the Exact Moment} I heard you talk about how you once questioned whether or not you were saved because you couldn’t name the specific time or event where it happened. How did you overcome that? I’m in the same situation.\r\n4. 31:29 {Tongues During Corporate Prayer?} How do I let someone know that when they pray in tongues during our corporate prayer time, it's distracting? I believe the gift of tongues is for personal edification. I'm not a Cessasionist, by the way. \r\n5. 38:46 {Faithful Believers in Unbiblical Offices?} What do you think about genuine Christians who have served in offices that aren't biblical, like bishops, priests, monks, etc.? Does God use faithful believers serving in unbiblical offices?\r\n6. 40:24 {How did Martha Know?} In John 11, when Martha says she knows her brother will rise in the resurrection on the last day, did she know that from the Old Testament, or from Jesus’ teachings?\r\n7. 42:36 {Jesus’ Sacrifice: Human Sacrifice?} If God doesn't allow human sacrifice, how do we reconcile Jesus' sacrifice?\r\n8. 46:38 {Balancing Kindness & “Tough Love”} How do you maintain kindness in the midst of tension while advocating for yourself or others? Some people lean toward kindness and don't speak up, while others lean toward speaking harsh truth, with an emphasis on harshness.\r\n9. 49:57 {Growing in Self-Discipline} Do you have any advice on how to become disciplined in life, such as in the realm of Bible study, sleep schedule, and working efficiently? How do I learn to force myself to do things?\r\n10. 52:15 {Guarding Against Greed & Corruption} As your influence grows, how do you personally guard against the temptations of greed and the misuse of power, like the corrupted leaders you're revealing?\n\n\nI'm taking questions from the live chat... here are the rules.\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:23 {My Sin Blocks My Prayers?} Psalm 66:18 says, \"If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.\" Does this mean God will ignore a person's prayers if they have active, ongoing sin in their life? How should we understand this verse in context and alongside other Scriptures about God hearing prayers?\r\n2. 9:07 {Biblically Defining a “Church”} Biblically (not legally), what constitutes a church? If someone were to host a weekly Bible study and do some volunteer work with just a few people, would that be considered a small church service? \r\n3. 15:29 {Support for Limited Atonement?} How does John 17:9 work alongside John 3: 16? Could John 17:9 be a valid point toward Limited Atonement? I do not want to believe in Limited Atonement, but I see verses like this and wonder.\r\n4. 24:40 {Discerning God’s Voice & Direction} My girlfriend recently told me that God told her to break up with me. She got us \"promise bracelets\" that promise that we will get married. Is what she heard really from God?\r\n5. 29:26 {Agape vs. Phileo Love} Are agape and phileo love synonymous in Greek? John 3: 19 & John 12: 43 use agape for loving darkness and men's praise, respectively, while John 5: 20 uses phileo to describe the Father's love for the Son.\r\n6. 34:29 {Non-Sapien Hominids: Thinking Biblically} How do non-sapien hominids (Neanderthal, Denisovan, Floresiensis, etc.) fit into creation? Do they have the Imago Dei? Are they animals?\r\n7. 39:19 {The Apostle John Still Alive?}  Have you ever heard the theory that the Apostle John might still be alive and be the second witness in the Tribulation? I found the arguments interesting, as conjecture.\r\n8. 45:47 {Is Anointing Oil for Today?} Should we still use oil anointing today (used by elders praying for the sick)? What would that look like?\r\n9. 52:00 {An Error in Translation?} In the NIV translation, Deuteronomy 22: 28-30 uses the word “rape,” but other translations imply consent. Is this a legitimate translation error?\r\n10. 57:16 {Are Charitable Tax Deductions Sinful?} Is claiming our charitable donations on our taxes “receiving our reward on Earth” (Matthew 6:1-5)?\n\nMy FULL teaching on divorce and remarriage according to the Bible. https://youtu.be/N2pC6ZikbYo?si=8D3Hm0sR5GdMi5AR\n\nMy original video on limited atonement and universalism, and why I see both as unbiblical. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKyQrAO3ps&pp=ygUdbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgbGltaXRlZCBhdG9uZW1lbnQ%3D\n\nAfter that original video I got a response from James White, I included his video and my response in a longer video focused just on the topic of limited atonement, here. https://www.youtube.com/live/shpZMRhr4uM?si=kldIApTPUBsJPBA8\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

How would he respond to Judaizers citing Genesis 17:9-14 on circumcision as necessary? Why doesn’t this apply now?\n4. 29:47 {Online Ordination: Mocking God?} My brother asked me to officiate his wedding. They’re not believers, and I’m female. The only way to do it is to get ordained online. That feels like mocking God and His church. Biblical thoughts?\n5. 34:48 {“Spirit Princes” – For Today?} Can you explain Daniel 10: 13 and 10: 20? What is the ‘spirit prince’ of the kingdom of Persia (NLT)? Is the concept of a spirit prince over a region only seen in the Old Testament, or can this happen today?\n6. 43:08 {How Could a Million Hear at Once?} How can the entire community of Israel, more than 1 million people, fit together & gather to hear (Leviticus 8:3, Deuteronomy 29: 10-12, 31: 10-13)?\n7. 47:44 {PSA – Contradicting Proverbs?} If Penal Substitutionary Atonement is an accurate doctrine, then isn't it contradicting Proverbs 17: 15?\n8. 53:11 {Encouragement through Arduous Times} What gives people the will to live in the midst of terror, hardship, poverty, pain, childhood abuse, loss, and all other types of calamity (specifically non-Christians, but also Christians)?\n9. 58:30 {Garden of Gethsemane: What is The Cup?} In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prays for the Father to let the cup pass from Him. I've understood the cup to be God's wrath, but Jesus says a few chapters later that James & John will drink it, too.\n10. 1:04:02 {Antichrist: Dead at Christ’s Coming?} Does the Antichrist die or not at Christ's coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8, Revelation 19: 20)?\n\nResources:\nPlaylist of my videos on Jehovah’s Witnesses https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHusHAi7fZiBBKR17rkK5EKk&si=7oZPmI-9vVMBvTQA\n\nPlaylist defending Penal Substitutionary Atonement https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHttVR0rkvhBfA-IKrg5SGcp&si=LujQjG2PXmwjLdP7\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:51 {Is Ash Wednesday Biblical?} Could you share your thoughts on Ash Wednesday and how Christians should understand and approach the day? Is it exclusively a Catholic observance, or is there a way for non-Catholics to participate? Should we participate at all?\n2. 22:01 {Bethlehem vs. Nazareth?} Why is Jesus in Bethlehem when the wise men come in Matthew 2:7-11? Luke 2: 22 and 2: 39 say they returned to Nazareth after the 40 day purification rites. Did Matthew make up their hometown as Bethlehem?\n3. 29:16 {1,000 Year Reign: On Earth?} Is there biblical evidence that the 1,000 year reign of Christ as described in Revelation is on Earth? I hear a lot about the 1,000 year reign specifically being on Earth, but I fail to see the word “Earth” anywhere. \n4. 34:22 {Ways our Worship Could Improve} What do you think about what the Bible teaches about principles of worship? How can our worship improve in the American Protestant churches?\n5. 41:27 {Does Calvinism Challenge God’s Justice?} I watched your video on Calvinism and it was amazing! But the question I still have is, does Calvinism go against God’s justice? God is just, and that’s a fact. Would that alone disprove Calvinism?\n6. 49:24 {Do God’s Children Deserve God’s Love?} We always say we don't \"deserve anything\" from God, but how biblical is this? Don't children deserve a degree of love from their parents?\n7. 54:43 {Passover vs. Yom Kippur} Why was Jesus' atoning sacrifice on Passover instead of Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement)? I've looked everywhere but can't find an answer.\n8. 58:27 {The Calling of a Pastor} I’m 17 and have a huge desire to go into pastoral ministry. I feel called and equipped for this, but hear a lot of people say God has to speak to you directly to do this.

Can you please explain this?\n10. 1:11:24 {How to be a “Fisher of Men”} What does it mean to be “fishers of men”? A leader at my seeker church said it meant to use bait to get them in.

Is that a possibility?\n3. 38:35 {David’s Story: Exempting Accountability?} How should we respond to people who use the story of David and other flawed biblical figures, whom God still used, to justify their own sinful behavior, especially when in positions of power?\n4. 45:48 {Are Body Piercings Sinful?} What does the Bible say about piercings? If a woman who serves in the worship ministry gets a belly piercing, should she no longer be allowed to serve in that ministry?\n5. 50:31 {Indwelling of the Spirit: How it Differs} What about the indwelling of the Holy Spirit makes us unique compared to Old Covenant believers? I’ve never quite grasped what difference it makes.\n6. 53:22 {Does the Spirit Still Teach & Guide Us?} Jesus tells the apostles that the Holy Spirit will “teach them all things” (John 14: 16) and “guide them into all the truth” (John 16: 13). What exactly does this entail, and was it only for the apostles?\n7. 1:00:34 {Reuel vs. Jethro: Contradiction?} Is there an explanation for why Moses’ father-in-law appears to have two different names (Exodus 2: 18 (Reuel) & Exodus 18:2 (Jethro))?\n8. 1:02:41 {Jonah: Failed Prophecies?} I recently had a Mormon claim it’s OK that Joseph Smith had failed prophecies because Jonah also did. He claimed Deuteronomy 18: 22 didn’t apply to either of them. Thoughts?\n9. 1:09:28 {Shad., Mesh., & Abed… Did they Know?} In Daniel 3: 16-18, how did Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego know that God would deliver them from the fiery furnace?\n10. 1:13:28 {Our Work in Eternity} Are there any hints in Scripture about what kind of work we will do in God's Kingdom in the future?\n\nThe false prophet Brandon Biggs https://www.youtube.com/live/hwisXDKSwdM?si=P4nx0TjEvhLvaCxw\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1 p.m. Pacific Time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:26 {Prophecy Always Positive?} Is the gift of prophecy always supposed to yield a positive, uplifting revelation? \n2. 20:38 {Praying Over Things?} What are your thoughts on praying over a house or object? Is that superstition?\n3. 24:23 {Giving Time vs. Money?} Is it ever OK to give time instead of money to church? How do we balance giving vs. saving, especially if giving might cause debt (Mark 12: 41-44, Romans 13:1-8)? I also have a family to provide for.\n4. 31:18 {Parable of the Wedding Feast} Can you please explain the parable in Matthew 22: 1-14 (The Parable of the Wedding Feast)? I don’t understand the meaning.\n5. 40:06 {Should I Be Rebaptized?} I fell out of the faith years ago and recently came back and feel like I should get baptized again. Is there anything for or against this in the Bible?\n6. 47:26 {Is God Selfish?} Do you believe that God is selfish in everything He does? It seems even His \"selfless\" acts are done for His own sake (Psalm 106:8, dying on the cross for His own glory, etc.). Would that motivation be wrong?\n7. 56:56 {Is Baptismal Regeneration Heresy?} Is believing that baptism is for the remission of sins based on Acts 2: 38 heresy? Is someone who was thusly baptized then not saved?\n8. 1:11:49 {Sinful Vows: Binding?} Are vows made in sin or amidst sinful circumstances still binding in eyes of God (Ecclesiastes 5:5, Joshua 9, Genesis 27, Judges 12)?\n9. 1:16:29 {Isaiah 14: About Satan?} Is Isaiah 14:3-20 about Satan? It says it is to the King of Babylon, but I have heard verses 12-14 used in reference to Satan. Just curious about your thoughts on it!\n10. 1:24:02 {Did David Violate Deut. 24?} How was David able to take Michal back as his wife? Isn’t that a violation of Deuteronomy 24, and does that apply today?\n\nMy first video on Bethel showing the problem of faking prophecy https://www.youtube.com/live/r3tEv26OMTU?si=rP_3AXPOPE70fFyA\n\nMy second video on Bethel, showing their are major problems beyond what I was aware in the first video.

Not only do I spend most of my time there, but all of my coworkers knew me pre-salvation. It’s a struggle.\r\n3. 33:06 {Should Children be Taught about Hell?} What should children who would go to Heaven if they die be taught about Hell, if anything? It may make them afraid that they would go there. \r\n4. 36:06 {The Unsaved: Prayer Priorities?} Is it appropriate to pray for the physical healing of an unsaved person? Isn’t it more reasonable to pray that they would come to faith in Christ? What is the \"prayer priority\" in this situation?\r\n5. 38:51 {Specific Moment of Salvation?} Do you have to have a specific date of salvation, or can salvation be a gradual thing/realization? This has been a debate within our current Bible study.\r\n6. 43:17 {God’s Omnipresence} Within God’s omnipresence, is that confined to spatial and spiritual dimensions? Or does that include Him being present across all of time, as well? As in He’s currently in all times all at once?\r\n7. 49:06 {Disqualifications for Serving?} What disqualifies someone from non-pastoral ministry? Are the rules for pastors the same for sound techs, ushers, etc.?\r\n8. 56:02 {Brands/Products: Letting in Spirits?} Are there specific brands or products that Christians shouldn‘t use? I’ve seen videos showing things like makeup products Christians shouldn't use because they let in spirits. Should I throw these away?\r\n9. 1:01:12 {Jacob’s Wrestling: Father or Son?} Do you believe Jacob wrestled with God the Father or God the Son (Hosea 12:4 and Genesis 32)?\r\n10. 1:06:44 {Tribulation Saints: Position in Heaven?}  In the pre-tribulation view of the rapture, if the raptured Church is the Bride of Christ, then what position/purpose in Heaven do the tribulation saints hold?\n\r\n11. 1:10:36 (Bonus) Prayer Request from Jacob: Can you and your listeners please pray for my sister Darby's pregnancy?

I just feel so stuck in my sin. I don’t know how to get out of this habit. I’m scared my repentance isn’t real.\n6. 1:31:29 {Sin in the Millennium?} Will there be sin in the Millennium?

I’ve heard that the Bible supports corporal punishment, but also that scientific studies say corporal punishment has negative outcomes. How do you reconcile these two things?\n8. 1:38:10 {Disciples: Not Recognizing Jesus?} There are some Scriptures where the disciples don’t recognize the resurrected Jesus. Is this because they are prevented by Jesus, or did He actually look different?\n9. 1:41:29 {Water & Blood: 1 John 4} What is the significance of the water and the blood in 1 John 4:6, 8?\n10. 1:45:03 {Relationships with Family in Eternity} What do you think our relationship will be like with family members in Heaven?

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:43 {The Pastor’s Salary: How MUCH?} How much should pastors be paid for their work in the ministry?\n2. 37:30 {Interpretations for Private Tongues?} When the gift of speaking in tongues is in operation, do the same requirements and standards exist for private/smaller ministry gatherings as they do the corporate gatherings of a church service? For example, if someone in the background is praying in tongues while you are praying for someone at a hospital, does that still demand an interpretation?\n3. 49:38 {Images of God: Ever Biblical?} Author J.I. Packer states that the 2nd commandment forbids using images of God for worship (such as paintings or statues/icons of God) and that images cannot capture His power & only serve as a crutch when worshiping Him. Thoughts?\n4. 58:19 {Was Jesus Tempted with Unbelief?} As a former atheist, the verse in Hebrews 4: 15 comforts and confuses me; how could the Son of Man be tempted with unbelief in Himself?\n5. 1:03:03 {Immediate or Messianic Prophecy?} It looks like Isaiah 7: 14 is fulfilled in Isaiah 8:4. The prophecy seems to describe something immediate and not messianic. What do we do with Matthew seemingly saying it is a messianic prophecy?\n6. 1:07:45 {How to “Obey the Gospel”} How do we answer those who think “obeying the Gospel” means physical obedience (works)? They cite verses like 1 Peter 1: 22, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Romans 10: 16, and Matthew 7: 21.\n7. 1:16:07 {Did The Apostles Misunderstand?} I’m struggling with the apostles believing that Jesus’ return was happening within their lifetime. How can we trust everything else they said to be inspired by God if they got this wrong?\n8. 1:22:22 {Not Enough Prayer in Church?} Why do we pray so little collectively during Sunday services? Singing makes up 40%, while praying roughly 1-2%. This does not seem to line up biblically or historically (Acts 2: 42; 1 Timothy 2:1-8).\n9. 1:28:55 {Gospel Contradictions?} Is there an irreconcilable contradiction in the Gospels as to whether Jesus instructed The Twelve to take a staff (Matt 10: 10, Mark 6:8)? How should this affect our view on inerrancy?\n10. 1:32:52 {Resolving to Follow Christ Amid Doubts} Can you be saved by choosing the Christian life at any moment and hoping it’s real, or do you have to be convinced? What conditions do you need from God or yourself? Do you have to be feeling a certain way?\n\n1:44:00 Bonus!

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:02 {What is Hades Like?} Looking at Luke 16: 19-31 (Rich Man and Lazarus), what does this parable teach us about the afterlife, and how literally should the depiction in that passage of Heaven and Hell be taken?\r\n2. 33:27 {Making Decisions “From Faith”} Is there a difference between indecisiveness and doing things “not from faith” (Romans 14: 23)? I struggle to make decisions and feel guilty about doing things without being 100% sure it’s God’s will.\r\n3. 46:03 {The Great Wealth Transfer} What is your opinion on the movement of \"The Great Wealth Transfer\" that prosperity preachers teach, where believers obtain unbelievers’ land and wealth?\r\n4. 51:09 {Difficult OT Passages} Nahum 3:5-6 is hard for me to reconcile with our holy and loving God. Can you help me understand this?\r\n5. 1:00:21 {Praying Biblically in Dire Situations} Is it a lack of faith in me to not pray for a miraculous healing for a fatal diagnosis in my baby I’m carrying, and instead be praying primarily for strength, comfort, and peace?\r\n6. 1:05:38 {Does Jesus NOW Know?} Did Jesus’ limits He placed on Himself while on Earth disappear once He resurrected/exalted to Heaven (Matthew 24: 36, No one knows the day or the hour except the Father)? Could Jesus know now?\r\n7. 1:10:22 {Should Morality be Legislated?} How do I respond to a Christian who thinks things (like abortion and transgenderism) are wrong but that they shouldn’t vote to have the government legislate against it to restrain/correct non-Christians (forcing it on them)?\r\n8. 1:17:10 {Avoiding the “Barn Building” Attitude} I feel the need/desire to make good money - that it's necessary to feel secure, to be a provider, and yes - to have some nice things (a house, vacations, etc.). Am I the Luke 12 barn builder?\r\n9. 1:24:07 {Spiritual Significance of The Election?} What do you think of invoking biblical figures like David, Cyrus, and Jehu when talking about President-elect Trump? Does his election have spiritual significance? \r\n10. 1:27:39 {Let “US” Make Man in “OUR” Image?} In Genesis 1: 26 God said, \"Let us make man in our image.\" Who is the “us” He’s talking about? \n\nHere is The Hebrews Series playlist (verse by verse through the book) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvbngIxNKt7fnkytLNO509g\n\nMy video exposing the false prophet Brandon Biggs https://www.youtube.com/live/hwisXDKSwdM?si=ebfAgByOpx19urME\n\nWhy Christians (and all governments) should support the death penalty. https://www.youtube.com/live/gf259Qv2qv4?si=3qCvLV28gyaLnaiw\n\nMy website is searchable and all the video and audio content is free https://BibleThinker.org\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:07 {Genesis: Different Views} What are the different interpretations that different Christians have about the book of Genesis and the creation accounts?\n2. 26:27 {Israel – God’s People or Moses’ People?} What’s the significance of God calling the Israelites Moses’ people in the golden calf story, and then Moses calling them God’s people? I can’t help but think it sounds like two parents of the same child saying “That’s your kid” as the child misbehaves (Exodus 32:1-14, specifically verses 7 and 11). \n3. 30:25 {Are our Souls Immortal?} Seventh-day Adventism claims that belief in an immortal soul comes from Paganism and leads to occult spiritualism (like necromancy and belief in ghosts). Is this biblical?\n4. 35:00 {Christians and Yoga} A family member does yoga for stretching, but in that quiet time they meditate, pray, and worship God. I know yoga for stretching is fine, but is worshiping while doing yoga an issue because of Deuteronomy 12: 30-31?\n5. 42:23 {Can Angels be Saved?} Does Colossians 1: 19, 20 suggest that Christ’s sacrificial death can be applied to fallen angels, as well?\n6. 47:04 {Can we Feel the Spirit Move?} Is “feeling the Spirit moving” biblical?\n7. 52:40 {Guilty of Unintentional Sins?} Are we guilty of sins we do not know we have committed (Leviticus 4: 27, 5: 17)?\n8. 57:53 {Prayer: How Long & How Many Times?} How long should our prayers be? I see many people online who need prayers, and I want to pray each night for everyone. It feels tedious & repetitive, but it feels wrong to pray for them only once. Thoughts?\n9. 1:01:45 {Salvation by Works in Revelation?} Is Revelation 14: 12 talking about salvation by works?\n10. 1:05:06 {From Intellect to Salvation} Is there a way for me to go from an intellectual belief in God to a relationship with God, or do I have to wait on Him for that?\n\nWhy we should not say all sins are the same https://www.youtube.com/live/Tp_lAMuX16k?si=LoOz2rFPXVILBOVf\n\nRefuting the idea that the Bible teaches a flat earth https://www.youtube.com/live/qePiXK_8Agc?si=DCyyVH1FCtUyFiMr\n\nAnalyzing \"The Physics of Heaven\" and Bethel/Bill Johnson's bridge to the New Age. https://www.youtube.com/live/weHo7pO6cmQ?si=XixymWvA_vMTitjT\n\nHere is The Hebrews Series playlist (verse by verse through the book) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvbngIxNKt7fnkytLNO509g\n\nMy website is searchable and all the video and audio content is free https://BibleThinker.org\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

If He does, is He able to change His future, or is He only able to do what He already knows He is going to do?\r\n4. 23:04 {By Grace, Through Faith, No Works} As a former strict, legalistic Orthodox, will I ever be able to grasp that salvation truly is by faith and NOT works? I STRUGGLE!\r\n5. 27:28 {The Temple – Continued Sacrifices?} What do we make of the Temple at the end of Ezekiel? It says God will dwell there, and sacrifices will be continued by Levites (Ch. 43:7; 19). Verse 27 indicates this will continue happening. \r\n6. 32:27 {Is “Bodybuilding” Biblical?} My friends and I love natural bodybuilding. Is it biblical to work on your body to one day showcase it in minimal clothing on a bodybuilding stage or on social media in a non-sexual way?\r\n7. 39:56 {True Peace in the Midst of Storms} Can you give us some thoughts on how to have peace and joy in Christ in this season, despite being stuck in some really messed up circumstances?\r\n8. 44:33 {Choosing Sides?} A friend of a friend asked why he has to “choose sides” (God or the Devil). Why can't he just remain neutral? He claims it's not really free will when there's only one “right side.” \r\n9. 48:35 {Purity in the Marriage Bed} Are married Christian couples allowed to engage in things like kink, costumes, and roleplay in the bedroom? Hebrews 13:4 states that the marriage bed must remain pure. But what is in and out of bounds?\r\n10. 53:40 {David’s Salvation – Murderer?} If according to John, no murderer has eternal life abiding in him (1 John 3: 15), how do we explain David’s salvation, since he had Uriah killed?\r\n58:24 Bonus Q!

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:13 {A Child’s Stage of Accountability} My three-year-old passed away in a tragic accident. I’ve heard that infants are welcomed into God’s presence when they die, but what about a slightly older child? Is my daughter in Heaven?\r\n2. 21:06 {Author Unknown = Still Inspired?} Can we be confident that a book of the Bible is truly inspired and belongs in the canon if the author is unknown (like Hebrews)? If we don’t know who wrote it, how can we trust what it contains? How can we know it wasn’t just the written version of a sermon? A pastor may be educated, but they aren’t inerrant.\r\n3. 27:40 {The Kingdom – “Suffered Violence”?} Can you help me to contextually understand Matthew 11: 12? Teachings I’ve heard have made no sense, and I have tried to understand it myself, but I’m not sure if I’m understanding what Jesus was saying here.\r\n4. 35:09 {50/50 Churches?} My LDS husband wants me and our kids to go to his ward & my church, split 50/50 every other week. Should I submit to him and do this, or should I get out completely from doing this? See 2 Kings 5: 17-19 and Psalm 1:1. \r\n5. 42:01 {Grain Offering = More Holy?} In Leviticus 2:9-10, the part of the grain offering for the priests is \"a most holy part.\" Why is the part that the priests eat more holy than the memorial portion that is burned on the altar?\r\n6. 44:24 {Avoiding Anger while Guiding Others} I see a lot of New Age-ish things (energy, manifesting, vibes) creeping into Christ followers’ lives around me. I’ve gotten blow-back trying to correct people in love. Do you have any advice about how to continue the conversation without angering them?\r\n7. 47:48 {Malachi 4, Elijah & The End Times} Does the last verse of Malachi 4 suggest that Elijah will be one of the two witnesses in Revelation?\r\n8. 51:37 {Dying to Sexual Addictions} I’m only 18, but I’ve been addicted to pornography for 5 years now, which slowly turned homosexual over time. Can you please explain the past tense of “died” in Romans 6:2? Am I dead to sin, or do I die?\r\n9. 1:01:49 {How to Biblically Confront an Elder} How should a church member confront an elder biblically? Is Matthew 18 still applicable, or is there another text that applies since they are an elder?\r\n10. 1:05:09 {Baptized in the Name of Jesus Only?} Why were people baptized in Jesus’ name in the book of Acts? I was challenged by this question and can’t figure it out. \r\nBONUS Q! 1:07:59 We'll probably never find every artifact or an original manuscript. But what is on your list of top biblical artifacts you hope are discovered? Israel in Egypt is one of mine.\n\nMy full video on the biblical case for infant salvation https://www.youtube.com/live/d9l0nbqjKHg?si=UVvH7pxCzbwoddgO\n\nMy full review of Joel Osteen’s “Mary” movie. https://www.youtube.com/live/K70XCtiwYOE?si=WMqTIuyImUKQ9fTe\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\r\n\r\n0:00 - Intro\r\n1. 1:27 {Leading When You Don’t Feel Worthy} How do you lead as a husband when you’ve betrayed and dishonored your wife and are not “worthy” of the respect of your wife’s submission?\r\n2. 6:15 {Submitting to Overbearing Leadership} How does submission work with an overbearing husband? Is it ever OK to say, “You’re overstepping your role”?\r\n3. 22:24 {Earning Your Wife’s Trust/Respect} How does a husband win his wife’s trust and respect? Are there any virtues or goals that might be helpful in earning her trust?\r\n4. 28:03 {Spiritual Intimacy in Marriage} What does the Bible say about pursuing spiritual intimacy in a marriage, and how might a husband initiate and a wife respond to that pursuit?\r\n5. 32:03 {Can a Wife Pursue a Career?} Is it God’s ideal design that the wife is a housewife or stay at home mom rather than having a full-time career? What if it isn’t part of God’s will for them to have children?\r\n6. 43:32 {Wife Provides = Husband Neglects?} Does a husband submit to his wife by being a provider? Is a married couple living in sin if their roles are reversed?\r\n7. 43:56 {Submission & Initiative in Harmony} How do submission and taking initiative fit together?\r\n8. 47:35 {Servant Leadership in Marriage} How does servant leadership look in your marriage? And can you elaborate on “according to her gifts”?\r\n9. 51:20 {Meaning of “Weaker Vessel”} What does “weaker vessel” mean?\r\n10. 53:59 {Headship & The Fall} Is Adam ruling over his wife in Genesis 3: 16 a godly ruling or a domineering ruling over his wife? What does this mean for husbands and wives today?\r\n11. 57:49 {Finding a Good Counselor} What are the necessary considerations for finding a trustworthy and appropriate marriage counselor(s)?\r\n12. 1:00:12 {When a Wife Refuses to Submit} If a husband wants to exercise headship and his wife struggles with this, what should the husband do?\r\n13. 1:03:31 {Marital Dynamics} We are very much best friends but how can we learn the husband/wife part?\r\n14. 1:06:37 {Following Jesus’ Lead} How does Jesus lead the Church, and what can earthly husbands take away from His example?\r\n15. 1:12:29 {Why the Church Struggles} Why does this topic within the American church hold such a minority position?\r\n16. 1:16:51 {More BibleThinker Content!} Where do we find brother Winger’s talks/videos?\r\n17. 1:17:09 {Comp. vs. Egal. Divorce Rates} Are divorce rates substantially different between Christian complementarian couples and Christian egalitarian couples?

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:10 {Can Fallen Leaders Be Restored?} Can fallen pastors who have engaged in egregious sin be restored back to ministry? \r\n2. 52:33 {Jesus’ Ministry – Which Nature?} Do you believe Jesus did His ministry of preaching, teaching, and healing out of His divinity, or out of His humanity empowered by the Holy Spirit, in light of Matthew 3: 16-17, etc.? What about us?\r\n3. 58:06 {Being Zealous for God’s Glory} In light of God's zeal for His own glory in all the Earth (see Ezekiel 36: 22-23; Psalm 46: 10; 2 Chronicles 6: 32-33), how can Christians be zealous for His glory among the nations, especially those who cannot go?\r\n4. 1:00:52 {“The River” = Heaven?} Is there a biblical basis for songs about “crossing the river” into Heaven, or is that just Greek mythology? Is the Jordan River a legitimate biblical metaphor for dying and going to the Promised Land/Heaven?\r\n5. 1:05:55 {Thinking Biblically about All Creation} Since all is God’s creation, will God hold us blameworthy for killing insects and other critters like cockroaches, mosquitoes, bees, spiders, mice, etc.?\r\n6. 1:09:46 {Can the Unsaved Seek God?} Can people not yet saved seek after God? Jesus tells us in Matthew 7:7 to “…seek and knock and it will be opened,” but in Romans 3: 10 it says “There is no one who understands; There is no one who seeks God.” \r\n7. 1:12:31 {Lazarus’ Resurrection – Missing?} I find the fact that the resurrection of Lazarus is missing from the Synoptics and the epistles to be unsettling. Do you have any insights on why such a massive claim is not in the earliest texts?\r\n8. 1:16:52 {“By Faith” vs. “Through Faith”} What is the difference between “by faith” and “through faith” in Romans 3: 30?\r\n9. 1:19:49 {Investing in Rental Properties – Sin?} I would like to start investing in rental homes. Is this flat out a sin and should I be just giving my excess to the needy people, or is it OK to invest to earn more, and just give then?\r\n10. 1:21:35 {Are My Dreams from God?} My pastor says you can tell if a dream is from God by whether or not it aligns with Gods Word, but also if it’s very bright, warm, and vivid. He says if you’re afraid in the dream, then it’s not from God. Is that true? \n\nAre Christmas Trees idols?

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:18 {A Biblical View of Immigration} What are some biblical thoughts surrounding the political issue of immigration?\r\n2. 49:40 {Confessing Your Faith when Difficult} I'm a 30 y/o woman in SoCal, financially dependent on my Muslim parents. I've studied for years and I’m now feeling called to Christ. I fear being kicked out. Any advice on how to tell them I'm Christian?\r\n3. 52:03 {Eternal Begottenness?} Should we hold to eternal begottenness of the Son which seems to suggest that the Son was caused? It seems orthodox, but wrong to say of God.\r\n4. 56:13 {When Discipline turns to Drudgery} William Booth says, “We ought not consult feelings but do our duty.” How does that not then become drudgery? How do we be disciplined like Daniel, yet not mechanical?\r\n5. 58:11 {Hosting Sinners in our Homes} Is 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 only for corporate gatherings or also for private gatherings such as family meals, etc.? Should Christians host professing Christian family members who are living in unrepentant sin?\r\n6. 1:03:00 {Overcoming Difficult Addictions} I’ve tried SO many times trying to quit vaping. I’m starting to feel like a bad Christian. Any advice?\r\n7. 1:04:51 {Contemplative Prayer} I'm curious about contemplative and listening prayer practices promoted in my church. Are they rooted in or influenced by Eastern mysticism or New Age ideologies?\r\n8. 1:08:01 {Why Didn’t God Forbid Polygamy?} If verses like Exodus 21: 10 aren't supporting polygamy but protecting women in a bad situation, why didn't God just outlaw polygamy outright? I agree with you, but don't know how to counter this argument.\r\n9. 1:13:10 {Obeying our Conscience} Is Romans 14: 23 about emotional doubt or intellectual doubt? For example, I'm mentally convinced that ham is OK to eat but I still doubt it emotionally. Which is my conscience to obey?\r\n10. 1:17:21 {What is a Heart of Flesh?} What does giving us a heart of flesh mean, when flesh is usually negative?\n\nIf you want more info on this issue of immigration and the Bible I recommend reading this very short book. It's also free. I am not saying I agree with everything in it but I think it's generally useful. https://americanevangelicals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wise-Welcome-2024-with-cover-Hoffmeier-June-7-2024.pdf\n\nAnalyzing Rob the Polygamy guy: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TW0zYjPURoM\n\nShowing how four polygamy proponents twist Scripture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIlyDjxYtKQ\n\nMy video on why the death penalty is biblical and all nations should have one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf259Qv2qv4\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

Do you think \"all things\" has been misused historically? Will other translations follow?\r\n3. 14:52 and 19:57 {Unforgivable Sin in The Didache?} In the Didache, judging the spirits wrongly was included as the unforgivable sin. Could you explain why you think that is not the case?\r\n4. 17:17 {Apathy vs. Anxiety} I have a lot of guilt/shame about not suffering for Christ the way missionaries and the persecuted church do. How do I find the balance between lukewarmness and anxiety that I'm not doing enough?\r\n5. 27:27 {Can We Live More than 120 yrs?} How come people live more than 120 years when God said we wouldn’t in Genesis 6:3?\r\n6. 30:39 {Spiritual Power?} How can I argue biblically against the idea that we gain personal power/status in the spiritual realm by being full of the Spirit, and how does this relate to abiding in Christ & James 5-16?\r\n7. 37:51 {Advice for Depression & Spiritual Dryness} When I was a teen, I had depression leading to a suicide attempt. Through God I'm still here, married, and have a family. I read/study the Bible and pray, but I feel lost and far from God.

    "description": "Most people don't realize that Hebrews 1 refers to the apocryphal book \"The Wisdom of Solomon\" in addition to Proverbs 8. Once you do, this raises questions about whether or not Hebrews is teaching that Jesus was created, since those other books indicate that Wisdom was created and Hebrews connects Jesus to that very concept of Wisdom. We'll dig deep on that topic as we continue this detailed, verse by verse study of the book of Hebrews.\n\nMy notes from todays' study https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Heb-002-new.docx\n\nNew Hebrews series videos added here as they come out. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvbngIxNKt7fnkytLNO509g\n\nHow often will I livestream this series?\nUnlike series in the past I won't have a particular live stream schedule for this. It won't be every week but, whenever I do make a new teaching in this series, I will try to do it on Monday's at 1pm Pacific time to have some degree of consistency.\n\nDo you want more real Bible studies?

Especially those actively trying to kill those you love.\n5. 43:07 {Church Coffee Shops – Sinful?} A church in town opened a coffee shop in the foyer. Some say it's akin to a marketplace in the Temple, and others say since it's run at cost (or even below cost) that it's fine. What are your thoughts?\n6. 48:55 {Paul & the Female Slave} Why was Paul annoyed with the possessed female slave in Acts 16: 16 when she was actually telling the truth? What about Philippians 1: 18?\n7. 54:47 {Does God Grant Our Belief?} What does Philippians 1: 29 mean when it says that God \"grants\" us belief in Him? Is this deterministic?\n8. 1:00:29 {Anger at God’s Word?} Do you have any specific advice on how to deal with emotions while reading the Bible? Recently, I can’t even get through a few verses without feeling overwhelmed with anger or frustration!\n9. 1:04:30 {Exodus: Conjugal Rights vs. Adultery?} Exodus 21: 10 says a man married to multiple women shouldn't deny them conjugal rights. Isn't each instance of intimacy in that situation adultery against one wife?\n10. 1:12:22 {The Purpose of The Church} What is the biblical purpose of the church, and do you believe modern Christianity is fulfilling that purpose today?\n11. 1:22:46 Bonus: More commentary on question #6 above!\n\nLINKS you may be interested in\nIf a polygamist get's saved should he divorce his wives? https://youtu.be/CSQdSZbu1JY?si=WsCbNMA4XTb6uW4n\n\nThree videos on Jesus' predictions, which includes the partial fulfillment idea. \n1. https://www.youtube.com/live/2Ojg7BT3V68?si=BH5E6WjGMvE9-yIA\n2. https://www.youtube.com/live/U5XqtcMhSh8?si=qZFaJqy3jSQEnjVZ\n3. https://www.youtube.com/live/G6_qnyMvsvI?si=nLO5ScD7tAfKPzR3\n\n\"I'm Rob, the Christian Polygamy Guy.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/TW0zYjPURoM\n\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "title": "Catholic authority contradicted",
    "description": "In my experience, many people misunderstand the weight of this point. They do not deal in a straightforward manner with the fact that Paul's teaching here requires that normal Christians (not a special class of clergy, bishop, or pope) be able to reason and compare what every potential authority may say (including angels or even apostles) with what is known for certain to be the prior teaching of the apostles. The only place that content is found for sure, in the current day, is in the text of Scripture. This simply demands a situation where normal Christians are not only allowed, but required, to ascertain whether a teaching from a church father, a church council, or even a pope, is in contradiction with what the apostles gave us in the text of the New Testament. \n\nIf you hear anyone push back on this reasoning, as I know many will, please make sure that they are understanding it properly first. It certainly doesn't work to claim that this principle was only applicable to the Galatians in the first century, or only applies to whatever mysterious and unknowable content they may have personally heard, rather than to the foundation which was laid at that time. I see no way for the authority claims of the pope to survive Galatians 1:8.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

I ask irrespective of Calvinistic irresistible grace. Luke 17: 31-36 seems to indicate both.\r\n3. 34:09 {The Multiple Beings of Polytheistic Religions} If God is one being and three persons (one “WHAT” and three “WHOs,” what would two beings of gods look like in false religions? How would those beings be differentiated in a way that the Trinity is not?\r\n4. 40:00 {About Natural Selection} Regarding natural selection, I recently had a class on that topic in college and was a bit confused on how we, as Christians, should approach that topic with others.\r\n5. 44:37 {No Persecution = No Godliness?} 2 Tim 3: 12 says, “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.” I’m not being persecuted. Does this mean I’m not living a godly life?\r\n6. 49:56 {King Nebuchadnezzar – Saved?} I was wondering your thoughts on King Nebuchadnezzar. Do you think he was saved, based on Daniel 4?\r\n7. 1:00:17 {Does Satan Always Need God’s Permission?} Does Satan have to come to God any time he messes with us? I have a friend using Job as proof that Satan needs permission to mess with us, too.\r\n8. 1:06:17 {Jesus Calling Out for Elijah?} On the cross, why did the Jewish people think Jesus was calling out for Elijah (Matthew 27: 47)?\r\n9. 1:07:49 {Staying Encouraged in Today’s Culture} How do you stay encouraged in today’s culture? The culture is so discouraging.

The doctrine essentially teaches that God will punish people for something completely out of their control, which makes God seem unjust.\r\n6. 1:02:35 {Is God Prideful?} Is God prideful? If our purpose in life is to glorify God, does that mean we were created only to praise Him? I know He is worthy of praise, but was He seeking praise by creating us?\r\n7. 1:05:49 {Bible Typography} How important is Bible typography? For example, the way the KJV arranges paragraphs makes context harder to understand than in the ESV.\r\n8. 1:10:12 {Standing With Israel?} With all of the tensions and things going on over in Israel, how should we be responding to those we’re surrounded by who hate Israel? They don’t seem to understand why we stand with Israel.\r\n9. 1:13:56 {Was Simon Always “Peter”?} Catholics always say Jesus changed Simon’s name to Peter. However, previous verses (Matthew 16: 16, John 21: 15, Matthew 4: 18, and Luke 5:8) refer to him as Simon Peter. Jesus says, “You are Peter…” not “From now on, you are Peter.” Was Simon always known as Peter?\r\n10. 1:20:35 {Adam – “Leave & Cleave”?} How do you interpret Genesis 2: 24? How could Adam come with such a statement, since he had no earthly mother or father?\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "When God does something that would be considered sinful if I were to do it, it is not sin. This isn't a double standard, it is the recognition of God's place as God. If a child punishes a parent by grounding them and telling them that they can't go out it is a sin, but when a parent does it we have a different metric based on their role. God is far above any parent, government, or any other authority, and he can pull rank whenever he sees fit to do so. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:10 {The Chosen’s New Book} Did The Chosen make their own Gospel?\n2. 29:00 {Our Attitude when God Works Through Us} Is it sinful for a Christian to be pleased when God enables them to do a good work (Isaiah 64:6, Galatians 6:4)?\n3. 34:27 {Is YHWH Biased?} How do we know YHWH isn't just BIASED with His Word (as one would be in any form of competition), when God says \"There is no other, beside Me there is no God\" in Isaiah 45:5 or \"I know not any\" in Isaiah 44:8?\n4. 43:27 {Did Christ Become the HS?} Does 1 Corinthians 15: 45 mean that Christ became the Holy Spirit? I was taught this growing up, but it seems like Modalism to me now. I can’t break from this reading of the verse since I left that group.\n5. 54:30 {How to Love Your Neighbor As Yourself} What does it mean to love your neighbor as yourself? Do I put their needs equal to mine, or above mine?\n6. 58:48 {Are Believers “Priests”?} What are the implications of believers being called to be \"A Holy Priesthood\" (1 Peter 2:5)? Does this mean we need to view ourselves as priests?\n7. ​1:04:00 {Typology = Eisegesis?} Is it eisegesis to interpret the Old Testament as depicting Jesus? I commonly hear this objection from Jews who say Christians are \"inserting their theology into our book.\"\n8. ​1:10:29 {Tongues = Vain Repetition?} Would it be fair to consider the way some churches use tongues in opposition to 1 Corinthians 14 as a form of \"vain repetition\" (Matthew 6:5-8)?\n9. ​1:19:23 {How to Know if We Should Marry Someone} What are some biblical ways to help you decide if you should marry someone?\n10. 1:24:24 {Why Evangelize?} Why should we evangelize, other than because God tells us to? If it would be God's will for someone to hear about Him, wouldn't God's will happen anyway? And based on Matthew 10: 14-15, wouldn’t they be worse off?\n\nLinks that may interest you...\n\nA playlist of videos teaching through the Gospel of Mark from start to finish. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj81y0U7Tmw&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF&pp=gAQB\n\nThe Evidence for the Bible playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596&si=IoVpOe9JJh5Bhp0t\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:31 {How to Pray Without Ceasing} What does it mean to \"pray without ceasing\" as instructed in 1Thessalonians 5: 17, and how do we practically achieve this?\n2. 17:44 {Proof of Annihilationism?} Does Isaiah 66: 24 prove annihilationism? The only counter verse seems to be Revelation 14: 10-11 and most of the Bible talks about Sheol, perishing, or the wages being death.\n3. 25:35 {WHY is Cussing Wrong?} I know I'm \"supposed to\" believe cuss words are bad to use as a Christian, but can you help me REALLY understand why? Most of them don't \"feel\" wrong to say in casual settings, especially if I'm by MYSELF (home alone and I trip or something).\n4. 33:11 {Demons Drowning – Why?} When Jesus cast the Legion of demons into the swine, why do they proceed to drown themselves? It showed the validity of the man being healed, but what was the actual reason for the demons to do so?\n5. 38:37 {Can We Truly Learn if Forgiven?} My friend says he doesn't want forgiveness because he won't learn from his mistakes if he doesn't face consequences. How would you respond?\n6. 45:26 {Must All People Hear before Rapture?} Does Matthew 24: 14 teach that the rapture will not happen until all people groups hear the Gospel? Or could Christ return before this happens?\n7. 53:39 {Marriage in God’s Eyes} What does it take for someone to be considered married in the eyes of God? A ceremony? A presiding religious leader? Religious words spoken? Having a legal certificate? Intimate acts?\n8. 1:01:35 {Are We Judged Twice?} Are we judged twice? Luke 16: 19-23 and Revelation 20: 11-13 suggest so.\n9. 1:09:41 {Can WE Bless GOD?} Popular worship song lyrics say things like \"I bless You\" (as in we humans can bless God) and \"You are enough, so I am enough.\" Is this biblical? Does Christ's righteousness imparted onto us also make us \"enough\"?\n10. 1:20:27 {Voting for the “Lesser of 2 Evils”?} Is it biblical to vote for “the lesser of two evils”? Could you point to something in Scripture to help us understand why or why not?\n\nLinks you may be interested in...\nWhat is the Abomination of Desolation (the sign of the end times) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5XqtcMhSh8\nWhat we got wrong about the end times https://www.youtube.com/live/2Ojg7BT3V68?si=vr7wCc0LlqaOt3h2\nMore on Trump https://www.youtube.com/live/m_ixN7ySlrY?si=oPcKsajoVcO5xm7p\nOn Christian cussing https://youtu.be/alm2C9_xrLg?si=mC-fgYBYbIhzOXMm\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

Why doesn’t God do it for everyone today?\r\n2. 25:45 {More Than One Interpretation?} Can Scripture have more than one correct interpretation? I know Psalm 22 can, but Catholics believe this is so with Peter as the rock in Matthew 16: 18 or Mary in Revelation 12. Is there a good method to test Scripture for this?\r\n3. 36:00 {Multiplying Gifts & Producing Fruit} What does the word “interest” mean (spiritually speaking) in Luke 19: 23? How can one not multiply God’s gifts but still produce fruit?\r\n4. 44:13 {Learning from Fallen Pastors?} Do you think it's wise to listen to preachers who have \"fallen from grace\" like Mark Driscoll? I find much of his preaching very life-giving, but I get judgment from other Christians.\r\n5. 52:26 {The Purpose of the HS’s Intercession} In Romans 8: 26-27, does the Spirit intercede in order to clarify what's in our hearts to God, or is it more to help us understand God's will and how He can help us mend our troubled hearts?\r\n6. 57:04 {Is there Time in Heaven?} Looking at these passages, is there time in Heaven? 2 Peter 3:8, Ephesians 1: 10, Revelation 21, Daniel 9: 13.\r\n7. 1:07:51 {Do our Lives Affect our Eternity?} Is our ability to rule and reign with God in His new world forever (Revelation 22:5) dependent on how we serve God in our lifetime for His mission (Luke 19: 17)? \r\n8. 1:12:57 {Serving God in our Professions} I am a DJ on a secular radio station. Knowing what's in many of the songs, I wonder if I am not pleasing the Lord by being in this job. Is this a matter of conscience?\r\n9. 1:16:38 {Did Jonah Actually Die?} Did Jonah die? I was introduced to this theory by social media and was surprised to see a lot of people think he died and was risen based off of Jonah 2:1-6, Jewish tradition, and The Sign of Jonah.\r\n10. 1:25:05 {Nazarite Vows – Why Long Hair?} If long hair for men is a disgrace by nature (1 Corinthians 11: 14), then why is it part of the Nazirite vow in Numbers 6:5? \n\nLinks you may want:\n\nMy church is having a Men's Conference: details HERE (just scroll to the bottom of the page at this link) https://graceevfree.org/ministries/mens-ministry/\n\nMy video on head coverings, where I also get into men's hair length. https://youtu.be/keXayp7JXf4?si=4vo9N8tQENs6C6hO\n\nEvidence for the Resurrection of Jesus (playlist) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHtGt3uB070ZiNbi06gII4L_\n\nMy website: https://BibleThinker.org\n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:23 {Is God Ignoring Your Prayers?} If prayer is effective, why do so many prayers seem to go unanswered, especially in desperate situations? \r\n2. 32:12  {Children/Procreation on the New Earth?} How are there children in the Eternal Kingdom on Earth (Isaiah 11:6-9)? Any child resurrected would mature during the Millennium, right? Does this mean there could be procreation on the New Earth?\r\n3. 39:44 {Having our Roots Deep in Christ} I recently read Mark 4 (the Parable of the Sower) and was convicted about not having my roots deep enough in Christ. What are some practical ways of achieving this?\r\n4. 47:05 {Jesus’ Deity in Scripture} Where does the Bible teach that the deity of Jesus is a salvation/damnation issue? For example, in Athens (Acts 17), it seems weird that Paul didn't explicitly teach this. John 8, perhaps?\r\n5. 57:52 {When Parents Oppose Church Attendance} My parents are Mormon. I'm an 18 year-old Christian. They don't want me to go to a Christian church. How do I confront them or ask them if I can go back? Any advice would be great.\r\n6. 1:02:49 {“God Bless You” to Non-Believers?} Is it appropriate to say to a non-believer, “May God bless you,” e.g., in a greeting card or in a new endeavor? It could be perceived as “May God give you good stuff.”\r\n7. 1:06:28 {Unequally Yoked Wedding Attendance?} Considering 2 Corinthians 6: 14-16, is it OK to go to a wedding when you know the couple is unequally yoked?\r\n8. 1:14:54 {Disciples Knew they Had the Spirit?} In Acts 19:2, Paul asks the disciples if they have received the Holy Spirt. How would they KNOW they received the Holy Spirit? Was there a type of evidence then that we don’t necessarily see today?\r\n9. 1:22:05 {Evangelism for the Ineloquent} Everyone seems to have their way of sharing the Gospel: street-preaching, pastoring, etc. How do I know how God has called me to share the Gospel? I'm not good socially, but I want to reach people.\r\n10. 1:27:03 {Secular Songs During Worship?} What are your thoughts on Churches playing a secular song before worship? They’ve defended this practice with 1 Corinthians 9. \n\nDidn't Jesus promise we would get what we prayed for?

    "description": "Here are MORMON sources showing that the two are incompatible.\n\n“My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join... I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in His sight; that those professors were all corrupt... He again forbade me to join with any of them;\"\n- Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., Joseph Smith–History, v. 1, pp. 8–26\n\n\"...all the priests who adhere to the sectarian religions of the day with all their followers, without one exception, receive their portion with the devil and his angels.\"\n- Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr. , The Elders Journal, v. 1, no. 4, p. 60\n\n“Nothing less than a complete apostasy from the Christian religion would warrant the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”\n- Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., History of the Church, v. 1, p. xl\n\n\"Brother Taylor has just said that the religions of the day were hatched in hell. The eggs were laid in hell, hatched on its borders, and then kicked on to the earth.\"\n- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 6, p. 176\n\n\"When the light came to me I saw that all the so-called Christian world was groveling in darkness.\"\n- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 5, p. 73\n\n\"With a regard to true theology, a more ignorant people never lived than the present so-called Christian world.\"\n- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 8, p. 199\n\n\"The Christian world, so-called, are heathens as to the knowledge of the salvation of God\"\n- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 8, p. 171\n\n“...the time came when Paganism was engrafted into Christianity, and at last Christianity was converted into Paganism rather than converting the Pagans. And subsequently the Priesthood was taken from among men, this authority was re-called into the heavens, and the world was left without the Priesthood—without the power of God—without the Church and Kingdom of God.”\n- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 22, p. 44\n\n\"Christianity...is a perfect pack of nonsense...the devil could not invent a better engine to spread his work than the Christianity of the nineteenth century.\"\n- Prophet John Taylor, Journal of Discourses, v. 6, p. 167\n\n\"Where shall we look for the true order or authority of God? It cannot be found in any nation of Christendom.\"\n- Prophet John Taylor, Journal of Discourses, v. 10, p. 127\n\n\"What! Are Christians ignorant? Yes, as ignorant of the things of God as the brute beast.\"\n- Prophet John Taylor, Journal of Discourses, v. 13, p. 225\n\n\"What does the Christian world know about God? Nothing... Why so far as the things of God are concerned, they are the veriest fools; they know neither God nor the things of God.\"\n- Prophet John Taylor, Journal of Discourses, v. 13, p. 225\n\n\"Both Catholics and Protestants are nothing less than the ‘whore of Babylon' whom the Lord denounces by the mouth of John the Revelator as having corrupted all the earth by their fornications and wickedness. Any person who shall be so corrupt as to receive a holy ordinance of the Gospel from the ministers of any of these apostate churches will be sent down to hell with them, unless they repent.\"\n- Apostle Orson Pratt, The Seer, p. 255\n\n“This great apostacy commenced about the close of the first century of the Christian era, and it has been waxing worse and worse from then until now. A short time after the death of the last of the Apostles, the Christian Church, what few of them remained, were persecuted from mountain to mountain, from den to den, from one cave of the earth to another, and from nation to nation until they were entirely exterminated and rooted out of the earth. Well, what was left? An apostate Christianity, a Christianity without revelators, without any voice of God, without any Prophets to unfold the future, without visions, without any communications from the heavens.”\n- Apostle Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses, v. 18, p. 44\n\nI could go on with more quotes but I think this will suffice. \n\nEither Mormonism is true or Christianity is true, the two are incompatible. This isn't an insult, it's a fact of reality.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:33 {The Changing Morality of the Bible?} Why does God seem more wrathful in the Old Testament and more forgiving and loving in the New Testament? Does the Bible have changing morals?\n2. 33:29 {Balancing our Time Wisely} How can we find a healthy balance between time with God and entertainment, like reading non-Christian books?\n3. 37:34 {Burned Works = Unsaved Soul?} Regarding 1 Corinthians 3: 15, how can someone be saved if their work is burned up? Wouldn’t the frailty of their work suggest that their faith wasn’t true in the first place?\n4. 46:57 {The Point of the New Covenant} What’s the point of the New Covenant when salvation has always been through faith?\n5. 54:53 {Who is Asherah?} Who is Asherah? I saw a video that claims she’s God’s forbidden wife. Who is she, from a biblical perspective?\n6. 1:00:21 {How Much Detail do we Confess?} When we, as Christians, confess our sins to God, how detailed should we be? Two verses that come to my mind are Psalm 139: 23-24.\n7. 1:05:28 {When & How Much to Give to Others?} My wife’s nephew is transgender, is here illegally (USA), and recently got married to a man. He asked my wife if she could help pay for his immigration paperwork. Am I wrong for saying no?\n8. 1:12:43 {Be Quiet & MYOB?} In 1 Thessalonians 4: 11 we are told to be quiet and mind our own business. How does that play out in a time where there is so much wrong in the world and in the Church? How are you doing it? You are the best!\n9. 1:26:33 {Strengthening our “Study Muscles”} What are some ways to make reading the Bible easier? I’m not saying I want the Scriptures deluded or anything, but I’m not a very good reader and I just end up getting frustrated and quitting.\n10. 1:31:33 {Was Jesus Silent?} In Mark and Matthew, Jesus remains silent which amazes Pilate, but in John, He delivers explanations. What are your thoughts on this subject, and how would you handle it when presented?\n\nBonus Q for Fun! 1:34:28 Why do you and so many other pastors like the LOTR so much?\n\nActually Helpful links (none of them are sales related):\n\nEvidence for the Bible series playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596&si=k6KBoteJPmTVjhjd\n\nHow the sacrifices of Leviticus point to Christ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GOvVSZJxCU&t=11s&pp=ygUVbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgbGV2aXRpY3Vz\n\nHow the high priests' garments point to Christ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srh1SfiWSRc&pp=ygUYbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgaGlnaCBwcmllc3Rz\n\nThe book of Mark verse by verse study with emphasis on theology and apologetics  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF&si=sOw-AmnIIIgXPEN3 \n\nI do this live stream most Fridays at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:11 {Trump’s Christianity} Is Trump's Christianity real Christianity? Here are some of my concerns about the rise of cultural Christianity.\n2. 28:15 {Open vs. Closed Communion} What is your opinion on open vs. closed communion? Should the pastors or elders check who is taking the communion? 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 may support closed communion.\n3. 38:26 {Are Guardian Angels Biblical?} What is the biblical case for or against guardian angels? Are they a myth, or do we really all have individual angels following us around and helping us?\n4. 47:58 {Do False gods Exist?} When the Old Testament talks of false gods such as Moloch, what does that mean? Is it that they don't exist, or is the word \"false\" referring to them being untrustworthy/deceitful?\n5. 55:51 {Courage & Self-Control on Social Media} Do you think God expects us to post about controversial issues on our social media accounts? I don’t want to start needless arguments online, but I also sometimes worry that I’m being cowardly.\n6. 1:06:11 {Does Satan Have Free Will?} Given what Revelation 20:7-10 says, what is the probability that Satan will NOT deceive the nations when he's released from the abyss? Is it 0 or greater? If it is 0, does Satan have free will?\n7. 1:11:40 {Can we be Too Wayward to be Forgiven?} Romans 1: 24 says “God will give them up to the lust in their hearts to defile their bodies.” Can one be forgiven and come back to Christ if one thinks this has happened to them?\n8. 1:24:40 {Explaining a Confusing Passage} Can you please explain how you understand Revelation 22: 11? I was super confused the first time I read this verse.\n9. 1:26:16 {Is Love God’s Chief Trait?} Is love God’s chief trait, or just one of them? Is it right to call all He does (i.e., punishing sin) an act of love, or are some things done in keeping with His holiness, justice, etc.?\n10. 1:34:25 {Recorded Sermons & Prayers – Biblical?} What are your thoughts on listening to recorded sermons, specifically “praying along” with recorded prayers? How exactly does that work? I listen to you mostly after the fact, so it feels odd.\n1:40:33 Bonus Joke – Just for fun! In Genesis 4:8, Cain killed his brother. I feel like it was because he was Abel. Your thoughts?\n\nI take YOUR questions from the live chat on anything related to Christianity and thinking biblically about everything.\n\nFirst up, is Trump's Christianity real Christianity? And my concerns about the rise of cultural Christianity. I can already feel people getting mad at me and they don't even know what I'm going to say.

That doesn’t seem right to me. Could you give us your take?\r\n3. 25:37 {Are Insulting Names Sometimes Appropriate?} Does Jesus calling the Pharisees fools, vipers, and whitewashed tombs give Christians a license to call our enemies insulting names?\r\n4. 31:36 {Can a Vow to God be Cancelled?} At age 19, I made a lifetime vow to God (not marital) that 31 years later seems counterproductive in light of new insight & circumstances. Is there a biblical case to cancel a vow despite Ecclesiastes 5:4-6?\r\n5. 38:06 {Dangerous Recreational Activities} What does the Bible say about participating in dangerous activities, particularly those that are recreational, such as riding motorcycles, mountain climbing, big wave surfing, etc.?\r\n6. 46:30 {Chuck Missler & the Hologram Theory} Have you heard of Pastor Chuck Missler and his endorsement of the Hologram Theory (the idea that there is no gravity beyond our solar system, a holographic representation of God’s Creation)?\r\n7. 50:20 {Temptations from the Flesh vs. the Enemy} Is it possible to discern between temptations that come from Satan and those that come from within due to the sinful desires of flesh?\r\n8. 55:42 {Meaning of “To Live Is Christ”} What does it mean when Paul says \"For me to live is Christ”? I've never heard someone use a phrase where an action or state of being IS a person.\r\n9. 1:04:28 {The Sonship of Jesus} A local church believes Jesus was literally the Son of God before the incarnation who \"proceeded out of the Father\" just like Eve from Adam. Can you help me understand the Sonship of Jesus?\r\n10. 1:07:51 {Idolatry Today} What does idol worship look like in a more modern sense?\r\nBonus: 1:14:44 {Prayer Request} Will you pray for my mom, Kelly? She was diagnosed with breast cancer and has started chemo, but they found a mass on her liver. Not sure if it's cancer but it has grown in the last month. Through this she has been saved! We pray God's will is for her to be healed, but most importantly, for her testimony to live!\n\nI take YOUR questions from the live chat on anything related to Christianity and thinking biblically about everything.\n\nLINKS:\n\nThe new and dangerous Trump prophet, Brandon Biggs https://www.youtube.com/live/hwisXDKSwdM?si=YHA_Eb297OLdFUEU\n\nMy website: https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:40 {The Bible Doesn’t Exist?} Can you please respond to Abraham Piper’s claim that the Bible doesn’t even exist? \n2. 12:03 {Jesus’ Deity in Scripture} In Luke 4:9-12, Satan uses the term \"Son of God\" yet Jesus responds with Deuteronomy 6: 16. Is this a possible claim that Christ is God, similarly to how He takes God's names for Himself?\n3. 20:52 {Lack of Works = No Heaven?} Why do we only talk about what will get you into Heaven (faith or works or both)? The Bible seems to teach that only faith can get you in, but lack of works can keep you out. Any thoughts?\n4. 24:01 {Are Sinful Desires Sinful?} James 1: 15 speaks about your desire giving birth to sin, but if you have an evil desire, isn’t that already sin?\n5. 37:48 {Are Natural Disasters from God?} We recently had a tornado touch down here in upstate New York. How does one explain to a non-believer that the tornado was not from God? Was it man-made?\n6. 45:40 {Does Hebrews 1 Prove Cessationism?} Is Hebrews 1:1 supportive of the idea that there are no prophets since the 1st century as God only speaks from Jesus Christ? \n7. 54:14 {Does Blas. of the Spirit Debunk Calvinism?} Is the fact that we can commit Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit proof that Calvinism is false?\n8. 58:58 {Jesus & the Samaritan Woman} Was Jesus pointing out the sin of the Samaritan woman, or was He letting her know He understood her circumstances, considering women had little control over their marital status?\n9. 1:09:34 {Modalism & Oneness – Truly Saved?} Are people who believe in Modalism or Oneness doctrines truly saved? Should I allow my kids to participate in events at churches that believe in Modalism?\n10. 1:15:44 {Receiving the Holy Spirit} When does a Christian receive the Holy Spirit? The apostles, it seems, received the Holy Spirit twice (John 20: 22, Acts 2:1-4).

    "title": "10 Questions with Mike Winger SKEPTICS EDITION (Episode 21)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:40 {Discussing Biblical “Contradictions”!} Can you please discuss some different Bible passages that appear to be contradictory?\n2. 41:10 {Unnecessary Body Parts = Evolution?} I have a coworker that is an atheist. He said that there are parts of our bodies that are not necessary and that might prove evolution rather than a Creator. Any thoughts?\n3. 48:11 {Is Salvation Sometimes Unfair?} One of my biggest issues is that you NEED to believe in Jesus to be saved. If someone is born in a Muslim country, they would have to sacrifice way more than the average westerner. How is that fair?\n4. 53:53 {Historical Jesus & Manuscripts} How can we believe in a historical Jesus if the oldest manuscripts we have are from the second or third century?\n5. 1:00:40 {Is Christianity the True Religion?} How do I know Christianity is right/true compared to other world religions?\n6. 1:09:20 {Does God Make Mistakes?} I often hear the argument, “If God doesn't make mistakes when it comes to gender, then what about people with disabilities?\" How would you respond?\n7. 1:15:08 {Applying PSA on Earth?}  If the doctrine of Penal Substitutionary Atonement is just, would it be just for an earthly judge to impute the guilt of a murderer to an innocent volunteer and sentence the volunteer to death instead of the murderer? If not, why?\n8. 1:18:30 {Joseph in Jesus’ Lineage?} Any idea why Matthew and Luke list Joseph’s genealogy when he’s not Jesus’ birth father? Does that mean Jesus’ lineage isn’t what it needs to be to fulfill prophecy?\n9. 1:20:27 {Is there Really an Afterlife?} Why do Christians think there is an afterlife? Why not just look at death as a return to the quantum state, like before we were born?\n10. 1:24:26 {Did God Create Cancer?} If God created everything, why did He create cancer? As a Christian mother, I still struggle with these sorts of questions.\n11. 1:27:54 {The Best Argument for God} What do you think is the best evidence/argument there is for God?\n12. 1:30:21 {Does Trusting First Invalidate our Faith?} If you have to believe first in order to experience the reality of Christianity, if the \"proof\" only comes alive when one chooses to trust it, isn't that \"truth\" make-believe?\n13. 1:33:54 {Would a Good God make a Terrible Hell?} When Jesus said that for the person who would betray Him it would be better not to be born, I assume Hell is worse than non-existence. How does this match with a good God?\n14. 1:35:58 {Unrepentant Heart – Still Saved by Faith?} If I believe in my heart that Jesus rose from the dead and trust in Him alone for salvation, why would God then send me to Hell for being actively gay? Am I not saved by my faith instead of my works?\n15. 1:42:16 {Salvation in the OT} How were people saved in the Old Testament before Jesus? And if they were saved without believing in Jesus, then why did it change?\n16. 1:46:11 {Why do Christians Ask for Forgiveness?} My question from a skeptic is, if you are already saved, why do you still ask for forgiveness for your sins?\n17. 1:47:26 {Hypostatic Union – Contradictory?} Is Jesus being God and Man a contradiction? The Bible says that the Son doesn’t know the day or the hour of His coming. Can Jesus know (as God) and not know (as Man) at the same time?\n18. 1:49:32 {Bible = Pure Fiction?} As a Christian, what is an appropriate answer to an atheist claiming that the Bible is pure fiction? \n19. 1:55:48 {Mixed Messages in Scripture?} I lost my faith due to all the mixed messages in the Bible. For example, is salvation by faith alone like John 5: 24, or faith plus works like James 2? Why doesn’t this cause you to doubt?\n20. 1:58:39 {Does the Concept of Sin Apply to God?} Is God holy and sinless? Can God do things which, if we did them, would be considered sin? One example is killing the firstborn of Egypt. Does the concept of sin (or being sinless) even APPLY to God?\n21. 2:03:30 {How to Trust in Christ} I’m a Bible believing non-Christian that hurt himself by absorbing bad Charismatic teachings. I have always had trouble trusting and accepting Christ. How would one begin to as a skeptic?\n\nThe Bible says \"no one has seen God at any time\" (John 1:18) yet also has people saying that they saw God (Gen 32:30). Is this a contradiction?

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:54 {Taking On an Atheist’s Challenge} Can you please respond to Holy Koolaid’s video alleging various Bible contradictions and problems with Christianity? Did Jesus Himself undermine Christianity? \n2. 30:34 {Preston Sprinkle & “Side B” Christianity} What's your take on Preston Sprinkle? Some Christians like him, but others call him a heretic or \"side B Christian.” The issue seems to be about him not thinking same-sex attraction is a sin when not meditated/acted on.\n3. 38:08 {Is Family Planning Sinful?} My church teaches that a couple must continuously have as many children as they're able, and it's seen as selfish and a sin resulting in church discipline if they use any form of family planning to stop. Many have 12-18 children as a result. Leadership says God wouldn't give more children than a couple can handle. Is this biblical? We already have 5 children.\n4. 47:49 {The Pinnacle of Wickedness} Mike, are we there yet? The Bible says it will be as in the days of Noah in the last days. Have we arrived at the pinnacle of wickedness yet?\n5. 53:41 {Can we still Glean from Reckless Charismatism?} I learned that Bethel's prophecy teachings and those of Storms, Wimber, Deere, Randolph, etc. trace back to scandalous Kansas City prophets. Should all be ignored, or can the chaff be separated?\n6. 1:04:11 {Trusting God with Deep Fears} I’m a mom of three young children. I struggle with a lot of fear over their safety. How can I give this to God, knowing that it doesn’t mean something bad won’t still happen?\n7. 1:11:44 {Healing = the Children’s Bread?} \"Healing is the children's bread\" is taught by a pastor friend when he prays for the sick. He uses Mark 7: 24-30 as the proof text. What is the “bread” in v. 27?\n8. 1:18:05 {Household Responsibilities in Marriage} Does God care who does the dishes and cooks the food? Is the wife called to manage the household? What if both the husband and wife work similar full-time jobs (Proverbs 31: 15,21,27; Titus 2:5)?\n9. 1:26:13 {Questioning Salvation = Not Saved?} I asked the youth how confident they are of salvation on a 1-10 scale. One replied with a ”7” citing that they still sin and don’t read their Bible often. Can one be saved if they associate salvation with works like Bible reading? Are the warnings in Galatians fitting here?\n10. 1:33:31 {Are All of Paul’s Writings Inspired?} What should we make of Paul saying \"I, not the Lord\" as if he's just giving his own opinion, while also believing that all Scripture (which includes that statement) is Holy Spirit inspired (1 Corinthians 7)?\n\nLINKS and cool stuff\n\nNext week's video taking ONLY skeptical questions is here https://youtube.com/live/ATPyA2gt36E?feature=share\n\nI’m Mike Winger and my goal is to help people think Biblically about everything.

I know this isn’t the case, but I’m having a hard time expressing why. \n2. 20:23 {How Can We Sin if Indwelled?} How are we able to sin if the Holy Spirit is in us?\n3. 24:52 {Defining Inerrancy} How can we biblically define inerrancy? Even the writers of the Chicago Statement seem to hold slightly different views on harmonization (according to Mike Licona).\n4. 31:45 {Is Nakedness Inherently Sinful?} My 16 year old daughter was wondering why with the Fall in Genesis, shame is associated with being naked. What’s the correlation between sin, nakedness, and the Fall? I didn't really know.\n5. 34:51 {How were Private Events Recorded?} Do you know how biblical authors recorded events, conversations, and moments that transpired despite being in private or in a one-man scenario, perhaps like Judas' death?\n6. 43:08 {When did the Old Covenant End?} When did the Old Covenant officially end? Christ's birth? Death (Temple veil torn in 2)? Resurrection? Pentecost? 70 A.D. (destruction of the Temple)? Or was it a gradual \"end\" similar to U.S. slavery?\n7. 49:05 {Overcoming Pride} I often feel myself getting prideful and I’m worried that if I don't get control over it, God will humble me. What are some ways to keep myself humble, before God does it for me?\n8. 53:40 {Did God or an Angel Give Moses the Tablets?} How do we reconcile Exodus 31: 18 with Acts 7: 38, Galatians 3: 19, and Hebrews 2:2? I’m unconvinced that Scripture contradicts itself, but this lives in my head rent free and I need a resolution.\n9. 57:55 {Why Pray for Others?} If Jesus is our final intercessor, why should we intercede for or pray over other believers' needs? Is this related to the spiritual realm and prayer delays, like in Daniel 10: 12-14?\n10. 1:08:26 {Commentary Recommendations} What is your go-to commentary?\n-- Bonus Q: 1:11:00 {Co-Led Studies & Complementarianism} After watching your Women in Ministry series, I’d like to know if biblically, you believe a woman helping her husband teach a co-ed adult Sunday school class would be an elder-type role and would be wrong.\n\nLINKS and cool stuff\n\nI’m Mike Winger and my goal is to help people think Biblically about everything.

For Example, Jesus is the water of life so there's no water in Hell, or we rest in Christ so there's no rest in Hell.\n3. 38:26 {Political Signups in Church?} Do you think churches should allow political signup ballots for certain bills in the church? I had an older woman come up to me and ask me to sign. For context, it was about gas and electricity.\n4. 45:43 {Slaves or Friends of Christ?} Does Jesus “call” us His slaves? In John 15: 15 He says He does not, but in Revelation 2: 20 He seems to do so.\n5. 50:11 {Jesus – the Son of Man} Why does Jesus switch from first person to third person only when He’s referring to Himself as The Son of Man?\n6. 52:53 {Does Refusal of Sex Justify Divorce?} Does 1 Corinthians 7 really mean we can never say no to sex except for a season of fasting and prayer? My pastor told my husband that if I deny him for too long then he has biblical grounds for divorce.\n7. 1:02:27 {Did Jesus Teach on the Rapture?} A friend doesn’t believe in the Rapture because “Jesus never taught it” and he doesn’t consider Paul (or his writings) to be authoritative. How would you approach something like that?\n8. 1:10:25 {Do Only Good Things Come from God?} Is the concept of only good things coming from God biblical? I hear this a LOT in CCM and I am just not sure, given how our culture defines \"good.”  Is God not finished if your story isn't \"good”? \n9. 1:18:10 {Biblical Support for Calvinism?} What's up with Isaiah 63: 17? Is this a bullet in the Calvinist gun?\n10. 1:24:57 {Did Jesus ever Make Mistakes at Work?} Do you suppose Jesus was the most skilled carpenter who ever lived?

    "description": "Learn to think biblically about everything, including doomsday prepping.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:25 {Is Doomsday Prepping Biblical?} Should we as Christians be stockpiling food and supplies for some future global catastrophe? Some of my Bible study sisters are constantly talking about this and have started preparing for impending doom. Scripture tells us, “Do not worry about tomorrow” and \"Be anxious for nothing.” But at the same time, I don't want to be caught off guard. Should Christians be stockpiling just in case?\n2. 17:42 {Navigating Difficult Pregnancies} What are your thoughts on terminating a pregnancy due to a “lethal” condition like anencephaly? This seems like euthanasia. Applicable passages might be Genesis 9:4-6 and 2 Samuel 1:1-16.\n3. 31:29 {Praying for the Sins of Others} Do we in any way need to (or can we) pray for the sins of another person, such as a family member? This topic was a recent one in some chats I am in. The verse cited was Leviticus 26: 40.\n4. 36:45 {Was Mary Asking Jesus for a Miracle?} When Mary told Jesus that the wedding was out of wine, was she asking Him to do a miracle, or a more prosaic fix? I was taught that she asked for a miracle, but I wonder due to her other actions.\n5. 43:26 {Thinking Biblically about Dating} I’m a late 20s Christian man struggling with anxiety in dating. As things progress, I tend to overanalyze everything to determine if I can marry the girl, and things end about 3 months in. Any scriptural advice?\n6. 49:50 {Blasphemy in the Sermon on the Mount?} In The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus refers to God as the audience’s Father. How was this not blasphemous in the way that Jesus claiming to be the Son of God was a big deal in the Passion narrative?\n7. 54:22 {Asking Others for Help When Needed} I have an illness that leaves me physically and mentally fatigued. My wife and I need a lot of help but struggle with asking. How do I ask for help in a way that is God-honoring and not selfish?\n8. 1:00:10 {What Exactly Is Sin?} What exactly is sin? Is there a difference between sins against the flesh and sins against the heart/spirit? Does 1 John 5: 17 have anything to do with that? Is sin only sin when it causes death?\n9. 1:06:36 {What does “Woke” Mean?} I have heard you use the word “woke.” Please define it. Since being hijacked from the Black community, it seems to mean different things.\n10. 1:21:45 {Salvation before the Reformation} Were people saved before the Reformation? It is hard to believe everyone went to Hell during that time, so I've heard people use this to argue in favor of Catholicism. Is this a valid argument?\n\nLinks you may want…\n\n***HERE is the clip search feature on my website.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:36 {Did Jesus Baptize?} Considering John 3: 22 and 4:2, did Jesus Himself baptize others, or not? A Mormon brought this up to me, and the only thing I could think of was that John 3: 22 wasn’t actually saying Jesus baptized, perhaps only that He oversaw the baptisms. Any insight? \r\n2. 21:45 {Did Jesus’ Deity Die?} Did Jesus' deity die on the cross, and if not, then how could He be an atoning sacrifice for sin? If it died, then how could He be God without affirming the kenotic heresy?\r\n3. 27:34 {God’s Eternal Covenant} I see in Jeremiah 33 that God extends His eternal covenant not only to the house of David as kings, but also Levi as priests (Jeremiah 33: 17-22). Who fulfills this promise? Does Jesus?\r\n4. 35:49 {Not Worthy = Not Saved?} Do Jesus' words in Matthew 10: 37-39 give the impression that if we don't put Him first in everything, we're not saved? Does the phrase \"not worthy of Me\" not refer to salvation?\r\n5. 44:44 {Does God Veil/Blind Understanding?} Why do we assume that 2 Corinthians 4:4 is not about God, but presumably about Satan? In the context of chapters 3 and 4, and also in other verses, we learn that God veils/blinds eyes (ex: John 12: 40, Romans 11:8).\r\n6. 50:44 {How Could God Need Strengthening?} Can you explain how an angel could have strengthened Jesus since He is God (Luke 22: 43)?\r\n7. 58:39 {Translation Discrepancies?} Mark 1: 41 in the NIV says Jesus was indignant, but other translations don't. What’s up with that?\r\n8. 1:04:13 {“Real Presence” in Communion?} Do you think “Real Presence” in the Lord's Supper could be true? The fact that the disciples say \"this is a hard teaching\" and many of them leave makes me think it was more than symbolic.\r\n9. 1:15:28 {Responding Biblically to Idols} Was it biblical for the man in Iowa to destroy the Satanic Temple display at the state capitol last December? How should Christians respond to the public display of literal idols in our society?\r\n10. 1:23:14 {How to Walk by the Spirit} Can we as Christians really truly live an upright and blameless life? \n\nLinks you may want…\n\n***HERE is the clip search feature on my website.

I grew up in a church that took many hard stances on issues that led our elders to act in unbiblical ways. Most would say it was a cult. Where is the line drawn?\n2. 25:30 {Female Elders under Male Elder Headship?} Any advice for a member of a church with a male lead elder pastoring alongside ordained female elders who often teach on Sundays? Is there any warrant to the idea that they are under his headship?\n3. 31:40 {Does God Overlook Ignorance?} In Acts 17: 30, what does Paul mean by God overlooking the times of ignorance? Was He more lenient toward idolatry before the time of Christ? Or did He stop trying to save the idolaters of that time?\n4. 40:18 {Evangelizing the Apathetic} My wife and I are having difficulty ministering to her father who doesn’t seem to care about the topic of God at all. How do you help someone realize the importance of salvation?\n5. 46:57 {Does God Operate Outside of Time?} Can you talk about your views on God’s relationship to time? Personally, I find the timeless God view incoherent and unbiblical. It seems He operates within time.\n6. 54:52 {What if Election Isn’t about Salvation?} What are your thoughts on election being about service and blessing rather than salvation (i.e., Judas was chosen by Jesus to serve Him but obviously wasn't saved)?\n7. 58:08 {Mark of the Beast: Literal or Symbolic?} Could the Mark of the Beast being on the forehead or right hand symbolize something that dominates the mind or actions of those who submit to it instead of a literal mark on the body as many assume?\n8. 1:00:37 {Ancient Israel & The Trinity} Did ancient Israelites believe in the concept of a \"multi-personal God\"? By multi-personal God, I mean a concept similar to the Trinity, where there is one God made up of multiple Persons.\n9. 1:06:11 {Christ Ascending & Descending} What is Paul talking about in Romans 10:6-7 when he’s speaking of Christ descending and ascending? The way he phrases things seems like it should be the other way around.\n10. 1:10:11 {Making True Disciples} According to Scripture, if the disciple you make doesn't make a disciple, have you really made a disciple?\n\nLINKS BELOW\n\n***HERE is the clip search feature on my website.

I've NEVER made such a scathing critique of someone.\n\nBenny Hinn has been doing damage control and did a fake apology video with Charisma Magazine's Steven Strang here... https://youtu.be/f2DyhGQcegQ?si=GDjaxJ1lx85PhT9q   and here... https://youtu.be/87zSp-evtKs?si=Jqmx3SQTXIKPPz4R\n\nCharisma also wrote an article that seems to defend Hinn and portray me as making a career out of criticizing Hinn as well as just using old footage of Hinn's past (both of which are not true). That's here https://mycharisma.com/spiritled-living/benny-hinn-speaks-out-amid-controversy/\n\nI have a lot of respect for my interviewer, John Matarazzo, for doing this interview when I imagine it could cause some waves for him.\n\nDisclaimer: I know I will be accused of being obsessed with Benny Hinn or of just having a vendetta. Someone who isn't paying attention could believe that pretty easily. They just make a few assumptions and ignore the details. In reality, this isn't about Benny Hinn. It's about his victims. Every day someone is hurt by Hinn or the myriad of pastors who are copying his manipulative ways. It harms the church and excuses the unbelief of skeptics. We should have collectively called him out decades ago. If my coverage of this bothers you then I understand. For the sake of the victims, this is worth addressing.

Is this Jesus supporting violence in self-defense?\r\n2. 22:23 {Overcome by Strong Delusion?} In 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12, when the antichrist is revealed, God will send a strong delusion to those who refused to be saved. Will everyone who has heard the Gospel but not repented be overcome by it?\r\n3. 27:50 {What is “Coarse Joking”?} How do we know what coarse joking is (Ephesians 4: 29, 5: 20)? My teen's Christian friends often joke about being LGBTQ and getting high or drunk. Is this a freedom issue, or is this sinful? How should a teen respond?\r\n4. 34:48 {Led by the Spirit vs. our Own Feelings} My mom changed her name recently. She felt God was giving her a new name. She often feels led by the Spirit where I don't agree. Any advice for those times, and should I introduce her by new name?\r\n5. 42:53 {The Unrighteous Entering the Millennium?} In the Premillennial view, who are the unrighteous (not saved) that enter into the Millennium? During the sheep/goats judgment, it seems like all the goats get sent to their eternity in Hell.\r\n6. 45:46 {God Taking someone to Avoid Apostasy?} Is there any precedent for God taking home a believer before he might fall away? I Kings 14: 13 says some good was found in Jeroboam’s son.\r\n7. 50:31 {Will We Remember “The Bad” in Eternity?} Can you go into detail as to what Isaiah 65: 17 means by “not remembered” and the “nor come to mind” part? I was told it meant literal memory loss and that scares me. I want to remember even the bad.\r\n8. 55:01 {The Most Pressing Issue for Deconstructionists} What do you believe is the most pressing issue for deconstructionists?\r\n9. 1:02:51 {Advice for When We’re Exhausted} Do you have any advice for someone who is spiritually and physically exhausted (like Elijah in 1 Kings 19)?\r\n10. 1:11:40 {Standing Firm for Christ at Work} My work environment is very vulgar and toxic. It's \"easier\" for me to blend in and not honor Christ with my language and attitude. How can I have more confidence and not give in?\r\nBONUS Q! 1:14:55 {Is All Pain Bad?} My 8 year old, Ben wants to know: If there is no pain in Heaven, will there be hot sauce?

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:07 {Deceased Loved Ones & Necromancy?} Is going to the cemetery and talking to loved ones necromancy?\n2. 27:59 {Our Choices & God’s Sovereign Will} Do we have any true control over life entering the world, or is it only based on God's sovereignty? I think if it’s God's plan for me to have a child, I'll get pregnant even if on birth control. But my husband thinks we control conception through birth control. If Jeremiah 1:5 applies to all people, wouldn't that mean God's plan overrides our plan for procreation?\n3. 31:45 {Jesus’ Death: Physical but Not Spiritual?} If Jesus' humanity and divinity are inseparable, then how could He experience bodily death on the cross without His deity dying, as well?\n4. 36:33 {Do Christians Continue to Need Forgiveness?} 1 John 1:9 perplexes me. I am a Christian. In what sense does my daily confession apply \"forgiveness\" to me? What happens if I die with “unforgiven” sin?\n5. 41:19 {Why Doesn’t God Just Satisfy Skeptics’ Doubts?} How would you answer someone who says, “If there is a God, He knows what evidence I would need to believe and has not given it to me” and seems to genuinely mean it, not mocking/scoffing?\n6. 51:33 {Metaphorical, Spiritual, or Physical Resurrection?} Is Romans 8: 11 referring to a metaphorical, spiritual, or physical resurrection later to come? I thought it was spiritual, but the term \"mortal bodies\" has me thinking differently.\n7. 57:43 {Too Much Theology & Doctrine?} My pastor says that theology is “just someone’s opinion” and that “we shouldn’t get hooked on theology and doctrine.” How would you respond?\n8. 1:03:05 {Did Peter & Other Disciples Quit?} Did Peter and the others \"quit the ministry\" when they went fishing in John 21:3? It seems that Peter had already seen the risen Christ 2 or 3 times before this event.\n9. 1:08:33 {Stewarding Friendships with Unbelievers} How do you navigate having worldly friends? At times I enjoy their company and the conversation is good, but at other times they are unbearable to be around, making crude jokes.\n10. 1:14:19 {God Conceals a Matter?} In Proverbs 25:2, in what sense is the author saying that God conceals a matter? It's clearly not an absolute (i.e., He does reveal things).\n\nHere's the clip I mentioned about how to handle grief over a loved one who is not saved. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8klceUIeps&t=4489s\n\nMy series of videos going verse by verse through Romans. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvQ9G4NCvuiN4Evbp13uQa1\n\n***HERE is the clip search feature.

    "description": "I actually think the two worlds idea is pretty powerful when you seriously consider the goods that come through suffering and combine that with the Christian idea of a new heavens and a new earth. It's a view that not only offers some helpful ideas about why God allows suffering (though not a full account) but also ties it to something that is explicitly Christian; the eschatology of the Bible in regards to the new heavens and the new earth.\n\nHere's a longer video with several other answers to the question of why God allows suffering.

Verse 22 states that tongues are a sign for unbelievers, and prophecy is for believers. But vv. 23 and 24 then go on to seemingly describe the exact opposite.\r\n2. 27:09 {John Rejects but Jesus Affirms?} How should we understand John's rejection of being Elijah and a prophet (John 1: 21), while Jesus affirmed it (Matthew 11: 14)?\r\n3. 34:42 {Debates on the Canon} What do we do with some of the earliest listed Bible canons and church fathers that exclude Esther and include Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon?\r\n4. 39:47 {Are Easier Translations Unwise?} I struggle reading word for word translations of the Bible like the ESV. I love the NLT for its simple vocabulary and how easy it is to understand. Is it unwise to use the NLT to memorize and study from?\r\n5. 41:56 {Proper Interpretation of a Common Passage} What are your thoughts on 1 Corinthians 6: 19? I hear people use this Scripture to call anything they don’t like sin (tattoos, drugs, junk food, etc.). But it seems it’s mostly about sexual immorality.\r\n6. 52:36 {Are We Still Made in God’s Image?} Can you explain Genesis 5:1-3? Why is it different with the birth of Seth? Are we still God’s image bearers?\r\n7. 56:10 {Is “Déjà Vu” a Biblical Concept?} What are your thoughts on Deja Vu and are there any examples of it in the Bible? I've definitely had times where I had the feeling of being somewhere before when it was the first time being there.\r\n8. 1:01:02 {Are Eating Challenges Sinful?} Could you talk a little on what is and is not gluttony? Is it just eating more than you need to, or is there more involved (i.e., eating challenges)?\r\n9. 1:07:38 {When Competition turns Sinful} How do I know when my competitiveness is sinful? I coach baseball and want to ensure I'm providing the right model of competition for the players, while also still being as competitive as possible.\r\n10. 1:10:29 {“Apostasy” = “Departed”?} I've heard that the word translated \"apostasy\" in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 can also be translated as \"departed,\" as in \"the end will not come until the departing (rapture) comes first.\" Do you think this is true?\n\n6 different Christian views of the End Times explained https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmw0uVLunwU\n \nHow we got the Old Testament books https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8vd2QXHc2I\n\nMy full video on \"Thinking Biblically About Tattoos\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_z5_pXDnTk\n\n***HERE is the clip search feature.

I was recently told in a Christian forum that I was “giving off [blank] energy.” Is this biblical?\n3. 36:36 {Who will Sit on the Thrones?} In Matthew 19: 28, Jesus states the 12 disciples will sit on 12/24 thrones in the regeneration. In Revelation 4:4, 24 elders are sitting on the thrones. Who are the other 12?\n4. 39:08 {Proof of Transubstantiation?} If Jesus identifies Himself as “the Word” and Ezekiel literally ate the Word of God (Ezekiel 3:1-3), is this a good case for Ezekiel being an analogy to the Catholic transubstantiation of the Eucharist being true?\n5. 47:28 {Tongues/Prophecy for Believers or Unbelievers?} Can you please explain 1 Corinthians 14: 22-24? Verse 22 states that tongues are a sign for unbelievers, and prophecy is for believers. But vv. 23 and 24 then go on to, seemingly, describe the exact opposite. \n6. 50:57 {God’s Name in Vain} What does it mean to not mention God's name in vain?\n7. 56:13 {The Spirit With, In & Upon Us} When David is anointed in 1 Samuel 16, the Bible says that “the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward.” How would this be similar or different from us receiving the Spirit now?\n8. 1:00:32 {Can a Pastor’s Wife be an Unbeliever?} Do the qualifications for pastors/elders in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9 disqualify a man who has an unbelieving wife?\n9. 1:09:56 {About OT Quotes in the NT} How should we understand inerrancy for New Testament passages that appear to quote the Old Testament, but no clear reference can be found? (e.g., James 4:5, Matthew 2: 23).\n10. 1:14:49 {Grieving our Loved Ones when Not Sure of Salvation} My mom just passed away and I am unsure of her salvation.

Can we help pay for other people’s sins?\r\n2. 18:03 {Home Churches & Pastors’ Pay} Can you address the belief that churches should only meet in homes, that church buildings are unbiblical, and pastors should not be paid? I’m questioning if this is biblical.\r\n3. 28:35 {Unworthy of Salvation but Valuable to God} How would you convey that we are not worthy of salvation but we still have worth to God? \r\n4. 34:10 {Which Sacrifices Have Ended?} What sacrifices and offerings is Gabriel talking about in Daniel 9: 27?\r\n5. 39:15 {Is Everyone Called to Street-Preaching?} Do you think the warning in James 3:1 has implications for evangelism? I think all Christians should be ready to share their testimony when asked (1 Peter 3: 15), but not all should street preach.\r\n6. 50:03 {Red Heifer – Pointing to Christ?} In numbers 19, can you explain if and how the ashes from the red heifer point to Jesus? Especially verses 6, 9-10, and 11-13.\r\n7. 56:07 {Can Prophecies be given “On-Demand”?} A couple with a prophetic ministry came to my church and gave a word of knowledge to all who asked. I don’t see prophecy-on-demand in Scripture. Is this a proper use of the gift of prophecy?\r\n8. 1:03:36 {Wisdom on Mercy vs. Justice} How should I balance mercy and justice as a Christian? How do you know when each one is appropriate? When is it wrong to apply mercy and grace, and when does it become unjust to do so? \r\n9. 1:06:40 {Records Before Moses?} How were records kept and passed down before Moses? How did Moses write about Abram?\r\n10. 1:11:02 {Jesus Died for You} I’m struggling to understand how we can understand Jesus dying on the cross for our sins personally when it was 2,000 years ago.

    "description": "Taking YOUR questions from the live chat.\n\nWelcome to the new weekly stream! 10 questions every Friday at 1pm Pacific time.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:21 {Benny Hinn Update} What’s your update on the Benny Hinn situation? \r\n2. 16:37 {Don’t Add or Take Away!} People often use Revelation 22: 18-19 referring to the whole Bible. When I read it, I see it only referring to Revelation, since the New Testament wasn't formed yet. Could you provide some clarity?\r\n3. 21:18 {Different Methodologies for Missions} There's a lot of debate in missions right now about methodologies (i.e., church planting movements vs. more slow-paced approaches). How should we think through both sides biblically?\r\n4. 29:56 {Does Satan Have Power?} Is it a biblical idea that it's blasphemy to say that Satan has any power?\r\n5. 33:12 {Freedom from Addictions} How does one get set free from nicotine addiction when current medications do not work?\r\n6. 37:54 {Determinism vs. Luck} If we don’t believe that God determines/causes everything, do we believe in some form of luck? For example, when you hit all green lights on your way to work: “Man that was good luck!” Or when you stub your toe: “That was bad luck.” \r\n7. 45:37 {Homosexuality vs. Other Sins} Why should we not ordain homosexuals in church although it’s a sin, when other people with less visible sins (hate, anger, etc.) are serving? What is the biblical view on this?\r\n8. 49:54 {Why was David’s Family Punished?} In 2 Samuel 12: 10, why was the sword to never depart from David’s house if our sins aren’t supposed to carry over? Why was his family punished for his sin, and not just his son with Bathsheba but Ammon, etc.?\r\n9. 57:35 {The Father & Spirit in Heaven & Ezekiel’s Vision} Will we see both the Father and the Holy Spirit in Heaven? Also, can you explain Ezekiel’s vision of God and how it relates to Jesus and the Father?\r\n10. 1:03:12 {Does God still Speak through Dreams?} Does God still communicate through dreams? Is there any New Testament examples of God doing so, apart from Mary and Joseph?\r\nBonus Prayer: 1:06:40 Could you pray for my youth leader?

    "description": "Why make this video?\n\nBecause I believe that this sort of teaching is going on in a lot more churches than many of us realize. Having the video out there may reach someone and deliver them from this movement. In addition, it helps to examine extreme examples of the most progressive teaching out there so that viewers can develop the ability to start recognizing that sort of teaching when it appears in more subtle forms. I don't make this video primarily for Jermell or his church, even though I hope it helps them. I have a much wider audience and impact in mind. \n\nPlease do not harass Common Good church or Jernell. If you must reach out to them (I am not trying to instigate a ton of people doing so) you need to have the wisdom, fortitude, and grace to to do so as an ambassador of truth. \n\nThank you to Woke Preacher Clips for exposing this kind of false teaching. https://x.com/wokepreachertv?s=21&t=sKUrwEM2KfMMZiYOLGCooQ\n\nLINKS:\nYou can see the full, original video here (though I would not be surprised if they take it down) https://www.youtube.com/live/z5qW3VoYBP8?si=q-2Vj3yFeSg5JRa7\n\nThis is the video defending the doctrine of Penal Substitutionary Atonement against slogans like what we hear from Jermell https://www.youtube.com/live/OzYQSh0SK2o?si=puBoXYU1nEmOfZo-\n\nI'm Mike Winger and my goal is to help people learn to think biblically about everything. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:08 {Andrew Tate vs. Scripture} Who is Andrew Tate, and do his views line up with the Bible?\n2. 35:07 {About Saul’s Motives} Was Saul's hostility toward the Jewish Christians based on his biblical beliefs, or was he really on a mission to achieve status considering his age prior to conversion and extreme actions?\n3. 41:25 {Can a Christian become Reprobate?} Is it possible for a Christian to become a reprobate? If so, can it still be undone? I don't know why, but God seems out of reach.\n4. 47:42 {Blaspheming the Spirit vs. the Son/Father} Why is the unforgivable sin described as blaspheming the Holy Spirit, as opposed to blaspheming the Son or the Father?\n5. 51:45 {Fulfilled or Unfilled Prophecy?} Has Zechariah 9:1-8 already been fulfilled? If not, is it possible that it is in the process of being fulfilled today?\n6. 56:08 {Is Jesus Presently “King”?} Is it right to call Jesus \"king\" since He has not yet set up His Millennial Kingdom on Earth (Revelation 20:4-6)?\n7. 1:01:48 {Reaching a Pagan Friend} I've got a Pagan friend. He believes that all the different gods exist, including the Abrahamic God, and that the Norse Pantheon is most worthy of worship. Any advice on reaching him?\n8. 1:07:58 {Marital Relations during Menstruation?} Is it a sin to have marital relations during the menstrual cycle? In Leviticus 18: 19, 24-25, it indicates that this is an abomination. But Leviticus 15: 24 puts it in the category of ritual uncleanness.\n9. 1:18:25 {Human Sacrifice in the OT?} I'm curious about how to handle 2 Samuel 21. This sounds very close to a form of human sacrifice to honor God.\n10. 1:27:45 {Do All Incorrect Secondary Views Warrant Repentance?} You said egalitarians need to repent (I agree). But do we apply that same response to other secondary issues such as Calvinism? That's higher on the list of secondary issues compared to egalitarianism vs. complementarianism.\n\nI'll be discussing Andrew Tate and his wild claims about the Bible. \nThe other 9 questions will come from the chat.\n\nWelcome to the new weekly stream! 10 questions every Friday at 1pm Pacific time.\n\nI’m Mike Winger and my goal is to help people think Biblically about everything.

    "description": "Welcome to the new weekly stream! 10 questions every Friday at 1pm Pacific time.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:27 {About the Queen James Bible} What are your thoughts about the Queen James Bible, also known as the “Gay Bible”? Is this a blasphemous translation to be avoided, or did the QJV publishers have any linguistically valid reason to remove negative references to homosexuality from the Bible? Also, can the Holy Spirit still speak through heretical Bible translations?\n2. 26:36 {Should Christians Leave Ungodly Areas?} Does the Bible say Christians should relocate their family (especially with young kids), or stop having kids altogether if evil/injustice continues to grow in their community?\n3. 34:35 {Should We Only Help Others, Never Ourselves?} Is it a sin to help myself instead of others? I only know Scripture that tells me to give to others (Philippians). I'm often frustrated when I'm forced to help others when I need time myself.\n4. 38:10 {Why is Only a Single Creator Obvious?} What about creation makes a singular Creator obvious, as Paul suggests? What keeps us from concluding that multiple deities created the different aspects of the universe?\n5. 43:15 {What to Do if Your Pastor is Female} I've watched your Women in Ministry series and come to basically the same conclusions you have. However, I'm part of a church with a female lead pastor. How do I handle this?\n6. 47:25 {Paul’s Hands vs. Jesus’ Hands} “These hands” provided for Paul in Acts 20: 34 NKJV & ESV. But “…of mine” (i.e., “these hands of mine”) is in some translations such as NIV & NET. Is Paul referring to Jesus’ hands or his OWN hands?\n7. 54:55 {Are Angels Purely Spiritual, Not Physical?} How can we know that angels are spiritual beings and not potentially physical beings? Some people say they're spiritual and do not have reproductive organs (since Jesus said they're not given in marriage).\n8. 58:12 {When Parents are Difficult} How does one biblically deal with an oppressive (but not abusive) parent? Lately they have been really stressed, anxious, and far from God. I’m not sure if they are truly a Christian.\n9. 1:00:53 {Navigating a Difficult Marital Situation} Am I dishonoring God if I initiate separation? I’ve been married for over 12 years, always rocky. I've begged for counseling, but my husband (professing believer) said he'd pick divorce first. He says he no longer loves me.\n10. 1:05:20 {Was Josiah Being Prideful?} In 2 Chronicles 35: 20-27, should Josiah have realized that it was God speaking (some suggest he was prideful)?\n\nLINKS:\n\nTHE FINAL VIDEO in the Women in Ministry series is right here.

    "description": "Welcome to the new weekly stream! 10 questions every Friday at 1pm Pacific time.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 4:41 {Has Anyone Seen God?} John 1: 18 tells us, “No man has seen God at any time…” but in Genesis 32: 30, Jacob says, “I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved.” Which is it? \n2. 19:19 {Are we Equal with God in Heaven?} My wife had a question I did not know how to answer: If we are perfected at the end of time and perfect in God's presence, how are we not then equal with God? We realize that we will not be greater than God, but I am not sure how to explain this subject.\n3. 22:35 {Godly Womanhood/Biblical Femininity} How does godly womanhood differ from godly manhood outside of marriage? How do we define biblical femininity, especially for the unmarried woman? Does discipleship look different for women?\n4. 30:13 {The LXX More Reliable for Typology?} Is the Septuagint more reliable for finding Jesus in the Old Testament? S. Douglas Woodward & others say that messianic passages & timelines in the Masoretic Text were altered in 2nd century to keep Jews from converting to Christianity.\n5. 35:52 {Effectively Caring for the Homeless} How are we expected to help homeless people in our modern culture? Are we still expected to invite strangers into our very homes as they did in Bible times?\n6. 42:35 {Must We Have an Eschatological View?} Do you think it is important to have a view on eschatology? Can we just all agree that one day, if we believe in Jesus and what He did on the cross and abide in Him, that we will go to Heaven?\n7. 47:34 {When was the Old Covenant in Effect?} Hebrews 8: 13 says that the Old Covenant is becoming obsolete and about to disappear. Does this mean the Old Covenant was still in effect at the time this book was written?\n8. 54:03 {Should Unequally Yoked Believers Bear Children?} I'm married to an unbeliever. I regret it and I worry that I’ve jeopardized my son's salvation! Would it be better not to have any more children in my “ungodly” marriage even though we'd like to have more?\n9. 1:01:02 {Jesus Leaves & Advocate Comes – Modalism?} Why is the Advocate unable to come unless Jesus leaves (John 16:7)? Why does this not imply Modalism?\n10. 1:05:41 {Believing in God but Not the Bible} How do I bring the Gospel to someone who believes there is a God, but rejects the Bible? My mom doesn’t believe God gave us the Bible and thinks that Christianity is man-made.\n\n1:13:26 BONUS Q!

    "title": "10 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 5)",
    "description": "Welcome to the new weekly stream! 10 questions every Friday at 1pm Pacific time.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:32 {Did Jesus Leave the 99 in Danger?} Regarding Matthew 18: 12, does Jesus know the 99 are safe when He leaves to find the 1? I’m trying to understand how this is responsible. Should we not do things for the greater good, but for the 1?\r\n2. 14:53 {Are We Living in Satan’s Deception?} Have you heard of the theory that we're already living in Satan's short season of deception from Revelation 20:3-8? Some of the ideas are intriguing, but most also claim extra conspiracy baggage, e.g., the \"mud flood\" and much more.\r\n3. 24:45 {Markan Sandwich in James?} Could James 1: 13-18, 1: 19-27 & 2:1-13 be similar to a Markan sandwich? If so, would it be correct that the focused interpretation of the 2 breads should be “Do not accuse God” of: 1. Tempting us to sin, 2. Not creating people equally? Can you explain the meat relative to the bread?\r\n4. 35:53 {Does Satan Know his End?} Does Satan know he is going to lose? People say, “Satan just wants to take as many people down with him as he can.” Does he/can he know Scripture?\r\n5. 43:29 {Strategic Evangelism to Strangers} How do you initiate sharing the Gospel with a stranger? Is it best to be direct (e.g., “Can I share the Gospel with you?”), or would you recommend a more gradual approach?\r\n6. 47:30 {Different Views on Communion} Have you considered differing views on communion? I’ve just recently learned there are more than just the typical Baptist, Lutheran, and Catholic views. Some believe in Real Presence in spirit, not corporeal.\r\n7. 50:30 {Does Acts 13 Prove Calvinism?} I'd like to hear your thoughts about Acts 13: 48. It seems to contradict the idea that God wants everyone to be saved and that everyone has the same opportunity/free will to believe in Him.\r\n8. 58:15 {Is the Father “Higher Up” than Jesus?} Many Scriptures sound as if the Father and Jesus have different authority. Does the Father have a higher authority than Jesus (John 14: 28, 1 Corinthians 11:3, Matthew 28: 18, Mathew 10: 40, Matthew 20: 23)?\r\n9. 1:05:25 {Living Productively & Overcoming Bad Habits} My apartment is a mess, I wake up late, I eat junk food, I'm too lazy to read the Bible and I feel like I know a lot about God, but I don't feel like His daughter. How can I turn my life around?\r\n10. 1:11:55 {Mark vs. Matthew – Contradiction?} Can you explain what some say is contradictory between Mark 9: 38-41 (not against us = for us) & Matthew 12: 30 (not with me = against me) & how that applies to NAR/false teachers who profess Jesus?\n\nLinks and resources:\n\n—Flat Earth video https://www.youtube.com/live/qePiXK_8Agc?si=qcNdo6S8_1_uEiC6\n\n—5 Christian Views of the End Times https://www.youtube.com/live/xmw0uVLunwU?si=g-a-gzkv0P1fnnHp\n\n—Mark series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF&si=YD0_6ijDkG8wMZSq\n\n—livingwaters.com for gospel tracts \n\n—6 hour video on the head covering passage in 1 Cor 11. https://youtu.be/keXayp7JXf4?si=R3t1YkDHr67VyXzo\n\n\nI’m Mike Winger and my goal is to help people think Biblically about everything.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:38 {Is God Abusive?} Does a Christian’s relationship with God mirror what an abusive relationship would look like in other scenarios? \r\n2. 18:34 {Are Healings being Hindered Today?} What does James 5: 13-15 look like today? Are we missing something today that is hindering more healings from the Holy Spirit?\r\n3. 25:28 {Is Charity Meaningless Apart from the Church?} A pastor I listen to says that any community service/charity work that is not done through the Church or a Christian organization is meaningless to God. What are your thoughts on this?\r\n4. 32:02 {Does Sin Separate Believers from God?} I often hear that sin \"breaks fellowship\" or causes \"relational unforgiveness\" (to quote GotQuestions.org), but is there Scripture to show that sin can, in any way, separate a Christian from God (Hebrews 10: 19)? \r\n5. 37:48 {Are We Called to Love AND “Like” Others?} Do I have to like a brother in Christ? I know I should love my neighbor and not hate anyone, but there are some personalities I don't like. Is that sinful?\r\n6. 42:00 {Who Will be Told by Jesus to “Depart”?} How is it that some people can cast out demons in Jesus’ name but then be told, “Depart from me for I never knew you”? How do I avoid that fate?\r\n7. 44:29 {Removing Shoes on Holy Ground?} What is the significance of people taking their shoes off in the presence of God in the Old Testament?\r\n8. 46:43 {Overcoming the Pressure of Comparison} How do I stop comparing myself to others? As a college student, I’m surrounded by a highly competitive environment and I find myself comparing my grades and career to others. How do I overcome this?\r\n9. 51:27 {Jews vs. Christians – Same God?} Do current Jews and Christians worship the same God? They claim to worship the God of Moses and the saints, but reject part of God.\r\n10. 55:50 {Solomon: Salvation & “The Book of His Acts”?} My question is, was Solomon saved? Did he repent after what he did? what is the Book of the Acts of Solomon (1 Kings 11: 41)?\r\n11. 1:02:47 (Just for fun!) BONUS Q: In LOTR Return of the King, it is mentioned that 3 days are needed to gather more forces. Before Aragorn leaves. However, only 1 day seems to pass. How do you reconcile this?\n\nTHIS is the video I mentioned which goes into detail on promises about getting what we pray for in faith. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VvA5ZWDSdmo\n\nQuick announcement: I've got bad news and good news. The bad news is that I'll only be doing 10 questions each Q&A instead of 20. The good news is that I'll be doing the Q&As every Friday instead of every other Friday. While I have the first question ready to go I take the other 9 from the live chat. Just show up in time for the stream to begin and, once you see my live on camera, post your question in the chat.\n\nI’m Mike Winger and my goal is to help people think Biblically about everything.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:03 {What if God Has No Free Will?} Does God lack free will Himself, since He cannot act outside of or contrary to His nature? If so, doesn’t that make His actions questionable?\r\n2. 20:31 {How Did John have Materials to Write?} Were papyrus and writing supplies expensive? How did John, banished to the Island of Patmos, have all the necessary items to write down his Revelation?\r\n3. 23:22 {Should we Infer Doctrine from Scripture?} Is it wrong to base doctrine on inference? Is it ever legitimate? E.g., the context of Hebrews 12:1 says nothing about saints watching us from Heaven, but some say it’s implied by the word “witnesses.”\r\n4. 31:43 {Where is the 2nd Coming in Scripture?} Where does it say in the Bible that the Messiah will have a second coming? Does Jesus tell His disciples that He won’t be fulfilling all of the Old Testament prophecies just yet?\r\n5. 36:29 {Did Jesus Always Have Power to Heal?} Regarding when Luke 5: 17 says, “The power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal,” did Jesus not always have this power, or does Luke emphasize it here because of what happens next? What’s your take on this?\r\n6. 42:01 {Do Our Prayers Affect Others’ Salvation?} Do our prayers for the unsaved actually increase their chances of being saved, vs. if they didn’t have anyone praying for them?\r\n7. 48:52 {Our Sinful Flesh vs. Spiritual Warfare} How can I discern the difference between demonic influence and my flesh when it comes to sinful struggles?\r\n8. 52:52 {Which Scripture is God-Breathed?} In 2 Timothy 3: 16, when it says “All Scripture is God-breathed…” what would the author have meant by “Scripture”? Because as far as I know, books like Jude and Revelation hadn’t been written yet.\r\n9. 55:00 {About Asexuality} Is asexuality real? I know believers who say they’re asexual (not sexually attracted to anyone). I think this may be true of me, but could it just be God guarding my heart from lust over the years?\r\n10. 1:01:25 {Physical Appearances of Jesus Today?} Does Mark 13: 21-23 refute present-day claims of Jesus physically appearing to people, or is this a misapplication of the text?\n\nWhy you should stop saying “I’m spiritual but not religious.” https://youtu.be/A96Q-hy81y4?si=JpxcF43mcwn0BN9A\n\nQuick announcement: I've got bad news and good news.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:05 {Does Exodus Condone Abortion?} Does exodus 21: 22 really condone abortion? I've seen multiple commentaries and translations, and it does really seem like abortion is accepted as the baby's life appears to be less valuable.\r\n2. 10:58 {How Long to Date Before Marriage} Is being in a long-term dating relationship wise? And how long should you wait for someone to make the decision to marry you or not?\r\n3. 14:32 {Why Did God Create Drugs?} Why would God create psychedelics, since they lead so many astray?\r\n4. 20:39 {“Too Much Bible”?!} How would you respond to the phrase “Too little Spirit, too much Bible”? I’d love to know how to respond.\r\n5. 25:03 {Can I Marry a Divorced Person?} My fiancée came to the Lord after our relationship started and I recently found out that she has been divorced twice. Has she been forgiven, or should we call off the marriage?\r\n6. 30:17 {Why Did God Give the Law First?} Why did God, knowing everything, give the Law first and not go straight to grace with Jesus?\r\n7. 35:50 {Can Christians File Restraining Orders?} Does 1 Corinthians 6 apply to restraining orders? A boy in a Christian household was harassing my sister, and my parents were told it was wrong of them for filing a restraining order.\r\n8. 42:34 {Eternal Forgiveness vs. Accountability?} Why does the Bible say we will give an account for every idle word if we will be forgiven?\r\n9. 48:45 {The Father’s Spirit or Spirit of Christ?} In Matthew 10: 20 the Spirit is the Father's Spirit, but elsewhere it says the Spirit is that of Christ. How does this work with the Oneness vs. Trinitarian views?\r\n10. 52:22 {Personal Relationship = Biblical?} Does the Bible actually talk about having a personal relationship with Jesus?\n\nLinks:\nJesus in the Old Testament Series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWlpQauXiTU&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO&pp=gAQBiAQB\n\nJesus in the 5 sacrifices of Leviticus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GOvVSZJxCU&pp=ygUVbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgbGV2aXRpY3Vz\n\nHow Passover pictures Christ https://youtu.be/tbwylmj26SU\n\nDivorce and Remarriage according to the Bible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pC6ZikbYo&t=2s&pp=ygUTbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgZGl2b3JjZQ%3D%3D\n\nThe biblical call of a husband https://youtu.be/65eMggo_xKQ\n\nThe biblical call of a wife. https://youtu.be/H8PFVZgIQ2w\n\nSome of my abortion related videos in a playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi-tJmIiOS7OTm-9w0j2hTX1IMO2-vNT3&si=M04RQBfgK9SmqyHF\n\nMy video responding to Catholic claims about purgatory. https://youtu.be/UzVzn8h7jnM\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "2nd Most Powerful Argument Against God",
    "description": "The idea is that the God, as the Christian describes Him, cannot exist, since a loving God would reveal Himself to the non-resistant non-believer and He does not. Therefore, such a loving God must not exist. I think this is a truly challenging argument not only because it tackles what feels like a very real world issue (I admit) but because arguing against it can quickly put you into the position where you are no longer arguing so much about philosophy or logic but where you are pigeon-holed into a situation where people will think you are personally attacking individuals. In other words, when I say that humans are accountable to know that God exists this argument can quickly turn things into the social foul of saying that people have bad motives or are otherwise insincere. What starts as a philosophical view of the apparentness of God's existence turns into a bullying situation where the Christian is painted as personally attacking others. I reject that framing but I realize that many will continue to see things in that perspective, sadly.  \n\nThis is a short video and it doesn't get into all the issues related to \"Divine Hiddenness.\" It only covers a couple aspects of it. Other arguments should be made about how apparent God's existence is and to address other issues. I hoped to simply do some work that would build a bit of a bridge past the sense of personal offense many feel on this issue and open them up to another way of seeing things.\n\nAre you wondering what I would consider the STRONGEST argument against God? Well, in terms of persuasiveness, it would be the Problem of Evil. I have a video on that right here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70T8mm0W2tA&pp=ygUbbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgcHJvYmxlbSBvZiBldmls\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "10 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 1)",
    "description": "Satan's Guide to the Bible is a popular video pretending to represent scholarship in general while only promoting selective skeptical talking points. I'll tackle that as the first question today. The rest come from you, in the comments section during the live stream.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:18 {Satan’s Guide to The Bible?} There is a dangerous video gaining popularity, called \"Satan's Guide to The Bible,\" that illustrates a pretend children's Sunday school class learning from Satan as their substitute teacher. He claims that pastors keep secrets from their congregants, but that he will reveal those secrets and tell them the truth. Can you please analyze this video and refute its false claims about the Bible?\r\n2. 38:34 {Was Evolution Used by God?} Genesis 1: 24 sounds like God created animals through evolution (at God’s command) – “The Earth brings forth…” V. 11 also uses the same language. Interestingly, it’s not used with water, birds, animals & man. Thoughts on why this may be?\r\n3. 42:56 {Israel – Male & Female?} What is the explanation for God referring to Israel as male (Hosea 14:5-6) and as female (Jeremiah 3:6)? Is it context related, or is there another explanation?\r\n4. 45:42 {Bethlehem & The Messiah} Did people not know that Jesus was born in Bethlehem (John 7: 41-43 NIV)? I feel like that would have cleared up some of their issues with Him being the Messiah!\r\n5. 47:38 {Does Deuteronomy Prohibit Witnessing to Cults?} Does Deuteronomy 12: 30 prohibit current Christians from learning about other worldviews/religions/cults in order to evangelize them and utilize appropriate apologetics techniques?\r\n6. 50:14 {Why Did God Appoint Unfaithful Leaders?} Why did God choose bad kings if He knows every heart? Saul, Solomon, Jeroboam, Hazael, and Jehu all turned away, but were directly chosen by Him. Why not choose kings He knew would stay faithful?\r\n7. 55:00 {The Divine Council Theory} I heard you once say you didn't agree with Michael Heiser's views on the Divine Council. What part of it do you not agree with? \r\n8. 59:25 {Speaking in Tongues} When did “speaking in tongues” change from being real human languages that the speaker didn’t naturally know to being a non-human/Spirit language?\r\n9. 1:05:24 {Biblically, how is “Neighbor” Defined?} Is there a biblical definition for the term “neighbor”? I've always thought it was a term used to describe a non-believer who shows love to a Christian (or means them no harm).\r\n10. 1:08:28 {Interpreting the Book of Acts} How do we interpret the book of Acts? Is it a reasonable interpretation that it’s merely a transitional period and that we have to be careful how much doctrine we take from it?\n\n\nResources:\nTwo different Christian takes on the Exodus\n1. Early dating - Titus Kennedy https://youtu.be/d_3Plj2e7FY?si=JysPcu2wvB-VqOXq \n2. Late dating - Inspiring Philosophy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIc7i6eVk7w \n\nOn the dating of the book of Daniel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z4c4DxTHhE\n\nDid Jesus say the end would happen soon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eExtYuAgB8\n\nEvidence for the empty tomb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BU_R7QoYo\n\nTom Holland’s book “Dominion” about Christian values undergirding modern values. https://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Christian-Revolution-Remade-World/dp/0465093507/\n\nSOME info from me on Psalm 82 and why I don’t hold Heiser’s view. https://youtu.be/NbK-fqz7-Mo?si=fzZeb4Rl1Zdo4B_K\n\nTheology in Acts. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mI5wiDTHpgE\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d3NVJU82du8&t=3330\n\nI’m Mike Winger and my goal is to help people think Biblically about everything.

It is disgusting.

    "title": "20 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 113)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:04 {Which Denomination is True?} Why are there over 30,000 Christian denominations all claiming to be the “true Christians”? Which one should I follow, and why?\r\n2. 25:17 {Was Jesus Only Condemning the Religious?} I often hear people saying that Jesus was speaking to and condemning the religious only, not speaking to the world. How would you respond to this sentiment?\r\n3. 28:41 {Punished for Adam’s Sin?} Are we guilty of the sin of Adam and Eve? If so, isn’t it unjust for God hold us accountable for something we had no part of (Ezekiel 18, Romans 5: 12)?\r\n4. 31:46 {Worship Only Services?} When it comes to a church service, would it be appropriate on occasion to just have worship instead of both worship and the Word preached? Should it always be both?\r\n5. 34:16 {Three Dippings during Baptism?} What are your thoughts on “Trine Immersion” during baptism, specifically three dippings? Is it justified in Matthew 28: 19?\r\n6. 37:02 {Repentant but Still Rejected} I was rejected by my church because of my behavior, PTSD & my mouth. They didn’t excommunicate me but stopped talking to me/started ignoring me. I’ve repented, apologized, and begged but they still ignore me. It has left me feeling flawed & unloved. What would Scripture tell me about my situation?\r\n7. 40:22 {Is God Deterministic?} If Jesus in the Old Testament was intentional by God, does that mean that God is sometimes deterministic? For example, did God orchestrate Joseph’s life?\r\n8. 42:22 {How to “Build Up” One Another} What does “building others up” with your words really mean? Does it mean that you should compliment people and just say nice things to them? Does it mean more, or something entirely different?\r\n9. 44:16 {Why Ask for Forgiveness?} If we are saved by faith alone, why are there so many prayers asking that our sins be forgiven, when by faith we know that they have been? Thank You\r\n10. 45:09 {Should We Limit our Fun?} I read my Bible every day and pray, but I feel guilty when I engage in a hobby or have “fun.” Is there a limit to the amount of fun one can have in a day?\r\n11. 45:42 {Jesus Just an Ordinary Prophet?} Why did Jesus refer to Himself as a prophet in Luke 13: 33 and not the Son of God? Wouldn't that be putting Himself on the same level as regular prophets when He was in fact elevated?\r\n12. 48:51 {Life on Other Planets = Abiogenesis?} If basic organisms are discovered on other planets, would that prove abiogenesis and prove evolution?\r\n13. 54:17 {Should we “Sin Boldly”?} Martin Luther has a quote that says “sin boldly.” I’ve heard he meant don’t be afraid of sinning and do so boldly knowing it has been paid for, but I feel that this is dangerous. Your thoughts?\r\n14. 56:42 {Mortal & Venial Sins?} 1 John 5: 16-17 seems to support the Roman Catholic understanding of mortal and venial sins. Is that the proper interpretation of this verse, and if not, how should we understand sin and the death it causes?\r\n15. 1:00:40 {Why Follow Any of the OT?} What would you say to the objection that “if we don't follow the old covenant anymore, why should we care about Leviticus 18”?\r\n16. 1:05:31 {How to Rejoice and Weep With Others} Since both good and bad things happen in the body of Christ daily, how can we accurately practice Romans 12: 15?\r\n17. 1:08:22 {Has the HS Been Left Out?} Why is the Holy Spirit not mentioned in the greetings of Paul, and why He is left out in such statements like 1 Corinthians 8:6?\r\n18. 1:12:14 {The Granville Sharp’s Rule} How reliable is the Granville Sharp's rule? Is it implemented outside of New Testament writings? \r\n19. 1:13:38 {The “Secret Sauce” to Fasting} Please help me with how to fast. I am praying for a friend’s salvation and protection from some dark things.

    "title": "20 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 112)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:08 {Did God Command Sin?} In Genesis 22:2, God tested Abraham by asking him to sacrifice Isaac as a burnt offering. How can God ask men to do something that is sinful, and how could Abraham obey God’s direction to sin?\r\n2. 19:11 {Proof of Virginity Required?} In Deuteronomy 22: 13-21, why were the women to be stoned to death if they didn’t present proof of virginity? Was it the same for the men?\r\n3. 25:30 {Keep All but 1 Commandment?} Why do Christians try to keep all 10 commandments except the 4th one? I hope this doesn't sound rude.\r\n4. 37:36 {Does God Have Blood?} Does God have blood? If not, isn’t that Nestorian?\r\n5. 39:22 {How to Put Faith in Christ} As an atheist who would like to believe in God, goes to church, and has read the Gospel, what steps do I take to believe?\r\n6. 45:16 {Is it Logical to Believe the Bible?} How can Christians believe in a literal Adam and Eve account or a literal worldwide flood?\r\n7. 51:32 {Did Jesus Doubt?} Is it true to say that Jesus doubted? How would you respond to someone that claims that He did (in Gethsemane), implying it's OK to doubt?\r\n8. 55:12 {Why Doesn’t God Immediately Help/Heal?} Why would I \"surrender\" myself to someone who could help me (be well, not be in pain, heal me) and is with me at all times, but doesn't help me?\r\n9. 58:43 {Why is Belief Necessary for Forgiveness?} Why does God require belief for forgiveness? Why can’t God simply forgive our sins since Jesus died for all and not attach belief to that?\r\n10. 1:03:23 {Why does God Heal Some Cancer but Not All?} I have a neighbor who can't get past this question: “My dad had cancer and died. You [me] had it and lived. Why does God think that's fair?”\r\n11. 1:08:18 {Rejecting the Message due to Credentials} Any advice for lay people doing public ministry that get attacked by non-believers on the basis of their credentials? I feel I am capable of interpretation and ministry despite never having been to seminary.\r\n12. 1:12:03 {Does the Devil Know Our Thoughts?} Can the Devil interpret what a non-believer may be thinking or what's on their mind? Can he understand what a person is thinking?\r\n13. 1:14:57 {Prophecies Written Afterwards?} How can you prove that parts of the Bible weren't written after the events took place, like prophecies or historical accounts of God's providence?\r\n14. 1:17:35 {Proof of God’s Existence} What proof apart from science is there that there’s a God?\r\n15. 1:22:01 {Couldn’t the Bible be More Clear?} Do you honestly think the Bible couldn't have been more clear about important moral issues where the church has been very wrong (treatment of gays, etc.)? What does that say about authorship?\r\n16. 1:27:39 {How to Know Christianity is the Truth} I am so afraid. There is so many views about God. How can I be sure I am following the correct ways? I claim to be a Christian but there are too many different views.\r\n17. 1:33:01 {The Problem of Evil} Why is there so much suffering if God is good? If He is almighty, why doesn’t He stop all the bad things?\r\n18. 1:38:38 {Faith/Trust Defined} Define faith/trust. If someone intellectually knows that God exists but doesn't know how to trust in Him, how would you counsel them?\r\n19. 1:41:28 {Didn’t the Israelites Have Meat to Eat?} If the Israelites had flocks and herds, why did they complain that they had no meat? They didn't have the Law of Moses yet on what not to eat.\r\n20. 1:42:36 {Would God Pass the Test?} Ricky Gervais says that if all scientific knowledge and religion were erased, science would be eventually re-discovered, but not God.

    "title": "20 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 111)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:36 {A Misogynistic Bible Verse?} In Ecclesiastes 7: 27-29, my fiancée who is new to Bible reading and study wondered why this verse sounded misogynistic. Do you have any ideas?\n2. 22:42 {Reaching Atheist Children} I'm a new Christian from Islam. My son & daughter are like Richard Dawkins (atheist). What do you think would be the best way to give them the Gospel, short but clear?\n3. 26:34 {Was Jesus’ Death Truly Sacrificial?} What is the biblical nature of sacrifice? An atheist asked me how Christ's death & resurrection is truly a sacrifice if God is infinite. How do I best explain Jesus' sacrifice?\n4. 34:52 {Faith in Christ = Guaranteed Protection?} Matthew 6: 25-34 seems to promise earthly protection. How do we contrast this with the \"nakedness and starvation\" that Paul and other Christians went through (especially under persecution)?\n5. 40:23 {Is “Allah” an Idol?} How do I explain to a \"Palestinian Christian\" that Allah is an idol and isn't God? My coworker claims to follow Jesus and doesn’t follow Mohammed but insists it is OK to call God “Allah” in her language.\n6. 43:34 {Are Pseudonyms Sinful?} Do you think it is sinful to use pseudonyms online to protect your personal identity? Could this be considered intentional deception? As Christians, to what extent do we have a right to privacy?\n7. 45:59 {Uphold the Constitution vs. Obey Government?} In general, Christians should not rebel against the government without biblical reason, but as one in the military, should I keep my oath to defend the Constitution if the government violates it?\n8. 48:30 {Is it OK to Tour Other Religions’ Places?} Where do you see the Bible speak to touring temples of other faiths for the goal of building long-term relationships and sharing the Gospel while also guarding against demonic influence or causing people to stumble?\n9. 54:39 {Scapegoat = Satan?} How can we be certain that the “scapegoat” isn't Satan in Leviticus 16 and Revelation 20?\n10. 1:00:03 {Are You Casting Pearls Before Swine?} When should we apply Matthew 7:6? I ask because for Christmas, I want to give a spiritually themed gift to my unbelieving sister, who has crudely rejected the Bible and God multiple times. Should I even bother?\n11. 1:04:39 {How to Honor your Parents} How can I honor my parents while not agreeing with their lifestyle or theology? What does it mean to honor your parents biblically as a young adult, and when/where do you draw the line?\n12. 1:07:56 {Responding to “Oneness” Teachings} How would you respond to a Oneness believer who denies the distinct Personhood of the Father, Son, and Spirit, even after showing them clear verses that distinguish the Father from the Son, etc.?\n13. 1:09:57 {Why is Jesus Called the “Son”?} Why is the title of Jesus “Son”? Why isn't the Holy Spirit called the Son of God?\n14. 1:11:30 {Honoring God & Each Other in Marital Intimacy} Does a wife have to do everything her husband wishes in the bedroom? I feel so uncomfortable doing oral acts, but he says it’s the only thing that satisfies him. I feel guilty. We both are believers.\n15. 1:14:47 {Did Jesus Tell a Lie?} Did Jesus actually lie in John 7:6-11?\n16. 1:18:49 {Is God a Biased Hypocrite?} Aren't we saved when we do our best to live Godly lives? Otherwise, God is a biased hypocrite who plays favoritism. We're to be perfect as He is! Other logic is a fallacy, thus false teaching.\n17. 1:22:11 {Christian Science} Would you ever be interested in doing a video on Christian Science and the teachings of Mary Baker Eddy? \n18. 1:23:12 {Which Proverbs are Commands?} How can we know which proverbs (if any) are direct, unilateral commands of God (example: Proverbs 23: 13-14)?\n19. 1:29:44 {They’re Not Worried about Eternity!} What advice do you have for witnessing to someone who doesn’t care about what happens after they die? I have a friend who is content with betting their eternity on Hell if they are wrong.\n20. 1:31:50 {Satan = “GOD of this World”?} How did Satan become the \"god of this world,\" and why did God allow him to reign?\nBonus Q! 1:36:22 - What was the best and worst part of filming your 11 hour long video?\n\nMy video on the typology of Jesus int he five sacrifices of Leviticus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GOvVSZJxCU\n\nTo ask your own question just show up during the beginning of the live stream and post a comment, starting with a Q, into the live chat.

    "title": "20 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 110)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:27 {Are there 7 Deadly Sins?} I’ve heard people refer to the “7 Deadly Sins,” but I haven’t been able to find that sort of list in Scripture. Are those sins especially “deadly” according to Scripture? If not, where did that list come from?\r\n2. 11:55 {Should Youth Pastors Simplify or Go Deep?} I absolutely love being a new Youth Pastor! However, I often find myself going over my students' heads. A small group of them tell me they're thrilled to \"actually learn something.\" I'm conflicted on whether I should simplify my messages in an effort to hold as many attention spans as possible, or keep going into deeper waters to continue feeding those that seem to be benefiting from it. Thoughts?\r\n3. 15:23 {Does God Love Everyone?} I hear some people make the claim that God doesn't love everyone. If God doesn't love everyone, how can He require that we love our neighbor (neighbor defined as Jesus defined it in Luke 10) as ourselves?\r\n4. 19:14 {Was Ezra Wrong to Assume God’s Protection?} Regarding Ezra 8: 21-23, shouldn’t Ezra have been practical and used the resources available to him? Isn’t it unwise to just assume/hope that God will provide divine protection?\r\n5. 25:46 {When God Kills, Was it Actually Satan?} Leaders at my church say that when God killed or did something bad it was always Satan. Thoughts? I think this is blasphemy.\r\n6. 31:17 {Does Satan Himself Actually Tempt Us?} Considering Satan is not omnipresent or omnipotent, is it realistic to state that he tempts us, or does much of anything directly? Wouldn't it be more orchestration of demons who act?\r\n7. 34:10 {Does Reading Scripture Aloud = Prophecy?} Does reading the Scriptures aloud in the power of the Holy Spirit count as prophecy? It's speaking forth the Word of God. Also, Scripture is called prophecy in 2 Peter 1: 19-21.\r\n8. 38:15 {Married Legally vs. in the Eyes of the Church?} Is there a difference between being married in the eyes of the church and the eyes of the state?\r\n9. 43:12 {When Apologists Make Mistakes} What do we do when apologists we trust are proven wrong or discredited by critics? Can we still trust them and their work?\r\n10. 50:12 {Can a Christian Attend Secular Concerts?} Can you pls help me think biblically about going to secular concerts like Taylor Swift’s Eras tour?\r\n11. 52:06 {Why Didn’t Greek Spread?} Why didn't Greek spread through the Christian world like Arabic did through the Muslim one? Both revere holy books, yet Greek didn't become widespread. Surely it would have made understanding easier.\r\n12. 55:31 {Is Cessationism Heretical?} What can I say to a Cessationist brother who calls me heretical for simply believing in the miraculous gifts of the Spirit? Can there be unity?\r\n13. 1:01:32 {Deathbed Visions from God or Satan?} Do you think deathbed visions of deceased relatives or Jesus are real, or hallucinations? If real, do you think they are from God or Satan? I’m worried about being led astray on my deathbed.\r\n14. 1:04:52 {Ministering to LGBTQ+ Friends} Most of my long-time friends are part of the LGBTQ+ community. I got saved 3 years ago and no longer support that ideology, but they don’t know that. I feel convicted but don’t know how to approach the issue. Any advice?\r\n15. 1:08:37 {Overcoming Lust} I’ve been struggling with lust for a few years, and it weighs heavily on my heart. Every time I think I can break away from it, I keep falling back into it. How can I finally break free?\r\n16. 1:13:18 {Is Ecclesiastes 7 Misogynistic?} In Ecclesiastes 7: 27-29, my fiancée who is new to Bible reading and study wondered why this verse sounded misogynistic. Do you have any ideas?\r\n17. 1:15:53 {Women & Men – Distinct Attire?} I heard you teach it’s a biblical principle for girls to make sure they wear only girl clothes and guys, guy clothes. I'm a girl but I sometimes wear zip hoodies or T-shirts that are technically from the men’s section (but with other women's items). I didn’t think that was wrong, but is my attitude wrong?\r\n18. 1:20:08 {Standing Up for the Persecuted in Israel} How do we best stand up for the persecuted people of Israel in the world today and effectively do our duty to glorify Jesus as the controversy of Zion blazes?\r\n19. 1:22:51 {Parable of the Patches & Wineskins} Can you help me understand the parable of the patches and wineskins at the end of Luke 5?\r\n20. 1:30:29 {How to Truly Trust God} How do I truly trust God? I've been struggling with fear of dying and judgment; fear that I don't have enough faith or that salvation isn't really by grace alone.\n\nMy verse by verse study through the Gospel of Mark https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF&si=CBCtLox9iawiARs3\n\nMy verse by verse study through the book of Romans https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvQ9G4NCvuiN4Evbp13uQa1\n\nThis is the book I recommended related to LGBT issues. https://www.amazon.com/Holy-Sexuality-Gospel-Desire-Relationships-ebook/dp/B07B2JGPJR",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Intro \n1. 1:12 {Different Wills among the Godhead?} In the Trinity, do the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit all have three separate wills?\r\n2. 22:15 {Conflict in Israel – Eschatological Significance?} Is the war going on in Israel right now part of a biblical prophecy? \r\n3. 30:28 {One Governor or 12?} In 1 Kings 4:7-19, there are twelve governors for Israel listed. I’m confused by verse 19b: “There was one governor...” What’s your take on this? 12 or 1?\r\n4. 36:22 {Do Some Sins Indicate a Lack of Salvation?} Verses like Matthew 6: 14 make me feel like there are sins so bad that if you commit them (like unforgiveness), you’re 100% not a Christian. I feel like I have to maintain my own salvation.\r\n5. 41:04 {Would the Spirit Ever Leave Us?} Can you please explain what it meant in 1 Samuel when the Spirit left Saul?\r\n6. 44:16 {The Vatican & Revelation} Does Revelation 7:9 apply to Vatican City despite its size and hosting unbiblical stuff?\r\n7. 48:42 {Is Marital Intimacy Only for Procreation?} Can a biblical case be made for the purpose of sex within marriage being for procreation AND intimacy/pleasure and not just for procreation? Is sex without the possibility of procreation evil?\r\n8. 55:11 {Christians Made Whole “Again”?} How do you feel about songs that state, “You make me whole again”? It’s my understating that before faith in Christ we aren’t whole, saved, or forgiven. Thoughts?\r\n9. 58:38 {Teaching Convictions as Truth} How should we deal with a pastor who is unwilling to receive correction on anything against his own convictions? It wouldn’t be as big of an issue, but he preaches his ideas as truth (i.e., no alcohol).\r\n10. 1:03:57 {Counting our Trials as Joy} How are we to “count it all joy” when we face trials and temptations, as James chapter 1 says?\r\n11. 1:09:58 {Wisdom = “She”?} Can you help me understand why in Proverbs 2 the Bible refers to wisdom as “she”? How do we argue this with those who try to speak about multiple gods, or LGBTQ+ people saying He is neither gender?\r\n12. 1:13:45 {Refuting Modalism} What is the best way to dismantle Modalism in a loving way to someone?\r\n13. 1:17:05 {The Commander of the Lord’s Army} In Joshua 5: 13, who is the commander of the Lord’s army? Is this another Christophany? And why do we read so little about him if he helped Joshua in his ventures?\r\n14. 1:20:53 {Are the Mentally Disabled Saved?} What happens to autistic people or mentally disabled people? Do they go to Heaven?\r\n15. 1:22:54 {Am I Saved if I Have An Addiction?} How do I know If I actually have a saving faith, especially considering that I’m addicted to pornography, and am having a hard time asking for someone to help me stop. Thanks.\r\n16. 1:29:46 {Congregational Votes – Sometimes Sinful?} Is it against the Bible to have your congregation vote on whether or not to have women as elders?\r\n17. 1:31:48 {Indwelling, Infilling & Assurance} Do you have the Holy Spirit if you haven't been baptized with Him? I don't feel/believe like I do. I can't hear His voice. \r\n18. 1:34:51 {The Day of The Lord & His Second Coming} How do the ideas of \"The Day of The Lord\" in the Old Testament and Jesus' second coming in the New Testament intersect? I've been studying this, but I'd like some of your opinions.\r\n19. 1:36:51 {A Cure for Hypocrisy} What is the cure for hypocrisy? I have stopped going to church because I feel rotten on the inside and feel like a fraud. I don’t seem to love Jesus like others. My heart is cold. No emotion.\r\n20. 1:43:49 {Can the Bible Become an Idol?} Is it possible to love the Bible so much that it can be a form of an idol?\n\nLinks I mentioned.\n\nEverything the Bible says about Alcohol https://youtu.be/MRpA4njHF64?si=-uo_83WPE2MFIo9S\n\nChristophanies in the Old Testament (I cover the Joshua 5 passage at about 31 minutes in) https://youtu.be/1CDOSbzd6Uk?si=5XCDrzYXNU4U830n\n\nA rare Tuesday stream! \nCheck back later for time stamps.\n\nI'm Mike Winger and I think we've underestimated how amazing the Bible is. \n\nEvery other Friday at 1pm Pacific time we do these live Q&As.

    "title": "20 Questions with Mike Winger (Episode 108)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:15 {When Should I NOT Take Communion?} When should a believer NOT take communion? Is finding myself repenting of the same sin over and over and having an ongoing struggle with the same sin a reason not to?\n2. 18:56 {Can A False Prophet Glorify God?} My parents sit under a pastor who claims to have a prophecy from God almost weekly. He preaches in Jesus’ name and glorifies God, but his prophecies are always totally wrong or incredibly vague. Can a man who glorifies God also prophesy falsely?\n3. 24:09 {Christ & H.S. In Us = Modalism?} At the end of Colossians, it talks about Christ in us, and in Galatians, it talks about the Spirit of His son in our hearts crying out “Abba, Father.” That sounds like the Holy Spirit, but is it Modalism to call Christ in you the Holy Spirit?\n4. 27:57 {Animal Sacrifices in Millen. Kingdom?} Why will there be animal sacrifices in the Millennial Kingdom?\n5. 35:25 {Should Slaves have Run Away from Masters?} In light of Ephesians 6:5-8 and Colossians 3: 22-23, was it wrong for African slaves to run away from their masters?\n6. 42:48 {Do Our Prayers Need to be Specific?} People have been saying with increasing frequency, \"Make your prayers specific.” I’m wondering why I keep hearing this lately. Is this biblical?\n7. 46:40 {Did Jesus Have a Sin Nature?} Was Jesus the biological son of Mary? If so, how did He not inherit a sin nature?\n8. 50:49 {Does Heaven Last for Eternity?} Do we live in Heaven for eternity, or will it be a finite time period (Isaiah 65: 20)?\n9. 54:50 {Share Our Burdens?} Galatians 6:2 says to carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ, but verse 5 says that each person should carry their own load. Should we share our burdens or carry our own?\n10. 59:13 {Reject the Church = Reject Christianity?} If I reject the Church as an institution, do I automatically reject the Christian faith?\n11. 1:02:00 {Committed Relationships as Good as Marriage?} How would you answer claims that “committed sexual relationships” have everything good that a marriage has? What’s the essence of marriage that withstands infertility/impotence/distance, etc.? \n12. 1:06:09 {Recovering from Works Based Thinking} I left the Hebrew Israelite movement 3 years ago, and since then, I’ve been struggling with my walk. I know we have God’s grace, but I was so used to doing works that I feel lost now. Any suggestions?\n13. 1:11:05 {Laws, Islam & Executing Apostates} Looking at Deuteronomy 13:6-10, is the apostasy law similar to Muslims? And is it inherently immoral for an apostate to be put to death because of their beliefs, according to the Old Testament? \n14. 1:16:48 {Was Jesus’ Body Broken For Us?} What are your thoughts on when people say “This is the body of Christ, broken for you.” To me, this is not accurate, as Jesus was not “broken” for us (no bones broken like the Passover lamb).\n15. 1:18:54 {Are Non-Believers Always Wrong?{ Some Christians act like non-believers are inherently untrustworthy or dishonest, like they shouldn't be taken seriously. This feels really wrong. Can you please help me find biblical teaching on this?\n16. 1:23:01 {Our Bodies during the Millennial Reign} What kind of body will each \"group\" of people have during the Millennial Reign? I know the previously dead will receive knew bodies, and those that die in God during the Tribulation will get new bodies.\n17. 1:24:17 {The “Prize” in Philippians} What is the prize of the upward call\" in Philippians 3: 14?\n18. 1:27:56 {Raising Children w/Unbelieving Family} Is it wrong that I don’t want to raise my son around my unbelieving family members? They can even be hostile to the faith. I even have a transgender niece, and my wife and I don’t want our son around that.\n19. 1:30:49 {Praising the Holy Spirit?} A friend said that Scripture never calls us to praise the Holy Spirit despite numerous worship songs and the Doxology saying otherwise. Is he wrong? Should we only worship the Father and the Son?\n20. 1:33:36 {The Bible Harmonized w/Psychology?} How do we harmonize the Bible and psychology? I have some leaders that try to diagnose people’s sin through the lens of psychology and not Scripture (things like compulsive lying, laziness, etc.).\n\nHere's the video on the topic of slavery and the Bible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2q3fql-BlY&pp=ygUTbWlrZSB3aW5nZXIgc2xhdmVyeQ%3D%3D\n\nThis is the resource I mentioned that helps train kids with biblical worldview.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 107)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:55 {Greater Works than Jesus?} In John 14: 12, Jesus said we would do even greater things than Him. That’s a tough pill to swallow since He died for our sins and created everything. How do I process Jesus’ statement?\n2. 23:42 {Did God Endorse Polygamy in the OT?} In 2 Samuel 12:8, God says that He gave David his wives (multiple), and if he had asked for more, God would’ve given him more. This sounds to be directly saying that God would be endorsing polygamy. How should we as Christians feel about one man having multiple wives according to the Bible, specifically this passage?\n3. 30:21 {Is Only OT Scripture “God-Breathed?”} In 2 Timothy 3: 16, was Paul speaking of ONLY OT Scriptures, since that’s all they had at the time? What about the inspiration of the NT?\n4. 37:13 {Relearning Proper Theology} One of your videos gave my fiancé a change of heart. He is a former Jehovah’s Witness and feels like he has to start over and unlearn then relearn everything. Where do you suggest we start studying?\n5. 43:57 {Is the Hypostatic Union Illogical?} How can Christ truly be God and man at the same time, infringing upon the laws of logic? If it’s true, I know I can't understand it fully, but I do expect to be able to demonstrate how it isn't illogical.\n6. 48:54 {Is it Wrong to Teach Kids About Santa?} What do you tell your kids about Santa? Is there a chance that kids who find out Santa isn't real might think the same about Jesus? Would you spoil Santa for children that aren't yours?\n7. 57:18 {Should We Avoid Semi-Pelagianism?} I'm a Calvinist, and recently I have been noticing Semi-Pelagian theology in Arminian churches. Can you distinguish between the two and explain why we should avoid Semi-Pelagianism?\n8. 1:06:19 {Can We Give God Too Much Credit?} Is it OK to give credit to God for something He might not have done (like a salary raise, new job, or other material or worldly things)?\n9. 1:09:52 {New Command or Old Command?} Why does 1 John 2:7 say that he is not writing a new command, but in the next verse (1 John 2:8) he says that he is writing a new command? What's going on here?\n10. 1:14:10 {Hasn’t Jesus Always Been Lord?} Peter said in Acts 2: 36 that God has \"made Jesus both Lord and Christ.\" He was already Lord and Christ, so what does this mean? Same with Jesus being “given all authority” in Matthew 28: 18.\n11. 1:24:33 {Were Christ’s Sufferings Lacking Something?} In Colossians 1: 24, what is lacking in Christ’s sufferings, and how is Paul contributing to them?\n12. 1:30:12 {Is God Constantly Speaking to Us?} My friend doesn't want to have too small of a view of God, so he sees every small event in his life as God speaking to him, even trivial things. Am I being too stingy, or is he \"over-spiritualizing\"?\n13. 1:36:08 {Examples of Serving God Daily} I’m wondering what discipling others, sharing the Gospel, and service to God looks like in your life day-to-day? Anything you’ve learned over the years?\n14. 1:39:38 {How Do We Find Joy in Our Trials?} In James 1, how do we count our trials as joy?\n15. 1:45:24 {Does the Devil Persecute Believers?} Is God giving the Devil permission to persecute the lives of certain Christians today, like in the book of Job?\n16. 1:47:02 {Does Praising Jesus Exclude the Father & Spirit?} I've been struggling with phrases or lyrics such as \"All glory be to Christ\" and \"All Heaven sings to Christ alone.” Do these incorrectly exclude the Father and Holy Spirit?\n17. 1:49:28 {Exploring the Different Words for God’s Law} Every verse in Psalm 119 refers to God's Law, and ten different words are used, including: commandments, precepts, law, testimonies, ways, etc. Why? Does each word have a different meaning?\n18. 1:51:58 {How to Prepare Large Study Projects} How do you go about a project like the Women in Ministry series? I want to do something similar with Genesis 1-2 but I don't even know where to begin or what tools to use (other than Logos, of course).\n19. 1:54:38 {Remembering the Unsaved in Heaven?} I would like to know, when we are in Heaven, will we just forget about those we loved on Earth that weren't saved? I can't imagine how there could be no sorrow if we remember them.\n20. 2:01:18 {What Was Paul’s Goal?} Can you explain to me what goal Paul hopes to achieve in Philippians 3: 11-12? What does he have to do?\n\nEvery other Friday I do these Q&As, trying to help people learn to think biblically about everything. To ask a question just show up during the beginning of the live stream, wait for it to actually start, and post your question in the live chat. \n\nI may have already answered your question.

    "description": "Timestamps and links below...\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:12 {ARRGH! The Pirate Bible!} Have you heard of The Pirate Bible? Apparently, it has been translated from the KJV into \"pirate vernacular\" using AI. It seems like a joke to me, but what are your thoughts?\n2. 14:28 {Does Video Auto-Play Lead to Sin?} Is it a sin to use a social media service that often displays ungodly messages and music? Short-form video services such as TikTok display videos directly on your feed rather than suggesting them to you. I will still often see ungodly videos even though I don't want to.\n3. 19:01 {Is Jesus Presently King?} Is Jesus presently on the throne or at the right hand of the throne? Is He King today? In what sense is He King? Proof text? How does the answer impact premillennial eschatology?\n4. 23:23 {Uncontacted Tribes & Judgment} I was wondering, what will happen to the uncontacted tribes during the time of Jacob’s trouble, and without the ability to hear the Gospel, what does judgment look like for them?\n5. 29:31 {Are Violent Video Games Permissible?} What are your thoughts on Christians playing violent video games like Call of Duty or Doom? At what point does it become a question of conscience vs. it just being wrong?\n6. 38:39 {Have a Pure Mind – Battling Lust} I came to Christ around 9 months ago, but I’ve been really struggling with getting closer God. I’m 15 and I have problems with lust. How can I stop always falling back into sin through lusting?\n7. 45:19 {Does Catholicism Save?} If at the end of days, the Protestant belief is proven true, would Catholics be saved? Conversely, if Catholicism turns out to be the truth, would Protestants be saved?\n8. 53:53 {Is Long Life a Blessing?} Proverbs 16: 31 says that long life is the reward of the righteous. But in Philippians 1: 23, Paul says he longs to go and be with Christ, which would be far better. So how is long life a blessing?\n9. 59:00 {About the 2nd Temple’s Construction} Given that Ezekiel's temple prophecy with its strict measurements was written before the second temple was built, why didn't the second temple get built to those specifications?\n10. 1:01:38 {Do Christians Still Sin?} How should I understand 1 John 3 when it talks about those who abide in Christ no longer sinning, even as someone who continues to sin?\n11. 1:10:31 {Leviticus – Burnt Offerings} In Leviticus 1:9, why were only the legs and entrails washed before burning? Cultural?\n12. 1:15:24 {Are Crop-Tops Appropriate?} Most of the older girls and young women at our church are wearing crop tops to church. I find this obviously inappropriate for church and in general, but I don't want to be legalistic. Thoughts?\n13. 1:21:10 {Are All Medications Tied to Witchcraft?} Galatians 5: 20 uses “witchcraft.” The word is only used 2 times in the Bible, with the origin word being where we get pharmacy/medicine. Can you clarify? I grew up learning this was literal and still applies.\n14. 1:26:20 {Honoring God through Singleness} How can I enjoy my singleness? I'm a young adult woman and I want to be in a relationship one day, but I want to be content where I am now. How can I grow closer to God during this time?\n15. 1:30:14 {Forgiving Others} Jesus said forgive others so that God will forgive us, but Paul says we forgive BECAUSE God has forgiven us. How do you reconcile those statements?\n16. 1:34:45 {Deliverance & the “Spirit of Jezebel”} How do we lovingly correct someone who believes the deliverance ministry doctrine (people saying they have a “spirit of Jezebel” that needs to be prayed away)?\n17. 1:36:50 {About the Filioque} Can you flesh out the Filioque and its implications for the Western church?\n18. 1:38:56 {Attending Catholic Ceremonies?} Can Christians go to Catholic weddings, funerals, and baptisms?\n19. 1:44:36 {How to Safely Study Demonic Works} I've been reading occult books to understand the worldview of a friend in the occult (books like Kybalion, Hermeticism, mediumship, etc.). Do you have any advice for reading these books without getting contaminated?\n20. 1:49:35 {Does God Use Verses Out of Context?} Does God still communicate through verses taken out of context? Some say “yes” due to His unique ways, but I'm unsure.\n\nMy playlist of videos intended to help people on the issue of Mormonism https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi-tJmIiOS7OiXmZg8ikq8Eh0OPwfEi1N&si=DdOOGOsl62stVn0C\n\nMy video on what happens to people who die without hearing the gospel -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiyxpE5UBz4\n\nHow Leviticus points to Christ - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GOvVSZJxCU\n\nAll my videos related to Catholicism - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91n6erthX6A&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvsToYQdfDkiDE6dPkouIv3\n\nEverything the Bible teaches about divorce and remarriage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pC6ZikbYo\n\nMy videos on the \"Mother God Cult\" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi-tJmIiOS7NtudVdtL8LSK3oWbCnLrBJ",

    "description": "Consider this description a bit of an expansion on my video as well as an anticipation of coming comments.\n\n\"It's just comedy Mike, lighten up.\" \n Yes, it is meant to be funny. But that isn't the same as saying that it doesn't carry any weight and isn't meant to convince anyone of anything. A lot of persuasion is done through comedy and it's rather a weak response to say \"it was just a joke\" after such persuasion is shown to be fallacious. Further, I have heard many people use this same argument quite seriously. It would be odd to simply pretend it is merely a joke. It is a joke, but it is not merely a joke.\n\n\"The REAL point he's making is that the reason you reject those other gods is the same reasoning that will get you to reject your belief in God, if you follow the logic properly.\"\n While I have heard this argument in various forms many times I have never heard a person present it in a convincing way. Every time I can recall someone making this point they overlook the differences in the nature of the God of Christianity and these other gods which Christians reject. Consider Thor as an example. Thor is a created being, his own existence is contingent on other things, he is not morally perfect or the grounding of anything. So classic arguments for God, such as the moral, contingency, ontological, teleological arguments, or arguments from fulfilled prophecy, or the resurrection of Christ, simply cannot be applied to Thor. In other words, the reasons for believing in the God of Christianity are completely unlike the reasons for believing in Thor. Therefore, rejecting Thor presents me with zero reason to reject God. So, on the grounds of logic, Ricky's argument is a bad one. \n\nSo, we are back to the fact that this is an example of shallow thinking couched in humor and snark, which causes people to be unwise about truly important issues.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:43 {Faith = Just a Family Tradition?} My husband believes that faith comes about by family tradition, and that someone's faith is just an expression of what their family has taught them rather than actual faith in God. What does the bible say about this?\r\n2. 20:34 {Wealth & Poverty in Heaven} If we all get different wealth in Heaven based on our deeds on Earth, won’t that create a situation where some people are poor and some are rich? And what happens once we spend it all?\r\n3. 25:28 {Was Paul Married? Widowed?} Acts 26:9-10: \"...cast my vote\" has implications that Paul was in the Sanhedrin (also residing over Stephen's trial in 8:1), which would have required him to be married (even though that requirement wasn't recorded until later; I'm guessing it was still implemented). Could Paul have been married? Perhaps widowed?\r\n4. 30:04 {Did Saul Know who David Was?} Why at the end of 1 Samuel 16 did the author emphasize David's service to and recognition by Saul, but in 1 Samuel 17, Saul didn't seem to even know who David was (no one seemed to know him for that matter)?\r\n5. 35:40 {Is Doubting OK?} I love Mark 9: 24 - “I believe, help my unbelief.” But how do we understand that along with James 1:6-8 which says to ask in faith with no doubting, as the one who doubts will not receive anything from the Lord? \r\n6. 41:10 {Should We Pray to Mary?} How can I respond with Scripture to a Catholic friend who says, “Mary is the mother of Jesus, so why wouldn’t you seek help from her? Jesus wouldn’t like you disrespecting His mom in any way”? \r\n7. 48:25 {Are Our Souls Truly Immortal?} I was raised in the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, and they say that the belief in an immortal/immaterial soul is Pagan in origin and has no basis in the Bible. Is this true?\r\n8. 52:30 {The Fruit of False Prophets} In Matthew 7: 15-20, what are the fruits of the false prophets? The teaching? The followers? The acts? Or something else?\r\n9. 57:36 {Leading with Proper Wisdom} In light of 1 Corinthians 3: 18, how can I lead others spiritually with wisdom without considering myself to be wise?\r\n10. 1:01:35 {Will God Give Up on Repetitive Sinners?} I suffer from same-sex attraction. I fight it, but sometimes I give in. Will God give up on me at some point if I give in?\r\n11. 1:07:35 {Premarital Cohabitation Without Sex?} Is it OK for me and my long-distance girlfriend to stay in an Air BnB for a couple of months if we do not fall into sexual sin, but are not married?\r\n12. 1:10:31 {Must Christians Attend Church?} Do you have to attend church to be a Christian?\r\n13. 1:14:18 {When Other Faiths Pray for Us} When people of other religions pray for us and we see these prayers answered, how do we reconcile that with Christianity? Does that mean all faiths are good?\r\n14. 1:18:32 {Why did Jesus Die if Humans Still Die?} If the payment for sin is death, and both believers and non-believers will die anyways, then why did Jesus have to die for us? Was it for a chance at us entering Heaven?\r\n15. 1:21:53 {Did Augustine Consider the Apocrypha Canon?} How would you respond to those who point out that Augustine considered the Apocrypha as canon? \r\n16. 1:24:40 {Satan’s Fall in Luke 10} Could you shed some light on what Jesus meant in Luke 10: 18? Is Jesus talking about Satan's initial fall here, and what purpose does it serve in the passage?\r\n17. 1:28:58 {OCD-Like Prayers} Any thoughts on struggles with OCD-like prayers? Ex: feeling the need to pray for protection over family members every day in fear that something bad will happen to them if I don’t.\r\n18. 1:33:55 {God Didn’t Reveal Himself?} What do you tell an atheist who says he looked for God and God didn't reveal Himself to him? And in general, what do you make of the argument of nonresistant non-believers?\r\n19. 1:40:16 {How to Hear God’s Voice} What does it mean to hear God's voice? Many teachings say to listen to your thoughts and discern God's voice. Is this even Biblical, or is it a cliche? Reminds me of imagination (visions/prophecy).\r\n20. 1:45:13 {Why did God Change OT Names?} Why does God change the name of Abram to Abraham, Saul to Paul, and Sarai to Sarah? Is there a meaning behind this?\n\nTo ask a question all you need to do is wait till after the stream starts (which means waiting until I'm actually on screen talking), post a question in the live chat with a Q at the opening of it, and be as clear as you can.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 104)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:38 {Avoiding the Appearance of Evil?} You recently said, \"Scripture says: avoid the appearance of evil.\" I was wondering, if 1 Thessalonians 5: 22 is the verse you were thinking of, isn't that Scripture referring to staying away from partaking in evil, not abstaining from things that look like you're partaking in evil to others?\r\n2. 17:49 {About Jesus’ DNA} What was Jesus' DNA? Was Jesus' DNA 100% from God, or did He have Mary's human DNA? Perhaps it's the same DNA as Adam, since Jesus is the 2nd Adam?\r\n3. 23:25 {Angels Ascending & Descending?} What did Jesus mean in John 1: 51? Was it a specific word for Nathanael, or does it apply to everyone? Would really love some clarity.\r\n4. 30:58 {Brotherly Support vs. Enabling Legalism} How do we balance being careful not to stumble a fellow believer, while also not catering to someone's legalism?\r\n5. 37:24 {Polygamy in Scripture?} Polygamy? Exodus 21: 10–11 says if he takes to himself another woman, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights. Clearly, God is speaking of multiple wives. Your thoughts?\r\n6. 44:11 {Negative Words = Neg. Consequences?} In WOF (Word of Faith) circles, 2 Kings 4:8-37 is an example of why you shouldn’t speak or pray negatively about your situation. What is the actual idea of this passage?\r\n7. 53:41 {Envy vs. Jealousy?} Is there a difference between envy and jealousy? Can you describe what the difference is biblically?\r\n8. 56:09 {Did Joseph Fail to “Test the Spirits”?} 1 John 4 says to “test the spirits.” But Mary's husband, Joseph, didn't appear to do this when he had the dream to flee to Egypt. How should we understand or interpret this?\r\n9. 1:00:20 {Must we “Wait for God” before Salvation?} Can you get saved whenever? My church teaches that God must first “knock on your heart” before you can respond and accept salvation. This leads to some people wanting to be saved, but waiting.\r\n10. 1:05:51 {Clarifying a Difficult Passage} A local UMC pastor preached on Matthew 18: 21-35. She said scholars say that Matthew added verses 34-35 and that the master does not represent God. I've never heard this take and it sounds concerning. Any insight?\r\n11. 1:09:12 {Why Didn’t Jesus Baptize?} Why didn’t Jesus water baptize anyone Himself (John 4:2)?\r\n12. 1:13:20 {Do Not Evangelize to Some People?} Are there situations or groups of people for whom we shouldn't share the Gospel? Acts 16:6-7 seems to say so, but I'd love to hear your insight on the topic and your interpretation of this passage.\r\n13. 1:17:21 {Godly Headship Carried Out} What does a husband being the head of the wife actually mean he does? I don't find any actionable steps or clear examples in the Bible. Does he boss her around or just be a good man?\r\n14. 1:22:20 {Do We Each Have a “Calling”?} How do we know how we (individually) are meant to serve the Lord?\r\n15. 1:25:32 {Thoughts on Genesis 1/Creation} I've recently seen Inspiring Philosophy's video on Genesis 1. He says that it's most likely mirroring the near East tradition of assigning purpose rather than actual creation. Thoughts?\r\n16. 1:34:09 {Song of Solomon = Christ & Church?} I am currently studying Song of Solomon, and I was wondering, do you believe that it represents Christ and the Church? I have an issue with that, as the book describes a sexual relationship.\r\n17. 1:37:30 {Can Same-Sex Attractions Change?} I'm a Christian, converted this year. I've felt the Holy Spirit inspire me to live a better life in many ways. But I still struggle with one thing. I'm gay and I struggle to see how my attraction could change.\r\n18. 1:40:35 {DND, Harry Potter, etc.} The Bible is clear about its stance on sorcery and witchcraft. My husband and I play DND and some people were having an issue with this and potentially also with books containing magic. What are your thoughts?\r\n19. 1:45:39 {Godly Dating Practices} What is the best way to date for marriage as a Christian? Is there a good way to sift through people to find someone equally yoked?\r\n20. 1:49:05 {Loving the Lord with Everything} I’ve been wondering about the great commandment Jesus gives in Matthew 22: 36. Seems like a Deuteronomy 6 quote, but why does Jesus change the last quality from “might” to “mind”?\n\r\nBonus Q! 1:52:02 Were they really taking the Hobbits to Isengard?\n\nHere's Christopher Yuan's book \"Holy Sexuality\" https://amzn.to/3O6tr1g (affiliate link)\n\nTo ask a question all you need to do is wait till after the stream starts (which means waiting until I'm actually on screen talking), post a question in the live chat with a Q at the opening of it, and be as clear as you can. Thanks!\n\nToday's stream is going to start off with a verse that I only recently realized I had used wrongly for years. It's not clickbait, this is a bit embarrassing but a good lesson for me to share with others.",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:53 {The Sin of Sodom} What Was the Sin of Sodom & Gomorrah? \r\n2. 30:37 {Proper Posture for Prayer} Does God really care about our physical position while we pray or praise and worship? Does He care whether we are standing, sitting, bowing, etc.?\r\n3. 33:31 {Why isn’t Dan Listed?} In Revelation 7, 12 x 1200 are listed from 11 of the 12 tribes. Dan isn't listed. What's up with that?\r\n4. 39:11 {How to View Mythical “gods”} How should we view mythical gods? Were they real? They had to come from somewhere to get the idea, right?\r\n5. 41:44 {Casting Out = Abolishing?} How do you reconcile Galatians 4: 28-31 with Jesus saying He didn’t come to abolish the Law? Casting them out kind of seems like abolishing.\r\n6. 45:11 {How to Explain Perceived Miracles} How can I respond with Scripture to my Catholic friend who says, “I’ve seen Mary & saints do miracles when my dad was in the ICU. That’s why it’s hard to leave the catholic religion: I’ve seen It”? \r\n7. 47:22 {Created More Obedient?}  If God knew humans would rebel in the garden, and that humanity is so prone to rebellion, why didn't He create us more suitable to be obedient to Him? Was His plan to always to perfect us in Christ?\r\n8. 53:23 {Is a Lack of Structure & Liturgy Problematic?} What do you think about tradition and church liturgy? Is it not a problem that contemporary churches lack beauty and tradition in their doctrine?\r\n9. 58:32 {Will the Gospel Reach All Nations Soon?} It seems that Jesus, in Matthew 24: 14, indicates that His return will come once the Gospel is preached to all nations. Can we assume this will happen sooner rather than much later?\r\n10. 1:02:29 {Jesus = Michael the Archangel?} Is Michael the Archangel Jesus? I once heard a pastor give praises and prayers to Michael on the pulpit, and when I asked him about it, he referenced a few Scriptures but I’m just not fully convinced.\r\n11. 1:06:41 {About Behemoth & Leviathan} Can you shed some clarity on what exactly is behemoth and leviathan in the Old Testament?\r\n12. 1:08:24 {Jesus Indwelt by the Spirit?} Was Jesus indwelt by the Holy Spirit, or was it His own divine nature that sustained Him while on Earth in His human form?\r\n13. 1:11:45 {Healing: By Faith or By God?} In Luke 8: 43-48, Jesus says, “Your faith has made you well.” He didn’t say God did it, but her faith. How is this different than the Law of Attraction as told by New Agers?\r\n14. 1:17:25 {Hellfire & Brimstone Preaching} What are your thoughts on the \"Hellfire and Brimstone\" style of preaching? Is there any truth in it?\r\n15. 1:22:19 {Is Debt Inherently Sinful?}  I have a question on debt. Do you see debt as sinful, or is it something that can become sinful if abused, like alcohol consumption? Any clear biblical lines on the issue?\r\n16. 1:25:39 {When Believers Disagree} Can you give me any advice on living in unity with other brothers and sisters in Christ? I always try to keep secondary issues secondary, but I’ve heard “Well, your secondary issues are someone else’s primary issues.” \r\n17. 1:29:53 {Using “Preferred Pronouns”?} I am a manager for a large retailer, and I have recently had two employees request that I address them by their non-binary pronouns. Do you have any thoughts on how I should proceed?\r\n18. 1:34:36 {The Doctrine of Inspiration} What evidence and encouragement can you offer a believer who is struggling to trust the doctrine of inspiration? I know that it’s true, but I struggle with doubt.\r\n19. 1:38:03 {Teaching PSA to Our Youth} My ex is Muslim. He taught our kids that God’s forgiveness is enough and there is no need for God to die for our sins. Do you have any ideas on how to discuss Penal Substitution with a 9 yr. old? \r\n20. 1:41:14 {Are David & Solomon in Hell?} I’ve always wondered why David and Solomon get a pass. David had 7 wives and 70 concubines. Solomon had 70 wives and 700 concubines. If \"no fornicators will enter,\" are David and Solomon in Hell?\n\nBibleThinker mugs can be found here - https://www.zockollpottery.com/shop (note, I don't make a penny off these but $5 per mug will be donated to missions work)\n\nEvidence for the Bible series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nJesus in the Old Testament series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO\n\nPolygamy video https://www.youtube.com/live/RF5suDf2yC8?feature=share",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:01 {God Lied 4 Times??} I’ve recently had someone use Jeremiah 20:7, Matthew 16: 28, the lack of immediate death in Genesis 3, and Cain’s exile in Genesis 4 as “evidence” that God is a liar. How would you respond? \n2. 38:46 {Animal Death Before the Fall?} If animal death occurred prior to the fall, wouldn’t that mean God called animal death/suffering “very good?” If we later see a wolf dwelling with a lamb, wouldn’t that indicate that prior to the fall, that was what we had enjoyed?\n3. 45:12 {Avoid the Appearance of Evil?} You recently said, \"Scripture says: avoid the appearance of evil.\" I was wondering, if 1 Thessalonians 5: 22 is the verse you were thinking of, isn't that verse referring to staying away from partaking in evil, not abstaining from things that look like you're partaking in evil to others?\n4. 48:19 {Human Souls vs. Animal Souls} Does Ecclesiastes 3: 18-21 teach that there is no difference between the spirits of humans and those of animals? I’ve heard this claim from those who reject an immortal soul.\n5. 55:07 {Has Jesus Always Had a Physical Body?} What form did Jesus exist in before He was conceived in Mary’s womb? Did He have a physical body before that?\n6. 57:27 {Evangelism Required for Salvation?} Is our salvation based not only on being saved and accepting Jesus into our life and believing in Him, but also on a need to be spreading the Word of God (the Bible)?\n7. 1:01:37 {Is Repentance a Change of Mind?} If repentance (metanoia) literally means “change of mind,” then why do we say repentance means changing  our mind/attitude about sin? Why isn't it changing our minds from unbelief to belief?\n8. 1:04:16 {Theocracy & Theonomy} Could Christ's commission to disciple the nations in Matthew 28: 19 mean the Christianization of countries and nation-states, or does it apply only to individual people?\n9. 1:11:18 {Will We Judge Angels?} 1 Corinthians 6:3 states that we will judge angels. What do you think Paul means by this, and is there any other reference about us judging angels? \n10. 1:14:18 {Cursing & Blessing in the OT} When prophets such as Elisha cursed or blessed people, was it God who put it in their minds to do that, or did they have a Spirit-given ability to do such things without having to consult Him?\n11. 1:18:00 {Does the HS Help Us or Take Over?} Does the Holy Spirit enhance who we are, as in assisting us in Godly behavior? Or does He, at times, take over completely so that we behave, see, and feel things opposite of our ungodly flesh?\n12. 1:24:20 {The Purpose of Scripture in Eternity} Matthew 5: 18 seems to say some Scripture will pass away at the end times, but Matthew 24: 35 appears to contradict this. What use might we have for Scripture in the next life where there is no temptation to sin?\n13. 1:27:55 {Are We to Administer Revenge Ourselves?} Someone said it was okay to exact revenge on pedophiles, and they used Matthew 18:6 to justify it. Is that what this Scripture really means or allows for?\n14. 1:32:14 {Death on the New Earth?} Why is there a reference to death and a lifespan (albeit a long one) in Isaiah 65: 20 when speaking of the New Earth?\n15. 1:34:37 {Will We Remember our Lives in Heaven?} Do you think we will remember our earthly lives in Heaven, given that there is nothing negative in Heaven and this world is so full of negative things and memories?\n16. 1:40:24 {The Serious Sin of Blasphemy} Why do so many Christians take the Lord’s name in vain? I know several Christians (even two pastors) who do this often. Should we tell them they’re in sin?\n17. 1:43:25 {What did Jesus Mean?} What do you think Jesus meant when He said \"The first shall be last and the last shall be first\" in Matthew 20: 16?\n18. 1:46:53 {Can our Conscience make Sex a Sin?} My question is about stronger vs. weaker consciences. Is it possible to make sex into a sin, and if so, how should the \"strong\" treat the \"weak\"?\n19. 1:53:30 {The Law of Agency} How do you respond to non-trinitarians who use the \"Law of Agency\" to dismiss the scriptural evidence for the Trinity in regard to Jesus, etc. claiming He is not God, but simply God's agent?\n20. 1:57:21 {The Book of James vs. Jacob} I was looking at the Greek in James' epistle (1:1) and his name in the Greek is Iakobos. Why do we call it \"the Book of James\" if the Greek more closely resembles Jacob (Iakobos)?\n \nLinks I mentioned:\nDifferent Christian views of the End Times https://www.youtube.com/live/xmw0uVLunwU?feature=share\n\nJesus as the Angel of the LORD https://youtu.be/ryCyQ4N08Q0\n\nMy discussion about Theonomy with Joel Webbon https://youtu.be/Jbbfx4YAj2A\n\nA biblical case for the death penalty https://www.youtube.com/live/gf259Qv2qv4?feature=share",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 101)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:08 {Is the Canon Closed?} Why can no new books of the Bible be written? Why is the canon closed?\n2. 26:49 {Must we Share our Faith in Every Circumstance?} Looking at 1 Peter 3: 15-17, what would you say to anyone who would ask you about \"the hope you have in you\"? And are there times or certain people who you wouldn't bother providing that answer to (e.g., someone you know isn't really interested in the answer and just seeks to make fun of you)?\n3. 33:27 {How did the Thief on the Cross Know?} The thief on the cross believed Jesus would come into His kingdom, despite knowing that Jesus was going to die. How might that be, since even the disciples didn’t grasp this until the resurrection?\n4. 36:58 {How to Reach a Wiccan} What can or should I say to a Wiccan relative who wants to have seances to reach her dead son? She’s not a believer, so should I just hold my tongue?\n5. 39:53 {The Man in Mark 14} Who was the man in Mark 14: 51-52? Could it be that this was somehow Jesus Himself escaping? As an unbeliever, how should I approach my readings? Any questions I should keep in mind?\n6. 45:42 {Understanding Parallel Prophecies} Is there a process you go through to understand parallel prophecies? For example, 2 Samuel 7: 14 seems to be about Jesus, but clearly not completely because he doesn’t commit iniquity.\n7. 53:11 {Different Personalities in the Trinity?} Do the different Persons of the Trinity have different personalities? Would God the Father, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit act in a different way than the others in a given situation?\n8. 55:54 {Do Heavenly Rewards Support LDS Doctrine?} Every time you answer a question about rewards in Heaven, I can't help but think of the LDS levels of Heaven. How do I debate with them when they use rewards as the basis for their belief about there being different levels of Heaven?\n9. 1:03:13 {Can a Christian Struggle to Obey God?} Can a Christian still struggle with submitting completely to God? Or is that a symptom that you're not truly saved?\n10. 1:05:20 {About the “Two Witnesses” in Rev.} Who are the two witnesses in the book of Revelation, and is it possible for them to be people that are walking the Earth today that are not in the Bible?\n11. 1:11:01 {Are Casual Conversations Sinful?} Someone argued with me that because of Matthew 12: 36 (every idle word…), all jokes and fun conversations are sinful, and that Jesus never spoke in a casual, non-serious way. Is this true?\n12. 1:16:54 {Should We Still Forgive when Not Asked?} Do we still need to forgive others if they don’t ask for forgiveness? My grandma believes that as Christians, we don’t forgive unless the other person repents and asks for forgiveness.\n13. 1:20:17 {Christian Creators: Make This Content!} As a YouTube pastor, do you have any suggestions for content you would like to see Christians make? I'm in seminary and I’m thinking about making videos, but I wonder what I should create (if I did).\n14. 1:22:56 {Being Open about Sexual Sin} Do you have any advice on how to come out (for lack of a better word) to my Christian parents about being same-sex attracted and addicted to pornography? I know Christianity is true.\n15. 1:27:23 {Does Titus 3:5 Teach Calvinism?} What is a non-Calvinist way of understanding regeneration in Titus 3:5?\n16. 1:31:34 {Is God’s Love Actually Conditional?} If the Bible says God loves those who love Him, thereby making a condition we have to fulfill for His love (Proverbs 8: 17, John 14: 21, 23), can we still say that God's love is unconditional (John 3:16, etc.)?\n17. 1:35:43 {Lessons from a Peculiar Bible Story} What is the lesson for us from 1 Kings 13: 11-24 where the man of God is deceived by the old prophet, eats with him, and is killed by the lion?\n18. 1:46:28 {About Catholic Claims: Eucharistic Miracle} Have you ever heard of the apparent eucharistic miracle that Catholics point to? How would you respond to it and how they claim that the apparent miracle has been scientifically verified?\n19. 1:48:57 {Baptized Believer, but Not Indwelled?} Acts 8: 16 says that believers in Samaria were baptized but hadn’t yet received the Spirit. Can one believe and be baptized without receiving the Spirit?\n20. 1:54:05 {Overcoming Anxiety while Witnessing} I always get anxiety and my heart starts beating fast whenever I try to speak up about social or biblical Issues to my family (mainly my dad who is a Progressive Christian). How can I overcome this?\n\nMy full series through the Gospel of Mark with lots of theology and apologetics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj81y0U7Tmw&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF&pp=gAQB \n\nExamining Matthew's use of \"fulfilled,\" or why Bible prophecy confuses you. https://youtu.be/_RTMcCS_r-s\n\nWhy I think Calvinism is unbiblical. https://www.youtube.com/live/oxakEl8BYBE?feature=share\n\nMichael Kruger's useful book, \"Canon Revisited\" https://www.amazon.com/dp/1433505002/",

    "description": "I realize that lots of indy movies and pop-music tends to be less than great. Yet, there are incredible artists who have and still do make great content, at the highest level, for God.\n\nYou know what's even more odd than the disregarding of the history of music? The fact that \"The Friendly Atheist\" (who made the original comments I'm replying to) thought that bad Christian music was actually an argument against God. Right, I know, someone is going to say it was just a joke. But it was one of those humorous things that people kinda mean. Let's be real. It wasn't \"just\" a joke. This is the kind of \"joke\" that people tend to stand by until they get confronted with how ridiculous it is. It's real force is to imply that Christianity makes you worse in some way, but countless examples show the opposite is true in so many artist's lives. \n\nHere’s his video, which has this pithy “reason not to believe in God) at the 1 minute mark. https://youtu.be/_V5ee1M4Slg\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 100)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:09 {AI – Image of the Beast?} What are your thoughts on Chat GPT (and AI in general)? As Christians, should we be concerned about this type of technology? Is it OK to experiment with, or should we \"steer clear\"?\n2. 27:13 {Worshiping at Work: Divided Attention?} Is it bad to listen to worship music when you're working? I prefer it over secular music, but I also feel guilty for not giving it my full attention. Is this treating it as entertainment?\n3. 31:34 {Speaking Over Our Lives} Is “speaking something over your life” a biblical concept? A Christian said something like, “If you were going to die in one week, how would you live? I'm not speaking that over your life though!”\n4. 38:36 {God Sent an Evil Spirit?} 1 Samuel 16: 14 and 1 Samuel 19:9 speak of an “evil spirit from the Lord” tormenting Saul. How could a holy/righteous and loving God give him a tormenting spirit?\n5. 46:07 {Disqualified from our Rewards?} Since sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit, and we will never be fully sinless in this life, how do we not become disqualified from/lose rewards in Heaven (1 Corinthians 9: 27)?\n6. 52:56 {The Biblical Way to Get Married} Why do we have to have an ordained pastor to get married? Is there Scripture to back this up? If two people make a commitment to each other and God, is that enough?\n7. 58:53 {What Does Evil Music Sound Like?} If we took away the lyrics from music, would there still be such a thing as “bad music” or “evil music”? If so, what does evil music sound like?\n8. 1:01:04 {Do We Still Have a Sin Nature?} Does flesh = sin nature? Adam & Eve sinned, even without a sin nature. After salvation, we still have the flesh (Romans 7: 18), but we’re dead to sin/not slaves to sin (Rom 6:2-7). Does this mean we no longer have a sin nature?\n9. 1:06:34 {Can We Go Outside of Scripture for Context?} I've heard 1 Corinthians 4:6 used to say not to go \"outside\" of scripture (e.g., learning history to help interpret biblical context). Your thoughts?\n10. 1:14:34 {The Origin of Sunday Worship} When is the earliest, in church history, that we see Christians worshiping on Sunday instead of the Sabbath? Did it begin with the Catholic Church, or was it before?\n11. 1:19:23 {What Makes “Drag” Wrong?} Drag queen culture is championed by the LGBTQ movement, and therefore feels immoral by association, but I find it hard to put a finger on why drag by itself is biblically wrong. Any thoughts?\n12. 1:24:09 {Eating Meat After the Flood} In Genesis 9:3, why did God allow us to start eating meat after the flood?\n13. 1:27:28 {Using Cannabis Before Quiet Time?} I take mild cannabis edibles for my ADHD. On them I have wonderful quiet times in prayer and Bible study. Would it be rightly dividing Scripture to say this is how I personally am being “sober-minded”?\n14. 1:32:42 {John 15 – Will I be “Taken Away”?} What are your thoughts on John 15:2 and the Greek word for \"takes away\"? I've heard that it would be more accurately translated as \"raise up.\" This word seems to change the meaning of the verse.\n15. 1:39:07 {Do God & Satan Talk?} Is the devil talking to God in today’s generation like in the book of Job? If angels are warring with demons, can we assume there is communication?\n16. 1:43:20 {Which Faith is True?} How can I know I have the right faith? I've been watching many apologetics videos since I first found your videos over four years ago, and many Catholics, reformed believers, and evangelicals all have convincing arguments.\n17. 1:49:02 {About the Shroud of Turin} What are your thoughts on the Shroud of Turin?\n18. 1:52:13 {Leading Others to Biblical Teachings} My family member LOVES Joel Osteen. What are some thoughtful questions I could ask that would naturally lead them to a more biblical, Christ-centered understanding of the Gospel?\n19. 1:55:08 {Rulers & Authorities; Manifold Wisdom} Can you explain Ephesians 3: 10 (ESV)? Who are the \"rulers and authorities in heavenly places,\" and how is the \"manifold wisdom of God\" made known to them through the church?\n20. 2:00:10 {1 Jn. 2:2 & Limited Atonement} Doesn't 1 John 2:2 blow the Calvinist doctrine of Limited Atonement straight out of the water?\n\nLinks and videos I mentioned\n\nWhy I think limited atonement and universalism are both unbiblical https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKyQrAO3ps\n\nResponding to James White and other Calvinist teaching on limited atonement https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shpZMRhr4uM\n\nJoel Osteen misuses the Scripture over and over - https://youtu.be/hHtQSQYPjzg\n\nDifferent end times views explained - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmw0uVLunwU\n\nGavin Ortlund's content on Catholicism is generally really good - here's one example from his channel \"Truth Unites\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ytYX4dXpRo",

    "description": "This is a delicate issue because the terms of the discussion push an evaluation of the person who is failing to find God. I hope that listeners can hear that I am not trying to offer any personal attacks on individuals, but am trying to offer an analysis of how a claim like \"I'm trying to find God and I am not finding Him\" can actually involve a situation more complicated than a simple, sincere, two-dimensional search. Without labeling people with specific explanations for their particular situation, I can acknowledge several layers to this issue which undercut this argument's power as evidence that God does not exist.\n\nMy honest hope and prayer for those who feel they are seeking God and failing to find Him is that they would continue seeking as sincerely as they can and wait on God to open their eyes to Him.\n\nPerhaps you find my answer unsatisfactory.

    "description": "The funny thing about this video is Ricky Gervais is literally just repeating back to Richard Dawkins one of the lines he has used on Christians for many years. Not only do you see Ricky and Richard nodding in agreement, this is a weird claim that I have heard made by many others since the rise of the \"new atheists\" and their caustic brand of one-upmanship rhetorical atheism. \n\nSurely I'll get comments like...\n\n\"He's a comedian, it's just comedy.\" - The context of this conversation is not pure comedy. He is repeating a common line from Dawkins (who is not a comedian but is an anti-theist) back to Dawkins. While they obviously think it's funny they also think its a worthwhile point in favor of atheism.\n\n\"You don't understand Ricky's REAL point.\" Yes. I do. It's pretty plain and simple and no mental gymnastics is needed to see that it's ridiculous to say that Christians are \"nearly atheists.\"\n\n\"Mike, this is really about the 'outsider test of faith' where we ask Christians to explain why they don't believe in other gods and then, after they give the reasons, we say 'those are the same reasons I don't believe in your God and when you apply the same standards you have for rejecting other religions to your own religion you will become and atheist too.'\" First, the claim that Christians are nearly atheists has no true connection to the outsider test of faith. Second, the outside test of faith (and a host of things coming from the \"street epistemologist\" playbook) doesn't actually undermine Christianity at all.

Not only are they fundamentally different, as opposed to the popular myth that they are generally all teaching the same thing, they are representative of foundationally different worldviews. These worldview differences can help us recognize why Christianity makes the most sense of the world we actually live in and why other religions can't be treated as merely different flavors of the same basic ideas. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "My logic is simple and only intended to help people, not to “win” an argument. \n\nIt’s inconceivable that a human would be right where God is wrong. God is the source of intellect and morality. God is supremely good, intelligent, and wise. While it is totally understandable for a human to say. “Some of what God has done, or has allowed, makes no sense to me and even appears morally wrong.” it simply never makes sense for them to say, “I therefore conclude that God is actually wrong. He doesn’t know what I know or he is simply immoral and is purposely doing evil. I conclude that my own evaluation of things is superior to the Creator’s.” Such an attitude is folly. \n\nIf you think God is wrong, it’s very strong evidence that you are wrong. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:01 {Infinite Punishment for Finite Crimes?} Why does God give infinite punishment for finite crimes? Even from a biblical point of view, not every crime is prescribed the same punishment. So why, then, can a person never serve the entirety of their punishment in Hell? \r\n2. 28:35 {Why Did God Allow Sin?} If God knew that humans would fall into sin, why did He allow us to live in this fallen world and not take us straight to Heaven? \r\n3. 34:36 {Has Christianity Changed Over Time?} How do you know the Christianity you believe is the same they were practicing in the early Church if history says Constantine and the Greeks changed things? \r\n4. 39:06 {Why Won’t Christians Marry Non-Christians?} A woman stopped dating me because of worldview differences. I believe in a higher power and wouldn’t have pulled her away from her faith. It hurt badly. Why do some Christians do that? She seems indoctrinated (“can’t marry a non-Christian”).  \r\n5. 43:49 {Is Christianity Itself a Cult?} How is Christianity like (or not like) a cult in either definition and/or practice? \r\n6. 47:46 {Is Every Good Thing an Answered Prayer?} Why are some people so quick to celebrate when God answers “small” prayers, but they overlook the fact that He didn’t answer “bigger” prayers like healing someone of cancer? \r\n7. 53:12 {Why Aren’t Mormons Christians?} Ex-Mormon here. Surely all Christians believe things about God that are incorrect, but they're still saved. What makes the LDS different? How are my misconceptions acceptable when theirs aren't? \r\n8. 1:02:12 {Are Miracles Unreliable?} If Satan and his workers can perform miracles to mislead people, why should I believe Christians when they tell me to look at miracles, or when Jesus says to look at His miracles? \r\n9. 1:07:05{Why Does God Allow Painful Grieving?} Why did God allow My cat to be attacked by a dog if He could have stopped it? We are heartbroken. \r\n10. 1:10:07 {Did Jesus Know He’d be Resurrected?} Did Jesus know He was only going to die for 3 days and it wouldn’t actually be for eternity? And why did the father require a sacrifice if it wasn’t for eternity? \r\n11. 1:14:18 {Did Jesus Exist & Is Scripture Really Inspired?} What proof is there that Jesus really existed, and if the Gospels were written by man, how do you prove they were inspired by God and not by man? \r\n12. 1:20:55 {Why does God Require Prayer?} Why would God require prayer for what He knows He SHOULD heal? \r\n13. 1:25:07 {Can Non-Believers Come to Church to Observe?} Are there any good rules of thumb for atheists attending a church service for the purposes of learning? Assuming they have no intention of conversion, is this considered rude or invasive? \r\n14. 1:27:23 {Is God Egotistical?} Isn’t it egotistical for God to ask us to worship Him? \r\n15. 1:31:14 {Why does God Expect Perfection} The Bible says, “Be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect.” Why would God, knowing that we will always be sinful when we are in flesh, expect perfection? \r\n16. 1:34:46 {Is the Bible Just a Storybook?} How can you believe in a storybook (referring to the Bible)? This was actually a question I faced several times when I stayed in Germany for a while. \r\n17. 1:37:21 {Does God Know Every Choice We’ll Make?” Does God already know what choices we will make? Does He just know the outcome of every single option, or are there maybe two or a couple possible options for everyone’s choices? If the first, what's the point? \r\n18. 1:40:48 {Was YHWH a “Storm god”?} I have been hearing atheists & Muslims saying our God YHWH was originally a storm god. Has this been proven archeologically? Any implications on our faith? Any thoughts on that? \r\n19. 1:42:01 {Stumbled by Theological Doctrines?} The different theologies like cessationism & continuationism can be a stumbling block for unbelievers and cause confusion. How can this be explained to them? \r\n20. 1:43:38 {Are Older Texts More Likely to be True?} What about other books like the Vedic texts that are older than the gospels? Should “older” equal more accurate or true? \r\n1:47:35 Bonus Q: Why is he still babbling and not demonstrating his god exists? \n\nVids I mentioned.\n\nPlaylist on Mormonism https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi-tJmIiOS7OiXmZg8ikq8Eh0OPwfEi1N\n\nPenal Substitutionary Atonement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la0SkKC091s&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHttVR0rkvhBfA-IKrg5SGcp&index=6\n\nInspiring Philosophy’s vid on polytheism and the OT. https://youtu.be/dg-pkeHrh_M and a related one on how Israelite monotheism didn’t evolve from polytheism. https://youtu.be/za260DIsgzQ\n\nMichael Heiser video on if Yahweh was a \"storm god.\" https://youtu.be/3c_i3o2E1H0\n\nMike Licona interview on Jesus mythicism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dQuw1g428c\n\nEvidence for the Bible playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nFull Gospel of Mark series. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF",

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:56 {“Work Out” My Salvation??} What does it mean to \"work out your salvation with fear and trembling\"? Is that a literal statement?\n2. 20:14 {Did Jesus Bodily Rise if He Appeared in the Flesh?} Jehovah's Witnesses claim that Jesus was resurrected as a spirit only (not a bodily resurrection) since He appeared in a locked room, and if He was in the flesh He couldn't have done that. What are your thoughts in response to this?\n3. 25:06 {Honoring Parents through Marital Friction} How can I honor and love my parents biblically when they take offense at and criticize my wife and I for every little thing we do? It's making my wife anxious, and we're going to have a baby. We want a relationship with them, but they seem committed to bitterness.\n4. 30:44 {Can Non-Believers bear the Fruit of the Spirit?} Can someone who is not a Christian show the fruit of the Spirit?\n5. 34:28 {Will Sharing Tough Truth Ruin our Witness?} I'm afraid to talk about issues like abortion, LGBT, etc. for fear that I'll turn people off so much that they won't listen AT ALL when I try to share the Gospel. How can I resolve this?\n6. 43:54 {How Do We “Abstain from Blood” Today?} How, as 21st century Christians, should we understand the decree for gentile believers to abstain from blood (Acts 15: 20, 28, 29)?\n7. 53:28 {Are there Really Any “Righteous” People?} Do the Righteous live by faith, or is no one Righteous? How do we reconcile these ideas without compromising their original meaning?\n8. 58:38 {Does Sincerity = Salvation?} I have a Muslim friend that I speak with regularly about God. I am a firm Christian, but I question how other God-fearing people who have been indoctrinated into a specific religion are not saved.\n9. 1:04:17 {Could the HS be Feminine?} Could the Holy Spirit be feminine? A biblically sound, wiser, older Christian in my life is unsure about this. He brings up decent arguments affirming this view, but then there's John 15: 26. Thoughts?\n10. 1:09:01 {Has God Hidden What We Need to Know?} What are your thoughts on Mathew 11: 25? I was raised in the Branham cult where there is a great deal of anti-intellectualism. They also claim that God has blinded most Christians from Branham.\n11. 1:14:41 {Will We Receive Anything We Ask of God?} The Bible says, “Ask and you shall receive.” I asked Jesus to save my mother, but He didn’t. Then why did He say, “Ask and you shall receive”?\n12. 1:21:03 {Resolving Translational Differences} Why does 1 Corinthians 11: 16 seem to have opposite meanings depending on the translation? How should we understand it? \n13. 1:24:30 {Missing Verses? Is My Bible Reliable?} I've just learned that some Bibles are missing passages. How should we approach the Bible knowing some verses have been left out?\n14. 1:32:27 {Why Is There Still Evil on Earth?} My 10-year-old wants to know, if Satan was defeated, then why is there still evil on the planet? I couldn’t think of a good way to answer her. Help?\n15. 1:36:43 {What is “Hyper-Charismatic”?} Please explain what \"hyper-charismatic” means. Thank you.\n16. 1:39:27 {Why was Achan’s Household Punished?} Ezekiel 18: 20 says that the son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father. How do you explain the story of Achan in Joshua 7: 25 where he and his household were stoned and burned because of his sin?\n17. 1:47:17 {Did YHWH Lose to the “god” of Moab?} Did Yahweh lose to the god of Moab in 2 Kings 3: 27?\n18. 1:58:54 {Is There a Temple in Heaven?} Is there a literal temple in Heaven, or is that meant to be understood figuratively? I have always understood that the temple/tabernacle on Earth were to represent truths about Heaven.\n19. 1:59:54 {Using Time Wisely in Marriage} My husband likes to spend hours on meaningless videos or gaming. How can I talk to him about how he spends his time as a Christian, especially that our young kids see this?\n20. 2:02:24 {Why is Bible Reading Important?} How is it important to read our Bibles outside of the church setting? And is there scripture to back this up? Why is it important to you to read your Bible?\n\nVideo on how Jehovah's Witnesses say that Jesus never physically rose from the dead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t79qwFwj6g4\n\nDoes Acts teach us to follow the Law of Moses?

    "title": "After years as an abuse counselor…",
    "description": "I spent years counseling men who were sent to me by the courts to attend a 52 week domestic violence program. The program consisted of a lot of very practical wisdom, a whole lot of self-confrontation, and education on issues related to domestic violence and unhealthy behaviors in relationships. I learned a lot during this time. After spending many hours with many men I found several common factors that they seemed to share, which contributed to the damage they did to others and themselves. The lack of \"consequential thinking\" was one of those factors.\n\nIt's interesting to me how much the Bible actually talks about consequential thinking and encourages us to take a very long term approach to evaluating and planning our actions. \n\nThis issue of consequential thinking applies to not only business, family, and physical health, but also to your spiritual health. Don't put off obeying God. Don't harbor sins in your life for years, the long term results will be so painful. Get right with God today. Trust in Jesus and repent of sin so that you can be forgiven, washed clean, and so you can enjoy the wonderful future of those who follow Christ. Following Jesus has short term costs but it only has benefits in the long term. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "It seems trite to some that I would tell them they are simply in no position to make moral judgments on God's actions or plans. To them it can appear that I am being overly dismissive of their concerns. I understand how they can feel that way but, in reality, I'm not actually dismissing their concerns but am saying that none of us in the position of having the knowledge, wisdom, or experience needed to evaluate those issue properly. It genuinely seems arrogant and lacking self-awareness to stand in the place of judgment over God. It seems so obviously unwise that I am surprised anyone feels personally insulted when they are told \"you aren't in a place to judge the God of all creation.\" How is that an insult? It's just facts. \n\nThe wise thing to do is take all our consternation, worries, fears, and hopes, and to trust that God will do what is right.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 97)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:56 {Self-Loathing vs. Self-Love?} As Christians, how do we deal with self-loathing without indulging in and practicing too much self-love?\r\n2. 26:19 {Evolved from Monkeys?} From a biblical standpoint, is there any reason that Christians believe we evolved from monkeys? I'm confused why some Christians believe that, and I’m curious if it’s purely a worldview standpoint?\r\n3. 37:50 {Who Are God’s Chosen People?} I had a debate with a friend about Israel still being God's chosen people. Doesn't Romans 9:6-8 and Galatians 3: 28-29 communicate that God's chosen people are anyone who places their faith in Jesus?\r\n4. 48:20 {Do Animals Sin?} Are animals able to sin? They kill for food and sometimes it appears this may be likened to murder, but what does the Bible say about this?\r\n5. 51:28 {Should our Main Focus be Evangelism?} John Wesley says, “You have one business on this earth: to save souls.” Is Christlikeness or spiritual maturity chiefly a means to an end – of bringing people to Christ (Romans 8: 29, 2 Corinthians 3: 18, 2 Peter 3: 18)?\r\n6. 55:00 {Setting Biblical Boundaries as Parents} I had a domestic violence upbringing, and I now have a son of my own. I have fears of family telling me how to parent my son. How do I set healthy biblical boundaries that protect my son and honor Christ?\r\n7. 59:19 {Bored in the OT!} How do I read the Old Testament without getting bored and distracted 2 minutes in?\r\n8. 1:02:13 {How to be a Worthwhile Servant} What makes a servant worthwhile to Christ? It seems like in Matthew 25, the servant was cast into outer darkness because he did not DO enough.\r\n9. 1:09:29 {Understanding a Difficult Passage} I'm struggling to interpret Judges 19:2, 25 on why the concubine suffered abuse. Some have said God was punishing her for adultery. How do I understand this without reading into the text?\r\n10. 1:23:18 {Who Sinned First?} I have been asked, \"Was Adam's sin the first sin?\" Something along the lines of: “Wasn't Satan the first one that sinned?” Thoughts?\r\n11. 1:25:00 {How to “Work Out Our Salvation…”} What does it mean to \"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling\"? Is that a literal statement? \r\n12. 1:28:07 {Is Nepotism Sinful?} Is nepotism a sin? My church was founded by my grandpa, my dad is the senior pastor, and my brother is a youth leader. I do believe they legitimately earned these roles, but others at my church don’t.\r\n13. 1:35:16 {Repentance After Death?} Can someone repent after death? Hebrews 9: 27 seems to say “no,” BUT Revelation 2: 21-27 seems to suggest “yes” for it is the “unwillingness” to repent that condemns. I really hope the latter is true. \r\n14. 1:41:23 {Did Adam Know Right from Wrong?} I was talking to an atheist and they asked, “If Adam had not yet eaten of the tree of knowledge, therefore not knowing disobedience, how can God hold him accountable and judge him for it?”\r\n15. 1:46:09 {The Waters “Above the Expanse”} What do you think the waters “above the expanse” are in Genesis 1:6-8?\r\n16. 1:49:01 {How to Biblically Process Grief} How do we deal with grief in the right & biblical way? I lost my dad months ago by sudden death. I feel worried, I’m angry, and I cry. I’m so tired of the rollercoaster feelings.\r\n17. 1:53:07 {About Foul Language} What makes language foul? Is it the words themselves, or the context? Like if I use a word in a friendly way, is it still considered foul language?\r\n18. 1:57:37 {Can Evolution be Plausible?} Do you think evolution is plausible theologically? I have never heard a good response to how there would have been death before the fall.\r\n19. 2:01:39 {How Could Satan Stand in God’s Presence?} If sin cannot enter God's presence, how could Satan present himself before God in the book of Job?\r\n20. 2:06:12 {Witnessing to Strangers} What’s your favorite way to witness to strangers?\n\nMy video showing the Bible does not teach a flat earth. https://www.youtube.com/live/qePiXK_8Agc?feature=share\n\nMy Romans playlist.

I may have a hard time finding them depending on how you word your question.\n3) It helps if you put a capitol Q at the beginning of your question. That way we can easily spot it in the live chat, which can move rather quickly.\n4) Please don't spam your question multiple times as everyone doing that makes the live chat hard to deal with.",

    "title": "\"No Christian Can Answer Me\"",
    "description": "Allow me to anticipate an objection you might have to this clip.\n\nObjection: \"Mike's answer depends on God's existence and he hasn't proven that yet.\"\n\nResponse:  This question completely depends on the hypothetical that \"if Christianity is true then...\". The question is only useful if it allows that the nature of the difference between atheism and theism be the REASON why a moral act can be performed by a theist which an atheist cannot do. To object to my answer on the basis that it stands on the difference between atheist and theist beliefs is to object to the question itself and not my answer. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. Either this question grants a real difference in worldview approaches or it is a useless rhetorical trick. The framing of the question requires that we either grant God's existence for the answer or we ditch the question as trickery.\n\nAnother Christian answered this question quite well, long before I did. Though I don't recall it specifically, I imagine I saw this video at some point and it may have influenced my own thoughts without me remembering. Either way, the answer is ultimately based on the teachings of Jesus, which means that Jesus laid the groundwork for this answer 2000 years ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqt3Ie8l-fo\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Look at it this way. If you are going to stand before God and have to do so on the merits of your own goodness and works, you're doomed. He is perfect holiness. You are not. He is morally perfect in thought and action. You.... you're like me. \n\nThe only way we will make it is if Jesus stands there and presents us to God through the merit of HIS own goodness and works. We do not give our righteous deeds to God and say, \"see, I've done all I can, judge me as worth of eternal life and forgiveness for all my sins.\" None of us has truly done all they can anyhow. In fact, we've done a whole lot we shouldn't have. Nor can we look into the holiness of God and pretend that our good deeds are some sort of comparison, or anything that remotely measures up to that holiness. When you realize how much Jesus has done for you, that He not only forgives you but gives you the righteousness of Christ, that He now only shows you the way to live holy but lived that perfectly holy way of life on your behalf, that He forever secures your salvation through His own goodness, not yours. When you realize this, it will change you.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

Of course we naturally make excuses and minimize our own sinfulness. But little moments give us a chance to realize we have no excuse. We need atonement. We need a savior.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:14 {Feminism’s Impact on the Church} What’s your opinion on how feminism is impacting the modern Church?\r\n2. 16:30 {Is Ordination Necessary?} What are your thoughts on the necessity to be ordained into ministry? Can I turn my home Bible study into a church?\r\n3. 19:33 {Heaven or Earth During 2nd Coming?} Will we be taken to Heaven during the second coming, or will God’s Kingdom come to Earth to reign? Seems odd to create Earth for Him to just destroy it and bring us to His domain.\r\n4. 24:59 {Relationship Dynamics Before Divorce} I was wondering, if a couple is married and one of them is seeking an unbiblical divorce, does that give them the right to start dating other people before the divorce is finalized?\r\n5. 27:34 {Witnessing to Muslims} I'm 15, and my best friend at school is a Muslim. Do you have any advice for trying to evangelize Muslims who are intelligent and rational but very set in their ways?\r\n6. 35:43 {Should Men Move Out Before Dating?} Looking at Ephesians 5: 31, Should a Christian man move out of his parents’ house before trying to date, to prove they can provide an income and a house?\r\n7. 40:07 {If God Seems Silent, Does He Still Care?} My sister walked away from God because she begged for direction in her life and she says she heard nothing from God. This led her to believe God doesn’t care about her. How do I respond to this?\r\n8. 45:48 {Slave to Sin?} In Romans 7: 14, is Paul describing his experience before or after he became a Christian? He’s just shifted to the present tense, but says he is sold as a slave to sin. Does this differ from Romans 8?\r\n9. 52:45 {How Should We View Extrabiblical Books?} With extrabiblical books such as Enoch or 1 & 2 Maccabees, how do you discern within these books if they're true accounts, if they don't contradict our canon?\r\n10. 55:59 {Earthly Rulers vs. Spiritual Rulers?} In 1 Corinthians 2:8, is Paul referring to earthly rulers (i.e. Pharisees or Romans) or spiritual rulers as he does in Ephesians 6: 12?\r\n11. 1:01:08 {Forgiveness while Guarding Against Abuse} In 1 Corinthians 13:1, we are told that love \"keeps no record of wrongs.” But how do we reconcile this with setting boundaries to protect us from abusive behaviors?\r\n12. 1:03:11 {Should we Pray for Specific Gifts?} What do you think about praying expectantly for a very specific gift of the Holy Spirit? I see people blessed with certain gifts teaching classes. For example, I've seen classes on how to prophesy. \r\n13.1:10:02 {Thoughts on the Anglican Church} Any thoughts on the Anglican Church? I found a church I like, but I have never been a part of a proper denomination before, so I’m worried about bureaucracy.\r\n14. 1:12:05 {Was Jesus Really Buried for 3 Days & Nights?} If Jesus died on a Friday and rose on a Sunday, then He was not in the grave for three days and three nights. Why is it that this seems never to be addressed?\r\n15. 1:18:33 {About Theistic Evolution} Can you explain your understanding of Theistic Evolution? I saw a video by InspiringPhilosophy and have a hard time accepting this viewpoint.\r\n16. 1:25:37 {Was Abel a Prophet?} Does Luke 11: 50-51 mean that Abel was a prophet?\r\n17. 1:30:04 {Who Can Baptize People?} Can anyone baptize? Or must one be a pastor?\r\n18. 1:32:40 {Communicating with God} How can we have a relationship with God when He doesn’t talk back?\r\n19. 1:34:54 {Was Saul Justified in Ending his Life?} Could we say that Saul killing himself in 1 Samuel 31:3-5 was justifiable for the same reason 9/11 jumpers were justified?\r\n20. 1:41:51 {Holy Week Reflections} With Easter coming up, what is something that we might overlook but shouldn’t, considering that celebrating Easter might just become a yearly habit or tradition to people?\n\nMy video on 21 different ways that Jesus fulfilled Passover (so awesome!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbwylmj26SU\n\nMy video on how to explain that \"three days and three nights\" is an idiom for Friday to Sunday. https://youtu.be/uoLYyyqijfU?t=1071\n\nMy extensive Women in Ministry series. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC\n\nMy video on different Christian views of revelation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmw0uVLunwU\n\nHere are my quick rules for questions\n1) We take questions from the LIVE chat, but only after the stream has actually begun.\n2) Please include one or two Bible verse references if they are relevant to your question. I may have a hard time finding them depending on how you word your question.\n3) It helps if you put a capitol Q at the beginning of your question. That way we can easily spot it in the live chat, which can move rather quickly.\n4) Please don't spam your question multiple times as everyone doing that makes the live chat hard to deal with.",

    "description": "This is such a short clip that I'd like to add some details here for clarity. \n\nI am not saying that revival won't be accompanied by increased apparent activity of spiritual gifts. Not at all. I'm saying that the term \"revival,\" in my own opinion, is MORE clearly evidenced by repentance and holy living than by the more obviously supernatural spiritual gifts being exercised. \n\nThis is based on the several Old Testament examples of what I would consider revival, not just the examples of Acts. It's true that the gifts of the Spirit were not operating in the OT the way they are in Acts, but that's part of my point. If we can call those OT examples true revival then we should be able to say that revival can exist with OR without a big increase in sign gifts (gifts, unlike teaching, which exhibit very obvious supernatural action on behalf of God in the moment, like prophecy and healing). So, gifts can be present or not, and it can still be revival. \n\nThis is not a cessationist perspective, since I'm not a cessationist.\n\nAnother support for this view is that Corinth was  a church in need of revival, even though they were very active in the gifts. \n\nSo, when asking, \"is this a revival?\" we can look at the lordship of Jesus in people's lives and not just the presence of spiritually powerful moments or gifts.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:23 {Overcoming Covetousness} Why is it so hard to be content? I've been blessed with more than most people, but I'm always wanting MORE. I drain so much money buying more \"stuff\" and once I see something I like, I'm bummed/stressed until I get to buy it. I don't want to be this way. Please help!\n2. 25:10 {Eschatological Timings} What effect does Psalm 110:1 and Luke 20: 42-43 have on the timing or placement of the rapture of the Church in reference to the tribulation?\n3. 29:59 {How to Pray for Unbelievers} I don’t believe Calvinism is biblical, but I find that my prayers for unbelievers often sound Calvinistic: “Change their hearts, bring them to You,” etc. How should we pray for unbelievers' salvation?\n4. 32:10 {Can We Be as Close as the Disciples?} Do you think that we can have as personal and intimate of a relationship with Jesus as His twelve disciples did? I've heard 1 John 1:1-3 used to support this.\n5. 36:17 {Did God Direct Moses to Deceive Pharaoh?} Why did God tell Moses to ask Pharaoh to go \"three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God\" (Exodus 3: 18) if it wasn't God's intention for them to return to Egypt?\n6. 42:58 {Do our Prophecies Create Reality?} Kris Vallotton cites Ezekiel 37:1-6 to claim that our prophecies create reality, rather than just foretelling the future. Is there merit to this?\n7. 52:24 {Does Jesus’ Compassion Change?} When Jesus interacts with people, He is often compassionate. However, with the 12, he most often sounds harsh. Does His relationship toward us change once we are “on the team\"?\n8. 1:00:17 {Moving Forward after Church Hurt} What are your thoughts on how to best get back involved with the Church after you have had past hurts both done to you, and you toward others? Also, should a person go back to the same church, or seek a new one?\n9. 1:05:48 {Trinitarian Clarity} How is the Holy Spirit not the Son or Father (Matthew 10: 20, Philippians 1: 19)? These verses confuse me when I’m trying to answer this question.\n10. 1:10:38 {Warnings about False Teachings} Do warnings to Churches and believers in verses such as Jude 1:3-4 or other Epistles regarding false/heretical doctrines apply to Mormons who want a relationship with God/Jesus but are just deceived?\n11. 1:15:29 {Knowing When to Yield} My pastor wants me to obey my husband even when it hurts my mental health, triggers my eating disorder, or my sleep disorder. Is he right or wrong? He says I should “Die like Christ.” \n12. 1:19:03 {Encouragement Amid Physical Limitations} What counsel would you give a discouraged believer with a debilitating chronic illness who carries a lot of guilt for not being able to serve in the ways they want to be able to?\n13. 1:24:10 {Jesus AND the Bible = “The Word”?} What is the distinction that is to be made between Jesus and the Bible, as far as the title \"Word of God\" goes, which is applied to both of them?\n14. 1:28:15 {When Translations Vary} What do we do when we find significant difference between translations (such as 1 John 5:7  in the KJV vs. modern translations)?\n15. 1:33:08 {Why Did God Choose the Tribe of Levi?} Do we know why God chose the tribe of Levi to be the priesthood?\n16. 1:34:26 {Tips for Preparing Your First Sermon} I give my first sermon this Sunday. Any tips/pointers for those going through seminary/preparing for their first sermon(s)?\n17. 1:39:29 {Advice for Raising Kids in the Faith} I want to raise my two kids aged 7 and 9 in the faith. I don’t want to push too hard. Any advice? My ex-wife has left the faith, so I feel like it’s up to me (and God).\n18. 1:41:23 {Was Paul Married?} I heard a theory that the Apostle Paul was married and a widower. Do you think that’s relevant, and does it have any biblical standing?\n19. 1:45:43 {Is My Daughter’s Cancer a Punishment?} When I got pregnant from an ungodly relationship, I turned to God and know He forgave all my sins. But my daughter was born with cancer. Is this a punishment from God?\n20. 1:50:19 {Should We Call Out Others’ Sins?} Should we call out sin in the lives of other Christian friends? I had a conversation with my pastor about this in regard to cussing, and he told me if we don't have a mutual edification then it might not be my place.\n\nLinks I mentioned:\n\nThe funny St. Patrick's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQLfgaUoQCw\n\nVideo addressing the \"name it and claim it\" Bible verse. https://www.youtube.com/live/VvA5ZWDSdmo?feature=share\n\nJesus was speaking to Moses in the burning bush passage. https://youtu.be/ryCyQ4N08Q0?t=1025\n\nMy analysis of the mass divorce God seems to approve of in the book of Ezra. https://www.youtube.com/live/NmtM1VQygxU?feature=share&t=4035\n\nMy explanation of why we shouldn't confuse Jesus with the Bible. https://youtu.be/CoBW3LY8xiw?t=310\n\nResources for parents natashacrain.com (great books and articles I highly recommend) foundationwordview.com (video curriculum that I highly recommend)",

    "description": "A worthwhile ministry to support right now....\n\"Restoring Faith\" is a ministry that helps bring aid and to people in crisis. They are sending funds to Syria to assist victims of the recent earthquake. 100% of the money donated goes to aid for the victims. http://restoringfaithinc.org/\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:29 {Worshiping in Spirit & in Truth} What does it mean to worship God “in Spirit and in truth”?\r\n2. 14:14 {Does Hebrews Support Cessationism?} Is Hebrews 1:1 a reasonable proof text for cessationism in relation to prophecy? It says God spoke to our ancestors through prophets, but \"in these last days,\" He has spoken to us through Christ. Are we in the \"last days\" Paul refers to?\r\n3. 21:23 {Hair Length that Honors God} At my age and health, it’s hard to manage my long hair. May I cut it chin length as long as I keep it looking feminine and still relatively longer than a man’s? Is simply maintaining that gender distinction the important part?\r\n4. 23:16 {Is Entire Sanctification Biblical?} Coming from a “2 works movement” (CHM), I’ve always heard 1 Thessalonians 5: 23 taught as calling people to a second work of Grace, or an experience of entire sanctification. What is Paul actually saying there?\r\n5. 29:42 {My Efforts & God’s Sovereignty} How much do my efforts influence situations when God is sovereign and in control? For example, my hard work vs. God blessing my business, improving my health to \"extend\" my life vs. God setting the number of my days, etc.\r\n6. 33:25 {What is the “Harvest”?} What does the harvest refer to in Luke 10? I've always heard it talked about relating to evangelism, but a harvest implies that the work has already been done and you're able to get the fruit of your labor.\r\n7. 37:01 {Can Satan Stop God’s Plans?} Can Satan stop God's plan? I had to cancel a mission trip at the last minute due to something I couldn't control, but doors had opened and things had fallen into place for us to go, so it seemed like it was God's will.\r\n8. 41:47 {Do Unbelieving Children Disqualify an Elder?} 1 Timothy 3:4-5 and Titus 1:6 seem to indicate if someone desires to be an elder they are disqualified by unbelieving children. Does this include adult children? The wife? What do these verses mean?\r\n9. 48:19 {Interacting with Fallen Believers & Cult Members} How are we to relate to fallen brothers in terms of fellowship, and to cult members with hospitality according to 1 Corinthians 5: 11 and 2 John 1: 10?\r\n10. 55:56 {Does Gospel Rejection = Stop Hanging Out?} If I have a friend who is not saved and I have tried to evangelize them and have only been met with resistance, do I need to stop hanging out with them?\r\n11. 58:41 {Why Does God Allow the Wicked to Prosper?} Why does God allow success for celebrities that don’t follow Him?\r\n12. 1:02:17 {Biblical Guidelines – Speaking in Tongues} 1 Corinthians 14: 27-28 says that someone should not speak in tongues unless there is an interpreter, but how are they supposed to know if there is an interpreter present?\r\n13. 1:04:19 {Ministering to a Suicidal Friend} What is a correct approach to reach someone you care about who is dealing with suicidal thoughts?\r\n14. 1:06:18 {Resolving a Scriptural Discrepancy} In the KJV, 2 Kings 8: 26 and 2 Chronicles 22:2 give two completely different ages for Ahaziah when he took the throne. How can we account for this?\r\n15. 1:14:43 {Could God be Playing a Joke On Us?} I am a new Christian and my brother is an atheist. He has brought up the question of “What if God is lying about everything and this all a big cosmic joke?” How do I combat this thinking?\r\n16. 1:19:55 {Saved by Grace – How is Anyone Excluded?} Ephesians 5:5 says that the sexually immoral will have no place in the Kingdom of God, yet later, Ephesians says we’re saved by grace through faith. Is this contradictory?\r\n17. 1:25:20 {Unclean Meats & the Second Coming} If all meats were made clean, then how do Christians interpret Isaiah 66: 15-18, as that passage, I believe, refers to Christ’s second coming, and in it He “destroys” those who eat unclean meats?\r\n18. 1:28:48 {The Right Age to Evangelize?} When is the right age to evangelize? I'm 15 and I used to evangelize and many believed, but I also got into trouble with the police and at my school. My pastor told me to wait until I’m more mature and I’ve learned more of God’s Word. \r\n19. 1:31:09 {Religion = Control? / Where’s God During Abuse?} How do I help my dad (an unbeliever) who thinks religion is used to control us? He also says, “If God exists, where was He when my father was beating my mother and I, and I cried out to Him?”\r\n20. 1:38:24 {Do This if Your House is Haunted} What's the biblical response on what a Christian should do if they move into a haunted house? I know \"hauntings\" are demonic...\n\nThe “Jesus in the Old Testament” series https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO\n\nHere is the “Got Questions” article I read on the stream. https://www.gotquestions.org/Ahaziah-22-42.html",

    "description": "I'm sorry I don't have more answers for you on this. But, what is disheartening to me is how quickly I have seen many weighing in and decisively proclaiming what they \"know\" about this revival that they seem to know very little about. Surely, some people are aware enough to evaluate and give wisdom on this thing. But, there are so many voices out there, with small information and real big conclusions, that I thought it would be a good reminder to us not to go beyond what we know.\n\nP.S.: Hearing from random people who happened to attend this event is not the same as understanding this event. Imagine if someone conclusively evaluated your church off the information of one visitor who attended one time. \n\nI don't discourage anyone from sharing real solid info and careful conclusions. It's just that such things are a minority at the moment, based on what I have seen online and in social media.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "A high energy pastor's anti-beard rant; Here's what's wrong with it.",
    "description": "Someone made me aware of the video of this pastor preaching against beards, to a massive crowd of cheers, and I realized that the question I took in yesterday's Q&A was likely from this rant, which is making it's rounds on social media. I thought it would be useful to juxtapose my answers with his claims. This kind of bad thinking is hurtful to people and I hope this video helps you to recognize it when you see it. It's not just about beards. I thought it was hugely ironic that he even says, \"We don't need beards, we need oil,\" when one of the chief, positive verses about beards is where oil is being poured on one.\n\nSome verse references from the video...\n\nPs 133:1-2 – Aaron.\nLoss of a beard associated with shame. 2 Sam 10:4-5; Isa 7:20, 15:2; Jer 41:5, 48:37\nDavid had a beard. 1 Sam 21:13\nAaron had a beard. Psalm 133:2\nDavid’s servants had beards. 2 Sam 10:4\nEzra had a beard. Ezra 9:3\nJesus had a beard. Isaiah 50:6 (if you grant that this is a prophecy regarding Christ, which I do) \nEzekiel had a beard. Ezek 5:1\nJews in Israel, in New Testament times, generally had beards. It is a default view that any traditional Jewish man in Israel at the time would have had a beard.\n\nThis is not to say you MUST grow a beard to be manly... but it might help. ;) \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org\n\nThe pastor in this video is Stephen Buxton, the former pastor of Hilltop Tabernacle in San Diego, CA. His son is now the pastor and he remains a bishop/elder.\n\nThe original sermon can be found here, at a non-trinitarian conference of “Apostolic Pentecostals”.  https://www.youtube.com/live/5I4gZ9Nn9Co?feature=share",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 93)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:15 {Do We Pray For or Against our Enemies?} How do you reconcile the New Testament's clear teachings to love and pray for our enemies with Psalms like Psalm 69:22-28? Is there ever a time when we should pray against our enemies?\r\n2. 23:44 {Gospel Patterns?} Is Genesis 1:1-6 a foreshadowing of the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ? John 1:1, Luke 1:1, Mark 1:1, Matthew 4: 17, and 1 John 1:1 all speak of beginning, then water, light, and darkness.\r\n3. 29:25 {Unhealthy Associations w/Gratitude} Growing up, I had people expect me to show gratitude as a way to ignore abuse. Now, I want to be thankful for blessings in my life, but I associate gratitude with abuse. How do I separate that?\r\n4. 33:24 {Prophecy Fulfillment, or Just Staged?} People quote prophecy as evidence of Jesus’ deity. Couldn’t He have deliberately fulfilled some prophecies, such as bribing men to divide His clothes, or purposefully riding a donkey into Jerusalem?\r\n5. 37:38 {Why Physical vs. Spiritual Blessings?} What is the significance of God promising physical blessings to nations (thinking particularly of the promise to Ishmael), when, in light of eternity, physical blessings are nearly insignificant?\r\n6. 39:38 {About the Septuagint & Masoretic Text} Is the Greek LXX (Septuagint) considered a flawed copy? The genealogy of Shem adds hundreds of years which is quite significant. Is the Masoretic Text inerrant, or am I misunderstanding inerrancy?\r\n7. 44:38 {Thoughts on the Asbury Revival} What are your thoughts about what is happening at Asbury?\r\n8. 48:04 {Is there a Proper Format for Church Services?} Is the current way we do church services prescribed in the Bible? Where did this current style of worship come from?\r\n9. 51:34 {Was Aaron Punished for the Golden Calf?} Why didn't Aaron get punished for making the golden calf in Exodus 32?\r\n10. 1:00:38 {Butterfly Effect/Multiple Universes?} What are your thoughts on the butterfly effect and the possibility of multiple universes?\r\n11. 1:06:31 {Galatians 5 – Heaven or Rewards?} In Galatians 5: 19-21, is the “kingdom of God” a reference to Heaven itself, or a reference to rewards? A local pastor says it is about rewards, but I am skeptical.\r\n12. 1:14:17 {Did God Permit Child Sacrifice?} Why did God allow child sacrifice in Judges when the man said he will sacrifice anything that walks through the door, and then his daughter walks out? Aren't the other nations judged for this action?\r\n13. 1:19:22 {Can Killing a Leader be Justified At Times?} We know that self-defense is biblical, but what about assassinations like Project Valkyrie (Hitler) or times when killing a leader might save other lives? Are we still bound to their authority?\r\n14. 1:23:50 {Bible Reading Schedule – Required?} Do you think it's wrong if I don't read the Bible regularly? I do read and study it, but I don't have a consistent schedule.\r\n15. 1:26:36 {Parable of the Minas} I was just wondering what your interpretation of the parable in Luke 19: 11-27 is. Specifically, what do you think the slaves and the minas represent?\r\n16. 1:34:07 {Must We Always be “Nice”?} Is it biblical to be nice? My boyfriend is extremely honest and it rubs a lot of people the wrong way. Does he have a biblical obligation to be nice with his words?\r\n17. 1:35:57 {The Holiness of God’s Justice} Any tips for how to become less opposed to God’s judgment, and to see it as holy? It can cause me to feel like God is an unloving God sometimes.\r\n18. 1:42:01 {Dancing as a Form of Worship?} Is dancing allowed in church? Can it be considered worship?\r\n19. 1:44:15 {Works-Based Salvation?} Does Matthew 7: 21 tell us that works are necessary to get saved?\r\n20. 1:46:25 {Are Men’s Beards Prideful?} What do you think about beards? I heard a pastor say that it is a prideful thing to wear a beard, and therefore wrong to have one. I don't really agree. I don't think you do either, as you have one.\n\nMy video on when to rebel against Government. https://youtu.be/s0eX1P2f8Nc\n\nMy “Evidence for the Bible” playlist. Lots of support for Scripture here, including explanations of how we got our Bible books and why they are reliable representations of the originals. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nTo ask a question just wait until after the you see me live on screen and send your question in through the live chat with a \"Q\" at the beginning. If possible, include specific verse references and write your question as clearly as possible. Thanks!",

    "description": "I have been wanting to make this video for quite a while. It's based on the teaching in the book The Physics of Heaven, which is very much a \"Bethel book\".  It is sold in their bookstore, it's endorsed by their leaders, it's written by people from Bethel, including their two lead pastors, Bill Johnson and Beni Johnson. The book is a very open appeal to Christians to embrace New Age beliefs and practices. I truly wish I was exaggerating. \n\nIn today's video I'm going to share quotes from the book to demonstrate the problems with it's teachings and show it's dangers. I'll address the way they misuse Scripture to support these teachings. I'll also be sharing content from a physicist who has weighed in to demonstrate how fake the \"science\" of the book is. Finally, I'll share some shocking details about the deceptions in the book related to the supposed credentials of the \"quantum physicist\" who they lean on as an expert. Spoiler, he's not. \n\nBethel Church in Redding California has presented itself to the worldwide body of Christ as a guide for deeper and more miraculous spiritual experiences. Since they have such a wide impact and reach and their teachings on these issues are, I am sad to say, not only reckless but dangerous and unbiblical, I feel this video is worth making.\n\nA physicist reviews the wacky science claims in The Physics of Heaven. Special thanks to Dr. Martin Krause for providing this analysis for free. https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-30-mghk-BookReview_The_Physics_of_Heaven_v24.pdf\n\nDo you want my notes from today's video?

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Intro\n1. 0:19 {Can a Christian Have a Demon?} Can a true Christian be “possessed” or have demons?\r\n2. 12:33 {About Plagiarism in Preaching} Plagiarism in preaching seems to be on the rise. In Philippians 1: 15-18, Paul seems to be saying the end justifies the means when preaching. Is this an accurate interpretation, and applicable to plagiarism?\r\n3. 20:09 {Should Pastors Discuss Politics?} Should pastors avoid discussing current political issues with their congregation?\r\n4. 24:19 {How Smart Must We Be to Evangelize?} I often get overwhelmed because it seems that I need to know EVERYTHING about EVERY topic (history, science, linguistics, etc.) to be able to defend the faith. Do you have any advice?\r\n5. 27:35 {Jesus’ Sacrifice Contradicted?} Does Deuteronomy 24: 16 contradict Jesus' sacrifice?\r\n6. 33:26 {When Will Every Tongue Confess?} When do you think Philippians 2: 10-11 will be fulfilled? At the end of the millennium, at Armageddon, or throughout the future at different stages? I think Romans 14: 10-12 gives us some insight.\r\n7. 36:24 {Sharing Truth with a Defensive Person} My husband doesn't believe in the Trinity and gets so defensive when I try to talk to him about the true God. Should I not bring it up anymore and just live as an example?\r\n8. 40:01 {How Old Will We Be in Heaven?} How old will we be in Heaven?\r\n9. 44:09 {About the “Church of Christ”} Do you have any insight on Church of Christ doctrine? I have a friend I'm planning to open a dialogue with who is in the Church of Christ. I see works based salvation emphasized, but need help.\r\n10. 46:05 {Are Believers Still “Sinners”?} I was wondering, when we get saved, are we still “sinners”? I know that after being saved we sometimes sin. But does that still label us as sinners? I thought we were new creations.\r\n11. 52:27 {Is the Senior Pastor Role Biblical?} Why do so many churches have a “head” pastor that does mostly all the teaching when God gives teaching gifts and words to many people?\r\n12.  57:27 {Cowardice in the Book of Jonah?} Were the mariners and shipmaster selfish cowards and Pagans in Jonah 1:5-15? Even with drowning in a stormy sea, I sense hesitation to discard Jonah to save their own lives.\r\n13. 1:04:43 {Mercy vs. Sacrifice} What does Jesus mean when He says, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice” in Matthew 9: 12-13?\r\n14. 1:08:17 {Can Coffee be Addictive?} Does proverbs 25: 28 apply to coffee? A lot of people are addicted to coffee, and without drinking coffee they get headaches and other problems. Does that mean it is sinful?\r\n15.  1:13:38 {About the Nicolaitans} Isn't Jesus hating the Nicolaitans in Revelation 2:6 out of character? Also, who were they? I hear they were a cult from the Nicholas of Acts 6, one of the 7 deacons.\r\n16. 1:20:32 {The Destruction of Jerusalem} Do you think that Jesus prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70? Or do you think the passages people refer to are only about end times events that have not been fulfilled yet?\r\n17.  1:23:26 {Living Together if a Couple Abstains?} Is living together without being married while abstaining living in sin? I don't know how to deal with so many Christians that think it's OK, in light of 1 Corinthians 5:9-13.\r\n18. 1:27:34 {Parental Guidance – Sexual Identities} HELP! My wife and I have access to our kids’ text messages. We discovered our daughter texted a friend that she wants to tell us that she's \"coming out as bi-sexual.” What do we do?\r\n19. 1:33:37 {Can Christians Serve in the Military?} I was curious what your thoughts are on the modern American military and if Christians can/should serve in it. \r\n20. 1:36:15 {Are there Additional Spiritual Gifts?} Are there more spiritual gifts than those talked about in the Bible?\n\nMy video explaining 6 different views of Revelation/end times. https://youtu.be/xmw0uVLunwU\n\nI also referenced this video explaining what Jesus meant in the prophecies about the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD as well as His second coming. https://youtu.be/U5XqtcMhSh8\n\nTo ask a question just wait until after the you see me live on screen and send your question in through the live chat with a \"Q\" at the beginning.

Many atheists have made the same devastating conclusion. Interestingly, this seems to push against common human perception and my own incredibly strong intuitions of these things (it most likely goes against yours as well). This alone is a strong reason to challenge atheism. \nOn the other hand, Christians have a clear purpose, meaning, and concepts of morality, beauty and value.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 intro\n1. 1:01 {Yoga Pants & Ripped Jeans?} Ladies on the worship team sometimes wear yoga pants and ripped jeans. I think that goes against the Romans 14 principle of not causing a brother to stumble. What do you think?\n2. 21:29 {Did Jesus’ Atonement Require His Divinity?} Why was it necessary for Jesus to be fully divine in regard to our salvation? Wayne Grudem states, “Only someone who is the infinite God could bear the full penalty for all the sins of all those who would believe in Him...\" Do you agree, and are there any other reasons stated in Scripture?\n3. 25:54 {Daniel: The Iron & Clay Kingdom} What is your interpretation of the 4th kingdom made of iron & clay in Daniel 2?\n4. 30:36 {Did God Need to Create Humans?} It may be a simple question, but why did God create humans? I’d be happy to get your insight. He didn’t need to, or did he?\n5. 36:35 {Do Tiny Choices Affect History?} Should Christians ever concern themselves with ideas like the butterfly effect (the idea that tiny choices have big impacts on history)?\n6. 38:38 {Ministering to LDS Members} I showed some LDS members your Book of Abraham video, but because they believe they heard from the Holy Spirit, biblical arguments haven’t worked. How can I show that they haven’t heard the Spirit?\n7. 45:18 {When Were the Apostles Saved?} When were the Apostles saved? They didn't have the full knowledge of what Jesus was doing until His appearance after His resurrection. Could they be considered \"saved\" before Pentecost?\n8. 47:40 {Will God Reveal when our Thinking is Unbiblical?} Philippians 3: 15 says God will reveal when our thinking is opposed to His calling. How, then, do so many dedicated Christians get all the way through life still utterly confused about essential moral issues?\n9. 52:02 {How to Tell When Love Has Become Idolatry} Have I made my crush an idol? I’ve found myself crushing on a brother in Christ. I’ve also found that sometimes I prefer thinking about him more than God. I don’t want to do this. Any advice?\n10. 56:48 {Are Drugs OK if they’re Grown Naturally?} Is Genesis 1: 29 allowing us to smoke weed and to eat magic mushrooms because they’re found naturally? Hasn’t sin surely had a big impact after the fall, on vegetation?\n11. 1:00:45 {The Bible on Transgenderism} What is the best biblical case against transgender behavior?\n12. 1:04:31 {Did God Die / Is Mary God’s Mother?} Can we say God died since Jesus died? And can we say Mary is the mother of God?\n13. 1:08:38 {Can We Add Punctuation to Scripture?} A pastor at a local Bible study wants me to add punctuation to a section of Scripture that is just words to see multiple meanings. I feel uncomfortable with this. What are your thoughts on doing this?\n14. 1:10:03 {How to Grow in Self-Control} Because it is a fruit of the Spirit, is self-control a teachable skill like in Titus 2, or a gift of the Spirit? What practical advice do you have to get more emotional and verbal self-control?\n15. 1:16:11 {Must our Salvation Produce an Emotional Response?} Most Christians have a moment where they break down and weep as they realize what Jesus did for them on the cross. Is it normal to not have experienced this? I'm grateful, but also weirdly indifferent.\n16. 1:18:43 {Is Reading the Bible Better than Listening?} I have difficulty reading the Bible, and I think that listening to the Bible (like an audio Bible) might be helpful, but I feel like I'm missing something by not reading it. Any thoughts?\n17. 1:20:50 {Is it OK to Correct our Parents?} Is correcting your parents biblical, and what do you do if they do not respect correction?\n18. 1:24:32 {About Love in 1 Cor. 13:7} What does it mean practically that “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things”?\n19. 1:29:10 {How to Tell if a Show or Movie is Appropriate} As Christians, how should we judge whether or not a secular show or movie is OK for us to watch or not?\n20. 1:32:37 {Is Hell a Present or Future Place?} What is the best defense or response when defending the position that Hell is not a present place, but instead, a future place?\n\nMy Evidence for the Bible playlist (including examination of several of the prophecies in Daniel) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnwldgqN8c&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nThe verse by verse study through Romans 14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi1Claoj1Uk&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvQ9G4NCvuiN4Evbp13uQa1&index=44\n\nHow the Mormon \"Book of Abraham\" proves Joseph Smith was a fraud https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in-sPf0pLQM",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:14 {Bookshelf Tour!} When can we get a bookshelf tour?\n2. 11:48 {Should Churches Keep Records of Giving?} My church requires all employees to give to the church (in general; any amount is fine). They pulled me aside to ask why I haven’t been giving, and when I told them I was, but that I felt better giving anonymously in the offering plate rather than having a record attached to my name, they told me it needed to be tracked. Am I wrong for feeling weird about this, or are they?\n3. 17:49 {Is Absolution or Absolving of Sins Biblical?} Does John 20: 23 and Matthew 6: 14 indicate that absolution (the act of forgiving someone for having done something wrong or sinful) is biblical?\n4. 23:52 {New Names in Heaven?} Do you have any insight about Revelation 2: 17, specifically about the implication of new names in Heaven?\n5. 29:07 {Is Changing our Appearance Sinful?} Would changing our appearance in any way be a sin since God has created us in His image? For example, if we wear makeup, is that covering our natural beauty? And if we shave our body, is that destroying the beauty God has given us?\n6. 33:53 {Am I Obedient Enough? Repentant Enough?} I have recently been worrying a lot about whether I am obedient enough, repentant enough, or believing enough to be a real Christian. How can I biblically deal with this struggle?\n7. 39:55 {Why Does Jesus Conceal the Meaning of Things?} In Luke 9: 44-45, why would Jesus tell His disciples this, only to have the meaning concealed? Why tell them if it wasn’t meant for them to understand?\n8. 43:52 {Raising Dead & Healing for Today?} Raising the Dead: Should we practice Matthew 10:8 today, or has the command to heal, cast out demons, and raise the dead ceased?\n9. 47:53 {Why is Abraham Commended for being with Hagar?} Why is Abraham commended for his faith when he tries to conceive a son through his slave, Hagar? Isn't that an indication that he had a moment where he lacked faith?\n10. 50:24 {Can the Deceased Hear/See Us?} Do you think that dead people can hear us and see what’s happening in our world?\n11. 55:40 {Discerning God’s Voice} How can I tell when the Holy Spirit is talking to me? Ever since hearing a sermon about a pastor's conviction to spend more time with God, I think I’m hearing God ask for more time when I close my Bible.\n12. 59:56 {Encouragement amid Infertility} My husband and I have struggled to have a baby, and I have had Psalm 127:3 on my mind. It makes me feel like there is something I need to do, and a lack of faith. What is the context of the “reward”?\n13. 1:04:18 {Why Can I Be Saved, But Not Judas?} Heartbreakingly, I have betrayed Christ for things worth far less than 30 pieces of silver. What is fundamentally different between Judas and me? Why can I still be saved, but he couldn’t?\n14. 1:06:36 {Who are the Called According to His Purpose?} Given the way Romans 8: 28 is worded, I am wondering: are all people called according to His purpose, or only those of us who love Him?\n15. 1:09:27 {Hot? Cold? Lukewarm?} What does Jesus mean in Revelation 3: 16 when He says it’s better to be hot or cold than lukewarm? \n16. 1:13:50 {Could Cain Still Be Alive?} How do you feel about the Bible conspiracy that Cain is still alive somehow and is wandering the Earth to this day?\n17. 1:15:20 {Witnessing to Stubborn Family Members} Does “shaking the dust off your feet” (Matthew 10: 14) ever apply to family? Or are we to always endure in witnessing to family, despite continual rejection?\n18. 1:18:15 {Was Jesus’ Analogy Flawed?} Someone's response to Matthew 5: 13 was “How can salt lose its saltiness? If it wasn’t salty, it wouldn't be salt.” I understand what Jesus is saying here, but does this mean Jesus’ analogy was flawed?\n19. 1:20:43 {Principles for Offering Advice to Others} What are some good steps to giving advice to fellow Christians without coming across as condescending and patronizing?\n20. 1:24:06 {How Could Jesus Have Been Tempted?} How can we reconcile James 1 which says God cannot be tempted with evil with the temptation of Jesus in Matthew 4?\n\nMy video on predestination, election, foreknowledge, etc. in Romans 8:28-29 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO92L11L9jc\n\nMy video on how Jesus could be tempted by Satan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ckvqgPbNZE",

    "description": "One thing I didn't mention in the video is idea that Saturnalia did involve gift giving. At first glance this might seem to imply that the gift giving of Christmas must be borrowed from the gift giving of Saturnalia. But there are some obstacles to establishing that connection. First, gift giving is a widespread practice across many different celebratory days. It doesn't really mean that much to see the giving of gifts on a holiday of some kind. It's the error of many to presume that similarity = origin, even when they don't have additional evidence to support that it does. Second, gifts were given on the 19th of December in association with Saturnalia, not the 25th. Imagine how clumsy it would be for the early Christians to feel they need to have a festival to replace Saturnalia, only to put it on the wrong date, leaving the people with nothing to replace Saturnalia during it's actual events.\n\nMore Christmas videos here:\nThe full \"Is Christmas Pagan\" video - https://youtu.be/ugxJBb0lPXQ\nDispelling other Christmas myths and wrong popular beliefs about Jesus' birth - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmLyxtImeYM\nThe theology behind Christmas songs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooXcxf-H4t0\nDoes Jeremiah 10 ban Christmas trees? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFhHmj77_rg\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:40 {Are Soul Ties Biblical?} What are “soul ties,” and are they biblical?\r\n2. 18:00 {Has Jesus Always Been God?} Our pastor said on Sunday that Jesus wasn’t God here on Earth until the baptism of John and descending of the Holy Spirit. It sounded really bad to my ears. Can you comment, please?\r\n3. 22:46 {Honoring God Regardless of Feelings} When I feel \"good\" I find myself doubting less, being more loving, and sinning less. How do I know if I'm growing in the spirit or if it's just my antidepressants making me nicer?\r\n4. 26:44 {Witnessing to Muslims} How do you convince a Muslim that Jesus is more than just a prophet?\r\n5. 30:31 {Did Jesus Overturn the Tables Twice?} Why is Jesus overturning the money tables in John 2 and not later when He enters Jerusalem (around John 11 or 12)? Did He do this 2 times and not just in His last week (Matthew 21: 12; Mark 11: 15)?\r\n6. 35:06 {Did God Foretell Something that Didn’t Happen?} In 1 Samuel 23: 11-13 (ESV), the Lord says David will be handed over to Saul at Keilah, then David leaves town before Saul gets there, so he was not. Why did the Lord foretell a future event that didn't happen?\r\n7. 40:28 {About the Cruciform Hermeneutic} What are your thoughts on the cruciform hermeneutic or cruciform theology?\r\n8. 45:20 {Advice for a Tough Marital Situation} If my wife committed adultery against me and a child resulted from the affair, am I bound to care for the child? Why or why not, and how would I go about handling the situation after finding out?\r\n9. 46:48 {Should Couples Promise “Till Death Do Us Part”?} In many modern weddings, people promise before God \"till death do us part,” or something similar. Doesn't that biblically preclude the option of even a biblical divorce?\r\n10. 50:16 {Why was the Cross Necessary if God is All-Powerful?} I have an agnostic friend who can’t accept that the cross was necessary. They believe God was not all powerful if He could not find another way of saving humanity without sacrificing Jesus. Thoughts?\r\n11. 52:59 {About Jacob’s Wrestle with God} How do you interpret Genesis 32, when Jacob wrestles with God?\r\n12. 58:50 {Having Insurance = Lack of Trust in God?} What are your thoughts on having insurance and medical aid? I've heard it said that these things are rooted in fear and keep us from truly trusting God. Is that a biblical/wise perspective to have?\r\n13. 1:01:25 {What Kind of Jokes Fall Under “Jesting”?} I'm confused about “eutrapelia” and I don’t know if it is just crude joking or all jokes that word speaks of in Ephesians 5:4. I use the KJV and it just says \"jesting.\"\r\n14. 1:06:47 {Can We Rebuke the Enemy Ourselves?} Can we rebuke the enemy?\r\n15. 1:08:38 {Are Flashy Lights Inappropriate for a Church?} My church recently renovated our hall to be more upbeat and have flashy lights. I'm extremely disheartened by this. Do you have any advice?\r\n16. 1:13:25 {Slavery in the Old Covenant} How do we reconcile the treatment of foreigner slaves (not Israelite servitude) under the old covenant (bought as property, handed down to children, etc. – Leviticus 25: 44-46)?\r\n17. 1:19:36 {Should we Only Have One Teacher?} Please, can you talk about what we should do when a spiritual leader wants you to only take advice from them and no one else, especially when the Bible says to have a “multitude of counselors”?\r\n18. 1:20:55 {Why did Some Men in the Bible Have Multiple Wives?} Most of the men in Bible had multiple wives. Can’t you then say they lived in sin their entire lives? Many people say that continual sin doesn’t equate to being a true Christian.\r\n19. 1:24:32 {Respectfully & Effectively Witnessing to a Boss} My boss is a leader in the LDS church. He is a good and friendly boss but calls himself a Christian. Do I have a responsibility to confront him, and if so, how do I do this respectfully since he is my boss?\r\n20. 1:27:16 {Does 2 Kings 2 Challenge God’s Goodness?} My brother brought up 2 Kings 2: 23-25 to challenge the goodness of God. He saw an imbalance of justice when bears came to maul 40 boys for making fun of Elisha. How would you respond to this?\n\nThe Desert Apologetics conference is coming up again (Feb 9-11, 2023).\nPromo Code for BibleThinker Listeners, 50% off Live Stream Ticket:  50Winger23\nPromo Code for Missionaries, 100% off Live Stream Ticket: DAmissions100\nWebsite: https://desertapologetics.com\n\nHow the \"Angel of the Lord\" is Jesus in the Old Testament - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryCyQ4N08Q0\nMy 3 hour teaching on divorce and remarriage.

    "description": "Forgive my own exasperation at people confidently saying when they think Jesus will return but I find this mistake to be counter-biblical, sloppy, damaging and embarrassing for Christianity. Some will be shocked to hear me say that such speculation is actually harmful, when they think it breeds evangelism and excitement. It may create a temporary benefit while people are expecting the return of Christ as a very soon time, but it results, in the long run, with many disappointed, disaffected, disconnected, discouraged Christians and many mocking and scoffing unbelievers. Jesus said no one knows. Can we leave it at that?\n\n Yes, you should expect Jesus. No, you shouldn't play games with setting dates or trying to get around the general fact that we simply don't know when He will return. We only know what we are supposed to be doing in the meantime. \n\nFull video HERE - https://youtu.be/d2ZsSlUsQuU?t=602\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Some say we should remove it from the Bible.\n\nIntro 0:00\n9:26 The Take It Out of the Bible View\n48:58 The Refutation View\n1:34:51 The Education or Clatter View\n2:05:56 The Strict View\n2:24:44 The Judging Prophecy View\n3:09:54 Conclusions\n\n[CORRECTION: at 2:52:10 I said \"office of prophet\" when I meant to say \"office of apostle.\"]\n\nOthers say the Bible is rejecting these statements about women, not endorsing them.\n\nOthers say this is why women shouldn't speak in church in any way, perhaps singing in the congregation is ok though.\n\nOthers say this is a prohibition on women as teachers during regular all-church services.\n\nOthers say this passage is about prophecy and who is supposed to participate in the judging of prophetic gifts, discerning whether those messages are from God.\n\nIt's hard to get around the idea that this passage seems to endorse complementarian or patriarchal views of gender roles. But we will explore various attempts to do so.\n\n\"As in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak\" 1 Corinthians 14:33-35\n\nWe'll examine all sides and dig deep to get as much clarity as I am able to offer on not only 1 Corinthians 14:33-35 but also how it applies to the topic of Women in Ministry.\n\nAfter years of being a bit confused about the topic of women in ministry I set out to spend months researching the topic in great detail to produce this exhaustive teaching series on the topic. This is part 11.\n\nCLICK HERE for the playlist of ALL the videos in this series (more will be added as I make them). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQSlQLYQsE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC\n\nCLICK HERE for my teaching notes from today’s video.

    "description": "I'm interested in your experience and feedback in the comments on this one. I've experienced those who teach evangelism by emphasizing that you must push people to pray with you, on the spot, to \"close the deal\" (a strangely crude term for such a lofty thing as salvation). I don't agree because I don't see that in Scripture and it seems counterintuitive when witnessing, to encourage people to pray in some empty fashion which they may not mean. So I have no rule. I respond to what happens in the moment. Perhaps I leave them unresolved, with the guilt of sin and the promise of the gospel weighing on their minds.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 88)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\nIntro - 0:00\n1. 1:05 {Our Reign With Christ & Purpose of Authority in Eternity} What does it mean that we will reign with Christ in Heaven? What use will there be for any kind of authority in a sinless universe where our righteousness and wisdom are perfect?\n2. 9:54 {Study Resource Recommendations} Are there any non-Calvinist Systematic Theology books you recommend?\n3. 11:50 {Biblical Hair Length of Movie Characters?} In Lord of the Rings, would you consider the hair length too long for some characters, such as Aragorn or Legolas? How do I apply 1 Corinthians 11 when designing characters for my own projects?\n4. 16:35 {How Was the “Thief on the Cross” Saved?} How was the “good thief” in Luke 23: 42 saved? He died without knowing Jesus' resurrection. Jesus tells him, “Today you will be with me in paradise,” but Christ doesn’t rise for 3 days. Confused!\n5. 22:35 {Should We Hate Evildoers?} How do you talk to someone who claims the Christian faith but hates people groups because they are “haters of God and denied Jesus”? My friend won’t talk to me because I don’t hate evil people enough.\n6. 26:24 {Meaning of the Leftover Miracle Food} What is the meaning of the 12 and 7 baskets left over from the feeding of the 5,000 and 4,000?\n7. 28:31 {Should I Leave My Job if I’m Kept from Church?} Due to work, I’m not able to go to church. should I look for another job so I can maintain fellowship, or should I just continue with the job I have now?\n8. 31:36 {Why is the NAR Unbiblical?} Please explain why the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is unbiblical.\n9. 38:32 {Is Heaven a Choice?} Does Revelation 22: 17 mean that we have a choice to stay in Heaven (the last sentence specifically)? Would we be able to blink out of existence? Would this offend God?\n10. 41:05 {How Would Adam & Eve Know Disobedience was Wrong?} If Adam and Eve didn’t have knowledge of good and evil, how would they know it is wrong to disobey God and eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil?\n11. 43:54 {Can We “Declare” things in Prayer?} What are your thoughts on “declarative prayer” or “positive confession” (e.g., “I declare revival for this city,” “I declare that this day is blessed,” etc.)?\n12. 46:59 {About Boycotting Businesses} Should Christians boycott businesses paying for abortion travel?\n13. 51:24 {How Deep in Theology to go while Evangelizing} How much of the doctrine of the Trinity do we need to explain while sharing the Gospel (especially when it comes to the hypostatic union)?\n14. 52:34 {Was Jesus’ Second Coming Prophesied?}  Is it clear in Old Testament prophecies that Jesus will come not only once, but twice?\n15. 54:59 {Should We Settle On a Religion that “Feels Right”?} If a friend says they're looking for a religion that \"feels right,\" how do I approach them if they’ve already left Christianity?\n16. 59:22 {Will We Remember Unbelievers in Eternity?} After a believer dies, will they remember their loved ones who were unbelievers? I understand \"perfect peace,\" but that doesn’t answer the question.\n17. 1:04:29 {Why Do Two Peoples’ Prayers Yield Different Results?} Why do some people have a gift of healing that works when they pray for people, but I can’t do the same? If we are praying to the same God, why do two peoples’ prayers give different results?\n18. 1:07:50 {Choosing Biblical Homeschooling Resources} We homeschool, and one of the most popular \"Christian\" curricula happens to be from a Mormon. I keep going back and forth over if I should use it because it's very solid academically. Advice?\n19. 1:09:27 {Handling our Emotions Biblically} What's the difference between suppressing our emotions vs. having self-control over our emotions? I struggle to show positive/negative emotions to God/others, and I seem to distrust God/others with my emotions.\n20. 1:13:15 {Did God Rest for More than 1 Day?} In the beginning of Genesis, it says God rested on day 7, but considering no creation happens beyond day 7, didn't He technically rest for more than 1 day, or am I misunderstanding something? Also, is it possible to ask you to pray for me? I'm getting baptized on Sunday and I hope my unsaved friends and family turn to Christ when they watch.\n\nI take questions from the live chat. Start your question with \"Q\" and try to include one or two specific verse references if you have them. Due to the number of questions we get I can't possibly answer them all so I apologize if you send one in that doesn't get an answer. \n\nMy website, with countless hours of free, searchable content. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 87)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 2:14 {“My Yoke is Easy” vs. “Take Up Your Cross”?} I’m confused about why Jesus says “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden” but then instructs us to pick up our cross (of suffering?) and follow Him. That sounds like a heavy burden to me, to try to love and obey Jesus perfectly.\r\n2. 11:46 {Trusting God’s Will for our Loved Ones} We are supposed to trust God with all our hearts. But what does it look like to trust God with the free will decisions of others, like our adult children?\r\n3. 16:51 {Pastors Teaching Dream Interpretation?} What is your take on Christian pastors practicing and teaching dream interpretation using dream dictionaries, Google, and their own reasoning to interpret?\r\n4. 20:11 {Was Christianity Made Up to Control People?} What do you say to a skeptic that thinks Christianity is just a man-made thing created as a means to control people?\r\n5. 24:20 {Is Monarchy Unbiblical?} I’ve been thinking about this question a lot since Queen Elizabeth died last month, but I’ve had it for a while. Does 1 Samuel 8:6-7 teach that monarchy is unbiblical?\r\n6. 29:49 {Does Satan Think He’ll Win in the End?} How can Satan, an angel much smarter than us, be so unwise as to oppose an all-powerful God? Does Satan think he stands a chance of winning in the end?\r\n7. 35:39 {Should Israel be Referred To as Palestine?} Why do you refer to biblical Israel as Palestine when Palestine wasn’t even a country until about 135 B.C.?\r\n8. 39:00 {Should I Date a Hyper-Charismatic?} I've been on a few dates with a great girl, but I've realized she's in a church that over emphasizes prophecy, tongues, possibly NAR things. Any advice on how to approach this?\r\n9. 42:33 {How Could Jesus have been “Perfected”?} Hebrews 5:9 says Jesus was \"perfected\" when He became the author of salvation to those who obey Him. How can an already perfect Jesus be “perfected”?\r\n10. 46:00 {Does God fill the role of Heavenly Father AND Mother?} My 7 year old asked me why we need an earthly father AND mother, but only a Heavenly Father? I started to say God fills both roles, but was hesitant about that in this gender-confused culture.\r\n11. 50:11 {Overcoming Difficult & Serious Sins} Do believers eventually overcome big sins like lust? What if we don't before we die? Does that mean we were never saved?\r\n12. 54:40 {Knowing God’s Plan for our Career} How do you know what job/career God wants you to pursue?\r\n13. 57:50 {Are Only Men Called to Sacrificially Love?} Can you explain how Ephesians 5: 25 is a particularly masculine command? Many verses including John 15: 12-13 call ALL believers to love one another sacrificially.\r\n14. 1:00:59 {Did Luke Journey With Paul?} I have studied Acts verse-by-verse and I have noticed that in some parts the writer uses “we” and “us” (Chapter 28 for example). Was Luke with Paul on his missionary journeys?\r\n15. 1:02:03 {Codex Vaticanus vs. Modern Bibles?} If the Codex Vaticanus is the oldest Bible, how much does it differ from modern Bibles, if at all?\r\n16. 1:06:00 {Overcoming a Fear of the Dark} How can I overcome a fear of the dark? Ever since I was young until now (I’m 25 years old), it’s hard for me to fall asleep every night because I’m scared that there might be something evil watching me sleeping.\r\n17. 1:09:40 {Does This Verse Justify False Teaching?} How should we understand 1 Corinthians 1: 18-2:5,14, 3: 18-19? Ray Comfort quoted this to say Bible stories are supposed to sound dumb! Can't this be quoted to justify any dumb-sounding false teaching?\r\n18. 1:14:50 {Why didn’t JTB’s Followers just Follow Jesus?} Why did John the Baptist still have disciples after he clearly pointed out Jesus? Shouldn't they have followed Jesus?\r\n19. 1:18:18 {Were the OT Sacrifices Cruel?} If God hates animal cruelty, why did He require animal sacrifices in the Old Testament?\r\n20. 1:20:54 {Eschatological Insights} What's your take on 2 Thessalonians 2:7? I've always used this as a proof text for the Church being removed before the time of the antichrist. That and 1 Thessalonians 5:9. Thoughts?\n\n\nI take questions from the live chat. Start your question with \"Q\" and try to include one or two specific verse references if you have them. Due to the number of questions we get I can't possibly answer them all so I apologize if you send one in that doesn't get an answer. \n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:22 {Can We Resist Sin Without the Spirit?} How were the disciples able to follow Jesus and resist sin without the Spirit indwelling them? Is it possible to be a Christian without the Spirit?\r\n2. 8:52 {Help with the Hiddenness of God} The hiddenness (and silence) of God is causing me doubts. Is there any advice or help you can offer (such as that God is silent now because revelation has been completed with the New Testament)?\r\n3. 16:35 {A Young Pastor being Disrespected} I am a young pastor of a church with people mostly in their 60s and 70s. My staff often micromanages me, corrects me in public, and treats me like a grandchild instead of their pastor. Any advice?\r\n4. 22:00 {Is Christian Nationalism Biblical?} Is Christian nationalism in the sense of theocracy a scriptural concept?\r\n5. 25:49 {God’s Judgment vs. Justice} How are God's judgment (him being a judge who carries out consequences) and His justice (establishing order) different if He uses His judgment to apply justice? Or can you explain His judgment vs. His justice?\r\n6. 28:29 {Are Batchelor Parties Always Sinful?} I am attending a bachelor party and I have a Christian co-worker who said \"Christians shouldn't go to bachelor parties.\" How would you response to this? All at the party profess to be Christians.\r\n7. 32:49 {Are Rapture Dreams Truly from God?} What are your thoughts on Christians that have “rapture dreams” claiming that the rapture will be soon? Do you think these are from God, or just a result of all of the end times talk that has ramped up lately?\r\n8. 37:00 {Was Aaron Punished In Place of Moses?} In the book of Numbers, why did God punish Aaron for unbelief when Moses is the one who struck the rock?\r\n9. 41:19 {Overcoming Addictions} I struggle with an addiction to nicotine and caffeine. There are no rehab centers for these. What do I do? I know its sinful, but I need help to overcome. I can’t be a slave to two masters.\r\n10. 45:45 {How Were Jesus’ Words Translated?} Did the synoptic writers translate Jesus’ words from Aramaic to Greek? Does that partially explain why they don’t match each other exactly, because they translated to best explain His teaching?\r\n11. 50:46 {Will the Father Not Forgive Us?} Matthew 6: 14-15 says we should forgive others of their trespasses or our Father will not forgive us of ours. But the Bible also says that all of our sins have been atoned for on the cross. Can you explain?\r\n12. 55:06 {Is Typology Only About Jesus?} Is typology only ever about Jesus? If so, how do we explain the type/antitype in 1 Peter 3: 21? If not, how do we tell true vs. false types when \"no new theology\" can come from typology?\r\n13. 1:01:27 {Christ’s Law vs. the Moral Law} What is Christ’s law, and how is it different from the 10 commandments which many argue is the moral law we are to keep to this day?\r\n14. 1:05:36 {Do Our Spiritual Gifts Ever Change?} As believers, are we given a static set of spiritual gifts, or are our gifts more dynamic in nature so that God adds to and/or subtracts from them according to our season of life or our maturity in Him?\r\n15. 1:09:48 {Should We Date Unbelievers for Evangelism?} My cousin is dating someone who is not a Christian in the hopes that they will get saved. Is this okay to do?\r\n16. 1:13:58 {If My Own Child Comes Out…} What is your take on what we should say when unbelievers ask, “What would you do if your child came out to be gay?” Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\r\n17. 1:16:55 {Avoiding Distraction in Prayer} What is the best way to focus on God? Do you know of any techniques for this? While I'm praying, I try to focus on God, but I always seem to get distracted.\r\n18. 1:18:45 {Can We Wear Cross Jewelry?} What are your thoughts about wearing cross jewelry?\r\n19. 1:21:05 {Am I Doing Enough in Marriage?} My wife works very hard, long hours. She frequently comes home exhausted and stressed. My job is fairly stress-free, and I work from home. I feel like I’m not doing enough for her. What should I do?\r\n20. 1:23:16 {How to Glorify God at All Times} If Scripture tells me to glorify God in all I do, how can I glorify God when doing things like taking a math class, playing checkers, eating a meal, listening to Beethoven, etc., if these things are \"morally neutral\"?\n\nCurrently doing these Q&As every other Friday.

It should be clear that I am not saying it's ok for you to murder people. Nor is my view so strange. John Piper holds the same view.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ylw45go4dpQ?t=6457\n\nSince Doctrinal Watchdog has also claimed that I have no problem with female pastors and teachers, I will provide related clips. Though I would nuance my views more than he wants me to, this is definitely a deception.\n\nThis clip is stating that women are not to be the teaching elder of the fellowship and that \"women are not to take the role of lead pastor or teaching elder, and to have that position as a woman would be what 1 Timothy is saying not to do.\"  And that it's \"God's ordained structure for men and women.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/fT3CWYKsS-4?t=2157\n\nReiterated here that women are not called to the pastoral role:\nhttps://youtu.be/fT3CWYKsS-4?t=3447\n\nYou can also check out my whole Women in Ministry series to see my views.\n\nThis clip giving my position on \"By His stripes we are healed\" and if that relates to physical healing for us today. Another point where I disagree with Bethel:\nhttps://youtu.be/QsjM4i-S7FE?t=17\n\nDoctrinal Watchdog's multiple deceptive videos about me (his channel seems to do this to others as well). \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTkDnXXJBd0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7tZE9ZwZIc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJyu_wfyPrA\nHis channel has several others on me.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 85)",
    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:00 {Is Loan Forgiveness Moral or Immoral?} Is it biblical for a Christian to file for student loan forgiveness? I attended college in my 20s and racked up 20k in student loans. The balance is currently at 16k. Biden's student loan forgiveness plan would really help, but would I be \"taking the easy way out\" when I'm able-bodied to pay off the remainder over time myself? Would it be selfish and irresponsible, or a blessing, to accept the aid?\r\n2. 19:15 {Does God Not Knowing a Soul Mean They Never Loved Him?} Through 1 Corinthians 8:3, we know that whoever loves God is known by Him. Thus, would you agree that Jesus saying “I never knew you” in Matthew 7 is the equivalent of Him saying “You never loved Me”?\r\n3. 23:51 {About the Patriarchs’ Ages in Genesis} Were the biological ages of the Patriarchs from Adam to Noah congruent with their chronological ages? At 900 years old, were they biologically 90? How long do you think they spent in childhood?\r\n4. 27:50 {Was Sacrificing to Molech Similar to Abortion?} Was Molech child sacrifice similar to abortion in that a key purpose was to get rid of unwanted babies born (most often) of sexual sin? Ezekiel 16: 20-21(NKJV) clearly links the practice to fornication.\r\n5. 31:54 {How Much Should we Desire Marriage?} How fervently should I pray for the possibility of marriage being included in God’s will for my life? It has always felt pointless considering that it's likely God may not ever give it in my life.\r\n6. 36:12 {How Will Jesus Reconcile All Things in Heaven?} In Colossians 1: 20, Paul says that Jesus reconciles all things to Himself, both in Heaven and on Earth. What does it mean for Jesus to reconcile all things in Heaven?\r\n7. 39:09 {Am I Called to Global Missions?} Is Matthew 28: 18-20 a calling for all Christians to leave their respective countries to share the Gospel, or just some? How can I tell if I am to leave my home country to share the Gospel?\r\n8. 44:05 {Should We Celebrate Friends’ “Out of Wedlock” Pregnancies?} I have some Christian friends who have gotten pregnant out of wedlock, and I feel like they expect you to react just the same as if they were married. What’s the right response in this situation?\r\n9. 47:35 {Is it Possible to be “Good”?} “Good Man”? Jesus said there is none good but God in Luke 18: 19, Mathew 19: 17, and Mark 10: 18. But, in Acts 11: 24 it talks about a Good Man. Also in Matthew 12: 35, Proverbs 13: 22, and Romans 5:7 (NIV).\r\n10. 51:12 {About Moral, Civil & Ceremonial Laws} Why do we differentiate between moral, ceremonial, and civil law? Meaning, who decided the moral law was to be continued but not the other two types?\r\n11. 56:02 {About Abraham’s Bosom & King Saul’s Salvation} Does 1 Samuel 28: 19 disprove the theological idea of “Abraham’s Bosom,” or could we perhaps assume that King Saul was saved?\r\n12. 1:00:34 {Can Only God be Perfect?} As a philosopher, I want to say that only God is (or can possibly be) perfect. How do I reconcile this with Matthew 5: 48?\r\n13. 1:03:14 {A Family Attending Different Churches} Is it okay to go to different churches while being under the same household? My family goes to a Pentecostal church, but I prefer a Baptist one.\r\n14. 1:05:07 {Should We Require a Sign from God Before Belief?} How would you respond if someone you love said something like, \"I won't believe in any God unless He performs a supernatural miracle right in from of me”?\r\n15. 1:08:27 {Is Satan Omnipresent?} I was asked if Satan was omnipresent. I said no, but was met with some push back. What are some good Bible verses to prove why Satan is not omnipresent and why this attribute is exclusive to God?\r\n16. 1:10:59 {Does the Opportunity for Repentance Expire?} Is there a point in someone's life when they can't repent anymore (like Esau)?\r\n17. 1:16:39 {Can We Take Communion for Someone Else?} My mom likes to “take communion over people” when they need prayer as if it does something extra special or gives her favor in prayer. It seems like this isn’t right or biblical. Thoughts?\r\n18. 1:18:52 {What is being Awaken from in Daniel 12?} In Daniel 12:2 what are they \"awakening\" from?\r\n19. 1:20:50 {Discerning What is Vanity in our Appearance} How do you discern what is vanity and what is not? Is wanting to \"fix\" appearances always vanity? Examples: covering scars with tattoos or having rhinoplasty to \"fix\" an appearance after a broken nose.\r\n20. 1:24:53 {Does the Bible Refer to Men as Virgins, or Only Women?} Why are women in the Bible referred to as virgins, but not men? It makes it seem as though sexual purity was only important for women, but not for men. I know that’s not true, but would love clarity.\r\n1:29:21 Surprise Bonus Q!\n\nI take questions from the live chat. Start your question with \"Q\" and try to include one or two specific verse references if you have them. Due to the number of questions we get I can't possibly answer them all so I apologize if you send one in that doesn't get an answer. \n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "It's very tempting to try to view myself as if I am truly good. If you read the Bible in context you'll see how much of it is showing mankind how serious our sin is, while we stand around with goofy smiles, thinking that we're not that bad. We can think that it's going to harm our psychology to see ourselves as truly sinful but it seems to me that a truly healthy mindset doesn't self-deceive. When we do finally admit that we are deeply in need of forgiveness we are humbled and ready to trust in Jesus to provide all the grace that's needed to wipe away all our sin. God's grace will fix our guilt, our denial will only make the problem worse.\n\nSee the WHOLE answer here. https://youtu.be/BO92nZDILWY?t=4425\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Since Joel Osteen removed my first video giving a full analysis of his sermon, I am uploading this highly edited one focused on his use of Scripture specifically. \n\nWhy are you doing this Mike? Because you can't think biblically if your teachers are misusing the Bible all the time. And pointing out when and how this happens is one of the best ways to help people learn not to do it themselves.\n\nI don't have anything personal against Joel Osteen. I do, however, feel a calling to help people learn to think biblically about everything and I recognize that the pop-level teaching of popular internet/TV preachers has done a lot of harm to our ability to read the Bible and our awareness of how serious Jesus' call to discipleship really is.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Here's the link I told you about, for searching on my site for answers to your questions. https://biblethinker.org/biblethinker-qa-topical-index/\n\nHERE’S my video on the unforgivable sin https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KmCHX8-2Smo\n\nHERE’S my video on how atheist scholar, Bart Ehrman, misleads millions. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g2ne3ndnVQk\n\nMy goal is to help you on the road to thinking biblically about everything.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:39 {Did Jesus Contradict Himself?} Why would Jesus instruct us to let our good works be seen by others (Matthew 5: 16) if He also instructed us to do our good works in secret (Matthew 6:1-4)? Am I misunderstanding something?\r\n2. 12:19 {Do Some People Get More Grace?} Romans 5:2 says we stand on grace. In Acts 4: 33, it says great grace was upon them all. Does that mean some people have more grace? I’ve heard you say we don't get grace little by little.\r\n3. 18:10 {If You’ve Forgotten a Promise to God} What do you do when you’ve made a promise to God and either forget the specifics of it or forget you’ve made it altogether?\r\n4. 20:58 {Should We Fear Future Events?} What is a healthy way to look at the future with all the disasters in Revelation? I have trouble building up my life without fearing everything will change soon, for the worse.\r\n5. 25:51 {Responding to Pro-Choice Thinking} How can we respond to someone who uses, “A creator has the right to do whatever they want with their own creation” as a pro-choice argument?\r\n6. 30:54 {About “Holy Water” or “Blessed” Objects} A local street preacher uses holy water on the ground, which he says keeps demonic activity from disrupting his preaching. I haven't seen Scripture support this. Is it biblical?\r\n7. 36:18 {About the Millennial Kingdom} If God is eternal and He knows everything from the beginning to the end, then why does He set up a 1000 year Millennium Kingdom? What are the reasons for this, biblically?\r\n8. 42:18 {Perichoresis vs. Modalism} Can you explain the difference between the concepts of perichoresis and modalism? They seem to be very similar ideas on the surface.\r\n9. 46:06 {About Bart Ehrman’s Teachings & Tactics} You have talked about Dr. Bart Ehrman (ex: your “Atheist Scholar Misleads Millions Of People” video). Does he also use these \"techniques\" on his professional peers?\r\n10. 51:27 {Trusting God when He Seems Silent} What practical steps do you do to trust in the Lord? I frequently have difficulty trusting Him during difficult times, especially when He doesn’t seem to be answering prayer.\r\n11. 59:20 {Were the Nazis Appointed by God?} Were the Nazis as a government authority \"appointed by God\" according to Romans 13?\r\n12. 1:03:39 {Why did God Send Jacob to Egypt?} In Genesis 12: 10, Abraham goes to Egypt. That decision is considered by many as disobedience to God. If going to Egypt is related to a bad decision, why is it that later, God sent Jacob to Egypt?\r\n13. 1:06:30 {Are We Dead to Sin, or Sold Under It?} Why does Paul say \"...reckon ye yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God through Christ Jesus our Lord\" in Romans 6: 11, yet in Romans 7: 14, he says, \"...but I am carnal, sold under sin\"?\r\n14. 1:10:05 {Traditional Preferences over Biblical Theology?} I’m an ex-Catholic, but I’m getting pulled back in. I don’t know why, but I just like praying in Latin, the Rosary, praying to saints, and using scripted prayers because I don’t know how to pray on my own.\r\n15. 1:18:15 {How to Understand the Bible} What is your general advice on understanding Bible verses that we don't understand?\r\n16. 1:20:33 {Communion: How Frequent?} My dad thinks that the Lord's Supper should only be observed on Passover because when Jesus said \"do this in remembrance of Me,” He meant Passover. Any evidence in Scripture for weekly communion?\r\n17. 1:25:06 {How to Help Victims of Abuse} I'm a new youth leader and we have teenagers who are severely abused at home. What messages do we focus on to help them? And what else can we do to help?\r\n18. 1:28:40 {Does God Command Murder?} What do you think of people that commit murder and then state, “God told me to do it”?\r\n19. 1:32:20 {Corporate vs. Individual Election} What are your thoughts on the idea of corporate election, as opposed to individual election?\r\n20. 1:35:22 {Is Jesus the Bible?} How should we biblically respond when someone says they believe Jesus IS the Torah or Jesus IS the Bible?\n\nI take questions from the live chat, after the stream has begun. Start your question with \"Q\" and try to include one or two specific verse references if you have them. Due to the number of questions we get, I can't possibly answer them all, so I apologize if you send one in that doesn't get an answer.

    "description": "Yes, we want to pray for their salvation! But I think that some people have a hard time praying for those who they see as causing large scale harm or problems for others when they mistakenly think we are supposed to ask God to prosper them in their efforts. Instead, we can pray for God to bring good out of their leadership and for other blessings which don't involve supporting ungodly commitments or commitments that we see as ungodly.

    "description": "My goal is to help you on the road to thinking biblically about everything.\n\nHere’s my video analyzing how Roman Catholics apologists abuse typology to teach Mariology. https://youtu.be/5p7DIQnRYO8 \n\nThis is the entire “How to Find Jesus in the Old Testament” series. The most personally rewarding and thrilling series I’ve ever done. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:54 {The Purpose of our Lives} As Christians, what is the purpose of our lives?\r\n2. 16:53 {About Kenosis Theology} Is Bethel style Kenosis theology from Philippians 2:5-11 heretical (where Christ is said to have lost His divinity to live instead as a human)? Or is that a secondary issue like sacraments and eschatology?\r\n3. 25:39 {When People Justify Bad Behavior w/Scripture} When strong Christians suddenly start to justify sinful treatment of others (rage, control, insults, blaming) through Scripture twisting, could this be due to a shipwrecked faith or mental illness?\r\n4. 28:09 {Should we Pray in Public Before Meals?} I grew up praying before every meal, even in restaurants. I want to know how often I should do this, since I don’t want to be like the Pharisees praying publicly to be seen by others.\r\n5. 32:45 {Can Satan Heal People?} In view of the magicians in Exodus potentially getting their power from Satan, can Satan and demons heal, and are these potentially healings that don't last?\r\n6. 37:58 {How to Reach Catholic Family Members} I’m a new believer, and my wife is a Catholic. Married 5 years. We have 2 very young baby daughters. How do I win my wife to Christ if she grew up rigidly Catholic? I can't break past her typological beliefs.\r\n7. 43:35 {Empathizing with Victims of Tragic Events} How should I view the pain I feel for victims of the Holocaust, Nanking Massacre, etc. when these groups were mostly un-elect vessels of wrath who will receive no comfort?\r\n8. 49:06 {Is Psychology Satanic?} I’ve heard some people say that psychology belongs to Satan and that Christians should stray from studying it. What is your opinion on that, and is there any biblical basis for avoiding it?\r\n9. 57:58 {How Might Fathers Exasperate their Children?} What does “Fathers, do not exasperate your children” in Colossians 3: 21 mean? Is this meant to be a general guidance to raising children, or discipling them?\r\n10. 1:03:06 {How to Distinguish Core Doctrines} How do I know what things are a “salvation issue” that I have to be right about, and what things are more open to interpretation that if I am wrong about my salvation will not be affected?\r\n11. 1:06:27 {Why is the Resurrection so Important?} Why are Jesus' claims and resurrection the one true root of our faith? Asking to help explain it to unbelievers who believe all religions lead to God.\r\n12. 1:11:22 {Must We Look Forward to our Glorified Bodies?} As a disabled person, some claim I’m missing out because I’m not looking forward to a new body. I’m content. Thoughts?\r\n13. 1:13:22 {Why was Tamar a “Disgraced Woman”?} Why was Tamar in 2 Samuel considered “a disgraced woman” after being raped by her half-brother, Amnon?\r\n14. 1:22:04 {Should we Insert Names into Scripture?} A friend likes to substitute names in place of \"you\" in Scripture. Is that biblical? Romans 15: 13 for example.\r\n15. 1:25:15 {Why does Jesus need to Pray in Heaven?} Why does Jesus pray for us in Heaven when He could just directly ask God, since He is seated at the right hand of God?\r\n16. 1:29:50 {How to get Others Excited about Apologetics} What is the best way to get a fellow believer to realize the importance of apologetics? I meet way too many Christians who are just like, \"I just read the Bible and that's all that's important.\"\r\n17. 1:33:38 {Why 6 Commandments Rather Than 10?} In Matthew 19: 18-19, why doesn’t Jesus tell the man to follow all 10 commandments instead of the 6 he listed when the man questioned him about having eternal life?\r\n18. 1:40:54 {Was Early Church Worship the Same?} Do we know if the early Church worshiped in a similar way to how we have corporate worship today?\r\n19. 1:43:48 {How to Draw Near to God when we Feel Far} I’m far from the Lord in this moment and not very genuine. What could I do to improve my relationship with God and to be as honest as I can, be obedient to Him, and listen to His word?\r\n20. 1:46:59 {Are we “Worthy” and “Enough”?} What do you think of popular statements such as “You are Worthy” and “You are enough”? To me, neither sound biblical. We are unworthy and not enough, and neither do we have to be, because Jesus is.\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

I don't think there's much good reason to do that, and I gave some more specifics in my full answer to the question found here https://youtu.be/5gROCeT3KjI?t=2509\n\nBut, I thought this clip would apply well to pretty much anyone cohabitating (which typically means that they are sleeping together) who call themselves Christians and think they have some good reasons for it. I know this goes totally against the general way of our culture. But that's pretty much par for the course if you are a true follower of Jesus.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "Have We Misunderstood \"Wives Submit\"? Women in Ministry part 9",
    "description": "Many, not all, egalitarians say that the fundamental way that marriage works, in relationship to authority, has been widely misunderstood by Christians throughout history. They say that wives are not called to submit in any greater fashion than their husbands are. They say that the real biblical teaching is for \"mutual submission.\" \n\nToday we will cover the main passages that seem to teach an authority imbalance in the marriage relationship, examine the context of each from a traditional, complementarian perspective, and then we'll spend the majority of our time going over egalitarian claims that would offer linguistic, contextual and historical reasons for why that's not what it means. They will generally say that a passage simply does not say that there is an authority imbalance in marriage, or that it does say that but it was only for a particular culture and a particular time.\n\nAfter years of being a bit confused about the topic of women in ministry I set out to spend months researching the topic in great detail to produce this exhaustive teaching series on the topic. This is part 9.\n\nCLICK HERE for the playlist of ALL the videos in this series (more will be added as I make them). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQSlQLYQsE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC\n\nYou can also find more videos freely available on my website:\nhttps://BibleThinker.org\n\nMy NOTES from today. https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/9-Mutual-submission-or-wifely-submission.revised.docx\n\nTime Stamps:\r\n\r\n0:00 – Intro\r\n1. 10:36 Mike’s teaching through 1 Peter 3:1-7\r\n2. 30:19 Mike’s teaching through Col. 3: 18-19\r\n3. 35:04 Mike’s teaching through Titus 2:5\r\n4. 35:52 Mike’s teaching through Eph. 5: 21-33\r\n5. 49:23 Mike’s teaching on 1 Cor. 7:3-5\r\n6. 55:14 Egalitarian view of 1 Pet. 3:1-7\r\n7. 1:21:55 Egalitarian view of Col. 3: 18-19\r\n8. 1:30:45 Egalitarian view of Eph. 5: 21-36\r\n9. 2:40:47 The slavery objection\r\n10. 3:05:07 Conclusion",

They attempt to use John 19: 34 to justify this, and they also believe Jesus never consumed wine. Is this biblical?\n3. 21:10 {Does Jesus Live in Us?} Would it be accurate after reading 1 Corinthians 6: 19 & 2 Corinthians 13:5 to state that both the Holy Spirit and Jesus live in the believer?\n4. 26:40 {Are “God-Given Rights” Biblical?} Does the Bible say anything about \"God Given Rights,” at least the way many Americans use the phrase?\n5. 33:20 {When & How to Evangelize} I want everyone to be saved & I feel guilty if I don't share the Gospel with every person I see. How do I know when I should share the Gospel & how do I start the conversation?\n6. 38:08 {Is the Curse of the Ground Still Active?} In what way did Noah bring relief from the curse of the ground (Genesis 5: 28-29)? Am I mistaken in thinking the curse still seems active today (Genesis 3: 17-19; 8: 21)?\n7. 43:47 {What is a False Teacher?} What do you think is the biblical definition of a false teacher? People's interpretations of this vary widely. I’d just like to have a fresh pair of eyes on it.\n8. 47:58 {About Fantasy Entertainment} What is your stance on fantasy entertainment which utilizes pagan/made up religions such as GoT, Lotr, Zelda, Hercules, or Valheim? Isn’t it promoting Idolatry?\n9. 52:05 {Safeguarding Ourselves While Witnessing} I have felt God call me to minister to the JWs, and He has opened doors for me to do so. What should I do to make sure my faith is not endangered when I am doing ministry? I meet with them tonight.\n10. 56:21 {How does Our Will Intertwine with God’s?} In Genesis 20:4-6, Abimelech seems to think he didn’t touch Sarah out of his own will, but God says HE didn’t allow it. Any insight on the intersection between our will and God’s hand making stuff happen?\n11. 1:01:29 {How did Jesus Pay in Advance for our Sin?} I'm not sure about penal substitution. How can it be that my sins, which were not yet committed at the time of the crucifixion, could have been imputed to Christ on the cross?\n12. 1:06:43 {Discerning God’s Calling from Our Feelings?} How can I tell the difference between when God is truly calling me to something or if I am just searching for signs?\n13. 1:11:44 {Is Being Baptized in a Special Location More “Spiritual”?} Is it wrong to think being baptized in the Jordan River could be special?\n14. 1:14:23 {What does it Look Like to “Renounce All” for God?} How should we live out Luke 14: 33?\n15. 1:20:26 {Should False Teachers be Shown Less Grace?} I've been told that when witnessing to groups such as the LDS (Mormons), a rebuke is better than a conversation because of Acts 13:8-10. Should false teachers be shown less grace than non-believers?\n16. 1:23:56 {Will Sin Send Some Believers to Hell?} Is Matthew 5: 30 referring to believers? How do we reconcile this with \"There is no condemnation in Christ\"?\n17. 1:25:18 {Are the Ceremonial Laws Gone?} Where do we see in Scripture that the old ceremonial laws are gone?\n18. 1:26:50 {How Important are Legal Marriage Papers?} Help, Mike. I need a Bible verse to help a Christian couple who are cohabitating and have 4 kids, but don’t want to marry. They say faithfulness is more important than marriage papers.\n19. 1:29:07 {Should we Pray for those who Pass Away?} I just lost a friend to an overdose. I don't think she was a believer. Should I pray for her mercy or is there no point after death?\n20. 1:30:56 {Does God Tempt?} God tests/tempts Israel and Abraham. But James says God doesn't test/tempt. How can we make sense of this?\n21. 1:33:45 {Health/Prayer Update} Pastor Mike, can you give us an update on your personal health and sleep troubles?",

I have been disappointed in friends, family, and \"church people\" a lot and I found out it has a big impact in my life.\n2. 15:36 {Could Satan Repent?} Would God forgive Satan if he repented?\n3. 19:33 {One Death or Two in Scripture?} How do we reconcile Hebrews 9: 27 with there also being a “second death” (as in: Revelation 2:11, Revelation 20:6,14, & Revelation 21:8)? Is there one death or two?\n4. 22:56 {Is it Wrong to Honor a DNR?} What do you think about DNR (do not resuscitate) orders? If I can’t perform CPR on a patient when it could save their life because the order forbids it, am I committing murder by honoring it?\n5. 27:10 {Does Breath Determine Life?} I've heard people quote Genesis 2:7 (usually from the KJV) to show that a soul can't live or exist without both body and breath. Is this an accurate understanding, and if not, why?\n6. 34:27 {Why Did God Call a “Chosen People”?} Why did God decide to have a “chosen people”? Was this due to His will to have a “people” that His Son would come from?\n7. 38:09 {Are We All Lying on the Internet?} Is it a sin to tick a box that says \"I have read and accepted the terms and conditions...\" without having read them first (e.g. when installing software)? Key word being \"read.” That would be lying, yes?\n8. 41:37 {Are Pictures of God in Movies or School Biblical?} Is Christian entertainment like The Chosen a violation of the 2nd Commandment? Are things like Sunday school lessons hurting our theology by using pictures of things or people?\n9. 46:45 {About the Doctrine of Election} How do you interpret 2 Thessalonians 2: 13 in light of the debate on the doctrine of election?\n10. 49:51 {Is Jesus in Human Form in Heaven?} My question is about the incarnation of Christ. Since He was bodily raised from the dead, does that mean He is still the incarnation in Heaven?\n11. 54:17 {Who did God Purchase Us From?} 1Corinthians 6: 19 says \"You are not your own, you were bought with a price.” Are the buyer and the seller the same person (e.g., Is God buying the people from Himself)?\n12. 57:19 {Are Altar Calls Biblical?} Are altar calls biblical? Hard to find much of this in the New Testament. Hard to think this through without preconceived notions.\n13. 1:05:01 {Overcoming Nervousness in Evangelism} I’m starting high school soon, and I feel very nervous to share the Gospel in person. Is it wrong for me to just stick to sharing it online where I don’t feel nervous at all?\n14. 1:07:07 {Can we Trust Paul’s Writings?} I was wondering how you combat the claims against the Apostle Paul if you have heard of the claims against him, such as preaching a different Gospel than Jesus and the 12.\n15. 1:10:24 {About Egypt’s Sacrifices in Isaiah} Isaiah 19: 21 speaks of Egypt repenting and offering Jewish sacrifices. How can this be, since we no longer have those sacrifices?\n16. 1:12:41 {Solidifying our Identities} How do I know if I am solidified in my own identity? And do you think it is biblically important for people who walk with you in the faith to understand your identity and who you are as a person?\n17. 1:16:31 {Should we be Baptized while Having Doubts?} People encourage me to get baptized ASAP (Acts 22: 16), but I struggle with serious psychological doubts. Should I disregard my doubts and get baptized? Can I take more time?\n18. 1:20:04 {Why did Jesus call the Father His God?} I've been wrestling with this passage for a couple of months, and I haven't found a solid answer yet. It's in John 20: 17. I can't seem to understand why Jesus calls the Father His God.\n19. 1:24:33 {Evaluating our Spiritual Traditions} I'm an ex-Muslim follower of Christ from Afghanistan.

What will we do with our time for eternity? Will we have actual bodies, or just be spirits?\r\n2. 21:44 {About Prophecy & Marriage in Heaven} How will Isaiah 54:1 be fulfilled if there is no marriage in heaven?\r\n3. 24:17 {About Following our Conscience} I Grew up in a KJVO (King James Version Only) Independent Fundamental Baptist church. I have thought about reading the NKJV, but my conscience feels like this is wrong. Does Romans 14 mean I must defer to my conscience in this situation?\r\n4. 33:38 {When did the New Cov. Begin?} Did the New Covenant officially begin at Jesus’ last supper, death, burial, and resurrection…or at His ascension (alluded to in John 20: 17)?\r\n5. 40:42 {Does God Get Angry When We Sin?} Does God ever get angry with believers when we sin? If not, why did God get so angry with the Israelites when they sinned?\r\n6. 47:18 {Why are Tongues Only Prevalent in Some Denominations?} Why is speaking in tongues so common in specific church denominations, but virtually never happens in others? What does this say about other spiritual gifts?\r\n7. 52:07 {Did Jesus Come to Abolish the Law?} Does Ephesians 2: 15 contradict Matthew 5: 17? In Matthew, Jesus says that He did not come to abolish the law, but it looks like Paul in Ephesians says the opposite. \r\n8. 56:29 {About Gun Laws, Usage, & Violence} Which bible passages do you think should shape how we think about gun laws, gun violence, gun usage etc? Are there any passages that are misused in this debate?\r\n9. 1:05:50 {Did People Evangelize in the OT?} Why wasn’t evangelism a focus in the Old Covenant? How were Gentiles far away from Israel supposed to learn about Yahweh, and what opportunities for salvation did they have?\r\n10. 1:09:45 {Is “Inner Healing Prayer” Biblical?} Is “inner healing prayer” as a form of trauma relief biblical? This practice involves a prayer leader asking the patient to picture vivid images and hear direct statements from Jesus.\r\n11. 1:13:22 {Are Only Jesus’ Words Authoritative?} Can we only use Jesus' words and not the rest of the Bible? Does Jesus teach against homosexuality? My friend claims that he isn't against it and she doesn't consider Paul's letters authoritative.\r\n12. 1:18:52 {Can I Trust that my Faith is Sincere?} I sincerely believe Jesus is my Savior, but if my sincerity can’t be trusted (just like the rich young ruler’s), how can I truly 100% know that I actually do have a saving faith in Jesus Christ?\r\n13. 1:22:20 {About Eschatology/The Second Coming} In Matthew 4: 42 Jesus warns believers to be ready for a second coming. Does this point to a partial rapture of only those actively practicing their faith, with others having to endure tribulation?\r\n14. 1:25:41 {Is it Wrong to Handle Ungodly Items?} I work in a warehouse handling every item imaginable. How should I handle satanic/\"magic\" items? Should I refuse to handle such things?\r\n15. 1:29:32 {About “Preferred Pronouns”} My niece wants to be male, but she was born female. She gets upset when she's not referred to her as male. I've been just avoiding any conversation at all with her, so as not to compromise. Any advice?\r\n16. 1:34:20 {About Spiritual Death} Can you explain spiritual death as referenced in passages such as Colossians 2: 13, Ephesians 2 and 5: 18, and what part it plays in the process of salvation?\r\n17. 1:37:02 {About Fossils, Evolution, & the Gap Theory} What are your thoughts regarding humanoid fossils which scientists claim are part our human evolution? Are they people from Noah’s time, offspring of angels, or part of the Gap Theory?\r\n18. 1:45:11 {What is the True Mission of the Church?} What is the mission of the Church? I have recently been told that it is worship and not evangelism. Therefore, we cannot worship fully without a diverse local church. I'm a bit confused!\r\n19. 1:50:21 {Examples of Faith-Driven Works} What counts as “works”? Since faith without works is dead, what are some examples of works that a woman can do? Please help!\r\n20. 1:52:27 {What Should Godly Dating Look Like?}",

Just search my name.\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:34 {Are All Pastors Pro-Life?} What is your view on the many progressive \"pastors\" coming out against the overturning of Roe v. Wade?\n2. 19:09 {About God’s Description} God's description in Scripture is often called anthropomorphic. Is it not true though that we are theomorphic instead? Why, therefore, must the imagery of God standing, etc. be metaphorical and not real?\n3. 24:51 {How do the Dead in Christ Rise if they’re in Heaven?} If believers are taken directly to Heaven when they die, then why does 1 Thessalonians 4: 16 say the dead in Christ rise at His return? Doesn't that suggest they are in their graves?\n4. 29:32 {About Near-Death Experiences} What do you think about near-death experiences?\n5. 35:50 {Does our Evangelism Determine Salvation?} Could our failure to share the Gospel actually determine someone’s salvation? Or will God provide the same opportunity somewhere else? I can’t imagine we have control over each other’s salvation?\n6. 40:18 {Why did Some Disciples Doubt?} Why does Matthew record that some disciples doubted the resurrection? Is there some sort of significance to this? How could they doubt if Jesus was right in front of them?\n7. 44:56 {Should Incarcerated Parents be Involved?} My 2-year-old adopted son’s birth mom is in prison for 15 years for using/selling meth. Biblically, should we let her be involved in his life? My wife thinks they should have an active relationship.\n8. 47:59 {Is “Spiritual Attack” Legitimate?} Is \"spiritual attack\" really a thing? Is that biblical? (i.e., during some notable season as a Christian, if we have intensified doubt, hopelessness, illness, etc. why's that not just, y'know, life?)\n9. 55:46 {About OT Prophet Credibility} Why were many of the prophets who wrote books included in the Old Testament if they didn't perform miracles and their prophecies didn't come true until the New Testament? What made them stand out from false prophets?\n10. 58:40 {Why is Abraham our Spiritual Father?} Why is Abraham our spiritual father (Romans 4: 16-25) if people before him also had faith in God: Abel, Enoch, Noah, etc.? Were they not \"counted righteous\" through faith the same way Abraham was?\n11. 1:04:15 {What is a “Clear Conscience” Before God?} I'm getting baptized soon, and one of the questions my church asks is basically, “Do you promise to follow God with a clear conscience?” I deal with a condemning conscience. Would this break the promise?\n12. 1:06:34 {When did the Holy Spirit Come?} My question is about the Spirit. Jesus spoke of the Spirit coming after Him in John 14, but He is there in Luke 1 before Jesus’ birth. When did the Spirit actually come?\n13. 1:13:44 {Does God Need Death to Atone for Sins?} In Isaiah 6, sin is taken away by hot coals. Does God need death to forgive something or atone for sin (i.e. Jesus on the cross)? If so, how was Isaiah forgiven? If not, what’s the point of sacrifices?\n14. 1:20:34 {Minimal Facts vs. Maximal Facts Arguments} Is a minimal facts argument or maximal facts argument better in presenting the truth of the Resurrection of Jesus?\n15. 1:24:25 {About the Samaritans Receiving the Spirit} How were the Samaritans in Acts 8: 14-17 baptized in the name of Jesus, but only received the Holy Spirt when Peter and John came?\n16. 1:30:04 {How to Decide What to Read in Scripture} Do you have any advice for reading the Bible? How do I decide what to read?\n17. 1:30:40 {About the Difference between Heaven & Eden} What is the ontological difference between Heaven and pre-sin Eden? If Heaven is greater than Eden, then doesn’t it follow that Adam & Eve’s sin led to a greater eternity than they would’ve had otherwise?\n18. 1:33:10 {Is Baptism Purely Symbolic?} Is baptism just a symbolic representation of our faith, or does it have a deeper value?\n19. 1:35:43 {About Gene Editing Technology} Suppose that a gene editing technology like CRISPR could change the cells of a zygote to change the sex of the individual. Would there or should there be a secular question as to the eventual sex?\n20. 1:38:01 {How Do We “Work Out Our Salvation?”} What does it mean to \"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling\" in Philippians 2: 12?",

    "title": "Why we think Hell is too much punishment.",
    "description": "We are often trying to evaluate the properness of the punishments we see in our society and even in the Bible. This, I think, is one area where we our intuitions are generally off base. \n\nLet me add some more thoughts for you to consider as you evaluate this idea. Did you know that most prisoners agree that their prison sentences are too harsh? Did you know that criminals are far more likely to have a low view of law enforcement in general? While we can grant that, in some cases, people are unjustly punished by the law we can also recognize that people who break the law are generally more likely to minimize their offense and think that even a just sentence is unjust. But what if we apply this observation to people's intuitions about the justness of Hell? It basically means that those who have moral guilt before God are more likely to think that Hell is unjust than they are to think that their sin deserves such a punishment. It seems to be an constant feature of the human condition that we will justify ourselves and even go so far as to demonize God Himself if He is going to truly bring down justice for our sins. I think it's much more wise to assume that, if I can't see the justness of Hell, then God is wiser than me and I am suffering from a culture of minimizing sin.\n\nThe full answer and context for this video is found HERE - https://youtu.be/RLnvfeCm5WQ?t=1980\n\nEvery Friday I do a live Q&A on my YT channel.

    "title": "Male Headship: Is it REALLY Biblical? Women in Ministry part 8",
    "description": "It's undeniable that the Bible explicitly teaches that a husband is the \"head\" of his wife. While church history has pretty much always believed this means the husband is the primary leader in the marriage and household there has been serious pushback against this view from egalitarian scholars in more recent years. \n\nTime Stamps!! \n0:00 - Intro\n1. 10:33 - Part 1: Medical Claims That \"Head\" Means \"Source\"\n2. 31:47 - Part 2: Bible Context Claims That \"Head\" Doesn't Imply \"Authority\"\n3. 54:20 - Part 3: Church History Argument\n4. 1:01:10 - Part 4: The Battle of Lexicons; does kephale mean authority?\n5. 1:33:33 - Conclusions\n\nTheir basic contention is that \"head\" doesn't mean what you probably think it means when you read it in Scripture as the description of the relationship between husbands and wives. They tend to offer 4 main arguments to support their case.\n1) In the Greek speaking world of New Testament times, general medical opinion was that the heart or liver controlled the body while the head was merely the \"source\" of nutrition. The egalitarians say that we need to factor in this popular medical understanding of \"head\" or we will mistakenly think the husband is the leader of his wife.\n2) Egalitarian scholars say that when you look carefully at Paul's use of the metaphor \"head\" and the specific context of the passages when it is used you come to see that Paul is NOT meaning to imply anything about authority but is speaking of nourishment or source. For instance, they will say that man is the source of woman in the sense that Eve was formed from Adam. Adam was her source. \n3) Surprisingly, some Egalitarians will actually share a quote from Chrysostom to show that one of the church fathers understood perfectly well that this term \"head\" didn't mean to imply authority. Catherine Kroeger, founder of CBE promotes this view and many echo her.\n4) Finally, we get to the biggest one. They will claim that the Greek word translated \"head\" really means \"source\" and not \"authority.\" I've found that egalitarians will repeatedly make very similar claims that ancient lexicons do not support the meaning of \"authority\" and that one very respected lexicon in particular (the LSJ) defends their case. \n\nI'm going to analyze each of these claims to see what the Bible really says about husbands being the head of their wives. This is super important because it doesn't just impact who is in church leadership, it impacts every single marriage in the body of Christ! \n\nAfter years of being a bit confused about the topic of women in ministry I set out to spend months researching the topic in great detail to produce this exhaustive teaching series on the topic. This is part 8.\n\nCLICK HERE for the playlist of ALL the videos in this series (more will be added as I make them). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQSlQLYQsE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC\n\nYou can also find more videos freely available on my website:\nhttps://BibleThinker.org\n\nCLICK HERE for the notes from today's study https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/8-Does-the-Bible-say-men-are-the-heads-of-their-wives.docx\n\nStephen Bedale’s overly influential little paper on kephale from 1954 https://www.jstor.org/stable/23953502\n\nWayne Grudem’s initial survey of over 2000 examples of kephale (he also addresses Bedale’s) https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/tj/kephale_grudem.pdf\n\nPlato’s passage which refute Payne’s use (use this same link to find 44d, where Plato speaks on this again) http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D70a\n\nFrank Freeman’s article on “Galen’s Ideas on Neurological Function” https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09647049409525619\n\nCatherine Kroeger’s article chopping up a quote from Chrysostom.

    "description": "Morality is a really good reason to believe in God. It's such a good reason that some atheists will actually go so far as to deny that objective moral facts are even a thing. In other words, they would have to say that nothing is really wrong and that it's just a preference that we don't like people stealing, torturing, murdering or lying, rather than thinking these things a really wrong. Some atheists or agnostics will actually go so far as to reject moral truth in order to escape the implications that real morality points toward God being real. \n\nThis situation leads to a dilemma. How do you respond to the person who is willing to deny morality? Well, that's a tough one. I think that in some cases they are just pretending to deny morality and one way to help them see it more clearly is to remind them of a time when they or someone they love has been wronged. That's what I did with this cell phone situation. The student did finally say that theft is genuinely wrong. Hopefully, this is one step on a path toward God.\n\nYou can catch the full, unedited answer here - https://youtu.be/AgDZE6ymMKw?t=1611\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

It sounds biblical.\n4. 31:11 {Should Ungodly Behavior Cause Doubt?} If I were to doubt Christianity (I don't), it would be because of a lack of holiness. Christians seem to be jerks at the same rate as the world, or more. Why is this, if we have the Holy Spirit?\n5. 36:40 {God in the Garden} Who was walking in the garden in Genesis 3:8? Was it Jesus, the Father, the Holy Spirit, or all three?\n6. 41:50 {About Anglo/British Israelism} What are your thoughts on Anglo-Israelism or British Israelism? It is the belief that America and the British commonwealth are physical descendants of Israel.\n7. 44:41 {Discerning True vs. False Prophecies} How do you test WOF prophecy when it sounds more like insights/encouragements, not foretelling future events? What SHOULD modern prophecy sound like?\n8. 48:49 {Is Fear of Hell a Valid Motivator?} Would a death bed conversion work if the main driving factor is the fear of Hell rather than choosing to trust God?\n9. 51:58 {Biblical Advice for Parents} What advice can you give to parents in these times to help them raise children who choose to trust and follow Jesus later in life? Can you do a biblical series on parenting?\n10. 55:33 {What Should I Do if I Question My Salvation?} If someone is thinking that they might not be saved, seeing their sinfulness, what should they do? “Not sinning” sort of seems like a Band-Aid on the problem.\n11. 1:00:07 {Singular vs. Plural Pronouns for God?} Why is it improper to refer to God as \"they\" instead of \"He,\" since He is three persons? Example of the problem: \"He spoke to Job out of the storm\" tends to make us think the Father alone is speaking.\n12. 1:03:03 {Can Past Sins Disqualify a Man from Leadership?} If a man’s pre-salvation life is especially disgraceful, could he ever truly be “above reproach” (1 Timothy 3:2)? Could old sin, then, even if confessed, disqualify him from being a pastor or elder?\n13. 1:09:07 {About the Geneva Bible} In your study of Bible translations, have you ever looked at the Geneva Bible that I believe the pilgrims used? What is its textual basis? Do you think Christians should read it?\n14. 1:12:54 {Is there Room in Christianity for Psychedelics?} Given the resurgence of psychedelics for recreation and therapeutic use in Western society, is there room for it in Christianity, or should its use stay separate from spiritual practice?\n15. 1:17:59 {What were the “Horns” on the Altar?} Why did the altar in the Tabernacle have the horns? Could you please clarify this?\n16. 1:20:20 {What does it Mean to “Share in Christ’s Sufferings”?} When we share in Christ’s sufferings, does that refer only to suffering that comes in opposition to doing God’s will, or can it also include something like suffering through a disease or a loss?\n17. 1:24:35 {Is Anyone Presently in Hell?} Is Hell something that is taking place right now, or is that a future reality after the final judgment (Luke 16: 19-31)?\n18. 1:27:19 {Seminary Suggestions and How to Study Well} I’m currently a Junior in high school and plan to go to a seminary after school to become a preacher. How and where do I start studying the Bible to become a true BibleThinker?\n19. 1:30:56 {Are there Multiple “Gods” in Jeremiah?} Why does Jeremiah 46: 25 and Jeremiah 51: 44 make it seem like there are multiple gods? How can God punish a god that doesn’t exist?\n20. 1:35:41 {Should Prayer be a Dialogue or Monologue?} Should prayer be a dialogue or monologue? How should we determine if instances of humans having a dialogue with God in the Bible are to be taken as normative?\n\nThis is the secret location where I store my searchable database of hundreds of videos  https://biblethinker.org/biblethinker-qa-topical-index/\n\nYou can also find me on podcast, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and the dreadful TikTok.

    "description": "Perhaps the biggest issue with oppression is when a society collectively agrees that certain, innocent people just aren't worth protecting. They speak of them in veiled or dehumanizing language (clump of cells, pregnancy, fetus, zygote, potential human, etc.) and they not only allow them to be killed indiscriminately but celebrate it like its a righteous act. They get attention away from the atrocity being committed by focusing on how the killing of these innocents will benefit others. Women will feel better, be wealthier, have better careers, not be straddled with the burdens of motherhood, or benefit in some other way.  They respond to any discussion of the life being killed with a change of subject to the inconvenience or oppression of the woman (supposedly) if she can't kill her own son or daughter. So, to remove any victim status of the unborn we dehumanize them with language and focus on how killing them will benefit others even though these babies don't deserve for their parents and doctors to kill them.\n\nIt's easy to see atrocities in other cultures in history. It's not that easy to recognize it when it's happening in your own city on a daily basis.\n\nYou can watch the unedited version of this video here https://youtu.be/7_tYObxgIj0?t=3114\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "My MAIN challenge to Flat Earth Proponents",
    "description": "There are several links to additional stuff you might be interested in.\n\n1) An article on \"raqia\" or the Hebrew word we often see translated as \"firmament.\" The big debate on this word is whether is implies the sky has a hard, solid dome or if it's just talking about an expansive space. I didn't cover it in today's video because it isn't about the shape of the earth. But, people are interested, so here's an article that Cultish put together on the topic. https://thecultishshow.com/blog/firmament-a-word-no-more\n\n2) Cultish is a very interesting show which covers lots of fringe topics and a variety of groups from Charles Manson's group to Masons to the JW's strange Bible translation to the \"cult of right wing politics.\" Here's them on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzOJll8dItg5NBpAuoXzHqRF4Rh_c5bbM\nHere's their website - https://thecultishshow.com/\nYou can also find them on podcast.\n\n3) BibleThinker mugs can be found here. Read the whole page to see the discount code and shipping info. https://www.zockollpottery.com/product-page/new-bible-thinker-mug\n\nAllow me to react to some of the kinds of comments I expect to get on this video, since they also came in on the Cultish version of this interview which released earlier, and to make a few requests for those inclined to consider them.\n\n1) Mike is biased, untrustworthy, disingenuous and generally bad.\nMy response: That's a lot of bad stuff about me but you haven't touched my reasoning or handled the Bible in context in order to demonstrate your position. Please comment below with Bible verses that, when examined in full context, promote your view. And please don't just post a verse, post your interpretation of it as well so that we can all understand and learn. \n\n2) No flat earth proponents use those verses. Mike isn't dealing with the real Bible verses we use.\nMy response: That's definitely not true. I got these verses from flat earthers, I didn't make them up. However, it's true that many of those who say the Bible supports a flat earth never really get around to offering specific verses that you can examine. They tend to just reference the Bible more vaguely or lean on what someone else says about the Ancient Near East. If you reject these as flat earth Bible verses then you actually agree with me that those who use them (and plenty do) are misinterpreting the Bible for their purposes. However, if you have OTHER verses that support a flat earth then please comment below with Bible verses that, when examined in full context, promote your view. And please don't just post a verse, post your interpretation of it as well so that we can all understand and learn.\n\n3) You should have a flat earth proponent on to talk about this stuff for themselves.\nMy response: No thanks. I don't need to have every single person on my channel who I disagree with. Imagine the apostle Paul inviting Judaizers on tour with him or cowriting Galatians with someone who disagrees with him for, you know, objectivity. That's silly. I can handle views without turning my entire ministry into a debate and interview platform. I read plenty of flat earth literature and looked at plenty of videos from proponents in order to make sure I got Bible verses that were really being used to support that side. This complaint is merely a way of ignoring what I've said and saying I should have done something totally different. I'm not your puppet and this response ignores careful Bible study instead of considering it. I've got books by Rob Skiba and Dean Odle, and have had a private and long conversation with Dean Odle just to better understand his views.\n\n4) Mike sees poetry but forgets that even poetry must have some connection to the thing it is describing. \nMy response: I don't forget that. Let's take the \"bars and doors\" on the coastline poetry for example. I take it that there are \"bars and doors\" in the sense that there are limits but not that there are literal bars and literal doors or anything physical that corresponds to them. It's the effect they have which is the physical correspondence of the poetic symbol not the presence of something physical that very much acts like a bar or door. Flat earth proponents will likely take the exact same interpretation as me at that point. But when we read, in the exact same passage, that the earth has foundations they have a very literal view of it in all aspects. I know you hear me saying that a lot of FE verses are poetry but this isn't a compromise on my part. It's just the case that FE proponents offer up a bunch of Bible verses for their views and they happen to continually pick poetic ones. The flaw is in the FE verse choices, not those who recognize poetry.\n\nSweeping dismissals will not be sufficient in the same way that verses with interpretations supported by the greater context of those verses will be. That's my challenge to you. Give a BIBLE study that supports your view. I don't think it can be done.\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:12 {People we Shouldn’t Pray For?} My father believes that there are people we do not (or should not) pray for. He backs it up with John 17:9, saying that it may even be a sin to pray for people we shouldn’t pray for. I would love to hear your thoughts!\r\n2. 8:22 {Truth in Love when Family is in Sin} My fiancé's sibling is transgender. I'm scared our future children will think it is a good thing and that it’s right. His family accepts this lifestyle unquestionably. I don't want to cut them out of our lives, but I don't know what else to do to protect our family. How can I be obedient to God and still be loving to his sibling and the rest of the family?\r\n3. 12:43 {Spiritual vs. Political Progressivism} Isn't Progressive Christianity simply the outcome of forcing progressive/leftist ideology onto Christianity? Should we even make the distinction between politically & religiously progressive beliefs?\r\n4. 19:04 {Witnessing to a Dying Loved One} My grandpa is dying, and doesn't have long. He has dementia/Alzheimer’s now and has never been a Christian. Is it too late to share the Gospel with him? If not, how do I do it effectively?\r\n5. 23:32 {About House Churches} What do you think of the house church movement (Francis Chan)?\r\n6. 29:04 {About Levirate Marriages} Why did God endorse levirate marriage? Isn’t it wrong to pressure a man to marry someone he doesn’t want to? And since marriage will supposedly end in Heaven, is love not a factor for God?\r\n7. 35:08 {Must Pastors be Married?} Does 1 Timothy 3:2 mean that I must have a wife to be a pastor? What about a man who doesn’t have a wife?\r\n8. 40:56 {Are Illusionists’ Tricks Sinful?} Is there anything wrong with learning sleight of hand magic or using it in evangelism?\r\n9. 46:16 {About Marriage in Heaven} In Matthew 22: 23-29, Jesus rebukes the Sadducees for trying to trap Him, saying they don’t know the Scriptures. Where in the Scriptures is this topic of marriage in Heaven mentioned?\r\n10. 51:03 {About the Census: Luke 2} Is there any extrabiblical evidence for the census in Luke 2? I heard it would be a pretty dumb idea to send people to their place of birth if you later want them to pay taxes from their current home.\r\n11. 57:46 {About Jesus’ Divinity Upon His Death} Was Jesus still fully God when He died? What happened to His divinity between God \"turning His face away\" and the resurrection?\r\n12. 1:01:37 {Navigating Marital Struggles} What should a Christian wife do if her husband doesn't want to work on their marriage, expects her to do almost everything when it comes to responsibilities, and doesn't provide enough for her needs?\r\n13. 1:06:09 {Overcoming Self-Consciousness} Mike how can we be less self-aware  or self-conscious? It stops me from preaching to anybody because my thoughts tell me I'm being disingenuous.\r\n14. 1:09:00 {Ideas for What to Pray About}I have issues praying every day because I feel like I don’t have anything to pray about. What would you suggest, to help with this?\r\n15. 1:10:49 {Is Islam an “Abrahamic Faith” that Saves?} How do I defend the Christian faith with my family when they always bring up Genesis 22: 18, arguing that Islam can also lead to salvation because it's an Abrahamic faith?\r\n16. 1:16:01 {Should I Correct my Christian Boss?} I work for a company that is owned by a professing Christian. He makes inappropriate jokes. I don't know if rebuking or correcting my boss is proper or not. How do I go about this?\r\n17. 1:20:08 {Catholic vs. SDA School for Children?} Would it be better to send my children to a Catholic School or a 7th Day Adventist school? We are looking to take our children out of public schools, and these are the two options available to us.\r\n18. 1:22:28 {Guiding a Wayward Teen} How do I respond to my 17 year old daughter who is persistent in being with her boyfriend who is an unbeliever and has fallen into sexual immorality?\r\n19. 1:25:48 {Can Fathers “Veto” Who their Daughters Marry?} We moved and are visiting a new church. The Pastor is teaching on marriage. He used 2 Corinthians 11:2 (KJV) to say that fathers can “veto” who their daughters marry. Is this a biblical view?\r\n20. 1:29:48 {Was Jesus ever Naughty as a Child?} Maybe a bit of a silly question, but do you think Jesus was an average naughty child or was He perfect as a child, too?\n\nHERE is the video on the senior pastor who said God is pro-choice - https://youtu.be/dI-YaZpniaA\n\nHERE is the link to an article on how \"Progressive Christians\" are more political https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/political-progressive-conservative-christians/\n\nThis is the book by Craig Blomberg on the reliability of the Gospels.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 76)",
    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:24 {The “What is a Woman?” Bandwagon} Do you think that the now famous question \"What is a Woman?\" is a relevant area of focus for biblical Christians? Doesn't the Gospel naturally address these issues we face today?\n2. 18:54 {Helping Friends be Biblical} Most of my friends claim to be Christians, but they support “pride month.” It depresses me that they encourage gay marriage which the Bible clearly says is a sin. How do I talk to them about this?\n3. 25:16 {Friends vs. Servants of Christ?} In John 15: 15, Jesus tells the apostles, “No longer do I call you servants, but friends.” How do we properly approach our position as “friends of Jesus” while not neglecting to still serve Him?\n4. 29:01 {Is John 1 about the Bible?} What does John 1:1-4 say about the importance of the Bible? Should we worship the Bible? Some say they won't read the Bible, but at the same time say they are Christian.\n5. 34:37 {Are there Sins we Really Can’t Help Doing?} How can I reconcile 1 Corinthians 10: 13 after decades of struggling with sloth, bad work ethic, sin at work, etc.? I’m praying for forgiveness, but was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I now see I can’t help it without meds.\n6. 41:26 {Was the Bible Written w/Chapters & Verses?} Since the Bible wasn't written with chapters and verses, how should that impact our reading of the current translations?\n7. 43:40 {Why Don’t the Jews Believe?} What is your understanding as to why the Jews don’t believe in Jesus and are waiting on someone else to come?\n8. 49:59 {About Receiving the Spirit} If we are to believe that you receive the Holy Spirit when you believe, why does there seem to be a separation from believing and receiving in Acts 19:1-2?\n9. 52:12 {Are Cards Inherently Sinful?} Are playing cards wrong? My parents think they are wrong even if I’m not playing Poker or anything like that. They think that there is some kind of evil in the card itself.\n10. 56:40 {Will We Fall into Sin in Heaven?} If Satan was able to disobey and sin against God in Heaven (along with him persuading others to sin), how do we know we will not sin against God when we are home with Him? I’m struggling with this question.\n11. 1:01:07 {Should Christians be Organ Donors?} I am wondering how Christians should think about organ donation? Is there a clear answer in Scripture?\n12. 1:03:43 {Loving God vs. Fearing Punishment} I find that I fear Hell rather than love God. Prayer and Bible reading feel like selfishly avoiding Hell more than devotedly pursuing God. How do I stop my fear from getting in the way of my relationship with God?\n13. 1:08:37 {Marriage in Heaven?} Since Jesus says that wives will be had in Heaven in Matthew 19: 29, why do most Christians say marriage won't exist in Heaven?\n14. 1:13:42 {Mental vs. Spiritual Health Struggles} When I talk to some people about my mental health struggles, they suggest that the cause is a spiritual issue. How do I explain that being a faithful Christian doesn't mean I can't struggle?\n15. 1:17:42 {What is an Apostate?} What is an apostate? Can they come back to God?\n16. 1:19:32 {About Elisha & the Bears} How can we explain 2 Kings 2: 23-24 in context? it involves Elisha and a group of young mockers who then get killed by 2 bears.\n17. 1:26:58 {Should Immoral Things Be Illegal?} Should biblically immoral mean illegal? Surely if sin harms the community, then all legal sin harms society and should be against the law. \n18. 1:29:28 {Fellowshipping as an Introvert} I am worried that being an introvert is keeping me from congregating in the church. Does this mean that I'm truly not saved? Where is the joy that I'm supposed to have in the Lord? Please help.\n19. 1:33:05 {Was Elihu in Job Correct?} In Job 32:7-9, the Lord tells Job’s 3 friends to sacrifice burnt offerings because they haven’t spoken truth, but the Lord didn’t mention Elihu. Does that mean Elihu was correct in his speech?\n20. 1:35:03 {Saved while Believing Heresy?} Can someone be saved without affirming certain correct propositions? If someone holds a believe that is heretical (to believe it would prevent salvation) but they are ignorant, are they saved?\n\nJWs die every year because of what they are taught about blood transfusions.

    "description": "Did you know that there is an egalitarian “silver bullet” Bible verse?\nMany egalitarians (who hold that women can rightly be elders, or any other position in the church) see Galatians 3:28 as such a powerful and wide-sweeping statement that it overrules any interpretation of any other passage in the Bible that would restrict roles of women in any fashion. \n\nIn my own experience, every egalitarian knows about this but many complementarians do not. \n\nIn this video, part 7 of my Women in Ministry series, I’ll be doing a detailed analysis of egalitarian scholar, Cynthia Long Westfall’s case for why Galatians 3:28 is such a pivotal passage for understanding women’s roles and for proving that complementarian views are fundamentally wrong. \n\n“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”\n‭‭Galatians‬ ‭3:28‬\n\nAfter years of being a bit confused about the topic of women in ministry I set out to spend months researching the topic in great detail to produce this exhaustive teaching series on the topic. \n\nCLICK HERE for the playlist of ALL the videos in this series (more will be added as I make them). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQSlQLYQsE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC\n\nYou can also find more videos freely available on my website:\nhttps://BibleThinker.org\n\nResources you may be interested in.\n\nMy notes from today. https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7-The-Egalitarian-Silver-Bullet-Gal-3-28.docx\n\nDiscovering Biblical Equality is the most updated work from a slew of egalitarian scholars. While I thoroughly disagree with it in a somewhat continual manner, it's a good resource for cutting edge egalitarian scholarship.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:14 {Can Christians ever Sue Christians?} Does 1 Corinthians 6 prohibit believers from ever taking other believers to court? Is there ever an appropriate time to take a brother “before unbelievers”? \n2. 20:43 {Working for God Without Selfishness} How can I do work for God to receive a reward but not be seeking to put myself first, such as in Luke 22: 24-30?\n3. 25:50 {Are Secret Churches “Denying God Before Men?”} Do secret churches in countries where Christianity is illegal contradict Matthew 10: 32-33?\n4. 28:50 {Is Rapture Theology Biblical?} Is it true that rapture theology didn't exist before the 19th century and that it’s a relatively modern interpretation?\n5. 33:00 {Anxiety about Hell} I've become anxious about the thought of eternal torment in Hell. If that's the punishment for our sins, wouldn't it have been best for unbelievers never to be born?\n6. 39:30 {Understanding Philippians 4} Philippians 4:8 confuses me because so many true things are none of the other things on the list. A lot of truth is just the opposite. I read books about true things that are not the other things.\n7. 44:03 {Is Eternal Subordinationism Biblical?} I read recently that the idea that God the Son has been eternally submissive to God the Father is heresy (Arianism). Is that true? Was Jesus only temporarily submissive to God the Father while on Earth?\n8. 47:32 {Prayer for a Struggling Marriage} Would you please pray for my wife and I? I know it's a vague request without much detail, but we are struggling in our marriage and prayers are much needed.\n9. 48:53 {Balancing Duties as a Young Leader} I am a full time high school/youth pastor whose role involves a lot of leadership and administrative duties. As a young person, I find it challenging and catch myself trying to overcompensate. Advice?\n10. 51:28 {Breaking the Sin Cycle of Lust} I’m a 15 year old that has struggled with lust for such a long time, and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like I will never get out of this constant sin cycle. Could you please help me?\n11. 54:37 {Dealing with Toxic People} What biblical counsel would you give for dealing with toxic people, especially Christian family members you live with, who are oftentimes mentally and emotionally unhealthy to be around?\n13. 58:18 {Why Would God Give us our Heart’s Desires?} Why would God give us the desires of our hearts (Psalm 37:4) if the heart is deceitful above all things (Jeremiah 17:9)?\n14. 1:04:56 {About OT Sacrifices} In the Old Testament sacrificial system, there seems to be a lot of required sacrifices. How often were those sacrifices required, and who was required to offer them? Was it just the heads of households?\n15. 1:07:24 {Volunteering vs. Getting a Paying Job?} I'm 31, living with my unbelieving parents. They're pushing me to get a real job, but I feel I should continue volunteering to keep a Foundation alive that's barely holding on. Any biblical advice?\n16. 1:11:05 {About the Joy of the Lord} What is the “joy of the Lord,” and how is it our strength?\n17. 1:13:48 {Can we be Refilled with the Spirit?} Is it unbiblical to ask for a \"refilling of the Holy Spirit\"? Don't we already have Him living inside us? I hear this a lot at my church, and I don't know what to think of it.\n18. 1:16:57 {The Descriptions of Jesus in Scripture} After reading Daniel 10 and Revelation 1, I was wondering what the connection is between the descriptions of the visions. The description of Jesus in Revelation is so similar to the description given in Daniel 10.\n19. 1:19:13 {When Israel is Mentioned in Scripture} In the Bible, when Israel is mentioned in the context, is it referring more to the people or to the land (country)? (Ex: Romans 11:26)\n20. 1:22:43 {When Science Cannot Answer} As a new Christian who was raised to follow science first, how can we extract the most knowledge out of the parts of the Old Testament that we cannot fathom/science cannot yet answer?\n\nTo try to get your question in please follow these instructions.\n1) Post your question in the live chat on YT\n2) The best time to post is right when the live stream begins.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 74)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:09 {Is it Helpful to Offer “Thoughts & Prayers”?} Following a tragedy, people will often say, “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who are affected,” which is often followed by angry or mocking non-believer comments such as, “Your prayers clearly aren’t working. Do something that will actually help like changing the laws.” What are some proper, biblical ways to respond to that sort of position?\r\n2. 10:02 {How Creative Can Worship Be in Church?} I would like your views on flag waving (as the Lord is my banner), dancing, and body painting as part of “creative worship” in church. When I questioned these things, Zechariah 1: 20-21 was quoted to me. Since creativity is inspired by God, am I being overly cautious and resisting change which is from God?\r\n3. 18:02 {Can Legalism be Spiritually Abusive?} Our pastor and denomination as a whole requires that any women serving (even volunteers) must only wear skirts, and that only the KJV is God's Word (every other version is a \"perversion\") and requires tithing. Are these things spiritual abuse?\r\n4. 25:25 {Does Scripture talk about Sex Slaves?} What’s your advice on how to approach numbers 31:15-18 (the passage about sex slaves)?\r\n5. 32:58 {Discerning God’s Will and Calling} How do I know if I’m called to preach? My family depends on my income, and I don’t want to unwisely step into anything against God’s will, but I feel I must evangelize much more than I can now.\r\n6. 38:15 {Why is Deborah not Mentioned in Hebrews 11?} I’ve appreciated your Women in Ministry series so much. Regarding Deborah, why do you suppose her name is not mentioned with the other 4 Judges in Hebrews 11: 32, but Barak is mentioned?\r\n7. 40:25 {How to Biblically Choose Who to Date?} How should mental health issues affect dating for Christians (both one's own issues and a spouse candidate's potential issues)? Overall, what things should be considered when choosing to start dating?\r\n8. 43:41 {What are the “Best Spiritual Gifts”?} What do you think Paul is referring to in 1 Corinthians 12: 31 when he says to desire \"the best gifts\"?\r\n9. 48:23 {Are Anti-Abortion Laws Biblical?} Is it biblical to make abortion unavailable to others by law? Or is it better to support organizations like Mom's House who help single moms with having a baby?\r\n10. 52:02 {Did Adam & Eve’s Offspring Commit Incest?} Does Genesis lead us to believe that if every person came from Adam, then there was incest between Adam and Eve's offspring to create mankind?\r\n11. 56:26 {Can we Only Have Belief through the Spirit?} “Only by the Spirit can one believe” … Can this be considered gaslighting unbelievers and a way of compensating for a lack of enough evidence? Please help my pain, I'm struggling.\r\n12. 1:00:58 {Tips for Ministering to Youth at Camp} Youth camp is in two weeks. Suggestions for ministering to teenagers?\r\n13. 1:04:01 {Why does Satan Tempt Believers?} Why does the devil bother to tempt people to sin if they are already saved? What's the gain for him?\r\n14. 1:05:48 {What do we Make “Our Own” In Phil. 3?} In Philippians 3: 12, what is Paul referring to when he says \"...I press on to make it my own\"? Make what his own? Help me. I am really confused.\r\n15. 1:10:04 {Rapture vs. Second Coming?} Do you think the rapture and the second coming could be different events? I have heard some Christians suggest this, explaining how the rapture will come before the tribulation.\r\n16. 1:14:44 {Should We Close Our Eyes & Bow While Praying?} I was wondering, is it biblical to close your eyes and bow your head while you pray, or is that a tradition that has been made up over time?\r\n17. 1:18:27 {Does Infant Salvation Conflict w/Original Sin?} How can we believe in the doctrine of Original Sin and also believe that if a child dies they go to Heaven? Inheriting Original Sin from Adam makes every child that dies unredeemed.\r\n18. 1:21:52 {Should I Confront My Spouse about Sexual Sin} I discovered that my wife watches porn. Any advice on how to approach her about this? I struggle with it, too, and I also hesitate addressing it with her because I think her viewing it puts her in the mood for intimacy with me.\r\n19. 1:23:28 {Vision vs. Imagination} What is the difference between vision and imagination?\r\n20. 1:25:22 {Can We “Cast Lots” to Determine God’s Will?} Can you explain “casting lots”? Since God never explicitly tells us that we can do this to determine His will, would it be unbiblical for us to do so? \n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything.\n\nCLICK HERE for my explanation of my own view of sin nature and how it plays in to infant salvation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezwpmY73iTA&t=712\n\nHere's me on Instagram. https://www.instagram.com/mikewinger/?hl=en\n\nMe on TikTok  https://www.tiktok.com/@mikewinger2?lang=en\n\nBibleThinker.org",

    "description": "After years of being a bit confused about the topic of women in ministry I set out to spend months researching the topic in great detail to produce this exhaustive teaching series on the topic. In today's teaching we will cover several topics that, to be honest, I didn't really think much about as a complementarian. These egalitarian arguments really do challenge some complementarians ideas in a good way.

On one side we have those who think we should never be afraid of God because God loves us and would never punish or chastise us. That's very wrong. On the other side we have people who think that the fear of the Lord is only a kind of terror and they miss out on a rich and historical meaning of the term, where we have true honor and awe of God and recognize His glory, authority, power, and role as judge of all.\n\nFull unedited answer HERE - https://youtu.be/6_WWDooGj1s?t=2411\n\nMy website with tons of free, searchable content. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 73)",
    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:49 {Conviction vs. Condemnation} Can you help me process the difference between “conviction” and “condemnation”? I know it’s right to feel sorry when I sin, but where’s the fine line between that feeling and allowing my guilt to cripple me and make me feel like a failure who is unclean before God?\r\n2. 14:09 {Thoughts about IVF} What are your thoughts about IVF? I’ve been battling infertility for a few years, but I’m concerned about whether IVF is biblically acceptable, especially about discarding the extra embryos. Is it equal to abortion to discard the embryos even if we can't guarantee they will grow if planted in the womb?\r\n3. 18:32 {Did the Father Turn His Face Away?} Did the Father really turn His face away from Jesus on the cross?\r\n4. 24:27 {About the Witness in John 8} In John 8: 13-19, Jesus testifies that the Father is His witness. Given the emphasis on 2 witnesses in the Law, why did He not mention the Holy Spirit in this point? The absence is conspicuous.\r\n5. 31:06 {Are Ministry Raffles & Lotteries Biblical?} What does the Bible say about ministries that raise money using raffles, lotteries, or giveaways? Would you give money to them? They appeal to my (and presumably others’) carnality. Is this sinful?\r\n6. 37:01 {The Trinity: Can We Ever be 100% Certain?} I've been fighting doubts and \"what ifs\" about the Trinity lately, and though I'm confident in the answers I've gotten, I fear I'll never be certain about it again. Any advice?\r\n7. 45:02 {Help Understanding Gossip} I’ve been confused about what type of talk is considered “gossip.” I don’t want to be doing it, but sometimes it’s hard for me to tell if it’s gossip or not. How do I tell what is and isn’t gossip?\r\n8. 49:32 {Are there Differing Accounts of Who Saw Jesus?} How should we explain the differing accounts of people who saw Jesus after He rose? Some verses say women saw Him first, and others say men.\r\n9. 52:04 {Is it Biblical to Spank Children?} Is it biblical for parents to spank their children? Does it model Christian character? Any advice for parents on how to biblically discipline their children, especially young children (around 2 years old)?\r\n10. 57:47 {About the Treasure/Pearl in Matthew 13} Is Matthew 13: 44-46 about us finding salvation in Jesus, OR is it about Jesus giving all for us? Is the treasure/pearl our salvation in Jesus? Or is it our value to Him?\r\n11. 1:02:38 {Wisdom in Applying for Ministry Jobs} I'm pursuing a degree in religion, and considering looking for ministry jobs. Is it right of me to apply for ministry jobs I might not be qualified for and trust the church to make a good decision?\r\n12. 1:04:13 {Clarifying a Confusing Verse} What’s your opinion on Genesis 3: 16? ESV says “contrary to” and other translations say “for.”  It can’t be both, can it? I’m so confused by it.\r\n13. 1:09:39 {Did God Command Balaam & then Become Upset?} Why does God get angry with Balaam in Numbers 22: 20-22 for going when it seems He just told him to go in verse 20?\r\n14. 1:16:01 {About Repentance & Rebuke} Can you talk about Luke 17:3? Should you rebuke someone after they repent?\r\n15. 1:19:23 {Does God Only Speak through Scripture?} Does God still speak to us? I have heard it said that if you want to hear God speak, read your Bible; and if you want to hear Him speak audibly, read the Bible out loud. I believe God does still speak, but I’m conflicted.\r\n16. 1:25:43 {Why is Transgender Surgery Wrong?} If Christian work is restorative: healing the sick, clothing the naked, etc. to create \"foretastes\" of Heaven, then why is transgender surgery wrong? Isn't that also restorative/fixing disorder?\r\n17. 1:31:53 {About Prophecy in Matthew’s Gospel} A Muslim asked: “Why did the Gospel of Matthew ascribe the prophecy in Isaiah 7 to Jesus, when that prophecy described events which didn’t happen within centuries in Jesus’ lifetime?”\r\n18. 1:36:16 {Loving our Enemies when it’s Difficult} How must we love enemies according to the Bible in extreme scenarios, such as loving murderers and rapists? In which way should we love them?\r\n19. 1:38:34 {Should Pastors Preach Using Commentaries?} We just got a new pastor, and he preaches from commentaries in addition to the Bible. Is this something that we should be cautious about? Is there a line where it can become too much?\r\n20. 1:40:17 {Can God be in the Presence of Sin?} If God cannot be in the presence of sin, how do you reconcile an eternal perfect unity within the Trinity with the moment that Jesus “became sin” on the cross?\n\nHere's me on Instagram. https://www.instagram.com/mikewinger/?hl=en\n\nMe on TikTok  https://www.tiktok.com/@mikewinger2?lang=en\n\nCLICK HERE for my video on supposed contradictions about the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uoLYyyqijfU&feature=youtu.be\n\nCLICK HERE to see my thorough playlist of videos defending Penal Substitutionary Atonement. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHttVR0rkvhBfA-IKrg5SGcp\n\nBibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 72)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:25 {Do we Need Religion to have Morals?} How would you respond to this statement?: “You don’t need religion to have morals. If you can’t determine right from wrong, then you lack empathy, not religion.” \n2. 6:19 {Can we be Sure of the Resurrection?} In Acts 25: 20, if Festus and Agrippa can't be sure of the resurrection claim, how can we be sure now?\n3. 12:23 {Comments on Reincarnation/Simpsons’ Prophecies?} Do you have any suggestions to help a believer of reincarnation? Ex: Ryan Hammons has 55 verified statements about having a past life. Also, Bible prophecies mean nothing since The Simpsons have predicted the future many times.\n4. 16:38 {Was I Really Saved in the Past?} Was I ever really saved and had a relationship with Christ if I left heterosexuality and embraced my same sex attraction and married my wife?\n5. 20:46 {Resolving a “Contradiction”} Does Ezekiel 18: 20 contradict the stoning of Achan and his family in Joshua 7: 24-26 (the idea of original sin passed down through Adam) and 2 Samuel 12: 13-15?\n6. 29:59 {Do we “Just Believe” to be Saved?} To be saved, all we need to do is believe? Like how I believed that Santa was real when I was younger? Or is there more to this belief?\n7. 33:19 {How are Miracles Proof if Satan Can Also Do Them?} One of the proofs you've put forward that the Bible is from God is miracles and prophecy. If we see that Satan is also able to do miracles, like Pharaoh's magicians, then why are those things proof it’s from God?\n8. 36:53 {Can an Infinite God relate to Finite Creation?} How can an infinite God relate to a finite creation? Compared to infinity, our world's age is nothing, be it 10,000 years or billions. Same with the size of universe.\n9. 39:44 {Could God Exist but Not be Perfectly Good?} Atheist here. What stops a supernatural but not perfectly good being from being the author of the miracles in the Bible, especially when you already accept the existence of supernatural beings?\n10. 43:57 {Does Creating Time Require Time?} An atheist posited this question: If God created time, doesn't that require time, to create time?\n11. 46:09 {Is a Belief in God an Attempt to Personalize the Impersonal?} An atheist claims: “Belief in God is what happens when social brains try to explain an impersonal universe. Personal explanations for impersonal events fail to deal with logic of uncertainty.” Any help?\n12. 51:38 {How can Jesus be Sinless if “Unclean” at Times?} My professor brought up this question and I need to know your opinion. According to Hebrew Scripture, anything not of God’s perfect eschatological view is sin (human excretion, etc.). So how can we say Jesus is sinless?\n13. 54:46 {Should Mormons Celebrate Christmas and Easter?} As a Mormon, since you'd consider us non-Christian, should we be allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter?\n14. 57:29 {Why Christianity vs. Other Religions?} Why should a person be Christian over another monotheistic religion which claims to be the truth, such as Islam?\n15. 1:01:55 {Why does God Allow Children to have Cancer?} Why does God allow children to get cancer and other terminal illnesses?\n16. 1:08:07 {Why Didn’t God Show Sodom Miracles?} In Matthew 11: 23-24, Jesus says that Sodom would have been saved if they had seen His miracles. Why, then, didn’t God perform miracles so that they would believe? Doesn’t He want everyone to be saved?\n17. 1:14:43 {If God Doesn’t Change, Why do His Rules?} From a non-Christian friend: If God doesn’t change over time, how come He commands Jews not to eat certain foods in the Old Testament, but deems them OK in the New Testament?\n18. 1:17:46 {Can God Give Commands when He Forced us to Exist?} Is it fair for God to demand our everything when we are forced to exist? I know Christ died for us, but it seems unfair to go through such suffering and sacrifice to receive salvation and avoid Hell.\n19. 1:23:05 {Is Evangelism Harmful?} If a conscientious person who never heard the Gospel can still be saved, but a skeptic of the Gospel is damned, doesn't evangelism damn more people than it saves? Wouldn't humanism be our best bet?\n20. 1:25:48 {Can we be Pro-Life and Against Same-Sex Adoption?} How do we respond to people who say “You Christians are so pro-life yet you don’t want gay people to adopt”? What’s the path to answering that question?\n\nNON-CHRISTIAN DAY!\n\nI'm taking questions from non-Christians today. You can ask a question if you are a non-Christian OR if you are a Christian but have a question that a non-Christian would also ask. \n\nTHANK YOU for your patience as we always get more questions than I can possibly answer, but I will do my best.\n\nFREE, searchable content on BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "This will be seen as a personal attack to many. It's really not. I'm trying to explain why it is that some people seem to see zero potential evidence for God and others see evidence for God pretty much everywhere. There's a fundamental divide in how we are thinking about everything we perceive. \n\nWhat should be obvious (but never seems like it is) is that I am not trying to talk about every single skeptic who has ever lived. But this seems to represent enough of the skeptics I've met that it's worth talking about. An interesting experiment can be done to show what I mean. Think of a former skeptic you know. Is it true that at one time they thought there was pretty much zero evidence for God? Is it also true that when they came to believe in God they saw tons of evidence for God all over the place? Yeah, that's what I mean. It's like a switch got flipped on. It's like eyes were opened.\n\nAll this is not to dodge any thoughtful discussions of things like the fine tuning arguments, the contingency arguments, the prophecy arguments, the argument from consciousness, or the many other lines of evidence we can talk about which point to God. But I really do think that for those who see the world around them clearly, the evidence for God is overwhelming.\n\nFULL unedited answer here - https://youtu.be/12fimxto67E?t=1671\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "Were Women Apostles in the New Testament? Women in Ministry part 5",
    "description": "I spent months researching the topic of women in ministry so that I could present you with this exhaustive analysis of everything the Bible says about it.\n\nWas Mary Magdalene \"an apostle to the apostles\" as NT Wright claims?\nWas Junia an apostle, as a consensus of NT scholars believe? \nIf so, what kind of apostle was she and does that mean that women can be elders too?\n\nThe basic view of the egalitarians (who see no role differences for men and women regarding leadership in the church) is that women were in the highest possible realm of leadership in the NT since some of them were apostles. They conclude that this means women can be in any leadership role, including pastor or elder.\n\nThe basic view of the complementarians (who say that the role of elder is preserved for men) is that women were either not apostles at all or that they only were in the sense of being missionaries. Some say this means that in a period of church planting a woman can have a transitory role of authority and teaching over men but that the permanent role of elder is reserved for men. Others say that even though they were missionaries it is reasonable to think that they had different roles than male missionaries in their work.\n\nAs always, we will be going deep.\n\nCLICK HERE for my notes from this study. If you’re looking to check my references, here’s where you will find them.￼ https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-Women-apostles-2.docx\n\nBurer and Wallace's paper from 2001 on why Junia is not an apostle. http://www.dge.filol.csic.es/DGE-I/RBLG-D/ProQuest/Burer%20-%20Wallace%202001.pdf\n\nRichard Bauckham's response is on pages 192-200 (Kindle edition) of Gospel Women: Studies of Named Women in the Gospels.\n\nBurer's 2015 response to critics. He gives a ton more evidence for his position that Junia was well known to the apostles but not one of them.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:33 {How to Respectfully Correct our Husbands} As a Christian wife, what are some principles I can apply in order to respectfully and lovingly offer my husband correction when needed? \r\n2. 10:27 {Can we Trust what Moses Wrote?} Besides simply “the Bible says so” and biblical figures certifying them, how do we trust revelations that what Moses wrote of others’ lives and/or words (all of Genesis) are things those people actually said/happened?\r\n3. 17:23 {Should I Get Re-Baptized?} If I was baptized as a teen and \"messed up\" a bunch, even not going to church as I should, should I get re-baptized after \"coming to my senses\" and trying to live for God again?\r\n4. 21:41 {Responding to Others about Divorce} How do you handle Christians who don’t believe that your divorce was biblical? He was a narcissist/sociopath who convinced them before he died that I was the problem, and my children won’t speak to me.\r\n5. 24:33 {Wisdom for Young Marrieds} Do you have any advice or mistakes to avoid for a young marriage?\r\n6. 31:14 {Struggling with Repeated Sin} There are sins listed in 1 Corinthians 6 that seem to send people to Hell. I struggle often with gluttony and anger. I repent, but I fall back into it often. What’s the difference?\r\n7. 38:41 {How to Interpret Proverbs} Verses in Proverbs often seem like unrelated thoughts. Their vague quality makes it hard to know how to interpret them correctly. How do you determine the context of these verses?\r\n8. 46:10 {Can Christians Work for Secular Businesses?} Should Christians work for businesses that include agendas promoting sin (like Disney)? It has a diverse product but sinful ideas are included. How do we make sure we’re not being unequally yoked in non-marital situations?\r\n9. 50:57 {Should we Command People to be Healed?} Should we command for someone to be healed, or ask God for someone to be healed (Acts 3:6)? Do we have the very same authority of the Apostles to perform miracles (Mark 16: 17-18)?\r\n10. 59:04 {Are the Beatitudes Eschatological?} Can it be said that the Beatitudes are eschatological? I've heard that the word “blessed” can be better translated as “blissful” in them.\r\n11. 1:03:05 {Speaking the Truth in Love – Abortion} How do we discuss abortion in a way that doesn't push people away from the Gospel? Despite being very careful to speak up with gentleness, I'm still getting accused of being hateful, and blocked.\r\n12. 1:05:41 {Bearing with One Another’s Conscience} The Bible says to bear with brethren of weaker faith. If instrumental music is a liberty, shouldn’t we bear with those who believe a cappella is the right way and not use instruments?\r\n13. 1:08:13 {About Pastors Purchasing Sermons} What are your thoughts about pastors purchasing sermons and not acknowledging the original author, basically plagiarizing another pastor? It has been a huge problem at our former church.\r\n14. 1:12:46 {Who Were the Spirits in Prison?} Who are the spirits in prison Jesus preached to in 1 Peter 3: 19?\r\n15. 1:17:26 {Is it Sometimes Biblical to Pray for Death?}  Is there ever a biblical case to pray for someone to die? Didn't Paul pray for the destruction of some peoples’ flesh for the spirit to be saved in the day of judgment?\r\n16. 1:22:32 {About Medical Marijuana Use} I have an incurable sleep disorder that my Doctor has authorized the use of Marijuana for as it is one of the few things that helps. Should I pray for healing or keep taking this drug that I hate?\r\n17. 1:26:13 {God’s Voice or My Own Thoughts?} How do I differentiate between God's voice and my own intrusive thoughts?\r\n18. 1:32:35 {True Believer but No Life Change?} Is it possible to believe in Jesus yet never have a change of life? My father has cheated and lived with his mistress. he said he believed in Jesus, yet he never came back home to live with his family.\r\n19. 1:35:20 {Do Women Always Need a Male Head?} If there is a Christian adult woman whose father has passed away and she does not have a husband, who is she to be accountable to?\r\n20. 1:38:10 {Symbolism Between the Wine & Jesus?} Was Jesus’ miracle of turning water to wine at Cana meant to be a symbol of how Jesus does not use water to wash us, but uses His blood (wine)?\n\nCLICK HERE for my “Evidence for the Bible” series - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnwldgqN8c&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nCLICK HERE for my video on how correct the “name it and claim it” teaching is – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvA5ZWDSdmo&t=794s \n\nCLICK HERE for my very long debate on whether baptism saves - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2TfBVNuuY8 \n\nCLICK HERE for clarity on a bunch of baptism related questions -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOx9Em_4_nI \n\nTHANK YOU for your patience as we always get more questions than I can possibly answer, but I will do my best.\n\nFREE, searchable content on BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "People give up too easily on studying the Bible for real. They hit a wall where they just don't feel like it, where it seems that it isn't immediately rewarding, or where they are bothered by not understanding as quickly as they want, so they quit. \n\nThey might think that people like me, who study the Bible a lot, have it easier.

The question was about how this would impact belief in God.\n\nI know this is a touchy subject for so many people and while I don't hold to abiogenesis or universal common descent (though I'm quite open to various other levels of evolution and genetic change) I think it is healthy to process these questions because of the wrong thinking that has so often said to people, \"If evolution is true then there is no God.\" That is a really silly way of thinking.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 70)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:34 {Why Did Jesus’ Body Still Have Marks?} Why did Jesus' resurrected body still bear the scars and injuries which brought about His death? It is my understanding that our own resurrected bodies will be perfect in every way, not merely those we had just prior to death. I, for one, want all my absent teeth and hair back! Why wasn't Jesus' body also perfect, as ours will be?\n2. 10:28 {Typology in Noah’s Story?} Do you think Noah could be a “type” of Christ? Why or why not?\n3. 13:18 {Learning to Desire our Study Time} How do I develop a craving for solid biblical teaching? I really enjoy your content, but I become bored easily. It’s easy for me to get distracted in my free time.\n4. 16:25 {Is Evolution Contrary to Belief in God?} I've noticed many people don't believe in God because of evolution. Is evolution contrary to God? Could God really have created the earth in 6 literal days? Can God “speed up” the creation process?\n5. 25:26 {Was Adam the First Man?} It seems in Genesis 1, that God creates humanity and blesses them, but then later in Genesis 2, God creates Adam as a representative in Eden. Doesn’t Scripture teach Adam was the first man?\n6. 31:09 {Are Angels Made in the Image of God?} In a previous episode, you stated that angels are not made in the image of God. Is that really something that we can state definitively?\n7. 34:32 {God/Satan in our Dreams?} Does God and/or Satan visit us in dreams?\n8. 39:12 {Was Simon Magus Repentant?} In Acts 8:9, Do you think Simon Magus was aware that he wasn’t right with God before Peter rebuked him? Some commentaries assume that he was never truly repentant, but some say he was genuine.\n9. 43:56 {Can We “Over-Study” the Bible?} Is it possible to over-study Scripture & theology? I feel like I constantly burn myself out on God's Word, but I also feel terrible if I go too long (like a day or two) without studying it.\n10. 46:33 {Where Did Satan’s Rebellion Come From?} Since God is not the author of evil and didn't create a kingdom with temptation or evil beings, how did Lucifer's pride and rebellion come about?\n11. 50:27 {How Intimate Before Marriage is Appropriate?} I think sexual intimacy prior to marriage (i.e., clothed sexual touching/rubbing) is sinful, but my fiancée disagrees. What do I do, as a soon to be husband, when we disagree on what is sinful?\n12. 58:15 {Resolving a “Contradiction”} About generational sin: Exodus 34:7 vs Ezekiel 18: 20…can you please explain how we should understand this apparent contradiction?\n13. 1:03:51 {Is a Continuous Drunkard Saved?} Are you still saved if you can't stop drinking?\n14. 1:07:48 {Does God Control our Free Will?} In Proverbs 21:1 it says, \"The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord. Like the rivers of water He turns it wherever He wishes.\" Does that mean God controls the king's free will?\n15. 1:09:53 {How was Solomon Wise since he Turned Away?} How was Solomon considered to be the wisest man on Earth and yet he, too, turns away from God in his old age? He also doesn't seem to recognize his sinful ways. He doesn't even ask God to relent.\n16. 1:12:01 {Witnessing Opportunity vs. Spiritual Trap!} I met some Muslims who were evangelizing, and I went up to them to challenge their beliefs. They invited me to a Ramadan dinner at a mosque. Should I go, or would that be a spiritual trap?\n17. 1:13:28 {Are Court Weddings Recognized by God?} I watched the whole marriage series and didn’t find anything about this: my wife and I have been married for 8 years (through the court) and she claims God doesn’t acknowledge it. Thoughts?\n18. 1:16:13 {About Jesus’ 40 Days in the Desert} I saw a video where you said “3 days and nights” was a Jewish idiom. Is 40 days in the desert the same, or is the Bible referring to 40 as just a long time that can be tangible (40 days, 40 nights, 40 years, etc.)?\n19. 1:19:09 {Can a True Christian Deny Jesus’ Deity?} If a person believes in the Gospel, that Christ died for our sins and rose from the dead, but they don't believe that Jesus was God (just a \"higher spiritual being\"), are they a Christian?\n20. 1:22:21 {Obeying vs. Honoring Parents} I am a legal adult and I currently still live in my parents’ home. I am looking at moving out in the near future, but my parents believe that young women shouldn’t leave the home until they’re married. Where do you draw the line between personal convictions and the command to honor your parents?\n\nCLICK HERE for my worship song, \"I Believe\" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DDCC711012604F9 (I give permission for people to freely use it for ministry)\n\nCLICK HERE for info about the marriage conference in Arizona - https://womensbiblestudy.com/marriage-questions-conference/\n\nTHANK YOU for your patience as we always get more questions than I can possibly answer, but I will do my best.\n\nFREE, searchable content on BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:47 {About the Parable of the Prodigal Son} Can you please teach us about the Parable of the Prodigal Son, specifically focusing on the obedient son who stays in his father's house and ends up resenting his prodigal brother? It seems like there's no real benefit to being the obedient son in that situation. Am I missing cultural context that would enhance my understanding of this parable?\n2. 13:44 {Did David Not Understand Heaven?} In Psalm 6:5 David asks God to spare his life because \"For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?\" Does David not have a belief or understanding of Heaven at this point in his life?\n3. 17:32 {About “The Last Reformation”} Have you heard of a movement called The Last Reformation, started by Torben Sondergaard in Denmark? Now he’s based in the U.S., but it has grown worldwide. Would you consider it a cult?\n4. 19:09 {About the Devil’s Disguise} The devil, according to 2 Corinthians 11: 14, disguises as angel of light, but can't fight against himself ( Mark 3: 24) or his kingdom won't stand. What if in disguising himself, he condemns himself?\n5. 22:41 {Raising Children with an Unbelieving Spouse} My husband doesn't believe in God and our 6 year old has started to notice and is asking why daddy doesn't believe. How should I approach this in a way that's helpful and honors my husband and God?\n6. 26:16 {Biblical or Unbiblical Use of a Verse?} Many Christians use \"The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away\" from Job (1: 21) to explain difficult things such as the death of a loved one. Is this biblical, or is it a misinterpretation of Job?\n7. 32:19 {Drawing Near to God on Spiritual Holidays} First Easter being saved! Do you have any suggestions for some God honoring ways to spend Good Friday and Holy Saturday? I’m so excited and want to do whatever is in my power to feel especially close to Christ.\n8. 36:40 {Strengthening our Faith When Others are Doubting} I have been doubting lately because I know of so many people deconverting even after finding apologetics. It makes me question my reasoning at times. What are your thoughts on this?\n9. 41:53 {Why Don’t We Have To Obey the Sabbath?} It seems the only commandment of the 10 that we don't still HAVE to follow is the Sabbath. If it was as important as the other 10, why are they all still upheld without exception and not that one?\n10. 44:33 {Handling Local Church Concerns} I’m afraid our church is being unknowingly influenced by progressivism. Ex: People love the podcast “the bible for normal people” with Pete Enns. Should we be worried? How do I share my concerns?\n11. 48:31 {When a Spouse Refuses to Follow Scripture} Can you help a brotha out on what to do if your wife says she will never be a biblical wife for her husband? She is a believer.\n12. 51:33 {Should We Bring Back Crusades?} Do you think that churches should bring back Gospel crusades? As I was saved at one in the 70s. These days, no one wants to preach the Gospel, but rather, do community works.\n13. 56:03 {Was Marriage Different in Biblical Times / Premarital Sex} Some say the biblical prohibition against premarital sex no longer applies since marriage then was so different. How was marriage different then, and how should that impact our view of sex now?\n14. 1:02:09 {Does Scripture Teach Familial Marriage?} 1 Corinthians 7: 36-38 seems like Paul is saying someone can marry their own daughter. The translations usually say fiancée but when I looked at the Greek the word used means virgin daughter.\n15. 1:05:08 {Does John 6 Teach Faith as a Work?} I recently watched your Calvinism series and you didn't address John 6: 28-29 where Jesus calls belief \"work.” I don't think it defeats Romans 3: 27. What do you think?\n16. 1:09:06 {About Freemasonry} Can you explain why Christians shouldn't be affiliated with Freemasonry? I have family members who are Freemasons and believe you can be a Christian AND be a member of a Masonic lodge. YIKES.\n17. 1:11:30 {About Conditional Immortality} What are your thoughts on conditional immortality?\n18. 1:13:47 {What is Biblical “Meekness”?} Do you believe the current oxford definition of meek or meekness is biblically correct? It's being quiet, gentle, and submissive – but I’ve heard it's being powerful under control. I’d Love to hear your thoughts!\n19. 1:18:53 {Was the Manner of Jesus’ Death Significant?} Was there significance in the exact manner Jesus died, or was it just circumstantial because of the culture/location/era in which He lived? Are there other ways Jesus could have been killed? Would the Gospel be unchanged if perhaps Jesus was thrown off a mountain by the Pharisees or thrown in the Colosseum or something?\n20. 1:23:06 {What Parts of God’s Image do Humans Share?} \"Let Us make man in Our image,” in what way(s) are we made in the image of God?\n\nThe video on Calvinism https://youtu.be/oxakEl8BYBE\n\nFREE, searchable content on BibleThinker.org",

For more details please see the unedited answer here - https://youtu.be/zHROjxY3XWE?t=2865\n\nAn example of hypercritical thinking is to judge Christianity by those who don't follow Jesus in their lives.\n\nAn example of shallow thinking is to think that \"purity culture\" treated intimacy in too shallow of a fashion while replacing purity culture with \"consent only\" views that endorse and celebrate all manner of sexual sin and distortion.\n\nAn example of lack of self-awareness is to criticize belief in God based on wimpy presentations of reasons for belief in God and to then hold to \"hopeful agnostic\" without any real evidence to support it.\n\nI know these statements will seem offensive to some. I only mean them as honest evaluations of trends that I've seen. \n\nIf I haven't offended you too much I hope you'll consider checking out my more thorough content on the topic of Progressive Christianity.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 68)",
    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:05 {Advice for a Difficult Marital Situation} My husband has joined a “Christian” cult where women are taught they'll go to Hell if they wear makeup, trousers, jewelry, etc., and I refuse to follow that teaching. He will not listen to the counsel of our pastor. Should I submit to his decision to leave our biblical church and be a part of the cult? He now thinks of me as \"not saved\" and I'm considering leaving the house.\n2. 11:50 {Does Moses Refer to himself as YHWH?} Why does Moses refer to himself as YHWH in Deuteronomy 29:6?\n3. 16:34 {The Beatitudes in Luke vs. Matthew} The beatitudes in Luke 6: 20-21 seem to have a different emphasis than those in Matthew 5 (physical poverty/hunger in Luke vs. spiritual poverty/hunger in Matthew). Much of the discourse in Luke 6 seems to cover similar teaching points as the Sermon on the Mount, so should the beatitudes in Luke be understood as the same as those in Matthew? If they are different, what is the takeaway from Luke's beatitudes?\n4. 22:08 {Were Adam & Eve Cursed?} When reading Genesis 3: 16 (especially in the KJV), I’m under the impression that Adam and Eve were not cursed, but only the Earth. Could you please weigh in on this?\n5. 26:28 {Advice for Entering College & Adulthood} I’m turning 18 this year, and have been a Christian for 2 years now. I’m looking at colleges now because I’m a junior in high school. Any advice for looking at colleges and going into adulthood?\n6. 31:47 {About 1 Cor. 5 & Banning Abortion} Does 1 Corinthians 5: 12-13 mean we shouldn't pass laws to ban abortion for \"outsiders\"?\n7. 38:26 {Can Pagan Traditions be Redeemed?} Are things with proven or supposed Pagan origins (such as wedding rings or birthday candles) to be avoided, according to Scripture? Or are they able to be redeemed?\n8. 43:20 {How Much to Confess Past Sins} I have some past sins that are pretty bad and very shameful. Do I need to confess these sins to my family and friends? I've confessed them to God and a personal pastor.\n9. 46:53 {Encouragement for a Progressive Friend} My friend has always been a strong Christian and is now struggling with same-sex attraction. He has adopted progressive thoughts on the Bible. How can I encourage him otherwise?\n10. 49:35 {Can We Do God’s Will Without Realizing It?} As a kid, my mom taught me to treat others as you would want them to treat you. I remember living by this, but I didn't know it came from Jesus. Does this show us that we can do God's will without realizing it?\n11. 53:26 {Can We Hear the “Still Small Voice” Today?} Pastors have preached about this “still small voice” that approached Elijah when he was distressed in the caves. Is this something we are supposed to be waiting and staying still to listen to today?\n12. 57:50 {How to Be Content While Suffering} God has blessed my life and I know it could be worse, but I'm severely disabled and sometimes I feel so trapped in my body that I want to die, but know that I can't. How do I learn to be content?\n13. 1:04:40 {Understanding Jesus’ Atonement} Is it more accurate to say that Jesus' death was sufficient for all rather than that He paid for all? Otherwise, wouldn't there be people in Hell right now for sins that Jesus already paid for?\n14. 1:10:35 {About YEC & “Mockers”} How do you interpret 2 Peter 3:4 (in context)?I’ve heard Young Earth Creationists compare the mockers to people who say rates like erosion or radioactive decay are unchanging and deny the biblical creation account.\n15. 1:16:58 {How Important is a Church’s Statement of Faith?} How important is a church's statement of faith? If a church has a basic, correct statement but adds and emphasizes serious errors in their services, what would you think they're really about?\n16. 1:19:39 {Settling an Interpretive Disagreement} Can you help settle this? I've heard it said that the word “brothers” in Matt 25: 40 refers only to believing brothers. I believe it refers to anyone in need. How would you interpret this?\n17. 1:25:13 {Should We Separate from Spiritually Unsafe Friends?} My friend of 15 years started practicing witchcraft. I ended our friendship because I felt unsafe. Was I wrong to do that? Can I still be close friends with her? What Scripture can I take to her?\n18. 1:28:12 {About “Carnal Christians”}\n19. 1:30:28 {Ministering to Friends with Mental Struggles} How can I share the Gospel with people who have schizoaffective disorder and severe depression? I know a man who can't comprehend that he has worth and value.\n20. 1:34:03 {Can All Sins Be Forgiven?} What does Matthew 12: 32 mean?\nBONUS Q! 1:36:01 What is the perfect number of cats, and how many cats do you have currently?\n\nWhat is the unforgiveable sin exactly? https://youtu.be/KmCHX8-2Smo\n\nMy series on Penal Substitutionary Atonement https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4bTHScjdEo&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHttVR0rkvhBfA-IKrg5SGcp\n\nMy videos on limited atonement\n1- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAKyQrAO3ps\n2- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shpZMRhr4uM",

    "title": "How Women Could and Couldn’t Lead in the Old Testament: Women in Ministry part 3",
    "description": "I spent months researching the topic of women in ministry so that I could present you with this exhaustive analysis of everything the Bible says about it. Today we are surveying the Old Testament to look for examples of women in positions like leadership.\n\nWe'll see Deborah, an actual \"judge\" of Israel who definitely exercised real authority in ancient Israel with God's approval. How does that impact our view of women's roles? Was Deborah limited in her role in any way? \n\nWe'll look at Miriam and ask if she was a leader like Moses during the time of Exodus.\n\nMany egalitarians claim that there are quite a few women in leadership roles in the Old Testament. Women as civic authorities, royal authorities, prophetesses (and there's no denying that one!). \n\nWhile there are more women in roles that carry some degree of authority than many of us have realized we still need to answer the question of why they were forbidden from being priests in the service of God even though pagan religions had female priests. I'll tackle both sides and try real hard not to go beyond the text of Scripture. \n\nI want to make sure that whatever my understanding of the New Testament teaching on women in ministry is, it's consistent with God's overall revelation and example of how He used women in the Old Testament. \n\nCLICK HERE (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQSlQLYQsE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC&t=0s) for the playlist of ALL the videos in this series (more will be added as I make them).\n\nCLICK HERE for the notes from today’s study. https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-Women-leaders-in-the-Old-Testament.docx\n\nYou can also find more videos freely available on my website:\nhttps://BibleThinker.org\n\nVideo Map for Quick Reference:\r\n0:00 Introduction & Part 1&2 Recap\r\n1. 13:49 Miriam as a Leader of Israel\r\n2. 34:54 Huldah the Prophetess\r\n3. 42:42 Isaiah’s Wife\r\n4. 43:54 Noadiah\r\n5. 47:24 Deborah the Judge\r\n6. 1:11:28 Jezebel\r\n7. 1:14:15 Athaliah\r\n8. 1:16:57 Esther and others\r\n9. 1:25:07 The Isaiah 3 Passage\n10. 1:35:09 Why Weren’t Women Priests?\r\n11. 1:49:57 Conclusions\r\n12. 1:50:58 Coming Up Next in Part 4",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 67)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:35 {How to have More Self Control} You mentioned in a past session the issue of “becoming slaves to our desires” instead of \"just doing the right things we don't feel like doing.\" Whether it’s reading Scripture, doing the housework, eating the right things, etc., I struggle with this daily, and my whole house is a disaster. Please, can you offer some advice on how to target this issue?\n2. 12:27 {Is Marriage Required after Kissing or Sex?} Some say that because my ex-boyfriend and I French kissed, we must marry. We broke up 2 years ago and he didn't answer when I asked to talk. I want to be free to marry someone else, but I'm scared to sin against God. Help. How can I know I am free?\n3. 16:34 {Why Isn’t the Greek OT More Authoritative?} Why isn’t the Greek Old Testament more authoritative? Its manuscripts are older and are referenced in the New Testament. E.g., Jesus mentions Greek version of Isaiah 61 with “blind” in Luke 4: 18.\n4. 20:54 {Is it Unfair that Certain People Receive God’s Forgiveness?} People in my life push against \"saved by faith alone\" asking “How can people like Hitler accept Jesus right before death and then go and sit in Heaven next to Mother Teresa? How do I address that?\n5. 26:47 {About the Elect & The Tribulation} Can you be saved but not elect? I’m confused by Mark 13: 20. Will the elect be taken by the rapture, or will they suffer during the Tribulation?\n6. 30:35 {Is Self-Forgiveness Biblical?} Any thoughts on self-forgiveness? Do you think it’s biblical?\n7. 34:33 {Is Contraception Sinful?} Why do people say there is no biblical basis against contraception when God kills Onan for it (Genesis 38: 8-10)? And the punishment for that is not death according to Deuteronomy 25:7-10.\n8. 41:07 {About Parachurch Ministries / CRU} What do you think of parachurch organizations like Cru? They don't seem biblical to me because they assume the duties of a local church. I would love to know what you think.\n9. 43:35 {About Conviction of Sin} How can someone know if they are truly feeling convicted about something? I am trying to get right with God, and I sometimes feel everything I do is damning. I don’t want to sugarcoat things – I want to be realistic.\n10. 48:41 {Will we See the Father & Jesus in Heaven?} Jesus said that no one has seen the Father except Himself. Do you think when we get to Heaven, that we will be able to see the Father, as well as Jesus?\n11. 50:48 {Did Moses Write in Hebrew or Hieroglyphics?} I am curious about the theory that Moses wrote in Egyptian Hieroglyphics, not Hebrew. Arguing for an oral tradition, not a written text. I had never heard this before, and I'm a little baffled.\n12. 52:47 {Scriptural Support for Continuationism} Is there Scripture that supports being a Continuationist? I am a \"soft-charismatic,\" but personal experience is not convincing to a Cessasionist claiming I'm being unbiblical, or even heretical.\n13. 56:30 {Could a Gentile Become a Jew in the OT?} In the Old Testament, God worked with the Israelites. Could a Gentile become a Jew in the Old Testament and be saved?\n14. 59:52 {Can Christians Marry Non-Christians?} Would you recommend marrying someone of a different religion? Say, Seventh Day Adventist, for example?\n15. 1:02:51 {About the Fall of Satan} How could the devil fall, being perfect (moral excellence), knowing the full comprehension of God? How could he even think evil thoughts?\n16. 1:05:14 {About the “Lying Spirit” in 1 Kings} How do you interpret the lying spirit in 1 kings 22?\n17. 1:12:26 {Theism vs. Biblical Christianity} I’m a theist, but I am not a Christian. What are some attributes of God? And how does Jesus exhibit them in specific situations in the Bible? Could you please pray that God gives me confirmation in my mind of the deity of Jesus? Or at least whether or not Jesus rose from the dead. No matter the evidence, I can’t tell. I want the truth.\n18. 1:16:10 {About the International Christian Church} My wife and I recently left the International Christian Church (ICC). Do you know about this group, and what advice would you give us, moving forward?\n19. 1:18:59 {How to Honor our Leaders} How do we actually honor leaders that we find personally dishonorable? Some find President Trump dishonorable, and some find President Biden dishonorable. What does honoring them actually entail?\n20. 1:24:58 {Why Doesn’t God Reveal Himself to More People?} If Jesus can show Himself to Paul, why can’t He show Himself to everyone?\n\nThis is my playlist on evidence for the resurrection of Jesus https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHtGt3uB070ZiNbi06gII4L_\n\nTo see if you have a question I have answered before go to BibleThinker.org and use the \"clip search\" feature.

    "title": "Was Women's Submission Just a Curse to Be Overturned? Women in Ministry part 2",
    "description": "There are some REALLY important debates about Genesis 1-3 and what they say about God's ideal for men and women and their relationships. Today I'm going DEEP on those issues. Here's a small sample of what we'll get into:\n\nDoes Genesis 1 giving dominion over the Earth to women as well as men mean that egalitarians are right in their contention that no authority differences based on gender should exist?\n\nDoes Genesis 2 have indications that before the fall, Adam had a leadership role in his relationship with Eve? Lots of debate on this issue!\n\nDoes Genesis 3:16, which says the husband will rule over his wife, actually mean that he will have control of her sexual desires? Dr. Linda Belleville argues for this.\n\nCan we say that male leadership in a marriage is only the result of the fall, and we should therefore try to overturn it as much as possible just like we try to overturn other elements of the curse?\n\nWas Adam a sexless being until after Eve was made? Dr. Phyllis Trible thinks so.\n\nDoes Adam show leadership of Eve by giving her a name?\n\nWhy is Adam made before Eve?\n\nWhy does Satan tempt Eve first?\n\nWhy does Adam seem to bear greater responsibility and consequences for the fall?\n\nWas Eve meant to be Adam's \"savior\" and not his \"helper\"?\n\nToday's video will be longer than usual, but I'm going to plow through a ton of content and I think it will give you simple clarity at the end, so don't feel overwhelmed by all the issues and debates.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 66)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference: \n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:24 {Should we Follow our Hearts?} \"Follow your heart\" is a popular mantra, but is not encouraged in some Christian circles. I understand that Jeremiah 17.9 says \"the heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick,\" but Proverbs 4.23 says \"the springs of life\" flow from our hearts. Also, since God's word is written on our hearts (Jeremiah 31.33), shouldn't we follow our hearts?\n2. 15:36 {Will We Have Memories in Heaven?} I recently heard people at my church say that when we get to Heaven our memories will essentially be wiped, and we won’t have any knowledge of our friends/family who are in Hell. Thoughts?\n3. 23:25 {Are Job and Jonah Historical?} My pastor says Job and Jonah are probably not historical events, but more poetic lessons. How do I decide true stories from parables in the Old Testament without questioning everything?\n4. 28:04 {Does Regeneration Precede Faith?} Is it first that you are born again and by that you confess Jesus as Lord and get Salvation, or you confess Jesus as your Lord first, and by that you get born again and will be granted Salvation?\n5. 32:45 {Comparing Paul & Joseph Smith} Compared with Paul, is Joseph Smith such a novelty? E.g., they both had a vision of Jesus only they reported on, introduced new teachings, weren’t prophesied of by Jesus, and were martyred as result of ministry.\n6. 42:53 {About Aggressive Countries/Leaders} Can you please explain what the Bible says we should do about an aggressor like Putin, and should other countries intervene to help Ukraine?\n7. 46:19 {Pastor Mike’s Favorite Attributes of God} What is your personal favorite aspect/quality of each member of the Trinity?\n8. 47:45 {Deconstruction vs. Deconversion} Is deconstruction just another term for deconversion? Why can't we deconstruct deconstructionism?\n9. 52:25 {Does God Sometimes Not Know Things?} Why does God ask, “Who told you that you were naked?” in Genesis 3: 11? Does He not know?\n10. 53:37 {Help for a Tough Marital Situation} What do you do when your spouse, who claims to be a Christian, has separated/said they want a divorce when they don’t have biblical grounds, and the church that married you won’t confront them?\n11. 57:47 {Why did Paul Preach to the Jews?} Why did Paul go to Jerusalem to preach to the Jews in the temple when it seems he knew very clearly he was called to be an apostle to the Gentiles? He chose Jerusalem before he went to Rome.\n12. 1:01:18 {Does God Forgive “Extreme” Sins?} A loved one is struggling with the idea that God would forgive an abuser or a murderer if they started following God after their evil actions. What can I say to help them through this doubt?\n13. 1:04:57 {About Harry Potter & Lord of the Rings} Biblically thinking, are The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter different regarding sorcery? Lots of Christians disapprove of Harry Potter, yet admire LOTR. Is this distinction biblically justified?\n14. 1:09:55 {Should we Desire to Read Scripture Daily?} Shouldn't a truly born-again believer desire to read the Scriptures regularly (even daily)? How should I approach and encourage a \"Christian\" who doesn't?\n15. 1:12:21 {Reformed Theology vs. Calvinism} What’s the difference between “Reformed theology” and Calvinism? It seems like the two are different, but also the same. Just curious to know all the different groups within this body of believers.\n16. 1:14:07 {How to “Carry our Cross”} How should we carry our cross in a practical sense?\n17. 1:17:28 {Reconciling the Accounts of Jesus’ Birth} How can the accounts of Jesus' birth in Matthew and Luke be reconciled when Josephus says that Quirinius didn't become governor until after the banishment of Archelaus?\n18. 1:21:44 {About Gog & Magog} I thought Gog & Magog in Revelation 20:8, and the Gog & Magog war in Ezekiel 28:2 were talking about the same event. I heard a Bible prophecy teacher say it was 2 separate events. Your thoughts?\n19. 1:23:53 {Should we Read from Christian Mystics?} Should the writings of Christian mystics be avoided? My friend wants me to study a Jeanne Guyon book with her.\n20. 1:25:32 {Is the Trinity Clearly Taught in the OT?} Is there a reason why a doctrine as important as the Trinity isn't EXPLICITLY declared in the Old Testament, especially the Torah, seeing as belief in the second person is paramount for salvation?\n\nThis is the ministry I mentioned who provide real, on the ground aid, in the name of Christ, to refugees from ISIS now living in poverty in Jordan. https://www.restoringfaithinc.org/\n\nMy video on \"What about those who never hear the gospel?\" https://youtu.be/IiyxpE5UBz4\n\nMy whole series on divorce and remarriage - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pC6ZikbYo&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHtBvJzugPJp9P5X1T-hA91j",

    "description": "Shorts are pretty short. So there is much more that can and should be said about all this. For instance, I find it very hard to push veganism from a biblical perspective when eating meat is not only permitted but actually commanded on occasion. It's one thing to rightly recognize that God permits things in the Bible that are far from ideal (divorce is an example) but it's another to say that something He explicitly makes the centerpiece of important events, like consuming meat at Passover, is inherently immoral. Again, more can be said about this but I think veganism as a choice is completely up to you but as a rule it seems to conflict with some plain teachings of Scripture. \n\nYou can search my database of over 600 videos for free.

    "title": "Why We Can't Think Biblically About It: Women In Ministry part 1",
    "description": "For years I've refused to answer the question about women in ministry. Because I worried I might be wrong and was fearful of how big of an impact my teaching can have in the life of another. I take that issue very seriously. \n\nI spent the last few months doing an in depth research project on women in ministry. My goal was to read the best egalitarian scholars on the topic and see if I might change my position. To be totally open with you, I actually WANTED to become egalitarian. That may sound strange to some but I'm just being honest about my own motivations. Now that my research is close to done, I'm going to present you with the \"Women in Ministry\" series; a thorough and systematic study of the topic, looking at all relevant biblical passages, historical research, linguistic studies and philosophical concerns, interacting with the most recent scholarship on the issue (and there is a lot of it). This will be a somewhat exhaustive series to go over everything the Bible teaches on the topic and engage in all the important debates you will want to know about. Each video will cover different issues/passages of Scripture and I'll try to present the content in a way that helps you make informed decisions for yourself and not just to parrot me.\n\nBut I'm not interested being one of those people who pretends they don't have their own opinions on the topic. So, after months of focused research, here are my general conclusions; which I will go on to support with great detail over the next 10 videos. I think egalitarian views (which hold there are simply no role differences related to authority between men and women in the government of the church) are obviously false. I mean that I went into this study hoping I'd see really strong and thoughtful cases for egalitarian views from top scholars and I saw, over and over again, insufficient evidence, poor reasoning, inconsistent positions and bad Bible study practices. I don't say ANY of that as a way of slapping at the sincerity or good will of those scholars. I think many of these scholars are strongly committed to Jesus and are my genuine brothers and sisters in Christ. But, as a result of studying this topic in detail, hoping to change my own mind and focusing on the work of egalitarian scholars, I am actually far more confidently complementarian than I was before. \n\nHowever, I have changed my mind on some important issues and would consider my self a \"soft complementarian\" who holds that the biblical role of \"elder\" is reserved for men but that women have been FAR too restricted in other ways because of clumsy and incomplete views of complementarians, and sometimes simply because Christians aren't quite sure where to draw the lines so they are overly cautious and unnecessarily limiting to women (and often to themselves). What I'm saying here is that I agree with many egalitarian complaints about abuses, restrictions and general disrespect toward women that has been too common in complementarian circles. I've seen it first hand many times and I think Scripture offers us needed correction.\n\nSo, I am rather firm in saying egalitarian interpretations are generally flawed but that complementarians have much to refine and even remove from their own views, though the biblical core remains quite sound. I offer the above explanation as I introduce this series simply because I respect your intelligence and want to be as open as possible with you all.\n\nIn today's video I'll walk through the biggest reason why I'm not egalitarian as I discuss philosophical beliefs that egalitarians often bring into the debate which make it impossible for them to be open to following the Bible if it leads toward complementarian views. I'll try to apply this standard fairly on both sides and set a tone for the debate that refuses to use polemics, ethics or philosophy in a way that taints our opinions before we approach the biblical text and ask \"what should I think about this?\"\n\nHere's the playlist for ALL the videos in this series (more added as I make them) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQSlQLYQsE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBtpJlwi7F5JYw3N5pKyLC\n\nYou can also find the videos and my notes freely available on my website. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Ed's 4 hour long church service which this clip came from. The clip I used starts at 30 minutes in. - https://youtu.be/ISDvpdtzomM\n\nYou may think I've picked the worst example of Ed's behavior but I really haven't. Ed can be seen doing all manner of far stranger and more extreme things in other videos. I chose this example to offer an analysis of how to identify this kind of spiritual abuse in an effort to help people caught up in it to do two things. First, to get out from under the control of dangerous leaders. Second, to realize that those bad leaders do not represent true Christianity so that people who've been burned by them won't turn away from Christ, the perfectly humble leader, as a result.\n\nI've got over 600 videos helping you learn to think biblically about everything and I promise not to make up stuff about your family tree.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 65)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n1. 0:00 {Only One Way to Evangelize?} Before Jesus left, He gave us the Great Commission: \"Go spread the Gospel and make Disciples.\" Sounds good, I can do that. But since Jesus didn't tell us exactly how to share the Gospel (He just tells us to do it), can we share the Gospel however we want, or do we have to do it a certain way?\n2. 13:05 {Is Modalism Heresy?} Why is modalism considered such heresy? I think it’s incorrect, but many people question the very salvation of those who hold to this doctrine. How vital to salvation is the correct understanding of the Trinity?\n3. 16:58 {When You’re Far from God} My heart is hardened, I’m backslidden, a carnal Christian…whatever you want to call it. I am so far from God right now. I want to love Him, but I don’t. I’m afraid of Hell. What can I do to heal?\n4. 21:23 {Why Didn’t Jesus Inherit Adam’s Sin?} Since Jesus was fully man, as well as fully God, according to the hypostatic union, how did He not inherit Adam's sin that all men inherit according to Psalm 51:5?\n5. 25:27 {Is the Resurrection Proof of Jesus’ Deity?} What should I say to someone who isn’t impressed with the resurrection of Jesus proving that He is God? I don’t think there is a better miracle explaining who God is and what He does.\n6. 28:17 {Advising Others on Theologically Bad Content} What do you say to Christians who say they have been blessed by the movie “The Shack” and other Progressive content, even though it is filled with New Age themes and Progressive Christianity?\n7. 31:37 {Explaining a Confusing Passage of Scripture} Is the man in Matthew 22: 11-13 thrown out for not doing good works, considering Revelation 19:8?\n8. 36:17 {Transubstantiation, Consubstantiation, & Symbolism} What are your thoughts on the Lutheran view of communion (consubstantiation in contrast to the Catholic transubstantiation)? What would be a good case for an entirely symbolic view?\n9. 44:36 {Exceptions to Marital Submission?} Your 1 Peter 3:1-6 teaching said Abigail's story was the only valid exception for wives not submitting to husbands. Why was “life threatening situations” the lens in which you interpreted her example?\n10. 47:17 {Is a Fear of Sin Biblical?} I find myself feeling paranoid and anxious because I'm scared to fall into sin. I'm no longer in bondage to sin, but I feel like the fear of sin can hold me captive. Is the fear of sin biblical?\n11. 48:59 {Help for Overcoming Pride} I struggle with pride. I hate that. Even with a past as filthy as mine that I’ve been forgiven for, I still catch myself looking at other people sideways. How can I be more loving?\n12. 54:12 {About “Not Boasting of Tomorrow”} In James 4: 13-17, The conclusion (v. 17) seems unrelated to vv. 13-16. I don’t see how it relates specifically to not boasting of tomorrow. Is it just a general statement that could be said after any command?\n13. 57:52 {Tongues: Heavenly or Earthly Language?} When we pray in tongues in private prayer time, is this a heavenly language, or an earthly language?\n14. 1:01:21 {About the Law, Works, & Salvation} I've watched both of your videos on the Old Testament law. I get that we don't need to keep the law, as we are now under grace, so how do I understand 1 Corinthians 6:9 which says adulterers won't inherit the Kingdom?\n15. 1:06:00 {How to Stay Focused during Bible Reading} I am a fast reader & I get distracted a lot. this effects my Bible reading/study time. Any tips or advice?\n16. 1:07:28 {Overcoming a Fear of War} How do I overcome a fear of war, thinking that the Ukrainian-Russian conflict will affect my country, too (I live in Europe)? I know in theory that God is in control, but my heart is still afraid.\n17. 1:11:33 {Discerning God’s Will in our Lives} How do I learn God's will for major life decisions like buying a pet, when and where to move, who I should marry, or if I should even get married? How do I know if it’s from God, or from my own desires?\n18. 1:16:03 {Where was Jesus After the Cross?} In a previous Mark series video, you mentioned that you don't believe Jesus descended into Hell after dying on the cross. If He didn't descend into hell, where did He go and what did He do?\n19. 1:18:40 {Help for a Tough Marital Situation} How does a wife whose husband hates church approach the issue when he convinces the kids (5 & 6 y.o.) that they can just stay home with him? How can I respectfully yet firmly advocate that they should come to church? Help!\n20. 1:19:48 {Having a Right Attitude about Sin} How do I have the appropriate attitude toward the seriousness of sin? I fear I lack it, which is displeasing to the Lord.\n\nHow to understand the OT Law (two video playlist). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoGKJEENngc&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuBirH5Rw3IhJinWrcTufY6\n\nThe video where I talk about sin nature. https://youtu.be/ezwpmY73iTA \n\nDid Jesus go to hell? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU82uoiL_gA\n\nhttps://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:33 {About “Binding and Loosing”} In Matthew 16: 19, what does the Bible mean in terms of \"binding\" and \"loosing,\" and how do we rightly understand and apply that concept today?\r\n2. 25:28 {Giving to Different Ministries} If I don't feel edified by the watered-down milk preaching at my local church, it is wrong to give less money to the local church and more money to online ministries that I spend hours listening to? \r\n3. 28:50 {Should we “Cut Someone Off” in Life?} How do I know if I am doing the right thing by cutting off a very toxic family member?\r\n4. 31:32 {Defending the Trinity} What are your thoughts on the argument against the Trinity that points out the lack of a Trinitarian controversy (like that of Nicaea) in the time of Acts and the writing of the New Testament?\r\n5. 33:36 {About False Prophets} How should we interpret Deuteronomy 13:6-9? Part of chapter is often used on Mormons for Joseph Smith being a false prophet...but if rejecting a false prophet is required, would it follow that this is required, too? This chapter - all or nothing?\r\n6. 38:38 {“Being the Light” in Difficult Situations} As a new believer, I feel I won’t be able to go to my sister-in-law’s house again because they smoke weed at every gathering. How do I find balance between being the light & not being in certain situations?\r\n7. 41:19 {Leading with Confidence, Not Cockiness} I just came into a lead role in a local ministry where many of the other adults are older than I. I want to be confident, but not cocky; Firm, but able to learn. Any tips?\r\n8. 44:52 {About Cult Shunning/Shaming} How can we differentiate the instructions given by Paul in 1 Corinthians 5: 11 & by Jesus in Matthew 18: 15-17 with the shunning/shaming practices of certain cults like Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, etc.?\r\n9. 49:01 {About Jesus’ Suffering} Did Jesus need to have suffered the most pain ever for Him to be worthy to save us? How should we answer the objection that some people have supposedly suffered worse pain, i.e. from torture or the Holocaust?\r\n10. 52:29 {Praying for and Trusting in God’s Will} How should I pray? I prayed for my husband's health, and shortly thereafter, he died suddenly & unexpectedly. Oftentimes, I feel that my will is out of sync with Yahweh's. It hurts.\r\n11. 55:36 {Do Modern Translations Hide Mythology?} Why do modern translations hide so much mythology? Leviathan and Behemoth are animals. Isaiah 34: 14, Lillith is an owl. Psalm 96: 5, Gods are idols and not demons. I fear this leads to materialism.\r\n12. 59:46 {Witnessing Well at Work} I've had some really good conversations with friends at work about being a Christian. What are some good tips for me to continue talking to them without it seeming like I'm pushing it on them?\r\n13. 1:02:26 {Who are the Nicolaitans?} Who are the Nicolaitans that are mentioned in Revelation 2:6?\r\n14. 1:04:43 {Who Recorded Job 1:6?} Job 1:6 states that angels and Satan present themselves before the Lord and they proceed to have a conversation about Job in the ensuing verses. Who was there to witness and record the conversation?\r\n15. 1:08:08 {About Noah’s Ark & Animals} How did the animals get onto Noah's ark?\r\n16. 1:11:03 {The Correct Way to Pray} When I pray, sometimes it feels like I’m so deep in God’s love, but other times it feels like I’m talking to a wall. How can I be sure that I’m praying correctly and not just blabbering mindlessly?\r\n17. 1:13:47 {Women Unclean Twice as Long?} In Leviticus 12, women are unclean and excluded from worship in the temple after giving birth. The time is doubled if the baby is a girl, and that has troubled my wife. Do you know the reason for this?\r\n18. 1:17:22 {About telling “White Lies”} Is there such a thing as telling a \"white lie\" for the benefit of something?\r\n19. 1:21:18 {Can We Focus Too Much on End Times?} As Christians, what should our attitude and mindset be toward end times stuff? I personally know many strong Christians who seem to be almost too focused or too concerned about end times.\r\n20. 1:23:54 {Can we Roll Dice to Hear from God?} In Proverbs 16: 33, the lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord. Does this mean we can roll dice to get answers from God?\n\r\nBonus Q! 1:31:18 Who do you think will win the Super Bowl on Sunday?\n\n6 views of Revelation/end times. https://youtu.be/xmw0uVLunwU\n\nHow to understand the Old Testament law part 1 - https://youtu.be/qoGKJEENngc\n\nHow to understand the Old Testament law part 2 - https://youtu.be/Qdbg5Yj8040\n\nHow correct is Kenneth Copeland https://youtu.be/VvA5ZWDSdmo\n\nAll sin is not the same - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_lAMuX16k\n\nThis is the “Battle for the Next Generation” apologetics conference (Feb 25-26 2022).

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:19 {About the “Serpent Seed” Doctrine} What are your thoughts about the “Serpent Seed Doctrine” which states that the serpent mated with Eve in the Garden of Eden as the first sin, and that the offspring of their union was Cain?\r\n2. 15:00 {Difficult Passages – Trusting in God’s Goodness} How do you respond to 1 Samuel 15:3 that includes in the command \"child & infant\"? It doesn't ruin my trust in God's goodness, but it is hard to understand/explain. Any insight you have is appreciated!\r\n3. 21:56 {About Mars Hill / Pr. Mark Driscoll} What are the lessons we all can learn from Mark Driscoll and the “Rise and Fall of Mars Hill”?\r\n4. 24:49 {Are Dating Apps OK?} Should a Christian use Christian dating apps? I don’t see anything wrong with meeting people through these apps, but when I try to use them, I feel guilty. Does the Bible guide us somehow on this?\r\n5. 28:34 {Intellectual Agreement vs. Faith in Christ} I believe I'm trusting in Jesus' death and resurrection for salvation, but I have OCD and can't control my thoughts. So how do I know if I'm really trusting, or just agreeing with facts intellectually?\r\n6. 31:06 {Reaching Difficult Students for Christ} I'm a high school teacher at a school that’s heavily influenced by culture and broken homes. The students lack respect, and hate following rules. How can I reach these students that appear far from God?\r\n7. 33:38 {About Seraphim, Snakes & Satan} If the word “seraphim” is derived from the same Hebrew root word for snake, it is really a stretch to say that Lucifer (who is a seraphim) in the Garden of Eden could have appeared reptilian?\r\n8. 37:34 {Staying in Fellowship While Working} I just moved to a new city, and I work every Sunday. How do I find a church family if I work every Sunday?\r\n9. 38:33 {Encouragement for New Bible Teachers} I'm a recent MDiv graduate who gets questions from friends and family about the Bible. I do a study and answer them, and they respond with \"that's what I thought.\" Any encouragement to keep trying?\r\n10. 41:57 {Watching Inappropriate Content} Do you think it’s a sin to watch movies or shows that make inappropriate jokes and have some language? Or is it only a sin when we personally make crude jokes and use that language?\r\n11. 45:30 {Refuting a Calvinist Interpretation} I am not a Calvinist, but I am having a very hard time finding a non-Calvinist interpretation of Acts 13: 48.\r\n12. 49:45 {Which OT Teachings are for Us Today?} How are some biblical teachings like hair length considered cultural and specific only to ancient times, when other things apply even today, like homosexuality?\r\n13. 52:49 {Theological Disagreements in Marriage} Should a husband refuse to go to a hyper-Charismatic church that his wife wants to attend, and rather attend his own church that emphasizes the Bible?\r\n14. 54:50 {About being “Unequally Yoked”} What does being “unequally yoked” look like?\r\n15. 57:45 {About the “7 Mountain Mandate”} Could you explain why the “7 Mountain Mandate” is wrong theology? It is so popular and, on the surface, seems like such a good idea.\r\n16. 1:01:25 {Do Salvation Numbers = Biblical Practices?} Should we always see new souls coming to Christ as a sign/indicator that the Lord was with us in a particular event, service, or mission field?\r\n17. 1:04:40 {Attending No Church vs. an Unbiblical Church?} Is it better to attend a church you disagree with in theology, rather than not attending church at all?\r\n18. 1:06:41 {Do Sources of Inspiration Matter?} I want my music to glorify God. When I make music with computer though, I worry a lot about the sources of my inspiration. Any tips or principles to ensure that I’m not being influenced by ungodly sources?\r\n19. 1:09:33 {Should We Have “Home Altars”?} What are the biblical parameters for altars in the home. Are they still biblical?\r\n20. 1:13:09 {Desire to Believe, but Still Doubtful?} I am very eager to have a relationship with Jesus. However, I still have doubts about the truth of Christianity, and I don’t have full certainty. But people believe their mom loves them.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 0:04 {My Fault if Someone’s Not Saved?} I know God is in control, but since prayer and fasting makes a difference, is it my fault if someone is not saved because I didn’t pray or fast enough for them? I feel responsible when I eat or forget to pray.\n2. 9:31 {About the 2 Witnesses / Rapture?} It seems like the 2 witnesses in Zechariah 4 and Revelation 11 are like two peoples instead of individuals, as Romans 11: 17-21 speaks of olive trees/branches being Jews/Gentiles. If so, would the rapture be the \"calling up\" of them?\n3. 17:01 {Does Romans Teach Works for Salvation?} Does Romans 6: 22 preach salvation by works? John Piper claims that this verse suggests that at final salvation, our works coming from sanctification result in eternal life.\n4. 24:30 {Does God Grant People Faith? / Calvinism} How would you interpret the end of Matthew 11 in a non-Calvinist way, since it seems at a quick read to me that God grants people faith?\n5. 29:55 {Thinking Biblically about Trends} There is a trend in many young male Christians where they are wearing earrings, painting nails, fixing eyebrows, and putting on makeup. Help me think biblically about this, as it's a bit shocking.\n6. 35:04 {Advice for being a Godly Man} I just turned 18 today, and for the past few months, I've been struggling with the transition into adulthood. Got any advice for someone trying to become the man God wants them to be?\n7. 39:22 {Does Blindness Cover Sin?} In John 9: 41, Jesus says, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin...\" What does it mean to be \"blind\" in this context? Does this blindness also cover sin?\n8. 45:43 {Discerning Extrabiblical Prophecies} When should extrabiblical prophecy be accepted or rejected? I don’t know how to discern or “test the spirits,” and I don’t want to be overly dismissive, even if the claims seem astonishing.\n9. 51:34 {About Submission in Marriage} If a husband's rule over his wife was a curse of the fall, why is it taught as God-ordained in the New Testament? Aren't husbands and wives called to submit to each other under the New Covenant?\n10. 54:18 {Right and Wrong Public Worship/Prayer} In Matthew 6:5, Jesus says not to pray like people in public who try to get attention. Would that include praying and worshiping in church?\n11. 58:18 {Interpreting the Psalms} In Psalm 2: 12, What does the psalmist mean by this verse in its non-messianic context?\n12. 1:02:23 {Judging & Correcting Non-Believers} Are we supposed to judge those outside of the Church, and do we have any right to control/direct what they do (Romans 1: 32; 1 Corinthians 5: 12)?\n13. 1:06:30 {Theological Differences while Dating} I've just discovered my long-term girlfriend does not believe homosexuality is a sin, and I'm really struggling with anxiety regarding this. Is it wrong to break up over this, and how should I approach this?\n14. 1:09:04 {How Does the HS Guide Us?} I'm a new born-again Christian and I'd like to know, how does the Holy Spirit guide us?\n15. 1:12:34 {Resources for Seniors} Are there any good sources for ministering to seniors you can recommend?\n16. 1:13:07 {Is Sheol/Hades the Same as Hell?} Are the biblical references to Sheol/Hades necessarily Hell? Some Christian traditions have it as the underworld, with Hell only being something after the resurrection.\n17. 1:15:45 {Abortion OK - Babies will Go to Heaven?} What would you say to a vicar who says that abortion isn't the biggest issue or problem for God as the babies will end up in Heaven anyway?\n18. 1:20:58 {Did Jesus Come to Abolish the Law?} Why does Paul say in Ephesians 2: 15 “…by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances…” when Jesus said that He did not come to abolish the law in Matthew 5: 17?\n19. 1:27:14 {Book of Ecclesiastes – Enjoying Life?} When the teacher in Ecclesiastes says to enjoy life, in the context of the book, is it being said like \"Enjoy it 'cause it is a gift from God,\" or \"Enjoy your lot since everything is meaningless”?\n20. 1:29:02 {Could Only God Atone for our Sins?} What role did the divinity of Christ play in His ability to atone for the sins of the world? i.e., could Adam, before the fall, have chosen to die for the sins of all (hypothetically)?\n\nYour questions can get answered live by doing the following. 1- Wait until after the stream begins. 2- Post a clear, concise question in the live chat with a \"Q\" at the beginning. \n\nThis is the “Battle for the Next Generation” apologetics conference I’m speaking at in Palm Springs, CA on February 25-26 of 2022. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/battle-for-the-next-generation-apologetics-conference-feb-25-26-2022-tickets-199484703117 \n\nLINKS to videos related to the Q&A:\nWhat about those who NEVER hear the gospel? https://youtu.be/IiyxpE5UBz4\n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:34 {What does it mean that God IS Love?} What does it mean that God IS love, rather than just saying that He is loving or that He loves us?\r\n2. 9:37 {Is it Wrong to have Vaxxed & Non-Vaxxed Services?} My church has decided to have 2 different services: one for those who have gotten the vaccine, and one for those who have not. I love my pastors, but I disagree with this approach, and I see it as divisive. Is this something I should leave the church over? I wouldn’t think Jesus would ever be for this option.\r\n3. 14:38 {Should we Worship the Holy Spirit?} Why isn't the Holy Spirit mentioned in any of the instances in Revelation when praise is being given to the Father and the lamb if He is to be worshiped as separate? For example: Revelation 5: 13.\r\n4. 19:48 {About Jannes & Jambres} Why does Paul mention Jannes and Jambres in 2 Timothy as being part of the Exodus story when they weren’t? Did he have a different exodus? Is he referring to an extra-biblical book so authoritatively?\r\n5. 26:55 {Is Being Poor a Godly Virtue?} In Luke 16: 19-31 we read the story of Lazarus and the rich man and it seems that the only thing Lazarus did to deserve Paradise was being a sick beggar. Does this story teach virtue in being poor?\r\n6. 35:36 {How to Respond to Friends’ Ungodly Behavior} How should I respond when hanging out with friends who cuss / curse or play foul music celebrating sinful behavior, some of them being believers?\r\n7. 39:12 {About “Twilight” relating to Passover} What does “twilight” mean when the Passover lamb is sacrificed? Is it the start of the 14th, or the end leading into the 15th (first day of unleavened bread)?\r\n8. 40:28 {How to Forgive the Abuse of a Loved One} My disabled daughter w/ MS was abused by her ex (hit, pushed her head through a wall, broke her jaw twice requiring three surgeries, told her he’s going to have her killed, & more). I know I should forgive him, but how?\r\n9. 45:10 {When to Lovingly tell Someone they’re Deceived} If you spend years lovingly bringing scripture to someone in a religion that corrupts it, hoping to open their eyes but fail, is it wrong to finally say directly they've been deceived, and that the religion is a lie?\r\n10. 47:46 {About “Dynamic Omniscience} Could you please explain and give your take on the Open Theist position called \" dynamic omniscience\" and how biblical or unbiblical the position is?\r\n11. 50:18 {Called to be Single? How to Know} How do you know if God has called you to be single?\r\n12. 1:01:39 {Did Jesus Not Know Who Touched Him?} In Luke 8: 45, Jesus asks who touched His garment while in a crowd. Did Jesus really not know who had touched Him, nor that this miracle would take place?\r\n13. 1:06:23 {About Jews & the Great Tribulation} I heard a pastor claim that 2/3 of Jews will die during the Great Tribulation, and the ones who survive will become Christians. Is this what Paul was referring to with “all Israel will be saved”?\r\n14. 1:13:26 {Can Mental Issues Sometimes be Demonic?} Could my Generalized Anxiety Disorder and OCD be a demonic issue rather than a mental health issue? I'm a believer, but I suffer from both of these issues and I feel trapped.\r\n15. 1:17:02 {Was Creation an Incarnation of God?} What do you think of Richard Rohr's claim that \"creation was the first incarnation of God\"?\r\n16. 1:19:51 {About “Boot Camp” Churches} What is your opinion on \"Boot Camp\" Churches such as Elevation and Newspring that say that their church is for unbelievers and is not a permanent space for believers to remain?\r\n17. 1:22:26 {About the Virgin Birth} Is the virgin birth an invention by Matthew to buff up the Gospel narrative? The \"double-fulfillment\" of Isaiah's prophecy sounds like a convenience interpretation. Does the virgin birth matter?\r\n18. 1:25:20 {Overcoming Fear while Witnessing} I am currently attending a public school, and I’m wondering how I am supposed to speak the Word and truth of God when I fear that I will be shut down if I let my true beliefs be heard. Any advice?\r\n19. 1:28:00 {Are Some Worship Songs Selfish?} Is it selfish or unbiblical for us to sing the song “How He Loves”? Sometimes I feel it's selfish that we're singing about ourselves when it's supposed to be a worship song. Shouldn't God get the glory?\r\n20. 1:31:37 {Should we Hate the Devil?} Is it OK to Hate Satan?\n\nThis is the “Battle for the Next Generation” apologetics conference I’m speaking at in Palm Springs, CA on February 25-26 of 2022. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/battle-for-the-next-generation-apologetics-conference-feb-25-26-2022-tickets-199484703117\n\nWhy we don’t understand “fulfilled prophecy” – https://youtu.be/_RTMcCS_r-s\n\n24 ways Jesus fulfilled Passover - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbwylmj26SU \n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "THIS is the education program for teaching kids a biblical worldview that I couldn’t remember! I highly recommend it. https://foundationworldview.com/\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:37 {Tips for Consistent Bible Reading} I’ve been pretty terrible with reading my Bible in past years, and I really want to stay in God’s Word this year (and always). Can you please give me some advice on how to read my Bible consistently? I always start reading plans, fall behind, then just stop reading altogether.\n2. 7:48 {Were OT Sacrifices Purely Symbolic?} Did Levitical sacrifices really do anything beyond point people to Jesus? Hebrews 10:4 and Romans 3: 25 tell us that Jesus' atonement was applied retroactively to Old Testament saints, so were their sacrifices only symbolic?\n3. 12:36 {Do Pastors Have Authority over Believers?} A lot of people in my circle talk about being under the \"covering\" and authority of their pastor and elders. Is this a thing?\n4. 16:31 {Tips for Reading Scripture w/Children} It seems like the more I try and teach my kids the Word (ages 8,12 yrs.) the more they say the Bible is boring and groan every time I want to read with them. I’m getting discouraged. Suggestions?\n5. 19:22 {When to be Re-Baptized} If I lacked repentance at the time of my baptism years ago as a teen, should I be rebaptized now as an adult? This past year I've experienced true, heart-felt repentance and now I just want to obey.\n6. 23:32 {Does the P. of Talents demand Physical Work?} My preacher uses the Parable of Talents to say we must go out to do work for the Lord. I have chronic illness and I don't have energy for stuff outside of my family. Does this mean I waste my talents?\n7. 30:47 {Why Didn’t Adam Stop Eve?} Since Adam was sinless before the fall, why didn't he fulfill his role as a husband when Eve was tempted by the serpent (it seems like he was nearby)?\n8. 37:40 {Legal, but Is It Moral / Biblical?} In bodybuilding, the usage of performance enhancing drugs are not illegal and are used by higher level competitors. As a Christian, would those drugs be considered sinful to utilize as a tool to be competitive in the pro league?\n9. 42:32 {How is the Bible Perfect, Written by Humans?} According to Scripture, all humans are flawed. There are no examples of humans being perfect, apart from Christ. Therefore, how can anyone deem the Bible 100% perfect when its authors were imperfect?\n10. 44:27 {A Prayer Request from Pastor Mike} Today I want to know how we can all pray for YOU and your ministry.\n11. 46:03 {Who are the Watchers in Daniel 4?} Who are the “watchers” of Daniel 4: 17? Do they play an end times role?\n12. 51:23 {Advice for a Transgender Situation} My baby’s kindergarten has hired a transgender person who advocates. If kids ask, they will say that he is a trans. My baby is just 1 yr. old. Is it even safe for her to be with this confused person? Any advice?\n13. 55:52 {Comfort from Scripture after a Breakup} My girlfriend (devout Catholic) and I (devout \"protestant\") broke up recently after dating for a year. We wanted to get married, but we broke up due to our faiths. Where can I read for comfort?\n14. 57:27 {Will we be Judged for our Words or Intentions?} Will God judge us for what we said, or for what we meant by those words?\n15. 59:43 {Understanding the Trinity} How should we understand the \"power dynamic\" within the Trinity specifically as it applies to \"sending\" (filioque clause in mind)? Does the Father have a sort of \"sending\" authority over the Son & the Spirit?\n16. 1:02:33 {About the “Little gods” Theory} Can you explain a biblical view of the \"little gods\" theory (Psalm 82:6 and John 10: 34)?\n17. 1:12:34 {About Jacob’s “Wrestle” with God} Did Jacob really \"wrestle\" with God? Why does Genesis make it sound as though he \"won\" this fight?\n18. 1:15:04 {About the “Tongues of Angels”} 1Corinthians 13:1 refers to \"speaking in the tongues of men and of angels.\" The tongues of men are just different languages, but what are tongues of angels?\n19. 1:19:20 {Why We Should Go to Church} My aunt tells me to go to church because that's when the Holy Spirit \"descends\" and is with us. Is this true? I'm abroad for school and I don't understand the language that well. Should I still go?\n20. 1:22:35 {How to Grow in Christ} What's the best way to get closest to Christ?\n\nTo get a question answered live just wait until after the stream begins, post a question in the live chat starting with the letter \"Q\", make sure it's clear and wait to see if it gets in.\n\nThis is the Friday live stream where I take 20 questions from viewers and do my best to give a biblical answer.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:46 {How to “Take Every Thought Captive”} What does it mean to \"take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ\" in 2 Corinthians 10:5? What are some examples of how we can live this out?\r\n2. 9:04 {Advice for a Difficult Church Situation} My daughter and her father-in-law visited the church I attend. They brought my 3 month old Grandson who was making loud sounds. One of the attendants asked them to leave. Now I have mixed feelings about this church. Should I continue to attend?\r\n3. 11:08 {Can Remarried People Serve in Church?} A divorced lady in my church recently got remarried to someone else. The church is not allowing remarried couples to serve in any area of the church. Is this biblical?\r\n4. 14:03 {Why are there Sacrifices if Jesus is our Sacrifice?} Why are there sacrifices (more specifically, sin offerings) in the millennial temple on Earth (ex. Ezekiel 42: 13)? I don't get it since Jesus was the final and perfect sacrifice.\r\n5. 20:07 {Surrendering to God when it’s Difficult} I'm double-minded and depressed. I want real salvation but have a hard time fully surrendering. Good works and prayer feel like pushing a boulder up a hill. Any advice?\r\n6. 24:14 {What is Love, According to the Bible?} Define love according to the Bible. Is it a feeling? Act? Choice? This is very important to me because it will inform how I view if I was loving or not in situations.\r\n7. J. 30:42 {Does Sanctification Continue in Eternity?} Do you think sanctification is complete upon our death and resurrection, or do we continue to “improve” throughout eternity?\r\n8. 32:57 {How to be Calm & Kind on Social Media} I often find myself being rude on social media. I don’t mean to be, but it just gets the better of me. How do you approach people, consistently, in such a loving manner?\r\n9. 36:12 Angels, Free Will, & Did God Command Satan to Rebel?} How would you react to someone who claims that angels don't have free will, and that by extension, God commanded Satan to rebel? Hoping to address the issue and the heart here, thanks!\r\n10. 39:41 {Biblical Help when Struggling with Infertility} I recently have had intense disappointment and grief in my life re: fertility and am struggling with not knowing God's path for my life. Do you have any biblical help to heal and move forward?\r\n11. 42:26 {Is Luke a “Social Justice Gospel”?} The book of Luke is being described as the \"social justice gospel” in Progressive circles. What do you think about Luke being described as the social justice gospel?\r\n12. 46:00 {About the Vows in Numbers 30} What specific examples of vows or oaths do you think Numbers 30 was referring to?\r\n13. 50:16 {Refuting WMSCOG Theology} I was approached by the Mother God cult in a department store, and they used Galatians 4: 26. How could I bring clarity to this verse for them next time?\r\n14. 56:22 {Should we Choose a Denomination Right Away?} I'm a new convert. I love God. However, since I'm a new convert I haven't \"chosen\" a denomination yet. Must I hurry and choose one? Right now, I'm just happy reading the Bible, believing, and praying.\r\n15. 58:44 {About “Seal” & “Deposit” in 2 Cor.} What is the meaning of the words \"seal\" and \"deposit\" in 2 Corinthians 1: 22?\r\n16. 1:02:18 {Lovingly Calling Out Sin} How do I love and exhort a close family member who knows & believes the Gospel but doesn't seem bothered by some sinful choices (e.g., going to rowdy parties, getting drunk)?\r\n17. 1:06:41 {About Leviathan} What are your thoughts on Leviathan? Do you believe he is an actual creature, or more symbolic? Where is he now?\r\n18. 1:14:48 {What if I Don’t Live near a Bible-based Church?} What do you do when there are only Jehovah’s whiteness, Catholic, and extremely Progressive churches within a day’s drive of where you live?\r\n19. 1:15:33 {What to Do when a Spouse Turns from Faith} What advice do you have for a man who married a Christian but she has turned away from the faith? I struggle with feeling betrayed by her and God, and I worry about raising our newborn in the faith.\r\n20. 1:20:38 {Modesty according to the Bible} What do you believe is the standard of modesty, biblically?\n\nHere’s my long study on divorce and remarriage. https://youtu.be/N2pC6ZikbYo\n\nMy series of videos on the “Mother God Cult” (World Mission Society Church of God). https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvwOzziMOk9ZIHKphdag47d\n\n\nTo get a question answered live just wait until after the stream begins, post a question in the live chat starting with the letter \"Q\", make sure it's clear and wait to see if it gets in.\n\nThis is the Friday live stream where I take 20 questions from viewers and do my best to give a biblical answer.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:45 {Theology Books for Teens/College Age} My 17 yr. old son is into theology. Do you have any theology books you’d recommend for teens/college students that aren’t weighty reads, but offer good, biblical answers to Christian questions? Something that will interest a teenager without getting lost into a huge textbook. \r\n2. 4:24 {Does God Bless in Material Ways?} Does God still bless us in material ways, or was that just for the old covenant and now He solely blesses us in spiritual ways?\r\n3. 9:05 {How Does God Speak to Us?} How does God communicate to us outside of the Bible? Does He speak through mediums like words, numbers, coincidences, etc.?\r\n4. 12:38 {About Separation from Bishops} How is separation from all bishops okay when all “early church fathers” (especially Cyprian & Ignatius) taught that separation from your bishop can call into question your salvation (Cyprian Epistle 26, Ignatius Phil.)?\r\n5. 18:39 {About Revelation/Great Tribulation} Do you have any idea why Revelation 7: 14 in the NLT says these are the ones who died, but other translations say they came out of the Great Tribulation?\r\n6. 21:40 {How to Initiate Gospel Conversations} How do I start conversations about Jesus with strangers/acquaintances?\r\n7. 23:25 {About the Extent of the Atonement} Do the two different stances on the extent of the atonement (unlimited and definite) ultimately represent two different gospels? This is a fear of mine.\r\n8. 27:09 {Does Prayer Have a Required Formula?} I talk to God in my head and pray during the day, but my thoughts drift and sometimes I realize I never said “amen.” I know that He’s listening, but if it’s not formatted like a prayer, does it still count?\r\n9. 29:00 {How to Find Counsel in Scripture} How do I go about searching the Scriptures to help me find a solution or to come to a decision in an area of my life?\r\n10. 32:16 {About being Born of God/of the Spirit} Prior to Pentecost, was anyone “born of God/Spirit” as the Spirit hadn’t been given yet (John 1: 13; 3:1-7; 7: 39)? Can this discredit regeneration preceding faith/total inability?\r\n11. 34:22 {Was Historical Proof of Biblical Events Just Made Up?} I heard that the historians’ consensus for the Patriarchs, the Exodus, and the Conquest of Canaan was that they didn’t happen but were made up later. Any input on this?\r\n12. 36:42 {If we Confess our Doubts, Are We Still Saved?} I was having doubts about the atonement, and I was questioning if I really believed it. I had thoughts about me not believing. Am I still saved if confessed those and do believe now?\r\n13. 43:08 {Was Jesus Rich? & How to Challenge False Claims} Someone told me “Jesus was rich and that was how He was able to feed the 5,000 and their families.” I know that’s wrong, but where do they find these theories and how do I help them see that’s not true?\r\n14. 46:33 {How to Share a Summary of the Gospel} Do you have a simple way to share the Gospel? How can we know what to say to be obedient and share the Gospel effectively without missing any of the essentials?\r\n15. 48:42 {Thinking Biblically about Covid Restrictions} My province has new Covid mandates that my pastor is implementing. Reduced attendance, vaccine passport checks, and masks even while singing. I think this is unbiblical. What can I do?\r\n16. 52:53 {Advice for Finding a Godly Spouse / Our Desires} I’m 23 yrs. old. 6 yrs. ago, my attraction to women just disappeared. This messed with my head a lot, and also, because of physical problems, I can’t approach girls in order to find a wife. Please, can you advise me?\r\n17. 54:29 {Was David’s Son Punished for David’s Sin?} In a past video, it sounded like Mike said David's child dying was \"collateral damage.” How is that not punishment for David's sins?\r\n18. 59:32 {Did God’s Promise Change?} Why did the promise for honoring your parents change from Old Testament (Exodus 20: 12 – “in the land I will give you”) vs. the New Testament (Ephesians 6:2 – “living long on the earth”)?\r\n19. 1:02:10 {Are Different Convictions = Subjective Truth?} How do we protect ourselves from post-modernist thinking such as \"truth is subjective\" when discussing matters of different convictions (ex: Christians disagreeing over matters such as cursing, etc.)?\r\n20. 1:06:02 {About Finding God’s Purpose/Will in our Lives} How do we know God's purpose for our lives, as in a career?\n\nThis is the Friday live stream where I take 20 questions from viewers and do my best to give a biblical answer.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 57)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:10 {Is Hypnosis OK for Christians?} What does the Bible say about hypnosis as a form of medical treatment? I struggle with food addiction and have heard that it can help by reaching the subconscious. However, I want to be super careful not to dip into the supernatural demonic realm that can sometimes happen during yoga sessions when \"channeling your inner-self\" and \"connecting with the universe.\"\r\n2. 9:26 {Was the Temple Ever Cleaned?} Blood was sprinkled around the altar in the Tabernacle and Temple. Did the priests ever clean up all the blood splatter? Or just let it accumulate? I cannot find the answer in Scripture.\r\n3. 11:51 {About the Evidence of the Spirit} In Acts 8, how did they know when the Samaritans had and had not received the Holy Spirit? Pentecostals teach that it must have been tongues. Is there another explanation?\r\n4. 18:36 {What is the Light in Gen. 1?} What is the light in Genesis 1:3? Some say the light is a spiritual force, Jesus, stars, the Big Bang, etc. I know it’s not Jesus, but I’m getting a lot of feedback in a group without any real solid answers.\r\n5. 24:46 {Should We Apologize for Every Past Sin?} Should Christians apologize to everyone from their past? I had so much anxiety, messaging people from high school about every lie or mean comment I could think of, even some things people didn't remember.\r\n6. 30:11 {About Pastors Preaching on Certain Sins} How would you respond to a pastor who says “I don't need to teach that a particular practice is a sin”? What dangers do you think are there if someone doesn't recognize certain sins?\r\n7. 33:46 {Are Works Required? (Sheep & Goats)} Does John 5: 29 or the Parable of Sheep and Goats mean that Jesus taught we need works to be saved? It seems to align with the mid-acts dispensational view.\r\n8. 37:46 {What is a Relationship with God?} What does a relationship with God look like practically?\r\n9. 42:10 {About Limited Atonement} If the extent of Jesus’ death was for all, but the application of His death was only for His sheep, why does Jesus say that He lays down His life for His sheep in John 10: 15 (v. 16 clarifies extent, right?)?\r\n10. 45:56 {About Demons Confessing Jesus’ Identity} Why did demons always announce Jesus' true identity when they were in His presence? Wouldn't they rather lie and claim He was a false prophet or something to deceive others? (Ex: Luke 4: 33-34)\r\n11. 48:04 {Should We Pray Once or Repeatedly?} I’ve heard several teachings about prayer and I’m a bit confused. Are we to pray once, believe we have it, and walk in faith? Or should we pray repeatedly until God gives us an answer?\r\n12. 52:16 {About Boundaries w/Unsaved Friends} I turned away from God 14 yrs. ago, but got saved this summer. My \"best friend\" has since made many bad remarks about me AND God. I only hear from him if HE needs something. Do I cut him off, or show him love?\r\n13. 54:55 {Should we Use the Word “Christian”?} The original definers of the word “Christian” were the enemies of Jesus’ followers. What authorizes us today to define who is/isn’t a Christian? Especially if we don’t know what their OG criteria was?\r\n14. 58:08 {About Ephraim / Israel} Often when I see Ephraim mentioned, it looks to me like God is referring to all of Israel. Have I misunderstood something? Why does He use this tribe? My reading today: Jeremiah 31:6 (?), 18, & 20.\r\n15. 1:01:01 {About YT Ads} As a fellow YouTuber, do you get concerned about the ads your viewers see on your videos?\r\n16. 1:03:37 {About Lifting Hands in Worship & Others Watching Us} I have trouble lifting my hands during worship songs, though commanded in Psalms. I can’t get over the mental block that I’m trying to look good to people around me. Do I have a weak conscience, or am I disobeying Scripture?\r\n17. 1:06:23 {Thoughts on Veganism} What are your thoughts on Veganism?\r\n18. 1:09:04 {Can We Trust the Lord Through Unanswered Prayer?} Jesus promises to give us what we ask in His name/His will, if we believe it. He also says to “let your yes be yes and your no be no.” Can we really say that God keeps His promises when this doesn't always happen?\r\n19. 1:12:20 {Biblical Counsel for Self-Harming Habits} I’ve been struggling for years with self-harm and am looking for biblical advice. I'm Baptist and believe we go through hard times, but I am just looking for advice!\r\n20. 1:19:55 {Is it Unreasonable to Say God had No Beginning?} If we say that it’s unreasonable to say that the universe had no beginning, why is it not also unreasonable to say that God had no beginning?\n\nMy video on prayer and why we don’t always believe we will receive. https://youtu.be/VvA5ZWDSdmo\n\nLimited atonement. https://youtu.be/shpZMRhr4uM\n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "My Response to Roman Catholic Apologist Trent Horn's Rebuttal of Me",
    "description": "Trent Horn has over 8 hours of video content \"refuting\" me. Today, I'm going to respond to some of that content. Because there is FAR too much to do a thorough response to, I will be reacting to one of his recent videos point by point. Here's Trent's video. https://youtu.be/4OTf-rR6O_o\n\nThis can be a bit awkward for me, to be honest, because I don't want to spend time \"defending myself\" but I don't intend for this to be that. The issues we are discussing here are really important and I think that Trent Horn's videos are doing more to sow confusion than they are to offer any kind of proper refutation to the things I have said (and still hold) regarding Roman Catholic claims. I hope you will consider this response thoughtfully and, if you are a Roman Catholic, know that I do not do this with any personal animus toward you at all! What I think we should all agree on is that if the pope is who the Roman Catholic church says he is then we all need to submit to him but if he is not then an open opposition to such claims is only an expression of loyalty to God. If Roman Catholicism is true in it's claims to have authority over all believers then we need to all submit. If it is false, and if it is propagating various doctrines of man, then it is only a kindness to tell others about it. This issue is worth discussing, for love of God and love of man.\n\nMy teaching on James 2 and a Catholic vs a Protestant view. https://youtu.be/eDNPHuCsEms\n\nMy long debate on baptism and whether it saves (with time stamps). https://youtu.be/x2TfBVNuuY8\n\nFor those interested in more details on Romans 2 and the verses Trent Horn used to say we work for justification, here is a verse by verse study I did on it 4 years ago. https://youtu.be/LdqppMFcAkI\n\nDepending on the response to this video I may make another dealing with the rest of Trent Horn's \"rebuttal\" because there are some very serious problems with what he has said. But because this video is already going to be really long, I have chosen to focus on the first half of his video which deals primarily with justification.\n\nI'm Mike Winger and my website, with all free content, is https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:16 {Was the Flood Overkill?} In Genesis, God destroys the world saying that the world has become unholy, but He saves Noah. Why couldn't He just do something bad to the people instead of doing all of the work to start over after the flood?\n2. 5:46 {Will Unbelievers Bow?} Does “every knee shall bow” refer to each person when they die and stand before God, or mankind collectively at the return of Jesus? If it's the latter, does this mean unbelievers will be forced to do this?\n3. 10:35 {Is it Sin, or Am I Legalistic?} A pastor told me it was a sin to watch Star Wars & Dragon Ball Z & listen to rock music because they're Pagan. I'm willing to give these up if they are, but how do I know if it's a sin or legalism?\n4. 16:35 {About Pastor Nathan Finochio} What do you know about Nathan Finochio? My daughter was invited to a youth event where he is the main preacher, but I'm not sure if I should let her attend.\n5. 17:44 {About Judgment, Sinners, & New Jerusalem} After the Great White Throne judgment and the Second Death (Revelation 21: 10), where do the sinners come from that are kept outside the New Jerusalem (Revelation 22: 15)?\n6. 21:53 {Taking Communion Unworthily} In 1 Corinthians 11: 30 when Paul says you can get weak, sick, or die if taking the last supper in an unworthy manner, what specific sins are punishable by death?\n7. 28:42 {About Tongues & God’s Will} If the Holy Spirit gives tongues, how is it that anyone uses it against the will of God, if the Spirit only does what the Father wills? (For example, misusing it in church services.)\n8. 30:50 {Anxiety about Repenting of Every Sin} How can I deal with the urge to ask for forgiveness for nearly every intrusive thought, feeling, and temptation? If I'm asking out of anxiety, am I asking in vain? I don't want to treat sin lightly.\n9. 33:33 {When a Spouse is Unrepentant} How should we approach a situation where one spouse is doing something potentially harmful to the health of the family, yet won't quit? Ex: vaping inside of the home.\n10. 37:17 {Do Paul & God Keep Secrets?} Regarding Paul's vision of Heaven in 2 Corinthians 12, Why can't Paul tell us what he saw? Did he see something bad? Why do Paul and God have to be secretive and hide things?\n11. 43:09 {Does Scripture Value Children?} In the book of Job, his children were killed as part of his trials. At the end, he was blessed with more children. This has always bothered me. Why does it appear that children are disposable like that?\n12. 45:57 {Is “Accepting Jesus” Man-Centered Soteriology?} Is it man-centered thinking to say that “Jesus died for everyone but it is only applied to you if/when you accept it”? Are we the ones who give the cross its power? I’d Like to hear your thoughts on this.\n13. 48:23 {Coming Back to the Lord after Doubting} I wanted to ask if you have any biblical guidance on coming back to your Christ-like identity when you've fallen into doubt.\n14. 53:25 {Can People be Tricked into Hell?} Can people be tricked into Hell, such as people born into false religions or North Korea? If so, how is that fair?\n15. 56:33 {About Praying for the Sick} How should James 5: 13-16 be interpreted in the light of praying for the sick to be healed, especially in church? I’ve seen people praying for others expecting them to be healed immediately.\n16. 1:00:25 {About the Trinity / Divine Simplicity} Isn't it problematic to affirm the Trinity while rejecting the metaphysical hermeneutic that was used to articulate/defend the doctrine (e.g., divine simplicity) in the early centuries?\n17. 1:02:40 {Should We Correct Non-Believers’ Sins?} What is the Christian’s role in bringing up non-believers’ specific sins? Should we, at all? I hear people reference John 16:8. How should we best evangelize to non-believers?\n18. 1:06:31 {About Jews, Prophecy, & Baptism} Did the Jews (ex. Nicodemus) understand the prophecies of a future cleansing as involving literal water (ex. Ezekiel 36: 25-27)? A colleague thinks so (she believes baptism is necessary for salvation).\n19. 1:10:36 {Going Through a Breakup Biblically} What advice would you give for getting over a break up biblically?\n20. 1:13:22 {Do OT Prophecies Mention Jesus by Name?} Old Testament Prophecies foretold Jesus coming as Messiah, but do any of those prophecies actually name Jesus? Are they being attributed to Him without proof? How do we know any prophecy applies to Him?\n\nI mentioned this study where I deal with healing and why we shouldn’t always expect it. Analyzing the best name-it-and-claim-it Bible verse. https://youtu.be/VvA5ZWDSdmo\n\nMy Evidence for the Bible series - lots of fulfilled prophecy stuff here! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 55)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:45 {About Church Discipline} Can you please explain what the Bible says about local churches having a process of “church discipline” and how that should be carried out? Should it be rare, or a regular part of church life? Where should leaders draw the line when deciding if someone made a minor mistake vs. someone needing discipline?\r\n2. 13:02 {Is Baptism Required?} Why does the Bible sound like baptism is required for salvation in some places (eg. Mark 16: 16)? Does Acts 1:5 answer what KIND of baptism IS required (Holy Spirit baptism)? And what did Jesus mean by “to fulfill righteousness”?\r\n3. 18:31 {About Tithing & “Prosperity” Teachings} My church says a declaration before tithing. Part of it is: \"I am believing Him for advancements, God-ideas, blessings & increases, financial freedom, & breakthroughs.\" Is this a prosperity church red flag?\r\n4. 22:00 {Are Murder Mysteries Appropriate for Believers?} I watched your video on Halloween, and I’m wondering what your thoughts are on murder mystery dinner parties (and for that matter, murder mysteries in general). Is it wrong to be entertained by them?\r\n5. 25:17 {Why does Pastor Mike Love Jesus?} I would love to know, why do you love Jesus?\r\n6. 26:52 {About Doubt, Truth, & Bias} My friend is doubting his faith and reality because he claims there's no way to discern truth objectively without some sort of bias. How would you answer him?\r\n7. 31:06 {Can Sons be Punished for Parents’ Sins?} Don't questions like 2 Kings 5: 27, 2 Kings 9:8, and Exodus 12: 29 contradict Ezekiel 18: 20 which says that sons cannot be punished for the sins of their fathers?\r\n8. 34:44 {Should We Ever Hate People?} Should we hate the evil doer (e.g., those who promote or perform abortion) or should we just keep their salvation in mind? Or can we do both at the same time?\r\n9. 38:19 {Can the Deceased Send us Signs?} How do you explain to someone that their dead loved one is not sending signs to them, no matter how convincing those signs are?\r\n10. 40:43 {About Questionable Worship Lyrics} I play guitar at my church. I don’t always agree with the theology couched in some songs. I don’t sing lines I don’t agree with, but I am still on stage. Would love to hear your general thoughts on this!\r\n11. 43:02 {How to Repent When We’re Not “Feeling” It} How do I repent unto salvation (repent and be saved) when I do not want to? I am asking from the current place of being unsaved.\r\n12. 45:04 {About the Fear of Eternity} A student recently shared a fear of hers: the idea of eternity, even if in Heaven. I have to admit I struggle with this, as well. Any advice for me, for how I can comfort her from the Bible?\r\n13. 49:45 {About our Music Choices} Is it OK to listen to old music from former Christians, like Kevin Max or Ray Boltz? Is their music prior to them leaving Christ OK to listen to?\r\n14. 52:36 {About Adam & Eve / Sin Nature} Were Adam and Eve created WITH a sin nature at their creation? If not, why then did they choose to sin in the first place, all the while God having called His creation good?\r\n15. 54:44 {About God being our Loving Father} I've been a believer for a very long time, but still struggle with the concept of God as loving Father. Mainly due to my upbringing. How do I overcome this? The doubt is overwhelming.\r\n16. 57:50 {Clashing Translations?} In 1 Corinthians 7, whom do verses 36-38 address? Some versions add \"daughter,\" implying fathers, but ESV, in using \"his betrothed\" and \"his passions\" seem to indicate a groom.\r\n17. 1:01:44 {How to Witness to an Angry Person} My friend has left Christianity. His family is a bit extreme and aggressive with their faith, and he says they are what pushed him away from his. If I try to talk with him, he gets angry. What can I do?\r\n18. 1:04:31 {How to Tell if a Sermon is Biblical} How does one recognize if a message is biblically accurate? Oftentimes a message is given with Scripture to back it up. How do you gauge the truthfulness of the message?\r\n19. 1:06:37 {Wrestling with Matters of Conscience} I’m a family photographer being asked to do sessions involving a same-sex couple with kids. I've done sessions for cohabitating pregnant couples before, but how can I handle this as a Christian?\r\n20. 1:09:46 {Balancing Work & Family in Life} My job has been taking away too much family time (extreme employee shortage), but I've been there many years and feel the relationships are still a mission field. How can I balance this?\n\nHere's a link to my video on Joel Osteen. I had to make radical changes to it because he kept copyright striking it. https://youtu.be/hHtQSQYPjzg \n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:36 {Should we “Apply” the Blood of Jesus?} Someone recently told me to always \"apply the blood of Jesus\" over my family, my home, myself, and everything that belongs to me before I pray, since there is spiritual warfare going on. Have you heard of this, and what are your thoughts?\r\n2. 5:44 {About the Curse in 2 Kings} How should we explain 2 Kings 2: 23-25? I had somebody bring it up to me and was unsure of how to answer them. On the surface, it seems problematic. What can I say to them?\r\n3. 11:10 {A Godly Attitude for Workplace Struggles} My parents think Christians shouldn’t unionize or strike, and should just do what they’re told or go elsewhere, citing the Parable of the Vineyard. But that sounds crazy to me. What should a Christian attitude be to workplace struggles?\r\n4. 15:46 {About “Leaven,” Destruction, & Revelation} Any thoughts on using Matthew 13: 33 to prove that people inside the faithful church will try to destroy it (saying that yeast is bad and the woman Jesus referred to is the same as in Revelation)?\r\n5. 18:52 {About Being Alive in Christ/Future Resurrection} Please explain John 11: 25-26, how the first person became dead but believed and the second person being a believer never dies.\r\n6. 23:05 {Thoughts about Steven Crowder} What is your opinion on Christian YouTuber Steven Crowder? A lot of his content (while in the name of comedy and free speech) is quite vulgar and feels insensitive. Is his method biblical?\r\n7. {Accidentally skipped - sorry about that!}\r\n8. 24:42 {Why did People Fall Over in John 18?} My question is about John 18:6. It’s a really powerful moment, but did the other disciples not see it?\r\n9. 30:36 {Repentance of the Heart & Mind} I am a former crossdresser (not transgender), but I don't feel any guilt or remorse for when I used to cross-dress. Any advice on how to not just repent with my actions, but also repent with my mind/heart?\r\n10. 35:08 {Is Marriage Different Now?} My friend says the definition of marriage evolved over time, and that now it’s a legal contract, but in biblical times she claims it was a social transfer of care. Thus, she believes living with her boyfriend unmarried is biblical. Thoughts?\r\n11. 39:29 {About Sin and our Flesh} Does Romans 7: 24 suggest that sin is in our flesh? Is this the reason why some people may be predisposed to certain sinful behaviors?\r\n12. 43:29 {Is Jesus Finite or Infinite?} Jesus said, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end\" (Revelation 22: 13 ESV). Does this mean God the Son is finite? Is He saying Jesus, fully man, is finite?\r\n13. 46:19 {Why does God Allow More Wicked Generations?} Why does God allow wicked people to persist and bring forth more generations that will mostly go to Hell, instead of bringing judgment on them and erasing their culture as soon as they go astray?\r\n14. 51:00 {Help with Doubts & Unbelief} How do you stop doubting that God exists or that Christianity is the true religion out of many, especially Islam? Sometimes my faith wanders from belief to unbelief. Any tips?\r\n15. 54:44 {Why was Jesus Given Sedatives?} Why would the Roman soldiers try to give Jesus the wine and myrrh (which I understand to be a sedative)? Wouldn’t they want the crucifixion to be as painful as possible?\r\n16. 55:32 {Are Prayers from Books Spells?} Could prayers from prayer books be considered spells?\r\n17. 57:04 {Should a Protestant Marry a Catholic?} What do I do if I'm thinking about marrying a Catholic girl, myself being Protestant? She has no problems with my faith but wants our sons baptized, since she and her whole family is Catholic.\r\n18. 59:43 {About Theophanies & Christophanies} Would you say that every theophany is a Christophany? (John 1: 17-18, Jude 1:5, John 8: 58, Matthew 11: 27, 1 Timothy 2:5)\r\n19. 1:01:36 {How to Increase Our Affection for God} 1 Corinthians 16: 22 implies we can't be saved if we don't love God, as I don't know how you can be saved and cursed at the same time. What advice would you give to someone who lacks affection for God?\r\n20. 1:06:02 {Was it Right for Rahab to Lie?} Hebrews 11: 31 says that Rahab's faith saved her. Yet Joshua 2:4-6 shows Rahab lying about the Israelite spies. Romans 3:7-8 condemns good from evil. How do we reconcile this, Pastor Mike?\n\nHere's my playlist on \"How to Find Jesus in the Old Testament\". It is honestly my favorite series of anything I've ever done.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 53)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction \n1. 0:30 {Should We Ask God to Change Us?} You taught once in a past video that when we pray, we should NOT ask God to change us, as that would be like asking or expecting God to do all of the work. Can you please elaborate on that, and how to rightly pray instead?\n2. 7:49 {About Forgiveness of Unconfessed Sin} Are you forgiven or held accountable for the sins you’re not aware of and don’t repent of? For example: gluttony, laziness, or even getting mad at someone and later forgetting about it.\n3. 10:37 {Why is Suicide a Sin?} Why do Christians see suicide as a sin if it’s never condemned in the Bible? Why should I be forced to live a pathetic life I never asked for?\n4. 15:55 {About “Feeling” God’s Presence} I always hear Christians say they “felt the presence of God.” How can I feel His presence? I read His Word as much as I can and pray often, but have never “felt” His presence.\n5. 20:11 {About Astronomical Alignment} Do you think the astronomical alignment on Sept 23rd, 2017 is a fulfillment of Revelation 12:1-3? It feels like astrology to me.\n6. 24:55 {Was Martin Luther Saved?} Do you think Martin Luther went to Heaven, despite the fact that he had a hatred toward Jews and was unrepentant?\n7. 29:04 {About Worship Principles} What is difference between the normative and regulative principle of worship? Any useful thoughts to this discussion, what to avoid, what to strive for?\n8. 35:03 {How to Keep Marriage God-Centered} Is your wife a part of your ministry? How do you keep your marriage God-centered?\n9. 38:17 {Do Numbers & Leviticus Contradict?} In Numbers 5, there is a test for an unfaithful wife. In verses 27-28 however, the punishment called for appears to differ from that in Leviticus 20: 10 which calls for death. Am I missing something?\n10. 44:30 {Can a Muslim be Saved?} Is it possible for a Muslim to be saved through faith since they also believe in to getting into Heaven by God's grace (although through works) and through repentance of sins?\n11. 49:53 {About the “Wages of Sin”} If “the wages of sin is death,” why is there a Hell? When a non-believer dies, why wasn't that debt paid by their death?\n12. 53:03 {Did Pharaoh in Exodus have Free Will?} I was just wondering what your thoughts were on Exodus 9: 12. Did Pharaoh have free will?\n13. 59:25 {How Important is Inerrancy?} I found out that several big teachers and content writers at my church don't believe that the Bible is inerrant? Should I be concerned?\n14. 1:02:39 {About Adoption/Homosexual Couples} How should Christians who are unwilling/uncalled to adopt respond to gay couples who adopt without looking like hypocrites or inhospitable (since they’re not taking in these kids themselves)?\n15. 1:06:43 {Should we Read Non-Canonical Books?} Would you recommend that current Christians develop an awareness of Scripture that is no longer canon?\n16. 1:09:46 {About the Galilean Wedding/The Rapture} Have you studied the Galilean wedding being justification for a pre-trib rapture? I’m having a hard time finding trusted sources to teach on this.\n17. 1:12:28 {About the “2 or 3 Witnesses” Principle} What is the significance of the Bible saying \"2 or 3 witnesses\" to establish an accusation, as opposed to saying \"2 witnesses\" or \"3 witnesses\"?\n18. 1:14:13 {Should a Head Pastor be Close to His Staff?} What are your thoughts on a head pastor who does not interact with his staff? I teach at a church and have no real relationship (to the point of pain) with my pastor as he is never present.\n19. 1:17:53 {Do Ghosts / Demons Exist?} I have a feeling that something is living in my house that shouldn't be there, and it is taking all the energy out of me! Do ghosts/demons really exist, and how can I get rid of them?\n20. 1:19:58 {Can God Punish After Commanding an Action?} How can God justly punish Gog/Magog for attacking Israel after He Himself made them do it? And how is this not God tempting them to sin by making them attack Israel?\n\nTo ask a question for the stream just be there as the stream begins, wait until AFTER it starts and post your question with a \"Q\" in front of it.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:48 {Does Scripture Promote Evil Things?} I’ve been challenged with the accusation that the Bible “promotes killing, rape, and slavery,” quoting Numbers 31: 15-18. I don’t want to simply prove them wrong; that doesn’t address this person’s heart. Would you please help?\n2. 18:36 {About the Death Penalty} As a follow up to your teaching on the death penalty, this question is from my skeptic brother: \"Isn't it better to rehabilitate offenders in hopes that they may come to repentance and give their lives to God?\"\n3. 22:32 {About the Apostles & Judas’ Position} I’ve heard it taught that the Apostles were being presumptuous when filling Judas’ empty position. Why did they choose to apply Psalm 69: 25 and Psalm 109:8 to the situation?\n4. 30:38 {Can we See God’s Face & Still Live?} Exodus 33: 20 says \"no one can see my face and live.” How do we reconcile this with Exodus 33: 11 which says, \"the Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as to a friend\"?\n5. 36:02 {About the 70th Week & Seven Seals} Is there any biblical evidence that the beginning of Daniel's 70th week and Jesus opening the first of the seven seals in Revelation will occur roughly at the same time?\n6. 37:44 {Why Didn’t God Rewrite Difficult Passages?} Can you explain the Holy Spirit Inspiration Doctrine? I struggle with understanding why God did not rewrite controversial Bible passages. I know I am only a man, and I seek to understand.\n7. 41:35 {Advice for an Unequally Yoked Marriage} My wife is an unbeliever. The more I attend church, the more strain it puts on our marriage. Is it right to continue going to church, or should I stop? (1 Corinthians 7: 14) I pray for her every day.\n8. 44:40 {About the Book of Numbers} What is the best way to read the book of Numbers? What’s some really cool stuff about it and how it ties to JESUS?\n9. 47:36 {Is “Deliverance” / Demon Casting Biblical?} I'm wondering about your thoughts on deliverance. Would you consider calling and identifying demons biblical, or is it not?\n10. 50:43 {Reconciling 2 Important Verses/Worldly Christians?} Can you explain Matthew 7: 21 vs. Romans 10: 13? Also, how do you spot worldly Christians (1 Corinthians 3:1) from those who are unsaved but have good works (Matthew 7: 22-23)? Shouldn't we have grace for sanctification?\n11. 55:15 {Advice for Christian College Students} What advice do you have for Christians in college?\n12. 59:12 {Is there Hope After Death for the Unsaved?} Can the Gospel be preached to the dead? According to 1 Peter 4:6, is there any hope for people after they die? Also, in 1 Peter 3:19-20, what does “preached unto the spirits in prison” mean?\n13. 1:03:43 {About Assurance of Salvation} How can I be sure that I am going to Heaven when I die?\n14. 1:06:35 {How is Satan the World’s Ruler?} Can you explain how Satan became the ruler of this world?\n15. 1:09:48 {About Salvation by Grace vs. Our Efforts} If we don't have to do works to get saved, why does Jesus tell us to \"make every effort to enter through the narrow door\" in Luke 13: 24?\n16. 1:13:07 {Help for Anxiety over Unsaved Loved Ones} How do I combat anxiety about my newborn daughter’s salvation? It’s a difficult topic for me due to my younger brother walking away from the faith as a teenager.\n17. 1:16:10 {About God’s Omnipotence & Non-Contradiction} Since God can’t contradict Himself, does that mean that His power is limited in a way? I know God is all powerful, but what is the logical reason behind Him being powerful and non-contradictory?\n18. 1:20:06 {About Vaccines & Aborted Fetal Tissue} What are your thought on vaccines using aborted fetal cell lines for development? I’m about to lose my job at big MN clinic if I don’t get the vaccine and struggle with this issue.\n19. 1:26:26 {About being Satisfied in God} How can you know that you are satisfied in God? How does it manifest practically? Does doing Christian things mean I'm satisfied in God? Can’t I do Christian stuff and still not be satisfied in Him?\n20. 1:28:59 {Is Pledging Allegiance Idolatry?} Is pledging allegiance to a country or flag a form of idolatry?\nTo ask a question for the stream just be there as the stream begins, wait until after it starts and post your question with a \"Q\" in front of it.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 51)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction \n1. 0:17 {Can Megachurches be Effective?} From a biblical and practical standpoint, is there a maximum number of people that can or should make up a local church? Assuming their doctrine is biblical, can a megachurch with multiple satellite sites or campuses be an effective church?\n2. 13:52 {Was Mary Surprised about Jesus’ Deity?} If Mary was aware of the immaculate conception (visited by an angel, etc.), why in Mark 3: 21 does it seem she’s surprised about Jesus being the Messiah? Scripture says His \"family\" that goes to \"take charge of Him\" for being out of His mind are His mother & brothers. Why would Mary think He is out of His mind if she had been visited by an angel?\n3. 19:40 {About the Apostles’ Martyrdom} A big defense for Christianity is that the Apostles died & were tortured, never recanting Jesus. How are the Heavens Gate & Jonestown 1978 incidents any different? They all willingly died for a lie, too.\n4. 24:33 {Who are the Called & Chosen in Matt.?} Who are the called & chosen ones in Matthew 22: 14? Is it God who does both the calling & the choosing?\n5. 30:32 {Does Jesus Mean “Hail Zeus”?} What do you say to people who claim that the name Jesus really means “hail Zeus”? They say one is unknowingly doing witchcraft by using the name Jesus. Why didn’t His name just continue as Yeshua?\n6. 35:17 {Is John 15 Works-Based?} Is John 15 works-based? v.10 says, “IF you keep my commandments, THEN you will abide in my love.” That sounds like obedience earns God's love, contrary to the Gospel. What does a life of \"abiding\" look like daily?\n7. 42:25 {Ways to Grow in Christ} I've recently found a renewed desire to get closer with God and was just wondering if you have any advice about how to do so.\n8. 44:05 {Did God Ordain Animal Sacrifices?} Does Jeremiah 7: 22 & Matthew 9: 13 indicate God never ordained animal sacrifices? To me it seems God has gradually moved mankind away from sacrifices & idol worship and into His ideal form of religion.\n9. 54:05 {About Angels} I know that we are made in the image and likeness of God and are called God’s children, but what are angels to God? Are they made in the image and likeness of God? Are they God’s children?\n10. 57:22 {Is there a Contradiction?} In Matthew 2: 19-22, was Joseph’s second dream (vs. 22) from God? God says all who mean to kill you are dead, but God warns him again. Some translations of vs. 22 leave out “God.” Is this a contradiction?\n11. 1:00:40 {How Many People are in Heaven?} It's estimated that 60% of natural conceptions fail to implant in the uterus and that at least 50 billion people lived until now. Does that mean there are around 75 billion people in Heaven?\n12. 1:05:32 {How to Recognize the Spirit vs. Enemy} How do we know when we feel the Holy Spirit that it isn't a trick from Satan making us think that it’s God? And how do you know Jesus’s resurrection wasn’t a false miracle/wonder by Satan?\n13. 1:09:26 {How to Glorify God as an Artist} I like to draw and write fiction in my spare time, and I want to glorify God as best I can doing this. Is there anything I should do or avoid doing as a Christian artist?\n14. 1:11:19 {Does Forgiveness Challenge Responsibility?} My grandma rejects Christianity because she claims relying on the forgiveness of a savior teaches us that we don’t have to be responsible for our own actions. How can I help her untangle that belief?\n15. 1:14:35 {About the “Day of the Lord”} What must come first, per 2 Thessalonians 2:3? Does “apostasia” mean a spiritual falling away/rebellion, or a physical departure, as in the rapture?\n16. 1:19:03 {What does “Cowardly” Mean in Revelation?} Can you shed some light on what Revelation 21:8 really means by the cowardly or the fearful having a special place in the lake of fire?\n17. 1:21:31 {About Liberal & Conservative Christians} It seems like conservative Christians are biblical with respect to personal morality, to the exclusion of societal justice - and liberal ones vice versa. Why? Is one more important? How do we reconcile the extremes?\n18. 1:26:36 {Forming a Biblical Self-Image} How do I overcome self hate? Whenever I look at myself, I see a sinner and a failure and it's hard to see God as a loving Father when all I can see Him as is a judge, and I'm afraid of Him at times.\n19. 1:30:46 {About the Marks of Stigmata} What do you think about the marks of the stigmata? Is there any way this could be biblical, even if someone isn't Catholic?\n20. 1:33:43 {About God Revealing Himself to Mankind} If God wants you to be saved more than you do, why doesn’t He reveal Himself to everyone like He did to Paul? Wouldn't more people be saved if they had the same “Road to Damascus” experience that Paul had?\n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 50)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:28 {How the Jewish Bible is Different} Why aren't there Bibles with the Hebrew order of the Old Testament? Some say the Hebrew order helps to show additional context and beauty of the Prophets and writings within Israel’s history. Any reason to stick to the English order? If either is fine, why aren’t there options?\r\n2. 14:15 {Advice - Tough Marriage/Divorce Situation} Regarding divorce, you mentioned that verbal/emotional abuse is only a valid justification when it is extreme. How do we think biblically about what God would consider to be extreme? I'm finding it hard not to doubt my own perceptions, but my husband is in complete denial. Also, where the husband has essentially separated from the wife within the marriage, is it still not permissible to remarry?\r\n3. 19:43 {About the “Faithful & Discreet Slave”} Can you explain how we should properly interpret Matthew 24: 45-47? I know Jehovah’s Witnesses think it’s referring to their governing body, but I’d like your opinion.\r\n4. 25:46 {Can Sin be Subjective At Times?} Sin is objective, but isn't it sometimes subjective? For example, you may be convicted of a certain activity and won't do it, but I do, or vice versa…and how modesty is different around the world.\r\n5. 30:21 {Are there Really “Accidents”?} Are there really accidents? For example, a freak car accident? How do we square God’s will with what might seem like a totally random event or “accident”?\r\n6. 33:26 {How to Quickly Defend Christianity} Please teach us to talk about why Christianity is true (3-5 points in 2-3 minutes).\r\n7. 41:44 {Can we Write Jesus into Games or Stories?} I'm a hobbyist/game developer and have started making Bible themed games. I want to include Jesus in one of my projects, but I feel uncomfortable writing words for Him. Any advice? Can I even do this?\r\n8. 45:10 {About the Natural Condition of Man} I've heard you say that you don't agree with any of the points in TULIP. What do you believe about the natural condition of man?\r\n9. 49:18 {Can There Be Differing Interpretations of Scripture?} If the word “clear” is used to describe a teaching in the Bible by two Christians with opposing views on the same teaching, wouldn’t that void the effectiveness of using the word in that way?\r\n10. 50:58 {Trusting God in Very Difficult Times} Do you have any advice for dealing with a miscarriage? It’s the first time in my life where I’ve been angry at God. I know He’s sovereign, but it’s difficult to accept right now.\r\n11. 54:56 {Does James Teach Guaranteed Healing?} Does James 5: 14-15 say that a sick person should ask elders to pray for him and he will be always healed? The text seems to be quite straight forward on this.\r\n12. 1:01:48 {Can we Give to Non-Christian Causes?} Thoughts on charitable giving to organizations that I'm passionate about but aren't overtly Christian? Even if it's above my normal tithe, is this \"taking money away\" from Kingdom advancement?\r\n13. 1:03:37 {Is There a Contradiction?} The Synoptics seem to indicate that the Feeding of 5,000 took place on the Sea of Galilee's West side (Mark 6:30-56), but it seems to take place on the East side in John 6. How do we resolve this?\r\n14. 1:04:58 {Is Worrying a Sin?} Is worrying (stress/anxiety) a sin? If so, could you provide some thoughts on the reasons you think it is?\r\n15. 1:10:51 {Is it Wrong to Visit an Unbiblical Church?} Is it wrong to attend a “prosperity gospel” church with our in-laws when we visit them?\r\n16. 1:11:59 {Protecting Children from Bad Teaching} My Hubby was raised Mormon. He still believes it all but isn't active. His family takes my son to church if he stays with them & they've started teaching him LDS doctrine. I want to not let him go anymore w/out hurting them. Advice?\r\n17. 1:14:49 {Is “Entire Sanctification” Biblical?} What are your thoughts on Entire Sanctification? Could a Christian eventually live a life without sin through God's power? If not, shouldn’t we shoot for it anyway?\r\n18. 1:18:39 {Was Christ Nailed to a Tree or Cross?} I’ve heard some Christian songs say Christ was nailed to a “tree” instead of a cross. Would you happen to know why the two terms are interchanged?\r\n19. 1:22:18 {Why Does Lot Offer His Daughters?} In Genesis 19:6-8, why does Lot offer his own daughters to the wicked people of Sodom?\r\n20. 1:28:32 {About Forgiveness When We Sin} When Christians sin, are they condemned again until they ask for forgiveness?\n\nMy video on why prayer in faith depends on God’s will before healing will happen. https://youtu.be/VvA5ZWDSdmo\n\nMy two videos on babies and salvation with an explanation of my own understanding of sin nature (as opposed to a Calvinist view) https://youtu.be/d9l0nbqjKHg\nhttps://youtu.be/ezwpmY73iTA\n\nHere's my website with a new clip search feature for finding exactly where in a video a particular issue is addressed. https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction \n1. 0:10 {How to Support a Recovering Spouse} My husband is a recovering alcoholic, now beginning to attend AA meetings. As a wife, what are the most practical ways I can support him while encouraging him to begin leading our home in a biblical way without overwhelming him?\r\n2. 7:00 {Where did Lazarus Temporarily Go?} Where were people who died and later got resurrected located in that period? Do they go to Heaven or Hell and get snatched back to Earth after they’re resurrected (e.g., Lazarus, Dorcas, Eutychus etc.)?\r\n3. 10:50 {Our Own Thoughts vs. the Holy Spirit} In something like pursuing a relationship, or even in general, how do you tell the difference between the Holy Spirit and your own anxiety telling you not to do something?\r\n4. 18:42 {How to Biblically Grieve Painful Loss} My only son died from an overdose last year. I was angry at God and walked away from Him for a bit. I told Him “If I am to serve you, I want the real God.” Isaiah 43: 18-19 says to get over it. How do I get over it?\r\n5. 23:28 {Can Horror Movies & Secular Music Invite Demons?} What are your thoughts about Christians having to be careful so that they don’t invite demons into their lives through watching horror movies or listening to secular music? Is this biblical?\r\n6. 27:50 {About Evidence & Belief} Imagine if someone asked you, “Would you be willing to disbelieve in God if the evidence led there?” What would your response be? Are we obligated to say yes? Does that dishonor God?\r\n7. 34:07 {About the “Golden Rule”} Is the Golden Rule objective or subjective? For example, I tease my friend and he teases me back because we think it's funny, but I won't do it to others because they don't think it's funny.\r\n8. 35:58 {Are All of God’s Actions Infallible?} How do I approach a conversation with someone who doesn't believe God is infallible? He believes in the God of the Bible, but he doesn't think all of God's actions are \"good,\" like in the book of Job.\r\n9. 43:44 {Identifying & Rejecting False Teaching} What's up with all the bad hermeneutics out there? How can those of us without formal training avoid bad interpretation/application of Scripture by ourselves and be able to spot them in sermons, etc.?\r\n10. 46:21 {Does God Hate Satan?} Does God hate Satan and the demons?\r\n11. 48:01 {What Did Jesus Mean by “Be Perfect”?} What did Jesus mean when He said, \"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect\" in Matthew 5: 48? Wouldn't that mean we're all condemned since we sin every day/week?\r\n12. 54:39 {About Jacob & Esau} Why didn't God punish Jacob and his mother for stealing Esau's birthright and blessing (Genesis 27)? In fact, why does He love Jacob and hate Esau (Malachi 1)?\r\n13. 57:53 {About “Unknown”/ Tongues in 1 Cor.} What do you make of the added word “unknown” in 1 Corinthians 14:2-3, which is not in the original Greek? Could it mean that it is not a different sort of tongues, rather, that no one understands them?\r\n14. 1:00:27 {A Difficult Passage – Ezekiel 45} Is Jesus offering sin sacrifices in Ezekiel 45?\r\n15. 1:03:23 {Should we Worship Using Instruments?} Should we use instruments in congregational church worship? Why or why not? The early church did not use instruments.\r\n16. 1:07:54 {What to Do When a Church Member is Out of Line} What should I do if a member of my fellowship with some mental issues has been making several false prophecies every day, saying literally \"hear me for the lord speaks”?\r\n17. 1:09:27 {Book Recommendations?} What are some good books for important topics like systematic theology, hermeneutics, complementarianism, etc.?\r\n18. 1:11:50 {About the Subordination of the Son} How do you explain the subordination of Jesus (1 Corinthians 11:3; 15: 28) to the Father within Trinitarian theology? I explain it via incarnational subordination (Philippians 2:5; Hebrews 29; 5:8).\r\n19. 1:15:14 {Were Any of Jesus’ Bones Broken?} If the nail of a crucified victim was inserted through the heel bone or ankle bone, how should we interpret John 19: 36? Wouldn’t a nail cause the bone to break?\r\n20. 1:19:51 {When to be Kind vs. Aggressive} When trying to be biblically based, how do we know when to be kind, and when to be aggressive?\n\nTo get your own questions answered please show up at the start of the stream, type a question beginning with \"Q\" (or ANQ to ask anonymously), but don't send it before you see me on screen.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:29 {About the Satanic Temple’s 7 Tenets} The Satanic Temple has been gaining popularity online due to their “7 tenets” they believe people should live by. Many people see these tenets as positive and morally good, and are being drawn into their organization as a result. What are your thoughts about this?\n2. 13:31 {Does Isaiah Disprove the Trinity?} Does Isaiah 9:6 disprove the Trinity since it calls Jesus the Father? many Oneness/Unitarians use this verse to support Oneness/modalism.\n3. 18:19 {About our Souls/Spirits} What exactly is a soul or a spirit?\n4. 20:14 {Biblical Dating Advice} What things should a high school student consider while deciding if or how to date a godly woman?\n5. 23:17 {Should we Always Say “God Willing”?} What does James 4: 13 mean? Should we always say “God willing” when making or talking about our plans?\n6. 27:03 {About the “Doctrines of Demons”} Can you give more examples about the “doctrines of demons” mentioned in 1 Timothy 4:1?\n7. 32:27 {About Becoming a Disciple} How do you become a disciple in light of Matthew 28: 19? Can you be unsaved yet still a disciple? I haven’t found the Greek word (μαθητευω) elsewhere. Seems to normally be μαθητης (ex. Acts 11: 29; 19: 30; 21:4, 16).\n8. 35:12 {When we Should and Shouldn’t Witness} How do we know when to speak up about the truth of Christ vs. when not to? I am grieved by what I see being claimed as “truth” today, but I don’t want to just sit back and say “I’m not supposed to judge.”\n9. 40:11 {About the Fear of God and Dinosaurs} Does the \"fear\" of the Lord mean \"scared\"? If not, why is \"fear” still used in today’s Bibles? Translation problem? Confused here! And were dinosaur bones/fossils created by the devil to cast doubt?\n10. 44:42 {About Denominations} Do you think denominations are a “concession” from God in that He knew we would disagree on doctrine, or is it more like differing members of the body reaching different people in different ways?\n11. 48:58 {Responding to Mormon Arguments} What is your best answer to a Mormon responding to \"There is only ONE God\" by saying \"Yes, only one God for US. Only one God we are to worship & that’s OUR Heavenly Father but there are others elsewhere\"?\n12. 55:29 {What is the Mark of the Beast?} What is the mark of the beast as described in Revelation 13? I’ve heard and read so many things, and I’m not sure how to make sense of it.\n13. 1:03:47 {Is it Biblical? Jesus in our Hearts} Do we have \"Jesus in our hearts\" as believers? What about worship songs about Jesus in the room? John 16:5-10, Acts 1:9-11 and basically all of Revelation seems to say Jesus is in Heaven for now.\n14. 1:08:43 {Why did God Allow our Sin Nature?} Frank Turek said (paraphrasing) that in Heaven we will have free will, but we won't sin because we won't have a sin nature. If that's the case, why didn't God just make us like that on Earth?\n15. 1:13:49 {How to Comfort Grieving Friends} I lost a good friend of over 20 yrs. He was recovering from a heroin addiction. He called his parents saying he couldn't take it anymore and he shot himself. What can I say to comfort them?\n16. 1:16:28 {Learning about Biblical Heroes} Some biblical characters are heroes in the faith, but not mentioned much in the Bible (people like Enoch and Melchizedek). How can I find out more about what was so special about their relationship with God?\n17. 1:19:31 {About Christ’s Return} Why did Jesus mention eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building, and getting married in Luke 17?\n18. 1:25:09 {About the Day of the Lord} How do you interpret the “day of the Lord”? Do you understand it as a single day, or do you see it as the whole tribulation period? People seem to have differing views on this.\n19. 1:26:33 {About the Vine & Branches, Eternal Security} Just wanted clarity on John 15:1-8. Is Jesus talking about people losing their salvation? Or people walking away from Him and the faith?\n20. 1:31:37 {About the LE of Mark} You've said that we should leave in the longer ending of Mark's Gospel because removing it could upset some Christians. If this is so, then should we be including things like the Comma Johanneum because removing that has upset some Christians? Where do you believe we should draw the line, and why?\n\nHere's that video giving a biblical evaluation of suicide. https://youtu.be/T6nlUhWJe00\n\nTo get your own questions answered please show up at the start of the stream, type a question beginning with \"Q\" (or ANQ to ask anonymously), but don't send it before you see me on screen.

    "title": "Can I Really Justify Seeing Pictures of Jesus In The Old Testament?",
    "description": "\"Typology\" is a fancy word for how God put intricate details about Jesus throughout the stories of the Old Testament. I'm not talking about prophecy here, although there is a relationship between typology and prophecy. I'm saying that Jesus is the main topic of the Bible so much that God shaped history and people's lives so that the Bible would become a beautiful literary tapestry that shows Jesus throughout it's pages. From the story of Joseph going from slavery and presumed death to the right hand of Pharaoh as a savior of many, to the feasts of Israel demonstrating the very nature and mission of Jesus to die for our sins. \n\nIn today's interview I will explain what \"typology\" is, give a number of examples of it and answer objections to it. \n\nThanks to Micah Gunn for having me on his podcast, Truth Be Told, to do this interview. \nMicah’s YT Channel – Truth Be Told\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn-rlo-ORHtatIPjGmtZm-w\nMicah’s Podcast on Spotify – Truth Be Told\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/5GRTgVGiqOOzz6DnJe1pfL?si=Qkjjj-yhQRqwIOcsbwIFsA&nd=1 \n\nTHIS is my 27 part series on Jesus In The Old Testament, the most rewarding and exciting topic I have ever had the pleasure of teaching! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWlpQauXiTU&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "The Super-Cute and Super-Wrong Religion of Omnism",
    "description": "Omnism, in the sense that we just pretend all religions are true, is a really nice (in the old sense of the word) religion. It has high hopes and seems to help everyone to \"get along\" but it depends entirely on utter irrationality and dishonest evaluations of the really important issues that religions are disagreeing on. If you have fallen for Omnism then I hope you'll consider this a kindness and a wake-up call to consider the evidence for Jesus and the importance of the truth about God and us.\n\nThis is just one question from a long interview I did for the moderators of the r/Bible subreddit. They asked their subreddit to send me a bunch of questions and I spent a lot of time preparing so that I would be able to offer the best answers I could. I'll be posting these answers as individual videos so keep an eye out for the rest in the set.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:23 {Will Psychopaths be Judged the Same?} It has recently been scientifically proven that many psychopaths have a physical brain alteration that doesn't allow their synapses to receive the neuron chemicals for emotions such as sympathy. Oftentimes, they become violent criminals or even murderers. Will they be judged by God the same as any other person, even though they have something physiologically wrong with them?\n2. 8:03 {What do Miracles/Healing Depend On?} If one were to pray over someone for a miracle or for healing, what would the chances of it working depend on? Jesus said that it depends on faith. Does it also depend on being a relatively righteous person?\n3. 15:07 {About Glorified Bodies/Resurrection} If our bodies are glorified at the rapture, what happens to those people who are saved post-rapture? Is there a second resurrection?\n4. 17:19 {About the Moral Argument} My brother has a very biblical worldview despite being an agnostic (in terms of homosexuality and celibacy, etc.) based on science. How do I prove that morality comes from God?\n5. 26:41 {Is Everyone Claiming to be Saved Really Saved?} Paul Washer said that Matthew 7: 13-14 is not about Christians and non-Christians, but rather, real Christians and Christians who think they’re saved. He says many who think they are saved aren’t really saved. Thoughts?\n6. 32:26 {About Giving Everything for the Lord} If salvation is a free gift and not by works, then why does Jesus say those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples? How do we know when we have given up everything?\n7. 38:53 {Honesty vs. Kindness?} Where do you draw the line between honest communication about things that bother you about something someone does, and “dying to self” if the person is a very close friend/loved one/spouse?\n8. 44:09 {About Demons and The Nephilim} Are demons the spirits of dead Nephilim? Genesis 6 explains that the Nephilim are the offspring of women and angels. Demons never materialize, but we know angels can. Luke 22:3 is not convincing to me.\n9. 48:04 {Can We Love Truth More than God?} Can I be a truth-seeker and a good Christian? Is it possible to love the truth more than God, considering that Jesus is the truth?\n10. 55:35 {About the Sun Standing Still – Josh. 10} What do you think really happened during \"the long day\" in Joshua 10 during the battle between Israel and the armies of the 5 kings when \"the sun stood still, and the moon stopped\"?\n11. 58:20 {About the OT Law & Sacrifices vs. Faith} Why was the old covenant law set up to require animal sacrifice, since we see Abraham was atoned for by his faith in the promise to come of what was Jesus (dimly perceived)?\n12. 1:03:22 {Bethel Worship Music?} Can I keep listening to Bethel’s music, given the intent (as far as I understand) to invoke emotional responses? I want to avoid the idol of “emotional highs,” but I still see value in their music.\n13. 1:07:03 {About the 153 Fish in John} In John 21, it is written that Peter caught 153 \"large fish\" and that \"although there were so many, the net was not torn.\" Is there a message or theme John was conveying here?\n14. 1:12:01 {Leaving a Church the Biblical Way} How do I go about leaving my church? Do I talk to my leaders? Do I have to explain why? What do I need to do to make sure that I do it the right way?\n15. 1:16:28 {About the Dead Jesus Raised} Where did all the people that Jesus and the disciples raised from the dead go while they were dead? I would hate to think they were in Paradise somewhere, then had to come back.\n16. 1:19:05 {About Asking for Forgiveness/Mark of the Beast} A popular internet ministry says Jesus never said we need to ask for forgiveness and the Bible doesn’t mention it. Is that true? They also say it’s impossible for a Christian to take mark of the beast. Is that true?\n17. 1:24:00 {Why Keep the L.E. of Mark in the Bible?} If the longer ending of Mark isn't original, nor written by Mark, how is keeping it in the Bible not diluting the Word of God and cheapening the meaning of \"Scripture\"?\n18. 1:26:09 {Help During Trying Times of Doubt} Why can’t I trust Christ for complete forgiveness even though I fully believe every word in the Bible? Why won’t my heart allow me to enter salvation? Why doesn’t God seem to want to help me?\n19. 1:31:35 {Jesus’ Deity & His Title of “Son of God”} If Jesus is God, then why do Paul and the Gospels often speak of them separately? What is the significant about the phrase \"Son of God\" being used for Jesus, since it is used for others, too?\n20. 1:35:13 {“Hearing” God in Prayer/His Guidance in Life} When we pray, how do we \"hear\" God's reply? How can someone differentiate between hearing the voice of God and hearing their own thoughts? When I pray, I feel like it's just me. How can I make decisions if I don't know what God wants of me?\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "Why Mark's Gospel Has Such a Strange Ending: The Mark Series pt 70 (16:8)",
    "description": "I'm not exaggerating when I say that some skeptics, and even some Christians, and some scholars in both categories, will teach that if Mark ends his Gospel at 16:8 then it destroys Christianity as we know it. I think this is silly. But I also think it needs a response. After going through those over the top claims we will deal with the more subtle and thoughtful claims of those who say that there are internal and external reasons for thinking that Mark could not have meant for 16:8 to be the ending of his Gospel originally. All told I will walk through 7 specific claims against the shorter ending of Mark and give a case for how this seemingly strange ending is actually quite powerful and meant to cause us to sit with the massive implications of the death and resurrection of the Messiah, until we are stirred to action.\n\nThis is the last video in the Mark Series. I have SO enjoyed doing this with you and appreciate your prayers for me to have wisdom as I seek to launch into future series and videos. Next up is a thorough study of women in ministry (that will probably take months to prep, sorry for the wait) and then I'll do a verse by verse teaching through the book of Hebrews, with the same sort of methods you've seen in the study of Mark. \n\nThis is part 70 of the Mark Series, a thorough verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark paying special attention to theology, apologetics and historical context. See the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nHere's Kelley Iverson's article, \"A Further Word on Final Gar\". http://www.jstor.org/stable/43725642 \n\nThe notes for many of my studies are also available for free on my website (as is all the content on my website). https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 46)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference: \n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:29 {Why Didn’t Jesus Mention Paul?} Hello, I am a Christian, and it's been important to me to understand why the Lord Jesus didn't mention to the apostles or anyone that Paul would be coming to enlighten the Way for His Church. This question hasn't been addressed in any of the studies I've researched, nor by any of the pastors I listen to. But isn't this question a most serious matter, since Paul wrote the majority of our New Testament?\r\n2. 6:45 {Is God Male?} Is God a male?\r\n3. 10:08 {About the Woman of Tekoa & Banishing} How can someone be banished, and yet not cast out from God? I’m referring to what the woman of Tekoa said in 2 Samuel 14: 14. Is it only within that context, or can it be applied transcendently?\r\n4. 17:34 {About OCD, Vows, & Fear} I’ve been struggling with OCD vows recently (such as, if I don’t say this in prayer, I’m not saved). Many places online say to let it go, and that you can’t make a vow out of fear. How can I look at this biblically?\r\n5. 22:39 {Are Souls Eternal?} Is the soul as an eternal entity more of a Greek philosophical idea, or confirmed in Scripture? Do you have any biblical references for an eternal soul?\r\n6. 25:20 {Did Anyone in “The Flood” Go to Heaven?} Do you think any of the people that died in the flood (above the age of accountability) may have been saved or will not go to Hell?\r\n7. 29:01 {About Natural Revelation & Salvation} You've said people who've never heard of Jesus need to respond to natural revelation to be saved. Can you give an example of how a woman growing up in Saudi Arabia would respond to natural revelation?\r\n8. 33:55 {About the “Mysteries of God” in Ephesians} Please explain what is meant by the mysteries of God in Ephesians 3:5.\r\n9. 38:09 {About the Beginning of the New Covenant} Did the New Covenant start when the Temple, which housed the Ark of the Covenant, was destroyed?\r\n10. 44:07 {About Miracles & False Religions} You've said miracles in other religions are false signs from Satan. Why would other religions have reason to think these signs are from Satan? Couldn't a Muslim say the same thing to a Christian?\r\n11. 48:47 {Do We Have to Attend Church?} Is it OK to not attend church at all? I live in Russia and Christianity here is very unbiblical. I’ve tried a lot of churches and I don’t feel comfortable there.\r\n12. 50:53 {Is it a Sin to Depict God?} I’m a new believer. I watched a Christian cartoon with my son, and it depicted God as a Santa-looking man. My son asked if we were breaking the 2nd commandment. Is it a sin to depict God in any way? (Exodus 20:4)\r\n13. 56:07 {Do those who Seek God Really Find Him?} The Bible says that those who diligently seek God will find Him. What about the Muslims, Hindus, and all the people who are diligently seeking God but never find Jesus and stay in their religion?\r\n14. 1:02:31 {Does God Forgive Repeated Sin?} If you struggle with sin and there is true contrition but you still keep repeating the same sin and asking for forgiveness, will God still forgive you?\r\n15. 1:05:59 {Advice for the Timing of Baptism} I recently converted to Christianity. Our church does baptisms once a year, but my husband has Covid and can't attend. I want him to be there, but I also want to get baptized ASAP. What should I do?\r\n16. 1:07:12 {About a “Gap” in Scripture} Can you explain the gap between the early churches in the New Testament and the first Protestants like Martin Luther?\r\n17. 1:11:32 {Men of Valor Living in Sin?} Why does the Lord call Gideon a mighty man of Valor when he had many wives? Was this always a sin? I'm confused about this, honestly.\r\n18. 1:16:59 {Where Does Sin Nature Come From?} If God knits us in our mothers’ wombs, where do we get our sin nature?\r\n19. 1:19:54 {Defending the Trinity in 1 Cor.} I believe in the Trinity, but there is someone who has used 1 Corinthians 15:28 against the doctrine. Could you please explain this for me?\r\n20. 1:23:18 {About Young Ambassadors Living for Christ} How can young people be good ambassadors for Christ when we also sin? How do we make sure we do not conform to this world?\n\nTaking your questions from the YT live chat! Every Friday at 1pm Pacific time. While I don't pretend to know all the answers I hope to offer some thoughts that will help you in the direction of thinking biblically about things. \n\nThe BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "title": "100+ hours of research. Is the longer ending of Mark authentic?: The Mark Series pt 69 (16:9-20)",
    "description": "Today's the day. I've spent weeks trying to dig deep on the debate of whether the last 12 verses of the Gospel of Mark are actually part of the Gospel of Mark. \n\nVideo Map with Time Stamps:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 3:45 Mike admits his bias\n2. 7:39 Why this research was so hard\n3. 10:04 Mike’s basic conclusions on the passage\n4. 11:21 Here begins the external evidence analysis\n5. 16:40 Codex Sinaiticus\n6. 22:38 Codex Vaticanus\n7. 33:55 How important are those 2 manuscripts really?\n8. 36:18 Codex 304; a Byzantine MS that ends at vs. 8\n9. 40:40 Other Greek manuscripts that weigh in on this\n10. 52:00 Syriac translations\n11. 54:30 Armenian translations\n12. 55:49 Georgian translations\n13. 56:42 Sahidic translations\n14. 58:03 Latin translations\n15. 1:00:13 Lectionary systems\n16. 1:01:38 What church fathers have to say\n17. 1:02:35 Irenaeus (c. 180)\n18. 1:04:01 Tatian (c. 170)\n19. 1:04:38 Eusebius (mid 300s)\n20. 1:10:45 Jerome (early 400s)\n21. 1:16:03 Victor of Antioch (5th or 6th century)\n22. 1:17:22 Clement of Alexandria\n23. 1:18:04 Origen\n24. 1:19:11 1st Clement (c. 95)\n25. 1:22:00 My thoughts on Lunn and Snapp\n26. 1:22:34 Conclusion on the church fathers\n27. 1:24:32 What is the “internal evidence”?\n28. 1:28:58 How vs. 9 doesn’t fit with vs. 8\n29. 1:33:16 Two common bad examples of internal evidence\n30. 1:36:45 Kai is not like Mark\n31. 1:41:29 The historical present\n32. 1:43:06 The demonstrative pronoun\n33. 1:44:46 Verbs for perception\n34. 1:45:57 The strongest piece of internal evidence\n35. 1:50:10 21 Markisms\n36. 1:55:00 The million-dollar question of scribal motives\n37. 2:03:55 Why I still want the longer ending in my Bible\n38. 2:06:46 Lingering issues\n\nThis is a book where 4 scholars each build a case for their different views on the ending of Mark. It’s a good introduction into the issues of the debate even if no one scholar has the space to fully flesh out their case. “Perspectives on the Ending of Mark: Four Views” https://www.amazon.com/Perspectives-Ending-Mark-Daniel-Wallace-ebook/dp/B004OR17WK/ \n\nNicholas Lunn recently wrote a book offering a very detailed case that the longer ending always part of Mark’s Gospel. At first I found Lunn’s book to be really helpful in challenging the scholarly majority. But after spending a lot of time with it I’ve come to think that his work causes more confusion than clarity on the topic. Uneven standards in how evidence is handled make his work difficult to read without leading to important misimpressions. “The Original Ending of Mark: A New Case for the Authenticity of Mark 16:9-20” https://www.amazon.com/Original-Ending-Mark-Case-Authenticity-ebook/dp/B00OU6OB78/ \n\nLarry Hurtado offered three short reviews of Lunn’s book, all three at this link.  http://evangelicaltextualcriticism.blogspot.com/search/label/Nicholas%20P.%20Lunn \n\nJames Snapp’s theory is that Mark wrote the longer ending but it was originally not part of the Gospel of Mark. It was taken from some other work from Mark and then added on to the end of the Gospel of Mark. He offers 5 different theories for why it is missing from some manuscripts. I respect Snapp’s tenacity but I think his logic has regular logical problems. I mean no insult by this, I just want you to be prepared to think very carefully about what he says. His book, “Authentic: The Case for Mark 16:9-20”, is free here. https://www.academia.edu/12545835/Authentic_The_Case_for_Mark_16_9_20  \n\nThe most helpful resource I found for dealing with the internal evidence in the longer ending of Mark is this article from Travis Williams. https://www.academia.edu/1444542/Bringing_Method_to_the_Madness_Examining_the_Style_of_the_Longer_Ending_of_Mark\n\nMy verse by verse study of the longer ending of Mark is here.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 45)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction \n1. 0:37 {Conscience before the New Covenant?} Based on Jeremiah 31: 33-34, did people before the New Covenant not have a conscience (innate knowledge of God and the ability to know right from wrong as we do now)? Based on the radical changes that Jesus and the Church brought to the world, and God seemingly needing to give people constant special revelation in the OT, could there be a case for this? Could the need for the cycle of sin-judgement-repentance/cry for help-deliverance be connected to this?\n2. 8:16 {Help for Maintaining a Godly Attitude} The Lord has blessed me tremendously in life. I love Him & want to please Him! But for some reason (& I have no excuse) I find it really hard to have a calm, grateful, God-honoring attitude. I'm easily irritated & find myself complaining about little things constantly, especially when I don't get my way or experience a minor inconvenience. I'm ashamed of this & don't want my attitude to be this way but I can't seem to change.\n3. 12:31 {Covenant vs. Dispensational Theology} What's your thought on the reformed perspective of Covenant Theology vs. the dispensational view?\n4. 15:46 {Jesus – “Forgive them, for they know not…”} Why did Jesus say “Forgive them, for they know not what they do” if Jesus knew they had to do it to save us at the cross?\n5. 17:59 {About the Vanishing & Glass Seas – Revelation} In Revelation 21:1, it describes the \"sea vanishing.\" Is this sea the same as the \"sea of glass\" in Revelation 4:6 where some have suggested it symbolizes the barrier that separated God from man?\n6. 20:51 {Discussing Theology Without Focusing on Death} My 14 y.o. does not like the subject of death (her father/my husband died suddenly 4 years ago). How can I talk about salvation and other biblical things in a way that doesn’t make her anxious?\n7. 23:37 {About the Paraclete} John 16:7 says Paraclete is the Holy Spirit, and 1 John 2:1 says it is Jesus Christ. I cannot believe this is a mistranslation, so what is 1 John 2:1 talking about?\n8. 28:16 {Did Moses Write the Pentateuch?} Do we have evidence that Moses wrote the first 5 books of the Bible? My atheist friend is questioning this.\n9. 31:14 {Does the Man Sin when an Abortion is Done?} Is it a sin for the man if a woman decides to get an abortion? With or without his consent (does that make a difference?) \n10. 34:00 {Are We Obligated to Obey God’s Standards?} My friend asked me: If we didn't choose to exist or come into existence, why do we have to follow what God says or His \"standards\"? Why does He have standards anyways? How do I respond?\n11. 37:45 {About the Covid Vaccine} How should Christians respond to the push to get the Covid vaccine (especially here in LA)? Is it our Christian duty to put others above ourselves, even if it betrays our own conscience?\n12. 40:41 {About the Doctrine of Preservation} Does Matthew 5: 18 teach the doctrine of preservation? What are your thoughts on this doctrine?\n13. 46:37 {About the Trinity & God’s Attributes} How can the three persons of the Trinity be distinct if they all have the same attributes (Omni-s) and their wills are the same?\n14. 50:22 {Is Depression Ever a Sin Issue?} Is there ever a point where depression can be a sin issue? How should I view it in light of what Scripture says about worrying, while being charitable toward those who are struggling?\n15. 54:23 {How to Evangelize at Work} What’s the best way to share the Gospel in the workplace? Is there a guide to sharing the Gospel that you keep to?\n16. 56:56 {About Exodus 4 & Zipporah} Please explain Exodus 4: 20-26, especially Zipporah's part in it.\n17. 1:02:46 {When Married Couples Disagree on Theology} What is your view of a husband and wife having differing opinions on eschatology or matters of salvation and particular biblical verses? Is it best to just agree to disagree?\n18. 1:04:41 {Can a Person be Beyond Repentance?} Can someone be beyond repentance as Esau was?\n19. 1:06:13 {Should our Faith Make Sense?} Is Christianity a faith that should make sense, or is it just having the faith to believe? How can we believe if one person interprets the Bible this way and another the other way?\n20. 1:13:15 {Why did God Punish ALL Snakes?} Why did God punish all snakes for what Satan did in the Garden of Eden?\n\nTaking your questions from the YT live chat! Every Friday at 1pm Pacific time. While I don't pretend to know all the answers I hope to offer some thoughts that will help you in the direction of thinking biblically about things. \n\nHere's my teaching (from 6 years ago) on a biblical view of the conscience, if you want more on that. https://youtu.be/xYjSxiTQtdY\n\nThe BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "description": "Is Leviticus just offering advice about medical health? Is it identifying homosexual acts as sinful or just potentially unhealthy? Can calmly and carefully try to understand the passage in context? I hope so.\n\nI think that the overall context of the passage makes its application pretty clear and even though our current culture tends to misunderstand this as condemning certain kinds of people instead of certain kinds of behavior we simply cannot be biblically faithful without standing our ground on this topic.\n\nThis is just one question from a long interview I did for the moderators of the r/Bible subreddit.

    "title": "How I Would Interpret The Longer Ending of Mark: The Mark Series pt 68 (16:9-20)",
    "description": "This passage is probably most well known because of it's abuse by snake handling preachers in the United States. I will address that issue but it's far from the only important thing to talk about in these verses! Though the snake comments in the passage get a lot of attention from normal people, scholars are mostly interested in the question of whether the passage belongs in the Gospel of Mark at all. But, today I'm not answering the question of whether the last 12 verses of Mark are authentic or not. I'm just answering the question of how I would interpret the passage as it stands. Next week I'll deal with the complex issues related to whether the passage belongs in Mark in the first place. \n\nThis is part 68 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 44)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction \n1. 0:31 {Were Jesus’ Disciples Married?}  Were Christ’s disciples married / did they have families? I believe there is a reference to Peter’s in-law, but I find it to be an interesting question. What would it be like for them? How would that fit with what the Lord tells us about the role of a husband/father? The love for God trumps all, so did that override their responsibilities as a husband/father?\n2. 9:55 {Should We Give to Beggars?}  I've had multiple encounters where people directly approach me and my wife on the street or at a gas station asking for money, food, or a ride. I know most people would say don't give anything because you're feeding their bad habit, and I know there is also the risk that if you do help/give, they may try to push for even more favors. But it's obvious that Jesus was compassionate toward beggars. What are some biblical principles for this in today's age?\n3. 15:37 {What is a Miracle?} What is a miracle? If it can be explained, is it still a miracle?\n4. 20:54 {Should we be Worried about Gov’t Control?} Should Christians be worried about government control? I have friends not getting the Covid vaccine because \"it's a way to be controlled by the government.” I want to think biblically about this.\n5. 26:09 {About Walking by the Spirit} Does living in the Spirit mean fighting the flesh? How do you fight something that is already dead?\n6. 32:04 {About “Perfect Love Casting Out Fear”} What did John mean in 1 John by “perfect love casts out fear, and that whoever fears has not been made perfect…”?\n7. 34:43 {About Paul and a Time Gap in Scripture} Why didn’t Luke mention the time gap that took place during Acts 9: 20-26, that Paul mentioned in Galatians 1: 17-18?\n8. 40:20 {Prayer to Help with Deep Depression} Can you pray for me? I’ve battled depression my whole life, and the past 2 weeks I’ve gotten so low I need some prayer if you have the time.\n9. 43:13 {Why did Jesus need to be Led by the Spirit?} Why did Jesus (God) need to be filled, led, or anointed by the Spirit? Troubled by some saying that Jesus did everything as a man through the Spirit, so we should be able to do everything Jesus did.\n10. 48:10 {Forming a Healthy Work/Rest Balance} Since life is finite and Heaven is infinite, how do we justify spending any time not working to influence eternity? Where is the balance between relaxation & work? (Ephesians 5: 15-16 vs. 1 Thessalonians 4: 11)\n11. 53:10 {Refuting Catholic “Queenship” of Mary} How would you answer a Catholic who uses Revelation 12 to argue Mary's queenship?\n12. 59:06 {Can we be Confident in God’s Existence?} How can one ever be sure that the arguments for God’s existence are truly sound? Is it because all current objections fail? Maybe there is an Achilles heel that has not come up yet.\n13. 1:02:44 {What is Prevenient Grace?} I just heard about prevenient grace. I have looked it up and it just don't understand it. Can you explain it?\n14. 1:05:48 {Finding Hope in Difficult Situations} How do you interpret the hopelessness of Psalm 88? How can you comfort someone who feels what Psalm 88:18b (NIV) implies?\n15. 1:16:27 {Is Receiving Mental Health Therapy Biblical?} Is it a sin for Christians to see a mental health therapist/psychiatrist? Is biblical counseling the only option for Christians?\n16. 1:18:54 {Can we Know 100% our Faith is True?} Is it possible to be 100% certain of Christianity and the Bible? Is believing but also having doubt a sin? I would like to have 100% certainty, but there's always a doubt that it all could be a lie.\n17. 1:22:59 {How to Respond to Verbal Abuse in Marriage} My husband yells & curses at me. I always tell him I don’t deserve it, but he continues. Can this be corrected? If so, how? And would I dishonor God if I stop being physically intimate with him?\n18. 1:27:02 {Is God Actively Judging Today?} Is God actively judging the world today or is all judgment held out ‘till the second coming? When negative things happen like natural disasters, how much of this can we say is God’s judgment?\n19. 1:29:59 {Hidden Meaning in the Book of Ruth?} Is there any hidden meaning behind Ruth uncovering Boaz's feet in Scripture?\n20. 1:31:33 {How to Stay Close to God When We’re Slipping} How do I get better in my relationship with God? I'm slipping away, what do I do?\n\nHere’s the video on dealing with depression, which I mentioned during the stream. https://youtu.be/KspwQ2wyuUU\n\nTaking live questions from the YT live chat!

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:17 {Did Jesus Consider the OT to be Scripture?} You said in a past Q&A session that Jude references Enoch, and your best explanation is that it's just to make a point, not to say that Enoch is canon or inerrant. But that's also my conclusion about when Jesus refers to the Old Testament. Isn’t it the same for when Jesus refers to the Old Testament?\n2. 5:18 {If I Don’t Read Scripture, am I Still Accountable?} Romans 1:8-2: 16…Responsibility? I'm afraid to read/not read the Scriptures. So I read/don't read, sometimes feeling physically ill/deeply anxious/even empty. Is it normal to feel like this?\n3. 10:16 {Discussing a Confusing Verse} What are your thoughts about Matthew 26: 13? You taught earlier that this specific action is not even recorded in all the Gospels, so what does Jesus mean?\n4. 13:42 {How did OT Punishments Display God’s Love?} What was the point of capital punishment in OT, which was way too harsh to the point that it was not strictly followed back then? How does it display God's love when people are killed for not obeying?\n5. 22:19 {Reconciling Two Verses} How does Ecclesiastes 9:4-6 reconcile with Paul’s statement that “to live is Christ and to die is gain”? Am I misreading it?\n6. 27:01 {Overcoming Condemnation/Embracing God’s Grace} I have a good understanding of God’s Love and forgiveness in my head, but I have trouble living as though I believe it in my heart, and I still feel condemned at times (1 John 4: 16-18). Any advice?\n7. 32:36 {About Paul’s Thorn in the Flesh} What is your opinion on Paul's thorn in the flesh? I heard it was his eyes, maybe from his encounter on the road to Damascus? 1) He had Luke, a doctor, with him during his travels 2) He had others write his letters.\n8. 40:00 {How to “Walk in the Spirit”} From Galatians 5, what is does it mean to “walk in the Spirit”? And do you have any pastoral advice for a new disciple on this subject?\n9. 47:46 {Difference: Doubt vs. Unbelief} What is the difference biblically between doubt & unbelief? Are either of them a sin?\n10. 52:48 {How is the Holy Spirit Received?} How does receiving the Holy Spirit work? In Acts, there are two times the HS is poured out: Jews (Ch. 2) and then Gentiles (Ch. 10), but every other time is passed by laying on of hands (Acts 8: 14-18, 19:6, etc.).\n11. 56:27 {Advice for a Difficult College Situation} I have to read “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” for school, but Oprah did a movie on it. Since she denied that Jesus is the only way, I don’t know if I should drop the class. Thoughts?\n12. 58:24 {About the Timing of our Death} Are our deaths appointed to us in both time and manner? If a person dies being hit by a car on the corner of Times Square, was it always going to end that way?\n13. 1:02:20 {How to Handle Online-Only Congregants} How should churches handle their local online only congregants? This is a big dilemma in my church's leadership right now. (Let's assume that it is safe to return to in-person church.)\n14. 1:04:13 {About the “Day of the Lord”} What is the day of the Lord?\n15. 1:06:16 {Was Jesus Created? Answering JWs} How would you respond to a JW who says that Revelation 3: 14 proves that Jesus was created when it says He is the “beginning of Creation”?\n16. 1:09:48 {Using Apologetics to Reach Friends} How do you recommend bringing up apologetics with unbelieving friends?\n17. 1:12:48 {Are Non-Believers Morally Superior?} How should I respond to the attitude of, “So-and-so is moral without a belief in God -  therefore, they are better than someone who needs religion to be good”?\n18. 1:17:30 {Can Preaching the Truth Harden Hearts?} What is a Christian’s role to speak truth on cultural issues to non-Christian society? Just preach good news & individual hearts get changed? It seems like preaching against homosexuality hardens hearts.\n19. 1:24:48 {Is Receiving Imputed Righteousness Just?} How/why can our sins be imputed to Jesus? I'm confused about the \"transfer.\" If God is just, how can He let someone else step in for our sin? And how valid is the sacrifice if He was going to rise again?\n20. 1:31:28 {Is God the Branch, or the Vine?} A few times in the OT, Jesus is referred to as the Branch (Zechariah 3:8, 6: 12, Jeremiah 23:5). Why then is He referred to as the Vine and us the branches in John 15:5?\n\nTaking live questions from the YT live chat! Every Friday at 1pm Pacific time.

    "description": "They tell me that the internet is where religion goes to die but they also tell me the internet is full of poor research and unreasonable arguments.\n\nWe are going to get pretty technical today. Lots of different threads of evidence will be explained and drawn together to support the factuality of the burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimathea. This may seem like it's not big deal if you haven't recognized the evidential value of the burial and empty tomb for the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus.

    "description": "0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:19 {Church Leader Living in Sin? Letter vs. Spirit} I am a young adult, still living in my parents' home. My father is the pastor of our small church. One of my siblings has leadership roles, but is living in sin (cohabitation). My father has talked with him, but hasn't taken any biblical action to remove him from leadership or from church. The elders don't see a need to do anything either. What should I do? (I'm the youngest and a daughter.) I was told I was taking the letter of the law instead of the spirit of the law.\n2. 10:33 {About John the Baptist being Jesus’ Cousin} Is it a big deal that John the Baptist was Jesus' cousin? I haven't heard this talked about much; wouldn't that mean that they knew each other when they were kids/before their ministries?\n3. 16:30 {About the Early Church & Socialism} Should Christians be living like the early Church in a sort of voluntary Socialism as found in Acts 2: 42-47 and Acts 4: 32-37?\n4. 27:03 {MW’s Personal Experience Witnessing} Could you share your most memorable experience in leading someone to the Lord?\n5. 30:08 {About Recent “Deconstruction” Stories} I find myself sympathizing with some who have deconstructed and walked away from the faith (though I don't agree with their decision). How can I keep from deconstructing myself?\n6. 41:08 {Is Yahweh Only the Father’s Name?} Some people I know say Yahweh is the name of the whole Trinity combined. I thought Yahweh was only the name of the Father (like how Jesus is the name of the Son). What are your thoughts?\n7. 47:13 {About Artaxerxes in Ezra} Are there two Artaxerxes in Ezra, or could it be that there is an interlude in Ezra 4:5-23? Artaxerxes stopped the building, but later seems to endorse it.\n8. 48:10 {Are the Church and Israel the Same?} Are the church and Israel the same or different? Is the church the continuation of Israel and heirs of the promises of God to OT Israel?\n9. 50:53 {Can Christians Attend JW Weddings?} Is it ok to attend a wedding of a Jehovah’s Witness? My colleague is a JW and she is getting married in 3 weeks. I was wondering if it’s ok for me to attend because of the belief system.\n10. 52:35 {How to Have Godly Sorrow Over Sin} How do you have a godly sorrow over sin (2 Corinthians 7: 10)? When I sin, I repent, feel really bad, and ask for forgiveness, but eventually fall for the same sin again. Do you just pray for God to give godly sorrow?\n11. 59:44 {About Approving of/Watching Inappropriate Shows} How do you respond to another Christian who thinks that watching movies or shows with nudity/sexual content is a liberty they have in Christ because they do not struggle with lust?\n12. 1:06:35 {Interpreting a Difficult Verse} I’ve read two different views on 1 John 3: 20. 1: If our heart condemns us, how much more will God since He is greater than our heart? 2: Even though we feel guilty, God knows our heart. Thoughts?\n13. 1:11:04 {What does Ecumenical Mean?} I'd rather not identify myself with any particular denomination. What does it mean to be an ecumenical Christian?\n14. 1:13:46 {Some Great Wisdom for Us} What’s the greatest lesson of wisdom you’ve learned as you’ve matured in your faith?\n15. 1:16:06 {About Believer/Non-Believer Relationships} What should a new Christian do if he or she has been in a relationship for 7+ years with a non-Christian (not married), and the non-Christian doesn't slow down the spiritual growth of the Christian?\n16. 1:19:36 {Is it Fair that Some People are Born in Unbelieving Areas?} How is it just that because a person is born in a specific region in the world, that they are more likely to follow the traditions and religion they are raised in and end up going to hell?\n17. 1:24:17 {Is the Fire Mentioned in 2 Peter Literal?} In 2 Peter 3: 10 it says that on the \"Day of the Lord\" God will destroy the world and \"its elements\" with fire. Is this a literal or figurative fire, and why?\n18. 1:27:06 {Did Jesus’ Family Believe?} Did Jesus' family not believe in Him as Messiah?\n19. 1:32:02 {About “Rhema” (Sword of the Spirit)} Can you explain the Greek word Rhema in Ephesians 6 when it talks about the “sword of the Spirit is the Word of God?” Is it Scripture, or like a word of wisdom, knowledge, or prophecy?\n20. 1:35:34 {Who was the 4th Person in the Furnace in Daniel 3?} Referring to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Daniel, who was the fourth person in the furnace? Is this OT evidence of Christ?\n\nHere's that video on Christophanies (times when Jesus actually shows up) in the Old Testament https://youtu.be/1CDOSbzd6Uk\n\nThe BibleThinker mugs can be found here. $5 per mug will go toward to support different ministries I choose.

    "description": "This matters. These lies are being absorbed by youth in our culture and they are breaking their ability to think rationally and biblically faithfully. \n\n0:00 Intro\n1:12 If I feel it, it must be true\n14:38 Follow your heart\n26:45 Love is affirming everything I feel\n35:25 Faith is the opposite of knowledge\n46:44 Humans are the product of blind, unguided, evolution\n57:59 You are the one you've been waiting for\n1:08:24 A good God wouldn't judge\n\nI HIGHLY recommend that parents check out Elizabeth's foundation worldview curriculum. It's a really good tool to train your kids (and yourself while you are at it) in how to think biblically about things. Since your kids are being exposed to worldly and unbiblical thinking all the time they are very likely to simply absorb it and assimilate it if they aren't given the tools to reason through the issues well. This is where Elizabeth's project comes in. You can have your kids do these classes once a week from home whenever it's convenient for you. I'm not making ANYTHING for telling you this. I think this is just a really needful program for Christian families in modern times. I know life is crazy busy for parents but I think this is one of those things that's worth your time and is really underpriced for the benefit it brings.\n\nHere is where you can learn more and sign up. https://foundationworldview.com/ \nMake sure to watch the video to hear what the coupon code is for 10% off!\n\nMy website, with the NEW search features that help you find exactly what you're looking for. https://BibleThinker.org",

I recently had a lot of problems within my church about this.\n5. 5:24 {About the “Three that Testify”} Can you shed some light on 1 John 5: 16-17?\n6. 8:36 {About Freedom from the Law} When Paul says we're saved by grace apart from the works of the law, is he referring only to the Law of Moses, or the moral law, as well?\n7. 13:44 {About Gematria & Numerology} In light of today’s first question, how do you account for more subtle/compelling examples of Gematria such as JESUS (IESOUS in Greek) calculating to \"888\"? Contrast with \"666.” 8=new life, etc.\n8. 15:28 {About “The Passion of the Christ”} As a Christian, is The Passion of The Christ film OK to watch, and is it biblical?\n9. 19:27 {About Ezekiel & OT Prophecies} What does Ezekiel 40-48 mean for us? What about OT prophecies about future sacrifices?\n10. 22:28 {About the Doxology in Scripture} How should we make sense of the Doxology at the end of The Lord's Prayer in some English Bibles when it doesn't occur in earlier manuscripts? Should we not use it?\n11. 25:01 {What does it Mean that God has a Plan?} I always hear \"God has a plan for your life.\" What does this mean? Is this about salvation, gifting/calling, or about God's overall will for believers? Is this specific or general?\n12. 29:55 {About Graven Images & Biblical Actors} Could you explain Exodus 20:4? Is God stating we shouldn’t have any images at all, like the images we see of Jesus in churches? And what about the people who portray Jesus in biblical movies?\n13. 34:25 {How to Respond to Unbiblical Statements} I was wondering of a kind way to correct people who just say \"God just wants me to be happy.”\n14. 37:00 {Can Disobedience Thwart God’s Promises?} If God gives us a promise, could His promise be dependent on our obedience, and could we veto a promise either by our actions or by our unwillingness to receive? Please elaborate on Romans 4:13-15.\n15. 40:00 {About the Perpetual Virginity of Mary} What are your thoughts on the Protoevangelium of James? Does it support the perpetual virginity of Mary?\n16. 43:39 {About the phrase “Son of Perdition”} What is the Greek meaning of “Son of Perdition”? Is it a specific person, or a general statement?\n17. 47:04 {Should Atheist Arguments Concern Us?} Should we be concerned about counterarguments that atheists and skeptics present to our faith? \n18. 49:30 {Is “Praying the Gay Away” Biblical?} Is “praying the gay away” wrong? It seems biblical to me.\n19. 53:45 {Am I Rightly or Wrongly Judging?} How do I know if I have a judgmental attitude toward someone or an honest concern about their sin?\n20. 54:56 {About the Woman Caught in Adultery Passage} It's said that the story from John 7: 53 to 8: 11 isn't found in the earlier manuscripts. It's one of my favorite pictures of God's grace. What do you think about how we should deal with this?\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

Are certain numbers in Scripture intended by God to carry hidden theological significance for us to find, or is this a man-made and potentially dangerous thing to look for while studying?\n2. 14:48 {About our Future Glorified Bodies} Will we still have scars and such in our new bodies? Like when Jesus was resurrected, He still had His crucifixion marks.

    "description": "It will be helpful for us to look at the account of the women finding the tomb of Jesus empty with fresh eyes. When we consider how embarrassing it was in 1st century culture to rely upon women witnesses, how important the idea of Jesus being physically raised was and how impactful the claim of the empty tomb was, we find that what we have here is remarkable evidence for the trustworthiness of the Gospel accounts of women finding the tomb of Jesus empty after He was buried there. Add this to the rest of the evidence for the resurrection of Christ and the case is quite powerful. What was considered and embarrassing fact of history back then is a wonderful piece of evidence from a modern historiographical perspective. In other words, it's true.\n\nThis is part 66 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark. Today we are in Mark 15:40-16:8.\n\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nIf you want to see the problem with anti-miracle bias in scholarship as well as online skeptic communities then I highly recommend this very entertaining and enlightening video by David Wood. \"Scooby-Doo and the Case of the Silly Skeptic\"  https://youtu.be/YrGVeB_SPJg\n\nI have live videos Mondays and Fridays at 1pm Pacific Time.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 40)",
    "description": "0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:36 {Should Repetitive Bible Passages Concern Us?} I'm very confused about why Psalms 14 & 53 are almost identical. Is this an error in Scripture? Are any other pairs of psalms also duplicate? This is causing me to worry about the reliability of Scripture. Please help me understand this!\n2. 11:07 {How to Connect Deeply with God} I struggle deeply with feeling the presence of a relationship with God. I believe I am saved, but I had wandered far and often during my youth. To this day, I try to \"imagine\" my relationship with God, but I still feel estranged (mostly I think because of sinfulness). I am desperate for that deep, living connection to the Father. What can I do to get connected in relationship with Him?\n3. 15:34 {More Miracles than Jesus?} Often, John 14:12-14 is used by “word of faith” preachers that I used to listen to. Their claim is that we are to do the same and more of the miracles that Jesus did. How should I see these verses?\n4. 22:28 {Is Common Sense an Argument for God?} Some weeks ago you said you believed common sense is the best argument for God. Can you elaborate?\n5. 26:27 {About Jupiter in the Bible} In Acts 19:35 where it says “the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter,” is this referring to the planet Jupiter, and did they know of other planets in that period of time?\n6. 29:15 {Are the Son & Spirit Extensions of the Father?} What would you say to people who say that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are mere extensions of the one God, the Father?\n7. 33:29 {What is a Biblical Perspective on Anointing for Today?} Can you explain “anointing” in the Bible and what the NT application is for believers? I've heard phrases like \"That song/speaker is anointed\" or \"the anointing is in the room.\" Is this correct?\n8. 38:00 {About Elijah & Enoch} About John 3:13 KJV - Where did Elijah & Enoch go? Elijah appeared at the mountain of transfiguration…where did he come from?\n9. 43:02 {Private Convos w/Pilate and the Resurrection} In John 18 from verse 33, Jesus & Pilate share private conversations inside his residence without any of Jesus’ followers being present. How would the disciples know what was said? Did He tell his disciples post resurrection, proving that the resurrection is TRUE? \n10. 46:43 {Do Punishments Get Passed Down?} Does God punish children for the sins of their fathers?\n11. 48:51 {About Adoption Outside of Marriage} Is it biblically wrong to adopt a child before marriage when you know you want to marry? And what about adopting a child if you don't intend to marry?\n12. 51:46 {Can Non-Believers Bear Fruit?} Can a non-believer bear the fruit of the Spirit? (Matthew 7:17) How can this be, and is it an argument in favor of secular morality?\n13. 56:27 {How to be a “Peacemaker”} What is a peacemaker? How controversial can we be, and can we push back? Does it matter how loving we look when the world looks at love differently?\n14. 1:01:25 {How to “Work out our Salvation”} I read a commentary on Philippians 2:12 and it was implied that salvation is not complete, what does that mean? Are we not fully saved?\n15. 1:05:28 {Clinging to Hope in Tough Circumstances} My husband had a vasectomy before we got together.  I used to be WOF and \"claimed\" a baby but now know that movement is heretical. Is it dumb to still believe in having a baby?\n16. 1:07:13 {Is Covid God’s Plan, or From the Enemy?} Some pastors say the Coronavirus is God's plan. Others say it's a scourge of the Enemy. How do we rationalize these two views when both come from pastors you trust and admire?\n17. 1:09:31 {About Holiness, Faithfulness, & Faith} Are holiness and faithfulness as important as having Faith? It's my position that they are. I just want a fresh perspective.\n18. 1:12:09 {About John the Baptizer/Baptist’s Salvation} Was John the Baptizer born saved? Luke 1: 15 says he would be filled with the Holy Spirit \"even from his mother's womb.”\n19. 1:16:26 {How to Tell Which Verses Apply to Us} I'm confused about how to know whether a verse is for me or not. I see devotional books where they pluck out a verse, and I never know if it is for us now or not.\n20. 1:19:06 {About the Textus Receptus} In one of your videos you said how the Textus Receptus came from the King James and not the other way around, I haven’t been able to find info on that and was hoping you could clarify.\n\n3 videos I did on how Bible manuscripts don't all agree it's no big deal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WclIZwBFhq0&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuzJhPtmrgqpVoXhjvqiIjW\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

I spent years writing one to my wife and it still doesn't work. Looking for examples to follow.\n2. 6:00 {About Jude Quoting Enoch} How do you explain Jude’s apparent quote of the book of Enoch in verses 14-15?\n3. 9:14 {Was Jesus Dead for Three Days?} According to Matthew 12: 40, Jesus predicted He would be dead for 3 days. But according to Mathew 28:1 and Mark 16:9, it seems this wasn’t the case. Thoughts?\n4. 14:50 {About Confession of Sins to Others} Is apologizing to people we’ve sinned against (e.g. lust) always necessary, and if so, to what extent? We must if they know about it, but what if they don't (or are indifferent/hard to contact)?\n5. 17:28 {How to Combat Intrusive Thoughts} As a new Christian, I’m constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts, including blasphemous ones. I feel guilty sometimes and I wonder if it's me thinking these things. How can I combat this?\n6. 20:59 {About Apologetics being Used in Fiction} How effective do you believe apologetics can be done in works of fiction (like Narnia) rather than just straight arguments? Should there be more of it?\n7. 23:27 {About the 24 Elders} Who are the 24 elders? They are not mentioned in the creation account. Are they a collection of people such as Enoch, Moses, etc.?\n8. 28:54 {Understanding a Difficult Verse} Can you please explain Matthew 10:34-39 where Jesus says a man’s household will be his enemy?\n9. 34:10 {Can we Only Attend Smaller Groups?} I’m an introvert and have never felt comfortable at large Bible studies with people I don’t know. Do I have to enjoy large group studies? Is it OK to stick to small studies with one or two others?\n10. 36:34 {About Evangelism & Guilt/Responsibility} If we don’t share the Gospel with our friends and family, is their blood on our hands?\n11. 40:18 {About Imputed Righteousness} Is imputed righteousness synonymous with forgiveness of sins? Or does God require more than just sinlessness (that is to say: a positive ascribed righteousness)?\n12. 44:00 {About Jesus Making Himself Eq. w/God} The Pharisees were wrong in much of what they did, so wouldn’t that mean they were also incorrect in thinking Jesus was trying to make Himself equal with God?\n13. 48:36 {About Jesus Descending to Hell” If someone believes Jesus had to suffer in Hell for three days after the crucifixion, could they truly be saved? Don't we need to believe it was all accomplished on the cross?\n14. 50:23 {Biblical Wisdom for a Tough Family Situation} My mother-in-law is in a gay marriage. My wife has shared the Gospel with her, but she rejects it. Lord willing, we'd like to have kids. Should there be boundaries between the kid/grandma relationship?\n15. 52:46 {About Aquinas’ Summa Theologica} Have you ever read or studied the work by St. Thomas Aquinas called \"Summa Theologica,\" and if so, what are your thoughts?\n16. 53:44 {About being “In Christ” in Paul’s Letters} In Paul’s prison letters, he uses the phrases “in him, in Christ, and in whom.” He seems to use these a lot in Ephesians 1, but also uses them in Philippians and Colossians. What does it mean?\n17. 58:13 {About Jesus being Truly Man} If Jesus was fully man and subject to time and space, how is John 21: 25 possible? Or is it hyperbole?\n18. 1:01:30 {How Can We Pray Constantly?} What are some practical ways to practice 1 Thessalonians 5:7? Trying to pray constantly can be draining & discouraging because it feels like there are only so many things I can pray over.\n19. 1:07:25 {About the Year of Jesus’ Birth} What year do you believe Jesus was born, and how do you reconcile it with the majority consensus of Herod's death in 4 B.C.?\n20. 1:09:44 {Is Lying Ever OK in Rare Circumstances?} What does the Bible say about lying to protect someone? Like if my brother breaks a vase and I say the dog broke it, or if I take the blame for something I didn’t do?\n\n~ Bonus surprise! 1:15:42\n\nHere’s that video on supposed Bible contradictions.

    "description": "Time Stamp Map\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:11 About BibleThinker\n2. 2:46 What is baptism, what does it do, and what does it declare?\n3. 5:23 Is baptism purely a symbol, or is there something spiritual that happens when a person is baptized? Does baptism affect salvation?\n4. 6:35 When a person makes a profession of faith, should they be baptized right away, or should there be a waiting period for their leaders to observe their conduct before allowing them to be baptized?\n5. 8:02 Is pedo-baptism (infant baptism) biblical? And is it biblical to draw a parallel between circumcision and baptism?\n6. 13:51 When studying Scripture, what is the difference between a descriptive text and a prescriptive text?\n7. 14:55 Time stamp #5 continued (circumcision vs. baptism)\n8. 16:09 What does the New Testament say is the parallel we should draw from the Old Testament practice of circumcision?\n9. 18:14 What passages of Scripture do pedo-baptists refer to in support of their belief?\n10. 24:22 What is the difference between infant baptism and infant dedication?\n11. 26:00 Even though baptism isn't salvific, is there any harm in baptizing infants just as a blessing? And do some people believe infants can, in fact, have saving faith already? How can we respond to that claim?\n12. 30:53 What happens to infants when they die? Are baptized infants more likely to go to Heaven?\n13. 32:11 Refuting the most powerful argument commonly used to defend infant baptism\n14. 44:59 Should believers now who were baptized as an infant be re-baptized after truly coming to saving faith in Christ?\n15. 49:10 Is it correct to baptize \"in the name of Jesus,\" or \"in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\"? And should a person be re-baptized if a different formula was used during their baptism?\n16. 53:56 Who can baptize people?\n17. 59:00 Closing thoughts\n\nI did this interview 3 years ago on The Remnant Radio program.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference: \n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:43 {Why does John and Other Passages Not Mention Repentance?} If repentance is required to be saved, why is it not mentioned in the Gospel of John and other evangelical texts like Acts 16: 31 and Romans 10? Can repentance be somewhat synonymous with belief?\n2. 10:41 {About Orthodox Beliefs} What do Orthodox Christians believe vs. Protestants? Is their doctrine as problematic as Catholic doctrine? (I heard Hank Hanegraaf converted to it.)\n3. 15:43 {About the Greek in Bible Translations} Pastors often say, \"what the Greek REALLY says is…\" Why don't translators use the Greek that pastors cite in sermons then? (Like how Peter is akin to pebble but is translated as rock.)\n4. 19:41 {Explanation of Ezekiel 14 – Prophets} In Ezekiel 14:9 it says if a prophet is deceived, it’s the Lord who deceived him. Could you offer some explanation to this verse, as it seems out of character for God?\n5. 25:38 {About Saving Faith in the OT} Romans 4 tells us that Abraham was saved because of his faith. He believed in God. How can we say that just because he was saved that way, everyone else in the OT was saved that way? Also, if they were saved that way, why did they have to sacrifice lambs? And if people were always saved by just believing in God, why was it necessary for Christ to come?\n6. 31:15 {Fruit of the Spirit – Longsuffering} Could you please explain what longsuffering means, in regard to the fruit of the Spirit?\n7. 32:40 {Is All of Scripture Inspired?} When Paul says, \"I say, not the Lord but I...\" in 1 Corinthians 7: 12, does that mean that portion of Scripture was not inspired? \n8. 36:12 {Assurance of God’s Love & Salvation} Does God really love me, and am I really saved? I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, but I am still sinful and I struggle with sin. However, it seems that God answers my prayers. Am I really saved?\n9. 39:47 {Has Mankind always only had One Spirit?} What are your views that God only created one spirit and gave it to Adam which was then passed through generations? This explains how God doesn’t create an impure spirit at birth, or generational curse.\n10. 42:44 {About Witnessing and Exemplifying Christ} My husband isn’t open to hearing me speak truth, so I have stopped correcting him. Is this a sin?? If he dies, he will go to hell.\n11. 45:00 {Promises vs. Prophecies} Is there a difference between a promise and a prophecy? Are all God's promises prophecies? Am I responsible if a prophecy told about me doesn't come to pass? A church leader told me these things.\n12. 47:54 {How to Be Kind when it’s Difficult} What specific actions can one who has no empathy do to be kind? (Thinking 1 Corinthians 13 \"kind.\")\n13. 50:27 {Help with Marital Conflict} I feel led by God to homeschool my teens. My husband disagrees. He doesn't want them to be sheltered. I want to submit, but I’m conflicted. Thoughts?\n14. 53:13 {“Free Grace” Theology, Faith, & Works} Free grace theology says that \"save\" in James 2: 14 means from physical death or harm. All uses of the word “save” in James 2: 14 are in the context of physical harm, so why is this different for you in 2: 14?\n15. 57:31 {When is Kissing Sinful?} Is all kinds of romantic kissing outside of marriage a sin? Could a Christian actor/actress do a kissing scene?\n16. 1:00:28 {Do Jew. & Gent. Christians Worship Together?} I’m an ethnically Jewish Christian and have seen that some believe that Jewish & Gentile Christians worship together, but with different lifestyle callings. This has been stressful. Input?\n17. 1:03:25 {Did God Promote Adultery in Genesis?} In Genesis 38:7-10, Someone was commanded to lay with his brother’s wife and impregnate her. He didn’t impregnate her, and the Lord struck him down. Is God promoting adultery?\n18. 1:07:35 {How to Tell if Repentance is Genuine} How can we know if we have genuinely repented from our sins?\n19. 1:09:45 {How to Respond to Disrespect} How do you respond to a brother or sister that disrespects you?\n20. 1:11:41 {About “Friends by Unrighteous Wealth” in Luke} What does Jesus mean when He says to make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth in Luke 16:9?\n\nHere's my study on why repentance is part of the gospel message. https://youtu.be/U_Iz1UYqCfA\n\nHere’s the video on how Jews and Gentiles are counseled on obeying the law in the book of Acts. https://youtu.be/mI5wiDTHpgE\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "title": "The Jewishness of Passover Refutes Transubstantiation",
    "description": "After this interview I was thinking about the possibility of other examples where Jesus uses a present physical object in a purely symbolic sense and I think we do have some. When Jesus spoke to the woman at the well He told her that she should ask Him for water, and while there was physical water present the real point Jesus is making is that she needs non-physical water which is representative of new life in the Holy Spirit. Jesus also manifested bread for the crowd but told them that this was food that perishes and they need food that gives everlasting life. He goes on to show that this food is belief in Jesus. Even in the favorite passage for those who promote transubstantiation (John 6) Jesus adds the clarity/commentary that the flesh profits nothing and the Spirit gives life. This is not merely saying the word \"spirit\" means \"symbolism\"; rather it is saying that \"spirit\" is not \"flesh\" and cannot be interpreted to mean \"my physical body being eaten by you\". A whole lot more can and should be said about all this but I hope that the above answer will be seen as offering strong support simply for the fact that the Jewish context of the Last Supper is such that we should conclude symbolic meaning in the act and not transubstantiation. \n\nThis is just one question from a long interview I did for the moderators of the r/Bible subreddit.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:11 {About the “5-Fold Ministry”} Have you heard of the \"5-Fold Ministry\" way of thinking about apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers exercising those gifts today? And if so, what are your thoughts about it?\n2. 12:40 {When does Competition become Unbiblical?} The Bible stresses the importance of unity within the body of Christ. When does competition among believers (even seemingly friendly competition - games, sports, etc.) become unhealthy?\n3. 16:21 {What is “Fundamental Christianity”?} Can you define \"Fundamental Christianity\" for me? Recently I've been seeing it referred to as a negative thing. Is it?\n4. 20:48 {Why do Animals Die or Become Extinct?} If “the wages of sin is death,” why do animals die? (My question also involves the extinction of the dinosaurs - why would God create them to be exterminated?)\n5. 26:51 {Using the Morality Argument} If using the morality argument, how would you respond to an unbeliever that uses the objection that morality is subjective and there is no real objective right or wrong?\n6. 32:30 {About Feeling Angry toward God} When someone is angry at God, are they able to bring that to God, or do they wait until they are not angry and then go to God? Do we have to be 100% before talking with God, as to not disrespect Him?\n7. 38:55 {About John 15 – Bearing Fruit} What do you think of the view that states that in John 15, Jesus actually said in Greek that those who don't bear fruit are lifted up instead of cut off? Is this us practicing bad Greek?\n8. 42:45 {About Gratitude in the Midst of Hardship} When I was an atheist, I got depressed and actually planned to end my life to escape all its struggles. I now know God exists, but I can’t be grateful for being created. How do I repent from that?\n9. 47:23 {Should Prayer be a Dialogue or Monologue?} About prayer, I’ve heard many people say that praying to God should be more of a dialogue than a monologue. Isn’t the Lord’s Prayer spoken by Jesus a monologue? How should we pray then?\n10. 50:19 {About Leaving a Church} Is it necessary to ask your church to remove your name from its records if you are leaving due to false teaching/beliefs? I wonder if that’s what God means when He says “come out of her.”\n11. 53:24 {About 1 Kings 13} In 1 Kings 13, what are we supposed to learn from this passage? It seems as though the prophet lied to the man of God, tricking him so that he wouldn’t stay the course. Why lead him into this trap?\n12. 1:02:44 {About the 1st Resurrection – Revelation} Will all believers partake of the first resurrection, or only those who have been beheaded in the name of Christ? Revelation 20:4\n13. 1:04:59 {About Matthew 27 – Holy People Raised} Can you please explain Matthew 27: 51-53? Hoping to get some clarity about the holy people raised to life. Where did they go? Did they die again?\n14. 1:09:19 {About “Divine Simplicity”} Do you believe in divine simplicity? If so, how do you reconcile it with the Trinity?\n15. 1:11:40 {Did the Covid Mandates Involve a Spiritual Battle?} A lot of believers seemed to believe the Church was being persecuted by being required to wear masks, meet in smaller groups, etc. Was a spiritual battle being waged in the Covid mandates?\n16. 1:13:51 {About being Used by God in our Lives} I see others being used by God, and I want to be used too. Because of this, I often struggle with envy, jealousy, & comparison. How would you encourage & help me grow past this sin?\n17. 1:18:27 {About the Death of our Pets} My cat died this week. Where did he go?\n18. 1:22:03 {How Should we Study Other Religions?} Do you have any recommendations for studying other religions and how to approach others with the intention to evangelize? I am particularly interested in Islam.\n19. 1:25:00 {Comparing Bible Verses – The Ark} How can you explain Isaiah 66: 22-23 to be understood, alongside Revelation 11: 19 (the 10 words are in the ark currently), if Colossians 2: 16 speaks of the weekly Sabbath being abolished?\n20. 1:29:00 {Wrestling with Doubts} I've studied the evidence for Christianity & it's amazing. But I struggle with doubts of “what if I'm wrong?” Does this affect my salvation? Will God help me?\n\nHere's my study on \"Dealing With Doubt\" from Psalm 73 https://youtu.be/NqRYPAIsDQs\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "description": "On one side we have skeptics who want to easily dismiss much of the biblical account of Jesus' crucifixion. On the other side we have \"progressive Christian\" teachers who want to take away essential theological truths about the meaning of the cross of Christ. I'm tackling all of that today. I find it genuinely intimidating to be speaking on the topic of the death of our Lord, since I don't know how any man could do true justice to the glory and horror of the cross, but I pray that God uses this to bless you and draw you closer to Him. \n\nThis is part 64 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark.

    "description": "0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:10 {Regrets about Not Sharing the Gospel} My father recently died, and I don’t think he was a true Christian. I’ve been a Christian for 7 months and I didn’t share the Gospel with him. Would things have gone differently if I did?\n2. 7:03 {Witnessing to Mormon Family Members} I'm a Christian who is married to a non-practicing Mormon who still bases his beliefs on LDS doctrine. I think I want to go into apologetics (largely inspired by you), but I don't think my husband will approve. I also feel called to evangelize my Mormon in-laws, but I struggle to get past their feelings-based testimony and their beliefs about who Jesus is and salvation. Any advice on my apologetic aspirations in my specific circumstances, and on the best way to surmount these LDS hurdles?\n3. 12:45 {How do we Meditate on Scripture?} I was wondering: how do you remember Scripture? I will read in the morning, and by the time night/the next day comes, I forget what I read. I know we’re to meditate on it, but how do we do this?\n4. 15:26 {How to Pray for our Leaders} I find it very difficult to pray for the current administration. I know they need it desperately. How do I overcome this struggle?\n5. 19:06 {Is “Deliverance” for Today?} Is deliverance for today? Should we be praying for each other to be set free from demonic bondage in our lives, along with seeking medical assistance and counseling where needed?\n6. 25:51 {About Pastor/Elder Qualifications} How literally should we follow the \"qualifications\" for pastors/elders in 1 Timothy and Titus?\n7. 31:10 {Can a Christian Marry a Non-Christian?} Is it OK for a Christian to marry a non-Christian like a Buddhist, atheist, or Muslim? And what if they already have children? How would you counsel the Christian?\n8. 35:07 {About Married Couples in Heaven} Does Luke 20: 27-36 teach that people who are married on Earth won't be married anymore in Heaven? I feel sad that my husband and I might not be together still in Heaven.\n9. 39:20 {About the Lord’s Supper during Covid} In my church, holy communion is postponed because of the measures surrounding Covid. Drinking from one cup is not possible. To justify this, they use Joshua 5:1-8. Is this biblical reasoning?\n10. 45:06 {Will God Understand if I Hide my Faith?} I’m an ex-Muslim who became a Christian in 2020 and I have secretly been Christian but I still have to do Muslim practices. Will God understand that I have to keep it a secret?\n11. 50:49 {Can we Truly Feel God’s Presence?} Todd Friel (Wretched Radio) said “The Bible doesn’t teach that we can feel God’s presence” and the “warm fuzzies” are only an emotional response when our minds receive biblical truth. Is this true?\n12. 57:28 {Can we Compare Jesus & the Tree of Life?} What's your view on the comparison between Jesus and the Tree of Life? It came to me in a dream, and I googled it and found that it was exclusively an Orthodox belief.\n13. 59:50 {What did Paul Do before his Missionary Work?} 11 years went by from the time Paul was saved ‘til his first missionary journey - I always thought it was only a few months. What did Paul do during those 11 years other than fasting and praying?\n14. 1:00:34 {Are a Person’s Days Determined?} Job 14:5 says a person's days are determined, yet in Isaiah 38, God extends Hezekiah’s life. It almost seems that with enough prayer & faith, we can persuade God to change His mind. Thoughts?\n15. 1:04:32 {Will we receive Glorified Bodies AND Minds?} We know that we will eventually gain glorified bodies, but what about glorified minds? Will someone who suffers from a mental disorder (like Down’s Syndrome) be “healed”?\n16. 1:07:00 {Encouragement when we feel Empty} I struggle with emotional emptiness, abandonment issues, & having low self-worth. This makes my walk hard because my cup is always empty. God won’t answer my prayers. Any advice?\n17. 1:11:36 {About Giving Everything for the Lord} Can you better explain Luke 14: 33 where Jesus tells the crowd, “So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions”?\n18. 1:15:29 {In Defense of Sola Scriptura} What is your understanding of 2 Thessalonians 2: 15, as many Orthodox Christians point to this as evidence of the legitimacy of traditions that are not explicitly written in Scripture?\n19. 1:20:33 How is Isaiah 52-53 evidence for the Bible if most of the stuff in there is theology, and not testable historically?\n20. 1:25:02 What does your personal time with God look like, Mike? How do you differentiate it from your study time?\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "description": "Skeptics claim that Barabbas was invented by the Gospels for symbolic purposes. Skeptics say that Pilate would never have given in to the requests of the Jewish leaders to crucify Jesus. Skeptics say that Pilate would not have released prisoners, like Barabbas or Jesus, for the Passover feast. I'll be answering all that today! \nBut I have two other really important things to cover as well. One of them is the sad fact that the trial of Jesus before Pilate has been historically used to justify persecution of Jewish communities by those who name the name of Christ; the Jewish Messiah, ironically enough! The second issue is simply the point of the passage as it relates to the theology we are learning from the trial of Jesus. \n\nWhether you are joining me for the live stream or watching afterward I hope and pray that this will be a blessing to you and increase your confidence in the truth of Scripture and the love of God for all people. \n\nThis is part 63 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 35)",
    "description": "0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:13 {Adam Buried Beneath where Jesus Crucified?} I heard on a program by the National Geographic that there’s a belief out there that Adam was buried beneath where Jesus was crucified. They say when Jesus died, His blood flowed down into the ground and through some cracks inside a tomb where Adam was buried, and Adam was resurrected from that. I am trying to find out where this belief even started, why it was started, and if there is any Biblical or Historical evidence to suggest that this ever happened. Have you ever heard of this, and do you know of any resources on this subject that might help me?\n2. 6:04 {About Bribery in the book of Proverbs} Can you please help me and my friend understand Proverbs 21: 14 about bribery? We read the references below the verse but still find it hard to understand. \n3. 10:15 {Should I Attend a Calvinist Church?} The church that I currently attend is in search of a new pastor, and the one that will be voted in is a Calvinist. I don't agree with Calvinism and question if I can submit to his authority/teaching. What do I do? Stay? Go? I don't want to be divisive but want to stand on God's truth in love.\n4. 14:09 {Faith vs. Works Contradiction?} I’m confused on two verses, Romans 4:3 and James 2: 21. I don’t believe the Bible has any contradictions, can you please clear up my confusion on this?\n5. 22:51 {Is God Faithful when We’re Faithless?} Is 2 Timothy 2: 13 saying God is faithful to us, or to Himself? I hear people thanking God that when we are faithless, He is faithful to us, but it seems to read the opposite.\n6. 25:26 {About God’s Will in our Lives} How do I know if I am living in the will of God for my life? Do wrong choices mean we have messed up Gods plan and we’re now living plan B?\n7. 29:32 {About the Age of Accountability} Does Numbers 14: 29 give us any biblical reason to believe the age of accountability to be 20? In Numbers 14: 18-19 Moses pleads with God, and God pardons the sins of the children 19 and younger.\n8. 34:40 {About the Wedding Feast/Garments} The man who was at the wedding feast without a wedding garment in Matthew 22: 11, is he like what would called a nominal Christian?\n9. 41:48 {About Cohabitation Before Marriage} What Scripture shows that 2 heterosexual Christians who love each other and intend to marry can’t cohabitate if they are celibate?\n10. 46:18 {How to Honor an Abusive Parent} My father was physically and mentally abusive when I was a child. Can I stop talking to him and still be honoring him?\n11. 49:19 {About Assisted Suicide/Euthanasia} What are your thoughts about assisted suicide and euthanasia?\n12. 52:55 {Is the Holy Spirit Jesus’ Father?} Might be a dumb question but if the Holy Spirit came upon Mary so that Jesus could be born, wouldn't that make the Holy Spirit Jesus' father?\n13. 54:59 {About “Pascal’s Wager”} What is Pascal’s Wager, and do you believe that it has been refuted?\n14. 59:10 {About Revelation – New Names/White Stones} What is the \"new name\" in Revelation 2: 17? Is it the individual's new name that receives the white stone, or is it Jesus' new name?\n15. 1:01:28 {Should Pro-Life = Immigration Support?} Do you think that being pro-life means that I should also support immigration/refugee resettlement due to the pro-life belief that children should be taken care of regardless of circumstances?\n16. 1:04:40 {Can a False Teacher Cast Out Demons?} What is the deeper meaning of Matthew 12:22-28? I’m a little confused. Can a false teacher cast out demons? If so, wouldn't that be a kingdom that is divided against itself?\n17. 1:09:20 {Defense of the Trinity} Hi Mike! I fully believe in the Trinity due to ALL of Scripture. But 1 Corinthians 8:6 is a bit problematic and seems Unitarian. What do you make of it?\n18. 1:13:20 {Should our Shortcomings Discourage our Callings?} I believe I am called to be a pastor, but I have sin & inconsistencies in my life. Do you think this could mean I’m not called, or do I just need to work on these things before being used in that area?\n19. 1:14:24 {About our Prayers and Troubling Thoughts} When does God hear my prayers? I am asking you this because my thoughts are barely controllable nowadays, and those thoughts are causing me to pray very weird things and think about things I don’t want to think about.\n20. 1:19:09 {Infinite Universes?} Is the theory of an infinite amount of universes biblical or unbiblical? \n\nQ&A every Friday at 1pm pacific time.\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 34)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n\r1. 0:52 {Offering Counsel in Difficult Situations} I’m in a master's program with Liberty University for clinical mental health counseling. During our training, we were asked how we would handle certain difficult situations, such as if a LGBTQ couple would request help strengthening their relationship, or request help advocating for adoption rights, or advocating for trans. people. Can you please give me some biblical principles to follow, to help me counsel these people in a caring way without condoning unbiblical behavior?\n2. 11:14 {Advice for a Difficult Marriage} Any advice on how to help a brother in Christ (who's also a preacher) not leave his marriage because he's miserable and he claims \"God doesn't want him miserable\"?\n3. 19:19 {Refuting JW Theology} A Jehovah’s Witness said that all the letters in the NT addressed to saints are for the 144,000 (example: Romans 1:7). How do I show that a saint is a believer, and that the NT should be applied to everyone?\n4. 26:00 {Does Modalism Jeopardize Salvation?} Does modalism lead to other fallacies? If someone believes in Christ except they don’t believe that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each distinct, could their salvation be in jeopardy?\n5. 30:00 {Witnessing to Abuse Victims} A friend was sexually abused by her family including her mother, foster family, the school priests, and her first husband. Understandably, she refuses to believe in any God. How can I witness to her?\n6. 33:22 {Are man-made Covenants Biblical?} Are man-made covenants for pastoral ordination biblical (specifically, covenants binding oneself to denominational doctrines and principles)? The Salvation Army requires this for their pastors.\n7. 37:19 {Should Believers Expect to Hear/Feel God?} I have never \"felt\"/\"heard\" from the Holy Spirit/God. I believe in and follow Jesus, but I feel like I am missing something. Should a Christian be literally hearing/feeling something from God?\n8. 45:23 {About the Overcomers in Rev.} What are your thoughts on the overcomers mentioned by Jesus in Revelation 3:5-12? Would you consider these to be believers in general, a specific group of believers, or some other group?\n9. 50:47 {Do Angels Sing?} Do angels sing? Or is worshipping via singing something unique to humanity? Thank you so much for your ministry. It really is encouraging for me and my wife. How can we be praying for you and your family?\n10. 54:22 {Can we find Proof of Jesus’ Existence?} I heard there are more proofs that Jesus is a real person than there are for people like King Tut, etc. is this true? If so, is there somewhere I can go to find those proofs?\n11. 1:01:02 {Is Satan an Actual “being”?} What would you say to the brethren that suggest that Satan is not actually a being? People argue that the OT doesn’t describe him as a singular being but something of the human mind.\n12. 1:03:44 {Same Spirit but Different Opinions?} Discerning the Spirit: I’m having a hard time understanding how Christians are all supposed to have the same Holy Spirit but we are so divided on so many issues.\n13. 1:06:30 {Bible Contradiction?} Can you explain the what appears to be contradiction in 1 Kings 7: 26 and 2 Chronicles 4:5, due to the different numbers?\n14. 1:12:59 {Jesus’ Genealogy/Lineage} How historically plausible is it that the Jesus‘ genealogies in Matthew and Luke authentically trace back to the Exile, Kind David, Abraham, and so on?\n15. 1:16:02 {About Same-Sex Attraction} As a Side B/Celibate same-sex attracted Christian, do you believe God can change my attraction to eventually desire to marry a woman?\n16. 1:21:21 {Encouragement through Chronic Illness} I’m newly diagnosed with a very debilitating chronic illness. How do I continue to serve the Lord in my role as a wife and mother and serve the body of Christ? I’m very discouraged.\n17. 1:26:04 {Who was Lilith?} Do you know anything about Lilith? I heard some rumors that she was Adam’s first wife. I don’t believe this, but I wanted to hear if you have any thoughts on it.\n18. 1:27:36 {About Jesus’ Death & Resurrection} Why do you think Jesus appealed to His death and resurrection as His messianic sign in Matthew 12: 39-40?\n19. 1:30:41 {Are Concentration Meds o.k.?} What do you think about taking medications like Adderall?\n20. 1:35:02 {Are the Spirit and the “Logos” the Same?} Is there any justification for believing that the Spirit and the Logos aren't the same thing, and that the Logos was made flesh when all (instead of just a part) of God's Spirit was put in one man?\n\nQ&A every Friday at 1pm pacific time.\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "title": "How Jesus Used His Trial To Teach Christology: The Mark Series pt 62 (14:53-72)",
    "description": "Mark is one of the favorite books of skeptics of Christianity. They will sometimes say that it has \"low Christology\" (a low view of who Jesus was) and suggest that this is evidence that belief in the deity of Christ came not from Jesus and the apostles teachings but from other people \"developing\" Christianity afterward. Others will claim that orthodox Christian teaching about how Jesus died on the cross to suffer the just punishment of our sins so that we could be forgiven, as an atoning sacrifice, is an invention of Christians coming centuries after the time of Christ and the apostles.  One of the reasons I love the book of Mark is because a careful study of it shows that all of those claims are false. In today's study we will look at Jesus on trial before the high priest and we'll see that there are two major lessons that Jesus wants to teach everyone about the nature of the Messiah. The Messiah is divine and the Messiah must suffer and die for the sins of others. Not only do these two teachings refute how some have distorted the Gospel of Mark, these teachings are actually central to the whole Gospel. They come at the climax of Mark's message and they reveal that the divine nature and the atoning work of the Messiah are absolutely essential in the Gospel of Mark. \n\nI love this stuff!\n\nThis is part 62 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark. Today we are in chapter 14:53-72.\n \nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org\n\nI have live videos every Monday and Friday at 1pm Pacific Time.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:04 {The Gospel of Thomas} Do you have any thoughts about the \"Gospel of Thomas\"?\n2. 9:55 {Can Denominations Substitute Baptism?} Is it within biblical \"freedom\" for a denomination like the Salvation Army to replace water baptisms with wearing a uniform instead, and to not practice communion regularly, as well?\n3. 12:29 {Is God Truly Impartial?} How is God impartial when He makes some people with disabilities and some normal, when some people are born into abject poverty while some are born into riches, and gives some people a relatively easy life and others a miserable life?\n4. 18:10 {How Should we Define “Fruit”?} How do we practically use Matthew 7: 15-20 to discern? People often define fruit as whatever they’d like. Some call being “drunk in the Spirit” good fruit, some say telling people to repent is judgey and bad fruit.\n5. 25:55 {About being Born Again & Indwelling} Jesus said unless you are born again you cannot see the Kingdom of God.\" Does Luke 13: 28 imply that “born again” doesn't mean “indwelt by the Spirit” since that wasn't possible until Jesus came?\n6. 30:20 {Psalm 51 – Were Sacrifices Optional?} In Psalm 51: 16-17, it talks about God not wanting sacrifices/burnt offerings. Does this mean those were optional, or is it just talking about the person’s heart in giving?\n7. 36:56 {Bible Contradiction about Demon Possession?} In Luke 9:1, Jesus gives the twelve \"power and authority over all the demons.\" And in Luke 9: 40, a man tells Jesus the disciples could not cast out the demon possessing his son. Is this a contradiction?\n8. 40:17 {About the Book of Ezekiel} What are your thoughts and opinions on Ezekiel 38- 39, as well as what it may mean for us?\n9. 44:26 {Overcoming Alcoholism Biblically} How do you help a fellow Christian (including your spouse) deal and overcome alcoholism biblically?\n10. 50:48 {Why are Bystanders Sometimes Killed in Scripture?} Why were the families of people who broke the law like Achan killed with their families? Why were they not killed alone?\n11. 52:45 {Why Wasn’t Daniel w/Shad./Mesh./&Abed.?} Where was Daniel when the 3 Hebrew young men were thrown into the fire?\n12. 55:06 {How to Think Biblically about Exorcisms} I was wondering about how a modern Christian would deal with demonic activity. You only see in movies priests doing exorcisms, but what would a pastor do if this was happening today?\n13. 57:04 AND 1:20:59 {About William Webb’s Hermeneutics} What do you think of William Webb's \"Redemptive Movement\" model for hermeneutics? My pastor is embracing it, but it seems almost heretical to me.\n14. 57:42 {About Intercessory Prayer} Is intercessory prayer a spiritual gift, possibly within the spiritual gift of faith that Paul mentions in 1 Corinthians 12:9)? Any knowledge you have on intercessory prayer is appreciated!\n15. 1:01:23 {About Church Membership Classes} What are your thoughts on churches that require classes and interviews before becoming a member? I think we should be actively involved in a church, but it seems like steps that aren’t biblical.\n16. 1:04:33 {Witnessing to LDS Members} What's the best way to respond to LDS friends who say \"in the beginning\" means only the beginning of \"OUR world,\" and say then it's possible that Jesus was created before He created all things \"here\"?\n17. 1:08:41 {Overcoming Pornography / Accountability} I’m getting married in 2 weeks and am hit with doubts and worries that my struggle with porn will lead into my marriage. My fiancé knows about it. Do you have any advice?\n18. 1:12:10 {Would Jesus have Died of Old Age?} Since Jesus never sinned, would he NOT have died of old age eventually (if he hadn’t been crucified), or would he have?\n19. 1:14:34 {About the Mosaic Law} How would you explain 1 John 3:4 (sin is transgression of the law) to someone trying to convince you to follow the Mosaic Law? I have watched your Hebrew Roots videos and didn't see this addressed.\n20. 1:19:42 {Building Spiritual Intimacy} Do you have any tips on building spiritual intimacy with your spouse?\n\nQ&A every Friday at 1pm pacific time.\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:56 {Sharing the Gospel/Unsaved Loved Ones} How do you share the Gospel to people with unsaved loved ones who have already passed? (Accepting it to be true would mean accepting that their loved ones are in hell.)\n2. 6:31 {What does “Turn the Other Cheek” Mean?} In the Bible, it says to “turn the other cheek.” Does that mean no one is supposed to be punished, except by God? (Meaning we shouldn't have prisons or protect ourselves and loved ones.)\n3. 14:07 {About Adam’s Sin Nature/Original Sin} Does Psalm 51:5 teach that we inherit the guilt of Adam's sin, not just his sin nature?\n4. 23:49 {Unity When We Disagree Politically} There is a lot of contempt within the body of Christ across the political aisle. How can there be genuine unity with those who differ so greatly in thinking when it comes to things like abortion or BLM?\n5. 29:36 {How can I Better Support my Pastor?} Aside from tithing and prayer, what are good ways to support my pastor? Would it be weird to send an email each week thanking him for the sermon? I have a social disorder, so I’m always unsure.\n6. 34:10 {Bible Study Resource Recommendations?} Do you know of any good Bible Study resources for a group with no teacher, only facilitators?\n7. 35:40 {When to “Shake the Dust from our Feet”} At what point are we to \"shake off the dust from our feet\" as mentioned in Matthew 10: 14 when trying to witness to friends, strangers, loved ones, etc.?\n8. 42:53 {God of the Living AND the Dead?} In Mark 12: 27, Jesus says God is the God of the living, not the dead; yet in Roman 14:9, Paul says He is the God of the living and the dead. How do I reconcile this?\n9. 48:06 {Should we Ask Qs while Reading Scripture?} Does God want us to ask Him questions and look for the answers in Scripture, even if the Bible does not specifically deal with the question?\n10. 50:06 {Historical Evidence for God’s Judgments?} Is there any historical evidence for any of the prophets of the old testament or for any judgments God pronounced on people?\n11. 52:26 {Is the Parable of the Talents Works Based?} How do you separate the Parable of the Talents from a works-based Salvation?\n12. 59:06 {About Jewish Interpretation} What's your take on Jewish interpretive methods for Scripture such as Gematria (Matthew 1: 17, Revelation 13: 18) or the Hebrew alphabet and pictographic symbolism? (Psalm 119: 73 for example) \"Yod\" = Hand, etc.\n13. 1:06:17 {About the 10 Plagues of Egypt} How long did the 10 plagues of Egypt last? Were these consecutive events?\n14. 1:06:52 {Women are the “Glory” of Man?} I'm studying 1 Corinthians 11, and I'm really struggling with verse 7. It says the woman is the “glory” of the man. What’s your opinion what this glory means?\n15. 1:09:28 {Why Didn’t the Father Send Jesus Earlier?} Why didn’t God simply use the “new” covenant right away (meaning, why didn’t He just send Jesus much earlier in the world’s history)?\n16. 1:14:00 {Contradicting Genealogies?} Why are the genealogies of Jesus different in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke?\n17. 1:15:42 {What is the Purpose of the Christian Life?} If a non-Christian asked you “What is the purpose of life as a Christian?” what would you say, and what Scriptures would you use as a reference?\n18. 1:19:16 {Does God Make Mistakes?} How can I help my Christian friend trust God? He reads the OT and thinks God keeps making mistakes and tries to fix them (snake in garden, Noah's flood). He doesn't trust Heaven will be better.\n19. 1:23:04 {How to Overcome Nervousness in Prayer} Why do I feel nervous to pray? I want to but it feels unnatural to me.\n20. 1:25:21 {The Deity of the Holy Spirit} I was wondering if the Bible mentions that the Holy Spirit was in the beginning with God the Father and the Son, and where is the Holy Spirit said to be God?\n\nThe NEW BibleThinker mugs can be found here.

    "title": "Jesus Dreaded The Cross: The Mark Series pt 61 (14:32-52)",
    "description": "I'm not exaggerating when I say that this passage of the Gospel of Mark records Jesus' most intense, emotional low point, full of agony, and absolute dread. Theological liberals will sometimes distort the agony of Christ in this passage while conservatives have sometimes minimized it. In fact, I would say that it has been radically minimized in history, to the point of us missing the main thrust of what is happening here. In addition to the horror and beauty of the moment where Jesus stands alone, the only faithful one, going to die for the world at great personal cost and pain, we have a lot of absolutely WONDERFUL theological insights from the Psalms, Jonah and parallels with the Garden of Eden that give me chills!\n\nI can't wait to share it all with you!\n\nThis is part 61 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark.

    "description": "Here’s my video on “the priesthood of all believers” https://youtu.be/fi0a94fbAoc\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:08 [What does Paul Mean by “The Faith”?] In Ephesians 4:7-16, what exactly does Paul mean by “the faith”? How does the Church attain to this unity, why is the Church so apparently lacking in unity, and why are so few believers participating?\n2. 10:31 [About Stephen, Terah, & Abraham] Why does Stephen mention that Abraham's father Terah died before Abraham left his home (in Haran) in Acts 7:4? That seems to contradict Genesis 11: 26 and 11: 32 which say that Terah became the father of Abraham (then called Abram) by the time he was 70 and Terah died in Haran at the age of 205. This means that Stephen is saying Abraham was 135 when he left Haran, but Genesis 12:4 says he was (only) 75 when he set out from Haran.\n3. 12:43 [Do You Have any Favorite Teachers?] What is your opinion of the written works of Emanuel Swedenborg, Watchman Nee, and Charles Spurgeon? Please share your favorite teachers.\n4. 14:28 [Is Dancing a Sin?] Why do people think that dancing is a sin? Is there a biblical basis to this, or is this legalistic/unnecessary?\n5. 19:38 [Should We Ask for Signs from God?] When we pray for direction from God, should we ask for specific signs to guide us or confirm God's will (similar to Gideon and the fleece) when the answer isn't clear to us?\n6. 27:24 [Overcoming Laziness] PLEASE give me tips on how to overcome laziness! I work very hard at work but get literally nothing done around the house when I get home. Feel free 2 be harsh. I need it. Thanks!\n7. 29:45 [Why did Jesus call Judas “Friend”?] In Matthew 26: 50, Jesus calls Judas \"friend\" as He is betrayed. Was Jesus being sarcastic at such a dire moment? The Greek word ἑταῖρος (hetairos) is used only by Matthew (11:16; 20:13; 22:12; 26:50).\n8. 32:47 [Why Doesn’t God Fully Reveal Himself?] Why does God not appear physically and audibly speak to everyone? I know some people that He does this with, but what makes them so special? Would it not get rid of all unbelief if He did?\n9. 39:14 [About Jewish Forgiveness/Atonement] How do Jews today obtain forgiveness for sin without the temple and sacrificial system in place?\n10. 43:46 [About Psalm 82] Who are the “gods” in Psalm 82?\n11. 50:10 [About the Big Bang Theory] Should Christians believe in the Big Bang? My brother says it isn’t biblical because the Big Bang Theory includes light, and God created light after the creation of the Earth.\n12. 57:06 [About Modalism / Discussing the Trinity] How do I lovingly witness to my husband raised Oneness Pentecostal? Discussing the Trinity, he gets angry. Tongues, falling out, etc…he says I just don't get it because I haven't experienced it.\n13. 1:00:18 [How to Summarize the Gospel] How do you summarize the Gospel when you are sharing it in conversation (e.g. with a stranger on the street or with someone from a different religion)?\n14. 1:02:53 [How does the HS Speak?] How does the Holy Spirit speaks to me personally? I've left a hyper-charismatic church and am confused.\n15. 1:06:24 [Why did God Choose to Die?] Why did God choose to die to redeem our sin? Does the Bible mention His motives for this method? Is this to show His power over death, or is there another reason?\n16. 1:08:23 [Did Jesus get Tricked by Demons?] In the account of the demoniac at Gerasene, did Jesus make the swine run down the steep embankment and into the sea, therefore tricking the demons? Or did the demons somehow trick Jesus?\n17. 1:15:05 [About Marriage Documentation] Due to the Coronavirus, me and my fiancé haven't had a chance to get documentally (or even in church) married (he's in another country right now). We behave as if we were, almost in everything. Is it justified?\n18. 1:17:23 [How to Overcome Gluttony] How do I avoid gluttony? Should I stay within a strict calorie limit, or is that too legalistic?\n19. 1:21:57 [About the “Priesthood of Believers”] I'm a Latter-day Saint Christian who enjoys your content (except for the denial of fellowship to \"Mormons\"). What does \"priesthood of all believers\" mean, and what biblical support would you use for it?\n20. 1:25:00 [About Elijah and the Children] What’s up with those kids getting mauled with Elijah? I’m a Christian so don’t think it’s a “gotcha” question - I’m just wondering why.\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:23 [Movies/Shows Taking the Lord’s Name in Vain] There is so much debate going on among me, my family, and friends regarding watching movies or TV shows that use the Lord’s name in vain. Like saying “Oh my G…” or when they get angry and say “J..C...” Could you shed some light on this, please? Is there anything in the bible that tells us if it’s wrong or right to watch these movies even if we ourselves don’t use the Lord’s name in vain?\n2. 8:30 [Are We Free from the Enemy’s Power?] In one of your videos, you said some things have been provided on the cross but not fully finished. One of them was being free from the Enemy’s power. Isn't that finished? (Colossians 1: 13, Acts 26: 18)\n3. 14:55 [Question about Priesthoods] Could you please explain the difference between the Aaronic, Levitical, and Melchizedekian priesthoods?\n4. 21:09 [Understanding OT Commands for Death] How does one justify God's directive to kill all the Amalekites, specifically the children, and even infants in 1 Samuel 15:3?\n5. 27:24 [Should good teachers teach w/false teachers?] What would be your opinion on pastors with sound doctrine who share stages with false prophets? Will they be considered guilty by association?\n6. 30:08 [About God’s Discipline/Correction] Hebrews 12:5-6 quotes Proverbs 3: 11-12. Why does the end of v. 6 say “scourge,” not “correct”? I get the first part, but to say God brutally whips EVERY believer “sounds” like a misquote. What does it imply?\n8. 36:36 [About Sin and Death] James 1:15 ends with \"…and sin, when full-grown, brings forth death.\" If we are in Christ, what does he mean by “death”? Is he speaking about unbelievers? Any insight to this verse would be helpful! \n9. 41:54 [Growing Closer to the Holy Spirit] I'm struggling with trusting and wanting Christ. How do you stop keeping the Holy Spirit at an arm's length distance, spiritually?\n10. 44:48 [Does Luke teach “Purgatory”?] Does Luke 12: 44-48 teach Purgatory? There are 4 servants: The faithful, the one sent to unbelievers, and then two others that only receive punishment, not casting out.\n11. 52:00 [Is Nudity in Art o.k. for Christians?] A lot of classical art has nudity in it, like the statue of David. How should Christians approach this art? Is it o.k. to like it, or to make art similar to it?\n12. 54:38 [About OT Law & Morality] I am having trouble understanding the morality of Deuteronomy 22: 28-29. Some say it is consensual, but this contradicts 2 Samuel 13: 14-16. How do you interpret and justify the morality of this law?\n13. 1:01:56 [A Biblical View of Self-Worth] We are talking about self-worth in a young ladies group and I wanted to ask, “What is the biblical view of self-worth?”\n14. 1:06:10 [Overcoming the Sin of Pride] How do you deal with pride? I find it paradoxical; I often get proud of how humble I am when I notice my pride, thus leading to more pride. It just goes into an infinite regress of layers of pride.\n15. 1:08:08 [Loving our Neighbor During Quarantine Times] In what ways can we love our neighbor and live lives that honor God in times like these, when many of us can't congregate and instead spend a lot of time at home?\n16. 1:10:04 [About “Jesus Ben Ananias”] What do you think about the claim that Jesus Christ was based off of Jesus Ben Ananias in Josephus’ Jewish War?\n17. 1:15:25 [Drawing Close to God when it Feels Difficult] I have felt cut off from the Lord. When I pray, I wonder if I am talking to myself and if everything I hold dear is wishful thinking. Why won't God help me when I am crying out to Him?\n18. 1:21:17 [About Military Service / Self-Defense] Is a will to fight for this country in opposition to a faith in Jesus?

    "description": "0:00 - Introduction\n1. 5:55 What are your thoughts on divorce and remarriage for Christians? Is it biblical?\n2. 15:33 What are your thoughts about the Covid vaccine, and about following other government mandates or laws?\n3. 22:52 What do you think of women in positions of Christian leadership?\n4. 24:39 Is it o.k. for Christians to live in prosperity? How prosperous is too prosperous for a Christian, when it comes to possessions? Should Christians sell all that they have?\n5. 29:05 How can we share the gospel to gay friends? Do you believe there is such a thing as a \"gay Christian\" that continues to act on their temptations? If someone is currently in a gay marriage, should they divorce, or stay committed to the marriage?\n6. 44:01 What does Pastor Mike think about Nate and Sutton’s channel?\n7. 45:47 Why do we worship on Sundays when the 10 Commandments talk about the Sabbath and even Jesus kept the Sabbath?\n8. 49:49 What is your perspective on the practice of speaking in tongues? Is that gift for today? And what do you think about people who say if you don't speak in tongues, you don't have the Holy Spirit?\n9. 54:57 When it comes to our giving, is there a specific percentage Christians are supposed to tithe or give?\n10. 1:02:37 How did Satan have the ability to sin before the fall, and how did sin come to exist?\n11. 1:05:21 Why should we pray for unbelievers to be saved when God already has His “Elect” chosen?\n\nHere's Nate and Sutton's channel. I had a great time with them but also think that they have valuable content that is helping people know and follow Christ.

    "description": "The best selling book \"A Rhythm of Prayer\" has a number of prayers, including one that asks God to help you hate white people. Let's analyze this prayer because it's not only wrong on the surface, it's a rather clever way to get us to embrace the very unbiblical views of Critical Race Theory, racial guilt and to replace a biblical value of impartiality and oneness in Christ with one of sectarian power dynamics. \nWe will look at the prayer as well as the justification that the author offers for it. It might surprise you to find out that there is a real worldview behind it. It probably won't surprise you to find out that it's not consistent with Jesus. \n\nHere's my video on Critical Race Theory with Neil Shenvi. Please watch it in full before judging it. We are serious about these issues and want to be biblical in how we handle them. https://youtu.be/yHvJx-rBYKo\n\nHere's a link to the prayer in full https://drchanequa.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/prayer-weary-black-woman.pdf\n- Please note that Dr. Chanequa, the author of the prayer, is the one who made it freely available online. This is why I feel it's ok to share the whole thing with you. \n\nDr. Chanequa's defense of her prayer is here. If you reach out to her, do so with the love of Christ seasoning your words. https://drchanequa.wordpress.com/2021/04/08/prayer-of-a-weary-black-woman/\n\nThe book, Rhythm of Prayer, is here. https://www.amazon.com/Rhythm-Prayer-Collection-Meditations-Renewal/dp/0593137213\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org\n\nI have live videos every Monday and Friday at 1pm Pacific Time.

But even after years of studying the Bible I think it's easy to miss out on some of the subtle and powerful truths hidden in the text.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 29)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:20 {Should We Obey the Sabbath?} What exactly does Jesus mean in Matthew 12:1-8 when He says we must obey His commands? Do we receive special rewards for obeying the sabbath, and are we jeopardized for not obeying the sabbath?\n2. 7:09 {Are Unwanted Bad Thoughts from the Enemy?} I struggle a lot with bad thoughts popping into my head out of nowhere. I'm kind of horrified and I don't agree with them! Is it possible that they can come from the Enemy?\n3. 12:19 {About the Local Church} What is a local church and how should one be started? Many teach that it should be a plant under the authority of an existing church, but is that a biblical mandate?\n4. 16:09 {How to Rest in God’s Presence} How should we as Christians rest in the presence of the Lord? Is there anything you do to be connected to Him throughout the day?\n5. 20:35 {How Could Judas Betray Jesus} Does Hebrews 6:4-6 apply to Judas Iscariot? How else could Judas betray Jesus even after he had \"been enlightened\" and \"tasted of the heavenly gift\" and had \"partaken of the Holy Spirit\"?\n6. 28:00 {Refuting “Universal Salvation} How do you square Romans 5: 18 and 1 Corinthians 15: 22 (among others) with 2 Thessalonians 1:9 and Matthew 25: 46 (among others) regarding the issue of universal salvation?\n7. 32:10 {Do Online Church Services Violate Hebrews 10?} How absolute is the instruction in Hebrews 10: 25 about \"meeting together\"? Are churches who go online-only due to COVID and/or government rules failing to live up to it?\n8. 37:41 {Why did Command Killing Instead of Moving People?} In the Old Testament, I struggle with why God has Israel kill thousands of people to take the promised land, rather than just driving them out or trying to convert them.\n9. 45:12 {Why was Zacharias Disciplined but Not Mary?] In Luke 1: 18 & 34, both Zacharias & Mary questioned Gabriel when he told them of their future offspring. So why was Zacharias disciplined for his question, but not Mary?\n10. 49:16 {Does God Ever Stop Forgiving?} Can we anger God to the point where He never forgives?\n11. 51:26 {Advice for Agnostics Seeking God} I am agnostic, trying to believe. How would you recommend someone should approach this? I am reading though the Bible – I started with John as some recommend, but my heart hasn't changed yet. Any advice?\n12. 55:28 {About “Total Depravity”} How do you read 1 Peter 1:3 in light of your rejection of the doctrine of Total Depravity?\n13. 58:15 {About Justification, Sanctification, & sin} Can someone be justified without being sanctified? In other words, can someone live a lifestyle of habitual sin and still be saved?\n14. 1:03:30 {About the “Mandela Effect”} This is purely hypothetical, but: How would you respond to the suggestion that the disciples’ confidence in the resurrection was produced by the Mandela Effect?\n15. 1:06:08 {Do Non-Believers get Physical Bodies Back?} Do the non-believers who have died or will die get their physical bodies back at the final judgment? I know we will, but does Scripture mention this about those who reject Christ?\n16. 1:09:55 {About Peter & Satan – Was Satan Divided?} Jesus says to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan!\" when Peter tries to rebuke Him from dying in Jerusalem, but \"Satan entered into [Judas]\" leading him to betray Jesus. Was Satan \"divided against himself\"?\n17. 1:11:44 {About Fear of Kids Rejecting Christ} A friend is afraid to have kids because she’s afraid they’ll reject Jesus. She would feel guilty for having them if they went to Hell and doesn’t want to take that chance. How should I respond?\n18. 1:13:44 {About Old Testament Scholarship} What is your take on scholarship that attempts to alter our common understanding of the Old Testament by questioning the translations or our understanding of the culture?\n19. 1:17:06 {Does Jesus Directly Say He is “Son of Man”?} In the Gospel of Mark, since Jesus talked about the Son of Man in the third person, that means Jesus was talking about someone ELSE. Where in Mark does Jesus directly say He is the Son of Man?\n20. 1:21:30 {About the Bema Seat of Judgment} Will sins be publicly exposed to an assembly or those we’ve sinned against at the Bema Seat before being erased/forgiven? (1Corinthians 5: 10, Luke 12:2-3)\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

The teaching portion begins at about 37 minutes in. You can see for yourself that I haven’t done that. https://vimeo.com/257414376 \n\nHere’s the video where Brandan makes this rather odd and baseless claim. https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeaj3R3H/\n\nHe also said that I don’t want people to ask questions. Which is a great time to remind you of my weekly Friday Q&A! See you there!\n\nSometimes it's helpful to examine a theological car accident.

    "description": "I have often heard this passage used in ways that I don't think it was ever intended to be. In this study we are going through the anointing of Jesus by Mary, but unlike last time where we handled a rather complex set of questions about how this passage supposedly shows irreconcilable contradiction in the Gospels we are now looking at this passage to learn what we can from it in the way of answering a few questions. Why did Jesus say we would always have the poor with us? Does that mean we don't need to give money to the poor? What about those who say that taking care of the poor is the job of the Church and not the government (a phrase I have heard on the lips of pastors many times)? Why was Jesus anointed with oil for burial? What symbolic meaning is in this (spoiler, it's beautiful)? Why did Judas fall the way he did? Can we learn something from it to keep ourselves from slip sliding away like he did?\n\nThis is part 58 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 28)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:29 [Is Salvation Applied to All Mankind?] Since Jesus died to save all of mankind, won't everyone be saved regardless of whether or not they place their faith in Christ, just like how gravity still works on everyone whether they believe in it or not?\n2. 6:47 [About Energy & the Kalam] Why couldn’t energy be infinite, considering that we (as Christians) believe in an infinite God? The reason I’m asking is because the biggest Atheist objection I get to the Kalam while evangelizing is that 1. Energy can create a universe (quantum fluctuations) and 2. Energy may be constant (infinite). Can you object to these claims thoughtfully?\n3. 10:18 [How can Jesus “become” sin?] The Bible says that Jesus “became sin who knew no sin” (2 Corinthians 5:21). You also mentioned it at times in your videos. How can Jesus become sin?\n4. 15:08 [About Jerome, Latin Vulgate, Changes] Around 400 A.D., what were the biggest changes in doctrine that Jerome introduced in his first Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, and how did they differ from the original Gospel?\n5. 18:55 [What does “impure” mean in Ephesians?] What does Paul mean, specifically, by \"impure\" in Ephesians 5:5? I can't find anything at all that clearly defines this. I would love to know what Paul, as a Jew, meant exactly by this term. \n6. 25:23 [Advice while “Waiting on the Lord”] I'm currently in a season of \"waiting on the Lord\" to know what He wants me to do with my life. Any advice for someone in this season?\n7. 28:20 [Can Christians Serve in Government Roles?] Can a Christian be called to be a governing authority talked about in Romans 13:1 with all that such a role would demand? Does it conflict or contradict with Romans 12:17 onwards?\n8. 32:07 [What does Idolatry Look Like Today?] What would you say is modern day idolatry? I spend way more time on Christian YouTube channels and my phone than I do reading the Bible or praying. Do you get concerned that people may idolize you?\n9. 38:37 [About Unclean Food/Items] In Mark 7: 14-19, why does Jesus seem appalled that the Jews believe that touching or eating certain things could make them unclean, given Leviticus 5:2-6 and Leviticus 11? This concept came from God.\n10. 44:21 [Why Would God Give Multiple Wives?] It's often said that God does not affirm polygamy in the Old Testament, but 2 Samuel 12:8 seems to refute that. Why would God give multiple wives to David if he opposes polygamy?\n11. 51:05 [When Were the Angels Created?] Were angels created on day 1 (with the heavens and all the hosts in them? (Nehemiah 9-6) Genesis 1 is not as clear. Are the hosts the angels? \n12. 54:03 [How to Lovingly Correct Others] When discussing “correcting each other” in Bible studies (eg. Galatians 6:1, Matthew 18: 15), people mostly focus on when/why we shouldn't admonish someone. What does loving and appropriate discipline look like?\n13. 59:33 [How do we Biblically Love Ourselves?] How can I love myself biblically? Any advice or Scripture? I feel like I hate myself sometimes.\n14. 1:04:54 [Help with Reaching Atheist Family Members] Most of my friends and family are atheists and don’t take any argument for God seriously. How can I reach them in a way that they will listen and start to take Christianity seriously?\n15. 1:06:38 [Biblical Thoughts about Birth Control] What is a biblical perspective on married believers using birth control or permanent measures (e.g. a vasectomy)? Heard some say no based on Genesis 38 and Psalm 139.\n16. 1:09:40 [Why did God Allow Satan into the Garden?] Why would a God who hates evil place evil incarnate (Satan) into the garden, when the world was still good and sinless, knowing it would lead to the corruption of humans?\n17. 1:12:39 [Does Judas have a Throne?] In Matthew 19: 28, Jesus told His twelve disciples that they will have twelve thrones of judgment to judge the twelve tribes in the future. Does Judas still have a throne?\n18. 1:16:17 [Why is Jesus Called “The Rock”?] Why does God repeatedly declare that He is the only Savior in Isaiah? He says He knows of no rock. This was confusing because Jesus is said to be a rock.\n19. 1:17:54 [About the “Narrow Gate” (Matthew)] Can you explain to me what the “narrow gate” means in Matthew 7: 13-14 (what it means in practice)?\n20. 1:20:50 [Does 2 Consciousnesses = 2 Souls?] There have been cases of people that live with only half a brain. Does someone that has had the connection between the halves of their brain removed and now have two consciousnesses have two souls. \n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "I almost gave up trying to resolve this supposed \"contradiction\" between Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Was Jesus anointed with oil/perfume once, twice or three times? Is there error in the Gospels about this? This is a rather complicated set of problems that will take time to unpack. In my study this week I searched and searched and could not find a satisfactory answer; and I'm not really ok with half-answers, so I was about to give up on the issue when I set aside all my resources and just worked with the texts themselves. Now I think I understand a very plausible explanation for the differences and similarities in the four Gospels on this issue. \n\nToday is all about apologetics!\n\nI'll be answering a lot of the following questions.\nIf Luke is a separate account that happened at a different time and place how do we explain the similarities between his account and those in Mt, Mk and John? Like the other Gospels, Luke records a woman anointing Jesus, using fragrance from an alabaster flask and the name of the home owner being \"Simon\". \nEven if Luke is a separate account we have questions about how John can be harmonized with Matt and Mark. Critics claim that John has this event happening 6 days before Passover while Mark and Matt have it happening 2 days before Passover. They say that John has this happening at the home of Lazarus while Mark and Matt have it happening at the home of Simon the Leper. Yet these three accounts seem too similar to say it happened twice in such a short period of time. This puzzle had me confused for a time, and when I looked up resources from other people who tried to figure out a good solution I found myself bothered even more. The solutions often disregarded obvious challenges! In the end, I think I've figured it out and decided to do a whole video on it to make sure a good resource was out there for those looking to answer the question. I also think we should talk a bit about the anxiety Christians often feel when trying to resolve a supposed contradiction. How do we process that, especially if we simply don't know the answer yet?\n\nThis is part 57 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark. Today we are in chapter 13:32-37.\n \nFeel free to use my videos in your own gatherings as an aid to studying Scripture. \n\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Intro\n1. 1:20 [Kalam Cosmological Argument] When using the Kalam Cosmological Argument, how can I convince skeptics that this argument should lead to belief in the God of the Bible specifically, and not just \"a creator\" in general?\n2. 7:58 [About the Antichrist, Antiochus, & Daniel] Is there any biblical support for the idea that Daniel 11: 36-45 is talking about the antichrist instead of Antiochus IV?\n3. 16:08 [Old Ages in Genesis – Literal?] How do you address the advanced ages found in the book of Genesis? My wife and I were discussing this last night. She takes them literally, while I view them more symbolically. How do you view it?\n4. 23:15 [Is Tradition as Authoritative as Scripture?] I was speaking with Orthodox Christian friends about tradition, and they said John 21: 24-25 was the best example of the Bible mentioning oral tradition as being as authoritative as itself. Thoughts?\n5. 27:52 [Mark & Revelation – Passage Comparison] Are Mark 13: 24-27 and Revelation 6: 12-17 describing the same event?\n6. 31:37 [How to Tell when Scripture Directly Applies] How do we determine the difference between text in the Bible that only relates to the cultural context of the time vs. text that is trans-cultural and relevant for all time?\n7. 37:41 [“The Restrainer” / Eschatology] When the restrainer is removed, will non-believers lose their compassion and morals? (See 2 Thessalonians 2:6-7)\n8. 41:40 [Should Atheist Philosophers Shake our Faith?] Are you ever shaken by why there are brilliant philosophers of religion, like Graham Oppy, who are atheists? I sometimes feel like I must be missing something.\n9. 45:30 [The “Sinner’s Prayer”] I was wondering, what is a good alternative to the “sinners prayer”? How should we lead someone to salvation?\n10. 46:37 [Molinism, Free Will, Circumstances] In Molinism (or your soteriology), is people's choice to believe only dependent upon the circumstances God places them in? If so, why doesn't God make circumstances that makes everyone believe?\n11. 50:35 [Difficult Passages – Deut. 22, Rape] A friend of mine points to the law on women and rape in Deuteronomy 22: 23-24 as an example of \"flawed teaching\" in the Bible. How should we understand this verse?\n12. 56:10 [What is the point of the book of Esther?] Why is Esther in the Bible? I see no moral purpose, no mention of God anywhere, and the last two chapters have dangerous implications.\n13. 1:00:53 [The Significance/Importance of Baptism] A friend who is a recent Christian hasn’t chosen to be baptized yet. He seems to not understand the importance of baptism. How can I explain the importance of baptism without being pushy? Ultimately, it’s his decision.\n14. 1:03:48 [What does it Mean to \"Wait on the Lord\"?] What does it mean to \"wait on the Lord,\" and how (in general) would you counsel someone who's in that season?\n15. 1:05:44 [How to Differentiate between Our Mind and the HS] Can you speak to how to tell the difference between the Spirit burdening your heart & just being obsessive about something? A friend broke contact with me during great pain a long time ago, and I still worry.\n16. 1:09:45 [Is it O.K. to Accept a Trial Instead of Praying?] My unborn baby has a serious birth defect. Several friends are praying for a miracle. Is it o.k. if we don't? I do believe God could heal that way, but I'm just trying to live with what's real right now.\n17. 1:12:36 [1 Corinthians 5: 11, Family Gatherings] What is your perspective on the application of the “Do not even eat with them…” passage when it comes to family (1 Corinthians 5: 11)? Do you think this includes not going to family gatherings?\n18. 1:16:39 [How to Help Someone who Doesn’t “Walk the Talk”] How do I talk to my wife, who believes in Jesus & prays “In Jesus Name, Amen,” but doesn’t read the Bible or know the true meaning & story behind Jesus Christ? Her lifestyle doesn’t add up with the script.\n19. 1:18:01 [Do Politics Belong in the Pulpit?] Do politics belong in the pulpit? I 100% disagree with politics being in the pulpit for various reasons, but I wanted your opinion also.  \n20. 1:23:03 [How to Respect an Atheist Husband while Obeying God] I was saved last year, and my husband is still an atheist. He doesn't want me sharing Jesus with our daughter because he thinks she'll \"think he's going to hell.\" How do I balance my faith and my respect for him?\n\n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything, because the Bible is more brilliant, beautiful and life-changing than most of us have realized.\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Mario became convinced that Jesus bodily rose from the dead because of the historical evidence for it. He wrote a paper defending the resurrection for a school project, in Belgium, and asked me to do an interview on the topic as well as to answer several objections from his teacher. What excites me the most is just knowing his story and how those of us who have been doing online ministry have been able to play a role in it. To any skeptics who may be listening. I encourage you to take this evidence seriously and to dig on your own. Not just looking for reasons to reject Christianity but looking to discover what the truth is. \n\nHere are some VERY helpful links.\n\nMy video explaining why, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\", doesn't help the skeptic deny the resurrection. https://youtu.be/3GRAI-us4es\n\nA large video giving tons of evidence for the resurrection. https://youtu.be/0Rtmn5LLM-0 \n\nA short video for those who only have moment to hear the evidence.

    "description": "People have been using this verse of Scripture to deny the deity of Christ for a long time. in reality, it's actually a beautiful way of teaching the deity and humanity of Christ. We will go through it in detail and answer objections while trying to make sure we don't lose the simple and profound teaching of the passage. Jesus didn't know the day or the hour. Why not? Does He know it now? Did the Holy Spirit know it?

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 26)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:11 [Grieving the death of the unsaved] How do we biblically grieve the death of a loved one who wasn't saved? Since we don't believe in purgatory, and therefore we don't pray for deceased people, what is an appropriate (but still loving) response in this situation? And how can we kindly correct those who make a well-meaning offer to pray for a dead loved one without being harsh?\n2.  8:20 [Plato & Christianity?] What does Plato have to do with Christianity? I recently read that Plato had as much influence on Christianity as the Bible.\n3. 11:29 [Does Christianity impede critical thinking?] Is/was Christianity guilty of impeding critical thinking and exploring the mysteries of the cosmos and physics of the natural world? How would you advise a believer involved in both worlds?\n4. 17:06 [Does God have a sense of humor?] Deep theological and philosophical question: Does God have a sense of humor?\n5. 21:18 [Should I be rebaptized?] Are there biblical examples of people being baptized more than once? I was baptized LDS but don't consider it to be a legitimate baptism. I want to be rebaptized now that I found Christ. Is this ok?\n6. 26:16 [About ‘gods’ of other religions] In Numbers 33:3-4, YHWH never denies other ‘gods.’ Are we then to understand gods of other religions (Allah, Zeus, etc.) as very much real ‘gods,’ albeit demons?\n7. 32:00 [Does God really forget sins? Should we?] After forgiveness, all sin is wiped clean. Can a person then claim to have never taken part in certain sin in his past? If the Lord remembers our sin no more, why should we?\n8. 35:17 [Is it biblical to mandate traditions?] The church I grew up in had extrabiblical \"traditions\" (women wear dresses, men are clean shaven, etc.), and justified this using Proverbs 22: 28 & Matthew 18: 18. Is it biblical to mandate adherence to tradition?\n9. 40:38 [Answering skeptics’ claims online] I've been trying to reach skeptics online, but they've told me belief in God is irrational and that I must believe rape & torture are o.k. since I'm a Christian. They also call God evil, a murderer, and a megalomaniac, and say Christians are wasting their time believing in \"fairytales.\" How should I respond to these claims, and how can I tell when a debate is not even going to be fruitful?\n10. 45:35 [Should we pray against “spirits” of sins?] Is it Biblical to pray against spirits (e.g., the \"spirit of\" offense, laziness, depression, confusion, etc.)? What is a \"Jezebel spirit,\" and is it real?\n11. 51:15 [Perpetual virginity of Mary?] Did Mary remain a virgin? I've heard that the brothers of Jesus that are mentioned were actually his cousins, and that if she had other sons, John wouldn't have needed to care for her (John 19:26).\n12. 58:16 [Defining persecution] Can you please define \"persecution\" and speak to whether these pastors imprisoned or being penalized for defying public health orders are in fact being persecuted?\n13. 1:00:35 [Can secular songs be turned into worship?] What are your thoughts on using secular music as a form of worship music where half of the lyrics are secular words and the other half is supposedly Jesus’ words?\n14. 1:02:34 [Do real Christians stop sinning?] Does 1 John 3:4-10 mean your aren’t a real Christian if you still struggle with sin? At face value that’s how it sounds, but then nobody would qualify for Grace - so I’m confused.\n15. 1:11:30 [Why did God command death?] My 12 year old daughter asked me after reading Exodus 32: 28 “If God gives us free will to worship Him, why did He have Moses command the Levites to kill those 3,000 people who chose not to?”\n16. 1:14:29 [Did God make individuals & not just mankind?] Even though I know people (as a whole) were made by God, because God made Adam, how do I know that I/people (individually) are also made by God, especially when they are conceived out of sin?\n17. 1:17:03 [How to rekindle passion for God] How would you counsel someone who feels their passion for the Lord dying? (Not praying anymore, not reading the Bible, etc.)\n18. 1:19:35 [Inerrancy & preservation of Scripture] How do you bring together an inerrancy and preservation to modern translations which say verses have been added and taken away (end of Mark, Acts 8: 37)?\n19. 1:21:53 [Reliability of Scripture when Jesus was alone] How do we know parts of the New Testament are reliable that narrate Jesus when He is alone without witnesses? (Ex: Being tempted in the wilderness or His prayer in the garden of Gethsemane.)\n20. 1:23:29 [Leviticus, uncleanness, and the Temple] What happens to people who become unclean (impure) in Leviticus? When they’re unclean for the whole day, are they just not allowed in the Temple, or do bad, negative things happen to them as well?\n\nHere’s the video where I go into detail about Mary not being a virgin forever. https://youtu.be/okrkXfrJrNA\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "Why Did Pastor Chuck Predict the Rapture?: The Mark Series pt 55 (13:28-30)",
    "description": "I've had a number of people asking me about when pastor Chuck Smith predicted the rapture. It's an uncomfortable topic for a Calvary Chapel pastor, which I am, and for someone who looks up to and deeply appreciates pastor Chuck, as I do. This is because Chuck Smith is the founder of Calvary Chapel and I can say that his ministry has had a big, positive impact in my own life. But I think we should talk about it for a few specific reasons. \n1) It did happen.\n2) It has not been publicly dealt with, to my knowledge. In fact, it appears as though it has been denied.\n3) My own ministry has led many people to Calvary Chapels and I feel obligated to talk about this because it's a significant issue in our past and I owe it to those who are or will attend Calvary Chapel churches because of my influence.\n4) It wasn't just mentioned in one message. Pastor Chuck predicted it in multiple books and over the course of years.\n5) It's based on a misinterpretation of Scripture which is still common among pastors today. It just so happens that this passage of Scripture is the one we are covering today in our verse by verse study in the Gospel of Mark.\n6) Many pastors, in my own movement as well as beyond, have gotten in the habit of playing fast and loose with predictions related to the rapture, the tribulation and the second coming and I think that if we look honestly about mistakes of the past we can be warned not to fall into the same mistakes in the future. And if my own understanding is correct, we can expect to see a great deal of reckless prophetic speculation in the years to come. We would do well to be prepared for it.\n\nI really should have mentioned that in Mark 11 the fig tree being cursed is thought by some to specially represent Israel. Here is my response to that. The fig tree there is used to make an example that relates to Israel or the Temple but I don’t think that’s because fig trees in general represent Israel (see my survey of its usage in the Old Testament from the video). Also, the context in Mark 13 shows Jesus is using the budding of the fig tree to refer to the two signs He mentions and not using fig trees in general as a representation of the nation Israel existing. In addition to this, the parallel passage in Luke shows that Jesus said “the fig tree and all the trees”. In other words, even if a fig tree might specially represent Israel in some cases it didn’t in this passage because all the trees aren’t fig trees.\n\nThis is part 55 of the Mark Series, going verse by verse through the Gospel of Mark. Today we are in chapter 13:28-30.\n \nFeel free to use my videos in your own gatherings as an aid to studying Scripture. \n\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:36 [Parable of the Dishonest Manager] What is the meaning of the Parable of the Dishonest Manager in Luke 16: 1-13? I was having a Bible study with a friend over Discord, and we're wondering about this.\n2. 10:01 [Anxiety about the Rapture] Is it bad to hope that Jesus doesn’t come back until after I have died? Not knowing when the rapture will come (pre or post-trib) causes me anxiety.\n3. 12:46 [Can Christians claim all biblical promises?] How do we respond to someone who says we can \"claim\" all the promises in the Bible for ourselves because we are \"grafted into Israel\" or because God is \"no respecter of persons\"?\n4. 16:35 [Resources to guard against confirmation bias] I am afraid that I am just partaking in confirmation bias for theism, but I find that most atheistic arguments are just strawmen and ad-hominem attacks. Are there any good, thoughtful resources?\n5. 23:42 [Premarital abstinence] I've been a follower of Christ for about 3 months now and my girlfriend of 2 years who I would say is \"lukewarm\" is hesitant to abstain. How should I handle this?\n6. 26:08 [Golden chain of redemption – Romans 8] Can you give your interpretation of the \"golden chain of redemption\" in Romans 8: 29-30?\n7. 29:53 [How is God glorified when a soul perishes?] Everything works together for God's glory, but I have a hard time reconciling that with the idea that God creates people that He knows are destined for Hell. Any thoughts?\n8. 36:17 [Do different biblical interpretations make Scripture contradictory?] Given the multiple schools of thought on concepts like eschatology and Calvinism, and each school has Scripture to back up their contradicting views, does that make Scripture contradictory?\n9. 41:28 [Advice for an atheist teen] Please give advice on what say to my 16 yr. old who has told me he is an atheist. He can barely defend his position. He has basically fallen victim to internet atheism, and he no longer wants to go to church.\n10. 43:50 [Have I truly forgiven if I don’t feel it?] How do you know when you truly have forgiven someone in your heart? I can say the words but I’m unsure if my heart has changed.\n11. 46:33 [Is Satan omniscient?] The Bible indicates that the mystery of God's plan for salvation was kept hidden for ages until after the resurrection. Could that mean Satan is omniscient, i.e. when Jesus had to rebuke Peter?\n12. 50:30 [Matt. 10 & Mark 13 written similarly] Why does Matthew 10: 16-24 have Olivet Discourse wording (same wording as Mark 13:9-13)? It does not seem to fit here/make sense & this is NOT found in the parallel verses (Luke 9:1-6, Mark 6:7-13).\n13. 52:56 [Is meditation style prayer o.k.?] I enjoy mindful meditation for mental health reasons and want to involve God in this, but I've heard this type of prayer is wrong. Why couldn’t I memorize a Psalm and repeat it in prayerful thought?\n14. 55:21 [Intro to apologetics resources] What are some good sources to look at to start studying apologetics?\n15. 57:50 [Can we allow extrabiblical sources to inspire us?] Is it sinful to be inspired by historical people in and outside of the Bible? Should I instead be exclusively inspired by the Holy Spirit who enabled believers or by the Father?\n16. 1:00:21 [Caring for a grieving loved one] A loved one of mine (a believer) is going through a season of mental anguish. What are some practical ways that I can help and encourage them?\n17. 1:02:37 [Disciples’ memory – Miracles in Mark 6 vs. Mark 8] How is it that when Jesus feeds the 4,000 in Mark 8, the disciples don’t seem to remember Him already doing the same thing in Mark 6 (the 5,000)?\n18. 1:04:03 [Jesus’ death, burial, & resurrection] If Jesus was beaten unrecognizably, how can we be sure they checked the right tomb?\n19. 1:08:41 [How could Adam & Eve know right from wrong?] If eating from the tree of knowledge is what gave Adam and Eve the knowledge of good vs. evil, how could they have been expected to know that disobeying God was evil before they ate the fruit?\n20. 1:10:21 [Can Christians listen to secular music?] I was wondering if you had anything to say about secular music? Is it ok to listen to? What draws the line of something a Christian shouldn't listen to/ watch?\n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything, because the Bible is more brilliant, beautiful and life-changing than most of us have realized.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:13 I'm a follower of Christ, and I have several major illnesses which makes me uninsurable, and I can’t afford a funeral plan. My family will likely cremate me, but I’m REALLY troubled about this. Can only buried bodies be resurrected? Will I miss out on eternal life and go to Hell if my body is cremated? When I asked a pastor nearby, he said cremation is Pagan and only burial is biblical. Is this true?\n2. 8:10 How do you see God when you pray? My mind wants to envision a person.\n3. 10:29 Is there a possibility that “Lady Wisdom” in Proverbs 8 is actually the Holy Spirit? Is there ever any definitively male or female pronouns used in the Hebrew or Greek to know?\n4. 13:26 Romans 11: 25-32 seems to say that the Jewish people will turn back to Christ. Do you have any thoughts on that or see a connection between that and the rising number of Messianic Jews is Israel?\n5. 18:59 I am a new Christian, formally LDS. Many LDS folk have been very active at challenging my new beliefs (the Trinity, etc.) I want to share the Gospel with them, but I recognize I'm still learning. Do new Christians have an obligation to defend our beliefs and evangelize, or is it o.k. to ask these challengers to give me space?\n6. 22:02 If God is timeless, how could He have sequential thoughts, especially before time was created (e.g., His decision to make time and creation)?\n7. 25:36 What are our \"non-negotiables\" as Christians? What doctrines do we unapologetically plant our flags on and refuse to back down from?\n8. 32:33 To what extent do we expose works of darkness? (Ephesians 5:8-14) A family member who claims to be a Christian is openly selling food w vulgar text & images and I found out she’s supplying alcohol to minors as well, through her business. The 1st part was bad enough, but I can’t stay silent anymore. She is already unhappy with me and another family member calling her out on behavior that endangered her child & our family, but admitted at the time that she “should be a better Christian.” How do we handle this?\n9. 34:12 Is the Paradise mentioned by Paul in his vision of being taken to the third Heaven, Jesus to the thief on the cross, and in the account of Lazarus the same place?\n10. 37:11 How can God love the whole world while hating sinners like in Psalm 5:5?\n11. 41:23 Any advice for a wife whose husband has admitted he is not as spiritually mature as the wife? She doesn’t want to lead *him,* but is more spiritually mature.\n12. 44:07 If a born-again Christian dies suddenly with an unconfessed sin (not a lifestyle) like momentary lust or deceit, will this lead to Hell? Or does Christ's sacrifice cover all sins (past & future)?\n13. 49:05 Where are we when we are judged? On Earth, in Heaven, or somewhere in between?\n14. 50:51 In Matthew 27, who are the people coming out of the tombs when Jesus rises?

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 23)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 0:38 The NT has a lot of examples of demons being very active, and Jesus & the Apostles had to cast many demons out of people - there was a lot of activity and possession. But in the OT, demonic activity and possession is not talked about at all (or very, very rarely). I was wondering what happened to cause the change and huge increase…or why we rarely read about it in the OT but there are so many examples in the NT.\n2. 9:32 How can Jesus be fully God and fully man if He died? How can God die? I can understand Him putting aside some of His divinity in order to die, but don’t we believe that He is both fully God and fully man? How can He be FULLY God at the crucifixion?\n3. 13:44 Some pastors I respect live in in huge homes in gated communities. Their salaries are higher than about 90% of their church members. Do you find anything wrong with this?\n4. 16:42 My sister has decided to make a vision board and was asking me to follow. I did a bit of research and it looks like it has ties with the New Age. Could you explain how Christians should deal with goals & dreams?\n5. 20:42 In Matthew and Mark, Jesus calls the first disciples before healing Peter’s mother in law and heals her by touch. In Luke, they're called after, and she’s healed by “rebuking the fever.” Is this significant?\n6. 21:38 What's your view of 2 Timothy 2: 20-21 saying people can \"cleanse themselves\" & using the same “honorable vs. dishonorable” wording as Romans 9? Does this refute the Calvinist view of “Total Depravity”?\n7. 27:14 What should we do when confused on doctrine? I’ve seen your videos on Catholicism, but recently had a debate with a Catholic and feel so confused. My faith is shaken, and I don’t know what to believe.\n8. 31:09 Any thoughts about the ecumenical movement? If my church is in it, should I get out of that church? In Finland, most churches have papers that you are officially in it. Is that biblical?\n9. 34:15 If Jesus doesn't return until the Temple is rebuilt, how is the Temple rebuilt when the ark and its contents are gone? Perhaps I have a big misunderstanding of prophecy or the specs for the Temple.\n10. 36:55 What happens to animals/insects when they die?\n11. 39:31 Is there anything Christians should fear apart from God?\n12. 41:41 Can you please comment on John 8: 30-38? Why was Jesus talking like this to those who believed Him? Would love to hear your insight!\n13. 46:49 What does the Bible say about modesty in clothing? Are there certain parts of our body that we cannot show, or is it just a heart issue? If the uniform for a sport is a bikini, should we avoid that sport?\n14. 51:18 Could you run through an explanation of the Armor of God in Ephesians?\n15. 59:07 Does Psalm 121:6 literally mean that God can protect you from being sunburnt? I want to not wear sunblock but don’t want to ruin my skin if I’m wrong.\n16. 1:01:44 Why do people go to Hell? Is it a penalty for sins, or for not believing in Jesus? Some say everyone's sins are forgiven, but that doesn't seem to square with Ephesians 5:5-6 and Colossians 3:5-6.\n17. 1:04:44 In one of your past Q&As, you shared your thoughts on “JESUS CALLING.” I was wondering if it’s okay for someone to get quiet and try to hear God and write it down just for themselves. Is that wrong?\n18. 1:07:18 You mentioned in an earlier video that you do not believe one goes directly to Hell once dead. Can you elaborate on that?\n19. 1:09:29 Given the fact that evolution occurs, is observable, and is supported by a vast body of scientific evidence, earning it the highest degree of scientific support, how do you interpret Genesis 1 & 2?\n20. 1:13:00 I have ADHD, and while looking for a Christian perspective on my condition I came across a website that calls mental illness a myth and attributes any abnormality in thinking to the influence of the devil and demonic spirits. It also says ADHD is a \"behavioral problem\" that happens because parents \"refuse or don't know how to discipline their children” and that the \"root of all disorders is some type of sin that is being committed\" & that medications are used as an excuse for continuing to engage in the sinful behavior. Thoughts?\n\nHERE'S my video on Catholicism. Please listen very carefully as these points are often misunderstood but I did research a lot and work hard to refine my concerns. https://youtu.be/7ZVHHmCOjOg\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Lori Anne Thompson's full victim impact statement video - https://youtu.be/4kDe8caElaw \n\nVictims of Ravi can safely contact (or have someone they trust contact) Rachael Denhollander a former victim and advocate who will help them. Please don’t spam her with emails, this is for victims who need a safe person to take up their cause. mailto:rjd.requests@gmail.com\n\n\nThis is not a video I'm looking forward to. But this is why I'm doing it.\n1) Ravi's victims need vindication. In particular, Lori Anne Thompson has been continually maligned and horribly treated because she brought TRUE accusations against Ravi. I believed the worst about her because of the comments from Ravi and the echoes of those comments from RZIM. This only made her a continual victim. We need to clear her name.\n2) Ravi's sins have left a lot of open wounds that need tending. Both in the body of Christ and in RZIM. Believers need to be reminded of how to process all this as a follower of Christ, of how true Christ remains regardless of this tragedy and how to handle this situation so that we don't wrongly treat RZIM staff, Ravi's family or continue to make the error of ignoring red flags that may still lead to more discoveries. I've seen every kind of wrong response online already. I pray to God that I would have wisdom to help us all to have wisdom here. If you are reading this before I go live then please stop and pray for me as I prepare for this video.\n3) Scripture commands us to openly deal with a leader who persists in sin, which is proven by evidence, by telling the local body so that other leaders can properly fear their own falling (1 Tim 5:19-20). Since Ravi was a leader in worldwide Christianity with personal character endorsements from countless other leaders this command can only be fulfilled by taking the truth as public as his endorsements were.\n4) If we as the body of Christ do not deal with this issue openly then I feel that we implicate ourselves in some sort of complicity at this point. The witness of Christ in the world has been harmed by Ravi's sin and we do need to publicly deal with it. Due to my own place in ministry as a public figure I do feel compelled to speak on this.\n\nLike many of you I am angry and I'm sad. But we can't respond with conspiracy theories that deny the overwhelming evidence of persistent sin, abuse of power, abuse of ministry funds, abuse of women and how calculated and deliberate it all was. The facts are in, all that is left is to face them and try to respond in ways that honor Christ. \n\nTo Ravi's family, I'm really sorry I am making a video about your father/husband/relative. It breaks my heart and I hate the idea of adding hurt to what you are going through. Please know that I don't mean you harm and I'm not on the bandwagon of heartless crowds. I am compelled that this must be done and I pray that you will find, in some way, some help in it as well.\n\nThe PDF of the full Miller & Martin investigative report on Ravi https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rzimmedia.rzim.org/assets/downloads/Report-of-Investigation.pdf\n\nThe board of RZIM's most recent statement (as of 2/15/2020) https://www.rzim.org/read/rzim-updates/board-statement\n\nThe timeline according to Brad and Lori - https://julieroys.com/open-letter-to-rzim-from-brad-lori-anne-thompson/\n\nChristianity Today Spa Article https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/september/ravi-zacharias-sexual-harassment-rzim-spa-massage-investiga.html\n\nWorld Magazine Spa Article https://world.wng.org/2020/10/new_sexual_misconduct_claims_surface_about_ravi_zacharias \n\nOpen Letter from Thompsons - https://julieroys.com/open-letter-to-rzim-from-brad-lori-anne-thompson/ 10-13-2020\n\nMy teaching explaining that all sin is NOT the same. https://youtu.be/Tp_lAMuX16k\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 - Introduction\n1. 2:11 If Revelation was written after 70AD, why wouldn't John say anything about the destruction of Jerusalem? Wouldn't he write about a prophecy of Jesus that came true? Pretty big event to ignore.\n2. 6:09 Do we have free will? If not, how does that affect God's sovereignty? If yes, how can we be punished for sins when we had no other option?\n3. 13:11 As a conservative Christian, is it wrong to enjoy New Age music? I enjoy playing and listening to the relaxing piano music, but if it is connected to New Age, I do not want to disrespect the Lord.\n4. 16:08 From a Christian perspective, do you have any advice on dealing with and overcoming the fear of death? I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety over my own death and the death(s) of my loved ones.\n5. 21:01 How do you view the false prophecies of Trump winning? Pride? A lying spirit spreading the same false prophecy? Do we stop listening to all those who claimed this?\n6. 26:50 In a futurist view of the end times, which current country do you think would best represent Babylon?\n7. 28:27 What is your advice for a young adult who wants to start a ministry platform similar to yours, but who doesn’t have any formal training? I want other young adults to care about theology like I do.\n8. 31:02 If God is omnipresent, would His presence also be in Hell?\n9. 34:23 Can you help me understand why Paul would permit Timothy to drink wine for his sickness in 1 Timothy 5: 23 even though it seems that he was under the Nazarite vow? (Numbers 6:1-4)\n10. 38:25 In Galatians 4: 27 who is \"the desolate\" referring to: Sarah or Hagar? My Bible study disagreed and I can see arguments for either one.\n11. 43:13 Who can baptize? Can I baptize my kids?\n12. 45:56 Why is it that big name Calvinists, in general, are super arrogant and ultimately unloving? And shouldn't this disqualify them from leadership and make them false teachers?\n13. 48:11 Should I stop reading the devotional on my “Bible in one year” plan? It seems to be eisegetical and groups the Old Testament, New Testament, and Psalms/Prov. daily reading under one common theme each day.\n14. 49:05 Can it be argued that the authority and power Jesus gave to the 12/70 disciples in Luke 3: 15 and Luke 10:9 to heal the sick and to cast out demons is different from using our spiritual gifts?\n15. 52:37 In Matthew 11: 22-24, Jesus says if Sodom saw and heard the miracles you have they would have repented. So why didn’t Jesus do those works in Sodom instead of destroy them?\n16. 57:41 In your marriage videos, you referred to men as “knuckleheads” that weren't acting as the “head” in decision making. Is it permissible to actively consult with and make decisions with your wife, cooperatively?\n17. 59:17 Am I a covenant breaker if I agreed to a divorce that I didn't want?  My wife is divorcing me, and I told her we need to go to counseling first but she said she doesn't want to fix the marriage.\n18. 1:01:11 Does the Bible teach that we can “feel Gods presence,” or is it just human emotion in response to our minds receiving biblical truths?\n19. 1:05:26 What advice would you give to me who struggles with apathy in my spiritual life?\n20. 1:07:11 Do we need to feel bad for our sin when we repent? Or is knowing it’s supposed to be wrong enough? My ex-girlfriend and I sinned and I feel bad about it, but she doesn’t.\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:53 Recently, I've seen several of your videos dealing with The Passion Translation, and the criticism seems very much on point. Clearly, Brian Simmons is a bit of a nut and I think you'd agree that religions can attract those types of people. So, why would you assume Paul, or the authors of Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John weren't also nutty? At the very least you should be skeptical of their writings. Further, there is no way to go back and do the sort of analysis of those authors, the way you can with Simmons. For example, the review you do of Simmons' lectures, as opposed to simply having his Passion Translation, is very effective in demonstrating just how nutty he is. Nothing even close to that is possible with the biblical authors. So why give them credence?\n2. 9:05 If Moses was God's chosen one, why did God want to kill him in Exodus 4: 24? Also, what did Zipporah mean by \"Surely a bloody husband art thou to me\"?\n3. 14:00 Can you help me understand the comparison/contrast between how the Holy Spirit comes upon vs. in someone? Is it correct that in the Old Testament, He came UPON someone (Exodus 29: 45 & Ezekiel 37: 27) but not IN, and in the New Testament, He indwells believers? \n4. 19:08 What are your thoughts on Kenneth Hagin's \"The Authority of the Believer\" and other Christian spiritual authority concepts? If none, would you consider looking into it?\n5. 21:27 Are angels immortal? if not, does that mean demons might have a chance to defeat them or some in a war? I ask because sometimes I see paintings of angels vs demons.\n6. 23:03 I was wondering, why are there times where Jesus tells people not to talk about Him? Some Verses: Matt. 8:4, 9: 30, 12: 16)\n7. 26:05 If God’s will is always done in Heaven, was Satan’s rebellion God’s will?\n8. 28:41 What are some ways God disciplines us as it’s said in Hebrews? How do we know if He is disciplining? Can He discipline through physical or psychological ailments?\n9. 32:34 What does someone need to believe for you to consider them your brother or sister in Christ?\n10. 35:13 Could you comment on Matthew 13: 44-45? Most people seem to feel that the merchant is a man and the pearl/treasure is Christ, but in context I seem to see the opposite.\n11. 40:27 You were in American Gospel 2. What do you think of the final 10 minutes teaching God's whole purpose for everything is His own glory, and we're \"merely\" incidental to that?\n12. 44:17 Does the integrity of our faith need Adam and Eve to be literal historical people? Some people say the account of Adam and Eve is a myth, or a story to teach us theological and moral truth.\n13. 47:01 If God is good and perfect, how can He ever be jealous (Exodus 20:6) or angry (Exodus 34:6) since both jealousy and anger are sins of the flesh (Galatians 5: 20)? More Cat Cam!\n14. 51:48 Can you explain how you understand John 20: 23? I’ve read several commentaries on this verse and still have difficulty rightly understanding it.\n15. 55:02 How can I learn to see God as a loving Father? I’m afraid and sometimes I feel that God is indifferent and impatient with me. Am I gonna make it to heaven?\n16. 59:40 Any books you recommend for those courting and preparing for marriage? If not, any advice?\n17. 1:02:00 If someone passes away, is it wrong to pray for their salvation? This would not be “get them out of purgatory,” this would just be in a “God, you knew back then that I would pray this” sort of way.\n18. 1:03:20 In your opinion, who are the “gods of Egypt” in Exodus 12? The options seem to be rulers, idols, demons, or actual gods.\n19. 1:07:59 I shared your Passion Project with the Elders of my church. They thought it was nitpicking. How do I decide to leave? Long history with these people. Seem to be becoming hyper-charismatic.\n20. 1:09:52 What boundaries (biblical separation) should a Christian establish with a professed believer who is now in a gay marriage?\nBONUS Q: 1:12:11 I am a new cat owner. What are your cats’ favorite kind of toys?\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 2:49 What led to the “charismatic conundrum” of 2020 where large numbers of false prophecies were being given by seemingly well-respected & well-known teachers online?\n2. 9:13 I'm writing a book with a Native American friend and I want to help him come to Christ. He is respectful of Christianity, but terrible things have been done to him and his family by people professing to be Christians (his aunt was beaten to death by a Catholic nun just to prove she had the authority). I want to share the Gospel with him in a way that is accurate, but at the same time, sensitive to what his people have endured. Any advice?\n3. 13:19 Matthew 19: 12 talks about eunuchs from birth. Does that include intersex people? It seems to advise that eunuchs should not marry and should just serve God. Is that right?\n4. 20:52 Is Ruth 4:5-6 typologically connected with Galatians 3: 23-25, where Boaz replaces the guardian-redeemer to redeem Ruth, Christ takes the place of the law to redeem the Church?\n5. 25:08 I have a Japanese friend who believes in a false Japanese religion, mainly because when she sprained her ankle, her mom prayed over it and the Dr. said it was healed. How can I effectively share that her religion is false, after she experienced this convincing miracle?\n6. 29:39 Can you please comment on the Book of Life and how one is written into it or blotted out from it?\n7. 32:15 Is there biblical basis for a Christian being able to “release healing” into the atmosphere? I hear this quite a bit at my church, and I’m uneasy with it for some reason.\n8. 36:26 What is the leaven of Herod? It seemed Herod was intrigued by John, even though John was against his unlawful marriage, and Herod did what people thought instead of God's law.\n9. 39:44 As a youth leader, my students share these New Age things they learn to do on TikTok, and 1 of them sounds like Astral Projection. How do we talk about this with them without sounding crazy?\n10. 41:52 Why should we care about false doctrine/teaching like the prosperity gospel or the word of faith movement? Does believing in such compromise one’s salvation? If not, why care at all?\n11. 44:35 In Romans 8: 34, why is Jesus still interceding for the elect since they are already saved?\n12. 47:44 Do you believe Solomon was saved seeing as he died worshiping false gods?\n13. 48:55 I preach with a stutter, and sometimes it can be very discouraging! I know God uses it still, but do you have any advice for me, both practical and biblical? It tends to be worse when I'm nervous or tense.\n14. 52:18 If you could visit any one moment in both the Old and New Testaments, what would it be, and how do you know when you’re ready to disciple others?\n15. 54:58 Could you clarify the difference between forgiveness and salvation?\n16. 56:27 How would someone test a prophecy until it had or haven't come to pass? Including you for all of the Trump prophecies?\n17. 58:42 I constantly sin. I have prayed, struggled, and fought to stay on the narrow path. I can't seem to stop sinning. The guilt is still there but there is no change. Can a heart be too cold to change?\n18. 1:02:48 In Hosea, God sends a message through Hosea and the names of his children. His family has to live with their children named things like \"not loved\" (Hosea 1:6). Does Hosea deserve this?! Is this a type of Christ, bearing others’ burdens? Is there more beyond the simple meaning of \"Your child will be given a horrible name to get the attention of Israel\"?\n19. 1:05:40 What to do when tempted with lust online? I watch it to deal with stress & struggled to stop this week without it. I repent & believe the gospel, but I feel like my house is built on sand.\n20. 1:08:25 I'm a biblical studies major with an end goal of being an online youth pastor. Do you have any advice about interpreting the Scriptures faithfully for the next generation?\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me. Clarity is paramount.\n2) Wait till we go live before asking. We don’t take questions until then.\n3) Put a “Q” at the beginning of your question.\n4) Please only ask once, our mods are checking the chat continually.\n5) I’m truly sorry if I’m unable to get to your question. I know its a bummer, but I am doing my best.\n6) If you arrive late we may have already gathered 20 questions. Please check the live chat to see if we are full on Qs. Thanks!\n\nHelping you learn to think biblically about everything, because the Bible is more brilliant, beautiful and life-changing than most of us have realized.\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

As someone who has studied the Bible & believes the story of Adam & Eve, I want to learn more about the timeline. How are there fossils?\n3. 16:10 I saw your video explaining that babies go to Heaven and I agree with you. Does this apply to people with severe dementia (so they can't repent) because they had a clear mind before?\n4. 17:38 How do you respond to people who say that religion is just a way to control society (perhaps even in a good way) and that it just psychologically helps people not to fear death?\n5. 22:18 Do you think Matthew 23:8-12 means that we shouldn’t use ministry titles? Elders (1 Timothy 3) and Pastors (Ephesians 4) seem to be roles and gifts rather than titles.\n6. 28:47 Trying to wrap my head around why God would create people that He knew would not choose Him. What are your thoughts?\n7. 31:59 Any advice on how to humbly share Jesus with loved ones who are facing struggle? I find that most people are defiant or see you as a Bible thumper on a high horse, even some believers.\n8. 34:59 I’m a teen and got saved in March. I haven’t read the entire Bible yet. How can I protect against false doctrines and test them when I haven’t read the entire Bible?\n9. 37:09 In your view, what is the fate of the Devil? Romans 16: 20 uses a verb (“crush”) that is common in warfare contexts, suggesting destruction. See also Hebrews 2: 14. How does this all work with 1 Corinthians 15: 24-28?\n10. 40:37 I constantly hear the cliché, “God is in control.” Is it anything more than a meaningless platitude? It seems to me theologically sloppy, and implies divine determinism, which I reject.\n11. 42:34 What are your thoughts on \"Generational Curses\"? Can believers be \"cursed\" by the actions of a parent or grandparent, or by having Native American blood?\n12. 46:35 How do you know a vision given with eyes open while you're very lucid, is from the Holy Spirit and not your actual subconscious?\n13. 48:19 Is it biblical to pronounce a blessing on someone? E.g. with words like \"I bless you...\"? I can sense a good wish but also looking down on someone (Hebrews 7:7).\n14. 51:00 Why is Jesus called “everlasting Father” in Isaiah if He’s not the Father according to Trinitarian explanation?\n15. 53:25 Is it possible that the current trend and level of awful political prophecies is actually setting up the Antichrist rather nicely to come and “save” the world? Will he be a progressive?\n16. 57:33 I recently joined a ministry that goes into strip clubs to spend time with the women in the clubs. I've gotten backlash from my family and I’m just curious if in your opinion it is Biblical. \n17. 59:32 I joined a prayer group at my church. This prayer group is discussing and praying for unbiblical things, and using a concerning “devotional” (Jesus Calling). What should I do?\n18. 1:01:14 Why did Paul warn the Corinthians about \"another Jesus\" in 2 Corinthians 11:4? How is that relevant for us today, in light of John 17:3?\n19. 1:05:21 My family is “oneness” and wanted me to get baptized their way forever. I was baptized at my trinitarian church and didn't tell them, to avoid disputes, but should I have been bold in my faith (from a teen)?\n20. 1:08:06 Is there Biblical evidence for ghosts? Maybe not if a soul can only go to Heaven or Hell? Have those who believe they've seen ghosts actually seen demons?\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "I still remember when I first started to realize that we had completely misused the words of Jesus. It took a while to be able to confront the fact that the teachers I had been so blessed by had actually reversed the meaning Jesus intended when He spoke these words. I hope that I can encourage us today to have humility and greater accuracy when dealing with end times prophecy and how current events might play in to God's end times plans. Humility itself can save us from a lot of errors and lessen the harm caused even when we do fall into error. In short, today's study shows how many of the things people often appeal to as indicators that the second coming is soon are actually not indicators at all.

    "title": "20 Questions with Pastor Mike (Episode 18)",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction - Allow me to deflate myself.\n1. 5:16 What are your thoughts about Hillsong? Are they a progressive Christian church? Is their theology sound?\n2. 13:48 Is it o.k. for Christians have icons in their home?\n3. 19:06 Did the apostles speak a language everyone understood in Acts 2, or did each one speak one of the foreign languages? Any thoughts? Also, why exactly did some people mock them?\n4. 25:06 Can you tell me your thoughts/insights about “missionary” Spencer Smith? He’s a fundamental Southern Baptist whose ministry seems more a witch hunt than the Gospel. \n5. 26:48 Can a spiritual gift be taught? I am of the mind that no spiritual gift can be taught simply because a gift is, by definition, free to the recipient. The gift costs nothing.\n6. 30:47 I am struggling to find a good response to Leviticus 25: 44-46 in terms of the Bible endorsing slavery. What are your thoughts on this passage?\n7. 41:37 What does it mean for believers to be \"one in us\" (the Father and the Son) in the same way that they are in each other? John 17: 21 has me confused.\n8. 46:26 I've heard my grandma say that sometimes she doesn't pray out loud so that the devil can't hear her, because \"the devil can't know our thoughts.” Is there biblical basis for this?\n9. 48:32 If God is the potter and I'm the clay, am I responsible for my own life, or not? Is it up to me to make something of myself, or is it my job simply to trust and obey God (and His will for my life)?\n10. 51:12 Which “form” does Jesus have in Heaven: a human one, or a shapeless one? I am having a hard time picturing Him in my prayers.\n11. 53:24 How do we know that the long book of Jeremiah which we use today is the right one (instead of Jeremiah in the Septuagint which is much shorter)?\n12. 55:14 Can you explain Matthew 25: 14? What are the “bags of silver”? Are they the same as in 1 Corinthians 3: 12 (gold, silver, etc.)? \n13. 57:46 What’re your thoughts on Christian Rock/Metal? Is it difficult (or even impossible) to honor God and spread the Gospel using genres often expressing dangerous messages and imagery? \n14. 1:00:18 How do you respond to someone who demands you give a chapter and verse from the Bible to support any claim you make regarding things that tend to be more nuanced or situation specific.\n15. 1:01:36 Is it biblical to anoint your home with oil that you’ve prayed over to combat spiritual warfare?\n16. 1:03:33 I was baptized as an infant in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, but got saved a little over a year ago. Should I get baptized again?\n17. 1:05:06 Hosea 8:4 vs. Romans 13:1? My county hasn’t allowed more than 2 households together in months. I want to be subject, but I wouldn't consider this a \"godly\" law as He taught hospitality. Thoughts?\n18. 1:10:13 I've heard Mormons equate Paul's conversion experience with Joseph Smith's in order to justify Mormonism. From an apologetics standpoint, why is Paul's conversion story credible?\n19. 1:12:59 On the subject of divorce, can the offending spouse remarry after trying to reconcile? Or is remarriage only available for the offended? What if the offense is sexually immoral to some, but not to others?\n20. 1:15:04 Is imputed righteousness biblical? I find Evangelical Christians will say “the blood covers my sins,” but the Bible says we have to turn from wickedness.\n21. 1:18:01 (Bonus Q!) Can you please give your thoughts on the New Century Version, The Amplified Version, and the Contemporary English Version of the Bible? I heard your video on translations, but these were not mentioned. I use the ESV and NLT mainly, but I like to use others from time to time, too.\n\nHere’s the video I did going through a variety of passages related to slavery https://youtu.be/l2q3fql-BlY\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "title": "Dr. Craig Blomberg Reviews The Passion Translation Book of 1 Corinthians",
    "description": "I've hired a number of scholars to review Brian Simmons' seriously flawed Bible version.\nOpen this description for time stamps to specific issues covered in the video.\n\nThis is my \"Passion Project\". Today's video features Dr. Craig Blomberg and his thoughts after reviewing the book of 1 Corinthians in The Passion Translation. Scroll down for links to Dr. Blomberg's paper. This same link will have ALL the reviews and papers as they are published. You should see a total of 5 uploaded by the beginning of January. After that I will need to wait a while for more scholars to finish their papers and do interviews. I hope to have it all done in the next few months. What's was my goal with this? I want the people of Christ to know the truth about this \"translation\" so that they can love what God has said without Brian Simmons altering it in unjustified ways. However, in the course of researching for this project I've uncovered some other very concerning things about Brian Simmons' teachings including false prophecy and various extreme claims regarding his own spiritual experiences. I'll be sharing some of this in future videos as well since I have realized that he is not just styling himself as a Bible translator but as an inspired Bible interpreter who is going to release a last days transformation in the people of God so that \"everything that can be said about Jesus can be said about you\". Yeah, it's weird.\n\nDr. Blomberg’s paper: https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Craig-L.-Blomberg.pdf\n\nLINK to all interviews AND papers https://biblethinker.org/the-passion-project/\n\nDr. Blomberg’s – Can We Trust The Bible? https://www.amazon.com/Can-Still-Believe-Bible-Contemporary/dp/1587433214\n\nFor even MORE content on TPT here is a playlist of my own research into this translation. I think it’s even worse than many of the scholars have said, because they restricted themselves to reviewing the translation text of a single book each, and only glancing at the footnotes, whereas I looked at the work as a whole and found various other issues including misleading statements from Brian about his own experience as a translator for the Paya Kuna Bible, his degree of education and even stunningly false prophecies he has given. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvXha4rjCj1Po0WLQc_jGGW \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:17 Why this video is important: Brian Simmons wild claims.\n1:55 What my Passion Project is.\n2:35 Who is Dr. Blomberg and why is he reviewing TPT?\n4:52 Dr. Blomberg's attitude toward paraphrases.\n6:41 Dr. Blomberg is not driven by bias against TPT but by credible concerns.\n7:51 Is TPT misleading people when it calls itself a \"translation\"?\n9:27 A great example of why TPT isn't a translation.\n10:07 The \"glaring, recurring error\" in TPT's footnotes (the \"Aramaic\").\n12:38 This is REALLY bad. Brian Simmons is deceiving people about what \"all the scholars\" think.\n17:37 Simmons' knowingly misuses Mike Bird's scholarship even after Dr. Bird rebuked the misuse.\n19:42 Brian Simmons claims that his FOOTNOTES in TPT are the result of God's inspiration.\n23:50 Why we should reject Simmons' claims.\n24:53 Why the \"lack of italics\" in TPT is deceiving people.\n27:29 1 Cor 1 vv. 11-12 that show TPT is inconsistent with italics.\n30:38 How Simmons messes up the \"gender role\" passage in 1 Corinthians.\n35:07 Simmons has an axe to grind on the topic of women which he seems to be wrongly forcing into his translation of the Bible. \n38:48 The one place where Simmons translation seems complementarian. \n43:26 What attracts people to The Passion Translation?\n45:03 Examples of Simmons adding \"passion\" to the Bible where he shouldn't.\n46:08 TPT is named after and angel that Brian saw, according to Brian Simmons.\n46:38 How Brian represents TPT as if it's a quality work without bias.\n47:42 But Brian sometimes admits his translation is very much a sectarian work.\n52:03 Simmons \"reverses Paul's meaning\" in 1 Cor 10 v. 13.\n56:05 TPT perpetuates a \"long standing mistranslation\" in 1 Cor 11.\n1:01:11 Dr. Blomberg thinks TPT can cause a doctrinal problem with the Trinity.\n1:04:11 An example of hyper-charismatic alterations in TPT.\n1:10:35 TPT once again mishandles a passage related to slaves.\n1:13:39 Quick recap of other places TPT does this.\n1:14:32 1 Cor 7 v. 36 is \"particularly confused.\"\n1:17:18 The best parts of TPT are also the worst parts.\n1:18:11 1 Cor 13 shows us TPT's style.\n1:21:21 Don't use TPT as a serious Bible.\n1:22:13 Dr. Blomberg responds to Bill Johnson's quote.\n1:23:33 TPT distorts the meaning of the Bible?\n1:24:19 Misleading claims from TPT web site.\n1:25:23 Should TPT be in apps and sites?\n1:27:21 Did Brian really get secrets from God?\n1:29:15 Brian's abuse of homonyms in the name of God.\n1:33:29 Dr. Blomberg's advice to someone who loves TPT.\n1:34:34 A Surgeon General's warning.\n1:36:02 Can We Still Believe The Bible?\n1:37:40 Last things.\n1:39:56 \"Cameo\" from Brian.",

    "description": "Fakery, false spirituality and money-grubbing is a multi-million dollar industry. But it's not new. Jesus warned us about these issues in the first century and they just keep coming up again and again. But I don't think we would be wise to limit this warning to an issue that we see in some leaders. We should take seriously the fact that humans seem to have a natural drift from authentic spirituality to impersonated spirituality. From genuine character and godliness to laboring at the appearance of character and godliness. This is something that leaders will probably be tempted with the most but any one of us can fall into.

    "description": "Open for timestamps to each question (I did 25 of them today).\n\nMy teaching on the fate of those who die without ever hearing the gospel. https://youtu.be/IiyxpE5UBz4\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 1:56 When reading and studying the Bible, when is a good time to refer to a second translation to clarify what I’m reading?\n2. 5:22 How do we reach a fellow believer who is not only believing in the lies but siding with them in the MSM when it comes to politics (i.e. Trump) or about any conservative viewpoint?\n3. 9:11 How can we look at Psalm 37: 4 without falling into a WOF trap?\n4. 15:27 Can a Christian work in the CIA, NSA, etc. when lying and deception is part of the job? You lie to enemies, other times you lie to your family, ex: saying you work for State dept. to maintain cover.\n5. 20:47 Over the past year, my wife has gained a lot of weight. She’s been wanting to have more intimacy, but lately I don’t feel any sexual desire or lust toward her. Is sexual deprivation toward a spouse a sin?\n6. 27:28 Mike, any comments for Christians? US Congress convened in the name of the Hindu god Brahma, and all the other monotheistic Gods called by other names. Then they said, Amen, Awoman… Idolatry?\n7. 30:50 How can my relationship with God grow even more? I have felt so many times that I am “not there yet” or as if the fire I used to have is gone and something is wrong between me and God.\n8. 33:51 The Epistle of Jude cites Enoch and the Testament of Moses. How do we know this letter isn't a fabrication of sorts like from Gnostic sects, and was snuck in during the council that established the NT?\n9. 36:26 Please recommend reading for marriage counseling. Christian counselors say too submissive = codependent; biblical counselors say if you're submissive enough your spouse will repent (about 1 peter 3:1).\n10. 43:39 What happens to all of the people who lived and died before Jesus was born? How will they be judged and saved?\n11. 46:00 I am an ex-Catholic still doing a daily Rosary. I understand the theological problems. Can you suggest a replacement daily devotional?\n12. 51:46 Does Hebrews 2: 17 \"like them in every respect\" indicate that Jesus had the same human nature as we do in every way? If so, can we conclude that we, like him, are born with an innocent human nature?\n13. 54:32 Christians are using John 16: 13 to qualify a wide variety of claims, believing that the Holy Spirit led them to particular beliefs or practices. To what extent does this apply to a Christian today?\n14. 58:47 I watched the conscience video and Romans 14: 23 confuses me. My conscience is so weak at the moment that I doubt just about everything…basic things. Should I obey my anxious inklings every time? \n15. 1:02:37 What are your thoughts about going to church during a pandemic?\n16. 1:03:50 In Judges 20: 18, why did God appear to deceive Israel and Judah as they sought His help in bringing justice on the tribe of Benjamin? They lost 40,000 people before He actually helped them.\n17. 1:10:53 If the man in the Gospel of Mark was born blind, how did he even know what trees look like? This troubles me a bit. \n18. 1:12:32 Do we have extrabiblical evidence for the earthquake & darkness that took place at the time of the crucifixion?\n19. 1:13:21 In the U.K., COVID-19 laws are getting stricter. As Christians, are we obligated to follow these rules even we think some of them are pointless and could put a strain on relationships?\n20. 1:15:19 What are your thoughts on baptizing children? my 8-year-old has made a profession of faith that we feel is genuine. Should we wait until he is older, say 12 or 13?\n21. 1:18:10 Have you reached out to Dr. Michael Brown to discuss TPT? I believe he endorsed it. I've been loving the passion project by the way!\n22. 1:19:07 Are re-baptisms biblical?\n23. 1:21:02 What do I do if I have to be around someone who is easily angered and I have to walk on eggshells?\n24. 1:22:40 I recently started posting Christian YouTube videos, and I have really enjoyed your second channel where you give advice for YouTube. Do you plan on still doing that in the future?\n25. 1:23:48 Why does the Holy Spirit grieve, and not the Father or Jesus?\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "title": "What Dr. Douglas Moo Thinks About Romans in The Passion Translation",
    "description": "Open description for time stamps. Welcome to my Passion Project! Where real scholars test the wild claims of Brian Simmons about his new Bible, The Passion Translation, so that YOU can know what’s really going on with this suddenly popular new Bible version.\n\n Today's video features Dr. Douglas Moo and his thoughts after reviewing the book of Romans. Dr. Moo has invested much of his scholarly life on the book of Romans and I am so excited to have such an expert weigh in on The Passion Translation. There's a link below to where I will put ALL the reviews and papers as they are published. You should see a total of 5 uploaded by mid-January. After that I will need to wait a while for more scholars to finish their papers and do interviews. I hope to have it all done in the next few months. What's was my goal with this? I want the people of Christ to know the truth about this \"translation\" so that they can love what God has said without Brian Simmons altering it in unjustified ways. However, in the course of researching for this project I've uncovered some other very concerning things about Brian Simmons' teachings including false prophecy and various extreme claims regarding his own spiritual experiences. I'll be sharing some of this in future videos as well since I have realized that he is not just styling himself as a Bible translator but as an inspired Bible interpreter who is going to release a last days transformation in the people of God so that \"everything that can be said about Jesus can be said about you\". Yeah, it's weird. Stay tuned to my channel for more info on this in the coming weeks.\n\nLINK to download Dr. Moo's paper on The Passion Translation https://biblethinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Douglas-Moo.pdf\n\nLINK to all interviews AND papers as they are uploaded. https://biblethinker.org/the-passion-project/\n\nIf you are interested in Dr. Moo's books and commentary they can be found here.

    "title": "Letting Jesus Settle Our Theological Debates: The Mark Series pt 50 (12:35-37)",
    "description": "What's super interesting to me about what Jesus says here is that, in one short passage He covers the nature of the inspiration and authorship of the Bible, how messianic hermeneutics functions, and the identity of the Messiah as greater than they had known. In a couple sentences he gives us so much clarity and tools for our own understanding and interpretation of the Bible. And also shows some clever behavior in asking His own question to finally trump the numerous trick questions of the opposition. Showing superior knowledge of God, Messiah and the Scripture. Jesus is awesome!\n\nHere’s that video on Melchizedek and how he represents Christ. https://youtu.be/qP-m85M8HWk\n\nFeel free to use my videos in your own gatherings as an aid to studying Scripture.

    "description": "Open video description for time stamps.\n\nHere's the video I mentioned which explains the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit https://youtu.be/KmCHX8-2Smo\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:29 What are your upcoming plans and/or announcements for this coming year?\n2. 12:04 You seemed to imply in a previous video that the dead can be aware of what happens on Earth. How do you reconcile that with Ecclesiastes 9:5, which says \"the dead know nothing\"?\n3. 16:00 In Genesis 4, what is your take on why God was not pleased with Cain’s sacrifice? The text says he was a worker of the ground, and Abel was a cattle owner, so wouldn’t it make sense that Cain would give grain and Abel would give meat, since those were just their individual professions?\n4. 21:02 If soul sleep isn't a thing, people who have been resurrected are essentially being snatched out of Paradise or Hell and put back into a body. Why would that be?\n5. 23:34 Scripture is clear that we are sinful, but do Christians sin every second, minute, and hour?\n~(Bonus Q) 26:51 I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness and baptized as a kid, but not in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. How do I know what church to choose now, and who should baptize me? I’m afraid of being misled.\n6. 30:57 In your video on Mark 11: 22-25 you talked about how important the Temple was for the Jews in regard to prayer. But didn't God hear the prayers of believers like Daniel without a temple?\n7. 33:35 The other day my friend/future roommate, a Christian, told me he has pursued a gay lifestyle since March. Any advice on points to hit when he and I are able to talk again?\n8. 37:28 Is it sinful to not want to marry? How do I know if I'm called to stay single?\n9. 39:22 A lot of people like \"happy church\" where everything is \"positive.” Thus, positivity and negativity become moral categories. What are the dangers of this approach?\n10. 43:20 Who was the most notable old testament leader in your mind, and why? I am doing a study on biblical leadership and would love your response. \n11. 44:10 Do you have any suggestions for someone who procrastinates on deeply studying the scriptures in fear of messing up? I want to study theological topics like eschatology, but fear I'll do it wrong.\n12. 46:15 I have 100 Qs, but could you pray for me? I'm anxious about my salvation and fear often that I've blasphemed the Holy Spirit. Also, how can we be praying for you and your wife?\n13. 49:15 If we can’t “lean on our own understanding” or trust in man or a group and there are many ways to interpret the Bible, how do we know whether we are following our heart or conscience?\n14. 56:05 Does God actually love us unconditionally? Does He still love the people whose conscience He intentionally hardens, those who blaspheme the Holy Spirit, and those who go to Hell?\n15. 59:05 Ehrman says the word for “born again” in Aramaic doesn’t have the double meaning it has in Greek, thus the conversation couldn't have gone the way it is referred to in John 3. What is the solution?\n16. 1:03:12 What practices in a party/wedding should be different for Christians vs. non-believers? Or what should one not practice as a Christian…drinking? Dancing?\n17. 1:05:56 Do you think the apostles taught the doctrine of imminence? Could it have been possible for someone like Peter who knew he was going to die according to Jesus’ words? Can we believe it today?\n18. 1:08:23 1 Corinthians 11: 10 states that the husband has authority over his wife, and Ephesians 5: 23 states the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the Church. Since Christ disciplines the Church, is there biblical grounds for wife discipline, and to what extend can a husband enforce his authority?\n19. 1:13:20 How literally should we take what is said about Hell? Is it a literal place of fire, gnashing of teeth, etc., or is it metaphor? Is either interpretation wrong?\n20. 1:14:37 My kids (2 & 4) received children's books on evolution from a family member for Christmas. How would you approach the situation of receiving the books and introducing children to other worldviews? My wife and I want to teach our children about worldviews other than Christianity and allow them to think about and respond to them. They will inevitably be introduced to evolution, etc.\n1:16:23 Closing announcements and a bonus!\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:18 Is the command in Genesis to “be fruitful and multiply” still applicable to us today? Is it wrong for married couples to choose not to have children if they don’t feel the desire or the calling to be parents?\n2. 13:43 Am I being too legalistic by not wanting to sing Hillsong, Elevation Worship, and Bethel Music due to the doctrines of the churches they are a part of?\n3. 17:50 Can you please talk about your view on Netflix? Should Christians cancel their Netflix subscription?\n4. 19:33 Why did the Holy Spirit leave Saul, and why did an evil spirit from the Lord enter into him? Why in the world would God do something that seems to be evil?\n5. 22:25 Shmuley Boteach says that the New Testament contains anti-Semitic propaganda, and that Christians should reject those passages as forgeries. What do you think?\n6. 24:56 I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness and baptized as a kid, but not in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. How do I know what church to choose now, and who should baptize me? I’m afraid of being misled.\n7. 28:06 I have liberal Christian friends who believe they are Christians, but also have many unbiblical beliefs and practices. How should 1 Corinthians 5: 11 affect my relationships with them?\n8. 31:52What does the Bible say about the role of church? Should it be focused more on reaching unbelievers, or on teaching believers who then go out and evangelize?\n9. 34:28 Do you ever plan to do a deep dive into the authorship of the contested Pauline epistles? I feel this would be a great resource for those in talks with more liberal Christians.\n10. 35:24 What are the steps to take while dealing with psychological doubts where no amount of reason helps you feel better?\n11. 39:06 Do you think the SDA church (Seventh Day Adventism) is a cult?\n12. 39:37 I have family that believes that Jews will go to Heaven even if they haven’t been saved by Jesus. What should I say to them when they say that?\n13. 42:37 How does God’s will not infringe on free will? What is the sense of even praying for a situation if it’s already in Gods will?\n14. 44:48 Do you believe amillennialism is biblical, and what arguments do you have for or against it?\n15. 46:00 I feel called to spread God's Word but I suffer greatly from Asperger's Syndrome. Is my fear of crowds, public speaking, and inability to convey a thought coherently a valid fear?\n16. 48:10 I got away with felonies years ago. No one got hurt & I have confessed to God & repented. Is the Godly thing to do to turn myself in? I have OCD & can’t tell if I’m feeling OCD or God's conviction.\n17. 48:53 If the Angels weren't \"100% safe\" in Heaven seeing as they were able to be seduced by Satan, how can we be certain we will be safe in eternity with God once we go to Heaven.\n18. 51:24 I have recently gotten back into full-time ministry. I'm dealing with online “heresy hunters” that badger me through email and such about my teaching. How do you handle these kinds of people?\n19. 54:10 Can you talk about why Jesus allowed Simon to help Him carry His cross?\n20. 55:45 How much utility should we find in the Church Fathers? I am still Protestant, but want to be consistent with historic Christianity, so should we view the fathers with any extra credibility?\n\n1:00:24 Passion Project Update & Closing Announcements\n\nHere's my study on Penal Substitutionary Atonement - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4bTHScjdEo&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHttVR0rkvhBfA-IKrg5SGcp\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "Here's Tim Barnett's answer to the challenge! I hope you'll consider subscribing to his channel. It's one of my favorite Christian YouTube channels and they are just getting started! https://youtu.be/WWN48lqa-sY\n\nIt's not very easy to deal with so many confusions and misconceptions with only 18 seconds per answer. As I'm typing this I don't know if Tim made it under 3 minutes or not, so we may all end up atheists anyways. Oh well. \n\nHere's my video on \"Did God create evil?\" which explains Isaiah 45:7, among other things. https://youtu.be/GSToZ_4yh54\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:09 If aliens do exist, how would that affect the faith of Christians? Would aliens disprove Christianity?\n2. 16:19 Regarding 1 Corinthians 7: 14 where it speaks of sanctification for the unbeliever if married to a believer, I have found it hard to understand that passage and was wondering if you could help me.\n3. 20:11 Have you heard of the Documentary Hypothesis, and if so, can you tell me your thoughts about it? \n4. 22:00 I believe in Christianity, but I have major doubts about Heaven & a fear of death. Can I know for sure while here on earth that it's true? \n5. 27:00 How is Hebrews 13:2 to be interpreted? Have some people literally entertained angels without being aware? Do angels actually interact with creation in a tangible sense?\n6. 30:39 I often hear Christians say that when we face big struggles it's because good things are coming. Is there any Biblical truth to this, or is this just a different version of the prosperity gospel?\n7. 32:04 Is “revival” biblical?\n8. 33:42 Why does Isaiah 9:6 call Jesus the “everlasting Father”? Oneness Pentecostals keep using this verse against me and I haven’t seen a good response. I don’t want to twist the Bible.\n9. 34:56 I have such a sensitive conscience that I feel it’s a burden sometimes. People can’t even remember what I’m apologizing for! How can I change this? Not to be free to sin, but to live.\n10. 37:36 Are women allowed to speak at all during Bible study? Such as read the Bible, pray the opening/closing prayer, or give commentary, and just not teach? Or do we have to be completely silent the entire time?\n11. 38:07 What are your thoughts on Judges 11 and why Jephthah made his vow and followed through with it, even after God's Spirit was on him?\n12. 43:35 Why don’t we celebrate Jewish holidays? God says in the OT to observe them forever. During the 1,000 year reign with Christ, we all observe them. Why don’t grafted-in Christians observe them now?\n13. 46:00 I am trying to disciple my dad and he says he believes in Christ, yet wants nothing to do with Him. What do I do?\n14. 47:53 How would you recommend determining credible commentaries, studies, & pastors? I am a new Christian & have concern about being inadvertently led astray by unbiblical interpretations & viewpoints.\n15. 49:20 Mike describes himself as “charismatic” a lot. I’m just wondering if he can clarify what he means by that. Does he or his church practice the “gifts of the Spirit,” like tongues, prophecy, etc.?\n16. 54:00 How can you know for sure that a loved one went to heaven?\n17. 54:44 I have heard the range for Jesus' death to be between 26-36 (A.D.) with 30 and 33 being the most agreed upon contenders for Jesus’ death. Can we know for certain the exact year He died?\n18. 55:58 If God said He would rid all creatures with a flood, what happened to the fish? And if they died, how did they multiply, because fish can’t be on an ark?\n19. 56:29 Are \"white lies\" ok, to spare your spouse’s feelings? For example, when they ask what someone said and you say \"I'm not really sure,\" but you do remember.\n20. 59:09 How much freedom do we have in the marriage bed? Are some sexual acts prohibited even for married couples?\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me. Clarity is paramount.\n2) Wait till we go live before asking. We don’t take questions until then.\n3) Put a “Q” at the beginning of your question.\n4) Please only ask once, our mods are checking the chat continually.\n5) I’m truly sorry if I’m unable to get to your question.

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:09 One of my pastors used TPT on Sunday. What should I do? I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt that he just doesn’t know much about it, but I’m not happy at all that this “thing” (can’t even call it a translation) was used in my church. WWJD?\n2. 5:14 Have you any solid information on Nicky Gumbel, Alpha, and The Message Bible (which he recommends)? Couldn't find it in a search here, and some friends think he's OK!\n3. 10:29 What is the best way for me to prepare to one day be a pastor? I am 20 years old and attending college and then seminary. Any suggestions for the years of preparation ahead of me? \n4. 13:30 How do I organize my prayer life and find ways to serve the Lord in quarantine? \n5. 15:58 How would you respond to an abusive father who pushes the narrative to “honor your parents” (when he really means submit/worship) and disregards the Scripture to “leave and cleave”?\n6. 19:20 How do you go about finding scholarly articles for the studies you are doing? I have begun doing my own study going through Matthew, and some scholarly work would be really helpful! \n7. 21:26 What does the bible say about “listening prayer”? Should we spend time in silence listening for God's voice? \n8. 24:09 Why did God not desire for the people to “return and be healed” in Isaiah 6? \n9. 29:23 What did Jesus mean by turn the other cheek, give away your tunic, and go an extra mile in Mathew 5: 38-42? What about self-defense, or when being taken advantage of? \n10. 37:02 Is accepting Jesus in our life the only way to Heaven? For someone who has never heard the Gospel or has seen harmful representations of it (i.e. JWs), will they also be given grace? \n11. 41:00 How do I help my mother in law she says she has been ordained as an elder in the church and she is excited about it? thanks. \n12. 42:47 How do I find God? Praying and reading the Bible got me nowhere in 5 months. And church is not available at the moment. New Age gave me comfort while searching, but Christ only gave me confusion.\n13. 47:10 How do we study the Bible properly? \n14. 48:06 Is there any evidence on the inspiration of the canonization of the Bible? or is the canonization something that was helpful but not inspired and thus inspired texts beyond the Bible could exist? \n15. 52:28 Why did god create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil if His foreknowledge knew they would sin? \n16. 54:46 In Mark 8:5-9, why does Jesus ask for bread in vs. 5, and why do they bring the fish to Him in vs. 7? Does it mean Jesus cannot create food \"out of thin air,” but He needs something to start with? \n17. 57:36 Do you view the early chapters of genesis as mythology or as history? I know it’s not a key issue, but would love your opinion!\n18. 59:46 If I have turned away from the Lord after being close to him is there any chance of coming back to him? I basically lived like the world for a year and a half and don’t know if God is done with me. \n19. 1:01:05 Any tips on how to start believing? I've been atheistic all my life.\n20. 1:03:08 Our church believes you have the Holy Spirit once saved but can receive a prayer language through a separate experience called the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Is this scriptural?\nBonus Q: 21. 1:05:08 Should a Christian take the Covid vaccine?\n\nMy most recent video on The Passion Translation. https://youtu.be/2EtXBxAuZ3g\nBut interviews with scholars are coming very soon!\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "title": "Answering Hitchens' Impossible Question",
    "description": "This is a clip from one of the most important videos I've made, here's the full video - https://youtu.be/VIgVAlI8T2c\n\nChristopher Hitchens is an icon to many atheists. He was an entertaining mix of brilliant, snarky, irreverent and British. One thing he is well-known for is debating theists and making fools of them, at least from the perspective of some people. I was always struck by this particular challenge that he threw out regularly in debates. Hitchens was so proud of it that I once heard him encouraging crowds of atheists to use this challenge as well. He felt that it really proved something, and I dare say many atheists agreed. What's really odd to me is that none of his debate partners (to my knowledge) ever offered a good response to his challenge. This is odd because the primary moral of loving God with all our heart, mind, soul and strength answers this atheist dilemma quite well. It not only answers the question it gets right to the heart of what an atheist has lost when they have sadly embraced a false worldview which rejects God's existence. To any atheists that have read this far I'd like to say that this isn't meant to be a smackdown or a slap in the face. Rather, this is meant to open a door to the possibility that the most important thing in life is being robbed from you, and your atheism is the robber. \n\nAfter I uploaded this video a friend sent me a clip of William Lane Craig answering this challenge 10 years ago! I was surprised to see how similar his answer was and now I’m wondering how much my own answer may have been influenced by Craig’s but without me remembering it. Obviously we are both influenced by the teaching of Jesus, but still, It seems likely that I heard this somewhere along the way and forgot. Anyhow, here is Craig’s answer (he is always brilliant). https://youtu.be/qqt3Ie8l-fo\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

I'm really hoping that those who are open to hearing the evidence will consider ditching Brian Simmons' Passion Translation. The evidence is mounting up more and more that this is not a good or faithful Bible translation. As scholars weigh in on this work it's only becoming more and more evident that my early concerns about it were well-founded. I'm hoping that my brothers and sisters in the charismatic movement will have ears to hear this and that organizations like YouVersion, Bible Gateway and various Christian bookstores would stop carrying this problematic and misleading \"translation\". Stay tuned because I will start posting interviews with scholars VERY soon which will help to drive the final nail in the coffin of The Passion Translation. I love the word of God way too much to just stand by and tolerate such alterations being made to what God has said. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Jesus, save us from modern morals! Actually, that's pretty much what He does when a scribe asks Him to tell us the most important command in the Law. Jesus brilliantly and simply sums up not only the Law of Moses but the moral duty of mankind with two simple statements. Love God with all and above all and love others as yourself. Our job is to let this truth invade all our moral reasoning and to make sure we don't turn it into a cliché and rob it of it's beauty and life changing results. The way this truth saves us from modern morality is by installing love of God above love of self or others. Yeah, that's the part everyone gets wrong. But Jesus sets us right. To me, one of the most remarkable things about all this is that love and relationship is at the heart of the moral purpose of mankind. We exist for love. We literally have love as our highest and constant moral duty toward God and others. Wow. I'm literally blown away by this but how could it be any different? After all, God IS love. Let that sink in. \n\nMan, I LOVE this study through Mark!

    "description": "My video on why I think the death penalty is biblical. Please hear me out and if you disagree share why in the comments. https://youtu.be/gf259Qv2qv4\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:04 Is there a conflict between being pro-life and pro-death penalty at the same time?\n2. 3:54 Can you address what John means when he says that certain sins lead to death and some do not (1 John 5: 16-17)? Is there evidence in this passage that suggests you can lose your salvation?\n3. 7:37 When, in the research process, do you (1) know you have read enough secondary literature to comment on the topic and (2) become confident enough to share your conclusion with thousands of people?\n4. 12:40 Are there any verses in the Bible where it clearly states or implies that rights (life, liberty, and property) are inalienable and inherently possessed, as opposed to being dependent on self-ownership?\n5. 19:03 God answered Hagar directly. Both her and many others before and after Christ. Do you think God sometimes uses the still small voice today, or only directly through the Scriptures? (Hebrews 1:2)\n6. 24:53 Do you think that macro evolution is consistent with Scripture, since evolution works by death? As sin entered the world through Adam and through sin entered death (Rom 5: 12, Rom 8: 21-22).\n7. 29:06 In 1 Corinthians 14: 22, Paul says tongues are a sign for non-believers and prophecy is a sign for believers. The next verses seem to flip it though. I can't make sense of it but I wondered your take on it.\n8. 32:50 My parents think religion is stupid and I don't want to evangelize to them because they'll judge me and say that I'm stupid. Is that ok, or should I try anyway? If so, how?\n9. 35:47 How would you understand the numbers in Revelation 7: 4? What does it mean by \"144,000 were sealed\"? Does it mean only 144,000 are faithful Christians?\n10. 41:11 In 2 Peter 2:6, is the example of Sodom & Gomorrah literal? Does it mean that on the final day of judgment the ungodly will literally be condemned to extinction like they were?\n11. 43:58 Is the Athanasian Creed biblical (specifically the first part which seems to imply that one cannot be saved without believing the doctrine of the Trinity)?\n12. 45:53 Is it biblical to say that all temptation comes from Satan and the demonic? Or can temptation also come from your sinful self?\n13. 50:23 Is there biblical support for having monarchies today? What attitude should we have toward monarchy, specifically?\n14. 52:48 What is your view on the Creation account given in Genesis? Some people hold to a young earth, but with modern science, that seems unlikely. Questions then arise such as: did Adam and Eve exist?\n15. 59:22 Were Old Testament believers born-again? Could they be called (during their lives) \"children of God\" as Christians can be called nowadays?\n16. 1:02:06 Are nerdy hobbies (comics, movies, games, etc.) reconcilable with Christianity? Or should we discard them and use our time in other ways?\n17. 1:04:21 My pastor teaches that we are \"little Gods\" from the word of faith movement. I have disagreed with him in private conversation about this and he is firm in his belief. How important is this issue to salvation?\n18. 1:05:43 How does Israel in the Bible correlate to the present day political state of Israel? Are the promises for Israel meant for Israel today?\n19. 1:07:39 Is there a difference between the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven? If yes, can you explain it for me?\n20. 1:09:04 What do you think of “dual covenant theology” (the belief that Jews can be saved without believing in Jesus due to their special covenant with God)?\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "It's a bigger issue now than ever before in my lifetime. We live in an upside down and rebellious culture and this is seen nowhere more clearly than our attitudes toward sex, marriage, dating, gender and purity. Dr. Sean McDowell has just written a book that is meant to give people a biblical vision for loving God and loving others in these areas. And if that seems like a cliche to you then it's because you too have become victim to upside down thinking on these issues. As a youth pastor I discovered that the most common reason people have for serious moral failure in their lives is a lack of godliness in relationships, particularly romantic ones.  I'm happy to host Sean as we talk about this issue. Maybe you should get this book, for yourself or for someone else who can be saved a lot of pain and rebellion by getting their heads and hearts right on loving God in sexual purity.\n\nSean's book, available December 1st or for preorder now.  \"Chasing Love\" https://amzn.to/3f81xQM (affiliate link)\n\nSean's video on Transgender Identities (really good content here) \nHttps://bit.ly/36EGrWo   \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "title": "Progressive Christians Are The Modern Sadducees: The Mark Series pt 48 (12:18-27)",
    "description": "I'm amazed at the similarities that exist between modern progressive Christians and the Sadducees in the gospels. I'm even more amazed at how Jesus' roasting of the bad theology of the Sadducees applies to modern liberal theologians and progressives in general. Disclaimer: I am talking about religious progressives or liberal theology, not politics. It's true that those who have liberal theology tend to have liberal politics but they aren't the same thing. \nIn this continuing series through the Gospel of Mark we will see how Jesus brilliantly refutes the Sadducees (and progressives and even Mormons) and we'll learn how we can better identify and not fall victim to the tactics that liberal teachers often use to get us to abandon biblical truth. Man, I love this series and love how applicable it is in our lives today!\n\nThis is part 48 of a verse by verse study through the Gospel of Mark.\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nHERE is me dealing with a popular progressive/liberal Christian teacher named Brian Zahnd. This may be my BEST example of how to notice and combat the common tactics of progressives who sadly twist the heart of Christianity and do so in the name of Christ. https://youtu.be/QUNdh1u6774\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:44 Is it right or wrong to refute other pastors who publicly teach false teachings?\n2. 7:24 I was wondering if you could talk about and help me understand Mark 16: 17-18 (specifically verse 18). I haven’t seen those two signs played out...perhaps it could be metaphorical?\n3. 13:58 How should we interpret 2 Corinthians 12:2? Are there “levels” in Heaven? And does it have anything at all to do with the phrase “seventh heaven”?\n4. 17:55 Are Christians who believe that Genesis 1-11 is allegorical (unintentionally or not) denying the divinity and validity of Christ, considering what Jesus said in John 5: 44-47?\n5. 23:33 What are the biblical principles, if any, about keeping our bodies physically healthy, and to what extent? (Think smoking, piercings, or eating/exercise habits)\n6. 28:29 How do you respond to Matthew 16: 28?\n7. 32:09 Do Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 speak about Satan?\n8. 33:46 Can you explain what Lordship Salvation is, please?\n9. 35:54 How would you react if someone said that all truth is subjective and that there is no concept of truth, except what \"works for you\"?\n10. 37:50 When you first accept Jesus into your life, is that when you become \"born again\" and baptized with the Holy Spirit? Or are they two different things?\n11. 40:24 My bible teacher said my family is saved because I believe in Jesus, citing Acts 16: 31. I think she misused scripture. If so, how do I address the issue? Does forgiving mean trusting her again?\n12. 45:33 Is it a salvation issue if someone rejects the idea of Jesus being one and the same with God?\n13. 46:56 Are unbelievers forgiven to some degree? I'm looking at Luke 23: 34\n14. 50:40 My daughter was baptized in 2018, and came out as bisexual in 2019. Any thoughts on how to talk to her about this? I’ve tried!\n15. 53:08 What do you think about the Noahide Laws? I’ve been told that if they’re enacted, Christians would be found guilty of “idolatry” and executed. Should we be worried?\n16. 54:26 I've seen your Mormonism series and have met with Mormons quite often, and I am wondering, what might be a good approach to addressing their belief in \"sons and daughters of God\" and pre-mortal existence?\n17. 55:30 What are the \"seven spirits of God\"?\n18. 56:38 My in-laws are WOF leaders and church owners, and it’s a constant \"name it and claim it\" around them. Should we have a doctrine \"sit down,\" or just ignore? Its tough.\n19. 59:02 Should Christians drink alcoholic wine at the commemoration of the Lord's Supper? And must we use unleavened bread?\n20. 1:00:57 If I live in habitual sin from addiction, and I really want to overcome it but I keep backsliding, am I still saved, or am I using it as a license to sin?

    "title": "The Death Penalty Is Biblical... Obviously",
    "description": "If I put the Bible first, before politics, I will end up supporting the death penalty. But I think the Bible also answers some of the fears of those who do oppose the death penalty. This will basically be a survey of several key Bible verses that deal with the death penalty. From it's initial inception in Genesis 9 to it's use in the Old Testament Law and the important teaching in Romans 13 on the role of government in enacting lethal punishment. Along the way I'm going to answer a few challenges that I've heard regarding the death penalty.\n1) What about those who are innocent but get the death penalty?\n2) But didn't Jesus reject the death penalty when He said to \"turn the other cheek\" or when he wouldn't kill the adulterous woman?\n3) But God's justice is restorative and not retributive. And the death penalty ends any chance to restore the person who committed the crime.\n4) I just don't trust the government to get it right, therefore capital punishment should be off the table.\n5) But we aren't under the Law of Moses any more.\n\nI realize there are major ramifications for political issues related to this question but I want us to approach it first as a question of what the Bible teaches. This is my own commitment in trying to think biblically about everything and it's what I hope you will do as well. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

How does the writer of Hebrews know so much about him if there's only a few verses in the Hebrew Scriptures about him?\n3. 14:44 The Bible says that Satan is the \"god of this world\" (2 Cor. 4:4), but I know that God is sovereign over all things. How do I reconcile these two truths in a biblical way?\n4. 17:55 What are your thoughts on \"Oneness Pentecostalism\"?\n5. 19:13 Is marriage a choice? I've heard that marriage is God's will for most people, but I like Paul's argument in 1 Cor. 7: 25-40. If someone desires singleness, could it go against God's will?\n6. 22:20 In John 3 where Jesus says \"you must be born again,\" it isn't like you chose to be born, you just were. Any thoughts on that? \n7. 23:59 What are your thoughts on attending a wedding between a believer and an unbeliever?\n8. 25:40 My church encourages kids to participate in communion. My 4 year old does not participate because we feel she's not ready. Not because of sin, but not fully understanding what she's doing. Any thoughts?  \n9. 27:01 In regard to our spirit, soul, body, mind, and heart, what does each biblically consist of, and what is their purpose?\n10. 29:00 What are your thoughts on this prevalent kind of \"repentance-free Christianity\" where psychological goals (self-improvement/fulfillment) have replaced pursuing holiness?\n11. 32:57 Does Revelation 3: 16 mean that lukewarm Christians will not be in Heaven? (\"...because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spit you out of my mouth.\") What does lukewarm mean?\n12. 38:36 What happened to Jesus on the cross? What does it mean that He took God's wrath? Was it just pain and death like we deserved, or something more? Was it the equivalent of spending eternity in Hell?\n13. 43:51 I got saved a couple of months ago! Any tips on studying the Bible? Where could I look to get background information on different books of the Bible before I begin studying them?\n14. 45:39 Could you please explain why there are two demon possessed men in Matthew 8, but only one in Mark 5?\n15. 49:01 How do you respond to teaching that says the verses that say homosexuality is wrong are actually about pedophilia, and not about same sex relationships? Do you have a video on this?\n16. 51:20 What do you do if you can't live at peace with a family member at home?\n17. 52:45 I like David Wood, but do you think his approach is biblical? It is effective, but isn't it too harsh?\n18. 54:37 At Pentecost, they were mocked for appearing to be drunk. Does this suggest that we should expect laughing, shaking, or falling when closely sensing the Holy Spirit?\n19. 59:12 My friend told me that their relationship with God and religion in general is something they keep private. Is this biblical? How should I respond?\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "Here's all I want to know. What is Critical Race Theory and is it biblical? We'll answer both questions today with special guest Neil Shenvi. \nI agree that racism is a serious problem in our lives today. A very serious problem. But real problems can sometimes lead us to bad solutions. The solutions provided by Critical Race Theory (and concepts of \"whiteness\", \"systems of oppression\", \"internalized oppression\", the redefining of \"racism\" etc.) are actually solutions that involve more racism. It is injustice in response to injustice. It's unbalanced scales in response to unbalanced scales. It's prejudice in response to prejudice. A biblical Christian should recognize that because racism, partiality and injustice are serious issues, we can not embrace Critical Race Theory. This isn't about taking political sides or pleasing crowds, it's about being biblical and pleasing God.\n \nNeil Shenvi's web site - https://shenviapologetics.com/\nNeil Shenvi on Twitter - https://twitter.com/NeilShenvi\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "I'm not going to pull punches today. This isn't really a \"translation\" of the Bible. It is one man's attempt to replace the gospel with his own false teaching. His false teaching is truly heart warming and encouraging. Francois Du Toit is a brilliant man, skilled communicator and as far as I can tell he is absolutely sincere and well-meaning in replacing the gospel with his feel good message that the real problem with people is that they believe the gospel when it says that all have sinned, are deserving of judgment and need to be born again in Christ. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the Mirror Bible is the worst translation I've ever looked into. In today's video we will survey through a number of Bible passages he has mistranslated and explain how he is trying to fight against the clear teaching of the text and how he tries to use Greek to trick people (and himself) into believing his anti-gospel.

What is the \"all these things\" Jesus speaks of? Would the original audience/early church have thought He was referring to the second and final coming?\n3. 20:54 What does Matthew 26: 46 mean?\n4. 22:08 Can you explain the parable of the 10 virgins in Matthew 25:1? It cannot possibly mean that half the Church fails to enter in...or does it?\n5. 26:18 I've heard people support abortion using Numbers 5, specifically v. 27. What is your take on that?\n6. 30:43 The OT often calls the Old Covenant an eternal or everlasting covenant. If it is eternal and everlasting, how can there be a New Covenant?\n7. 32:22 If I don’t read the Bible and pray every day, I feel a huge amount of guilt - like I’ve sinned and am not even worthy to be a Christian. Is this kind of guilty conscience or conviction healthy, or not?\n8. 34:57 In Mark 7: 27-28, do you think that this passage is a good way to highlight that the eucharist is specifically spiritual and not physical flesh, or do you think it's not correlated enough?\n9. 36:26 What is the \"rod\" in Proverbs 13: 24? Is it a method of corporal punishment, or does it refer to a rod of truth with which we hold our children/households accountable to?\n10. 39:52 As a struggling Calvinist, could you explain the apparent favoritism of God throughout the Bible and why He \"chooses\" some over others? (ex. Jacob/Esau, Abraham, Prophets, and Moses.)\n11. 43:01 In Genesis 9, Noah seems to curse Canaan for the actions of his father, Ham. Do you think Noah cursed Canaan, or is Moses emphasizing Canaan on purpose?\n12. 44:26 How do you respond to the claim that Jesus came to dismantle systems of oppression? though He did dismantle \"systems\" like legalism, it also seems to diminish the Gospel when it becomes the focus.\n13. 45:55 My wife and I are wondering if the parable of the sower (Luke 8:4-15) clarifies Hebrews 6:4-6...We both believe salvation is eternal. Thoughts?\n14. 49:32 I don't feel the witness of the Holy Spirit or a love for God. I trust Christ to save me, but I'm not seeing fruit. Does the inward work of God take longer for some people?\n15. 52:19 ​Is \"the anointing\" a real thing, or is it just another word for the Holy Spirit? And can we get an anointing today? Any verses to support your argument?\n16. 53:54 How do we reconcile forgiveness for our sins by His work on the cross with being examined on Judgment Day? If we sin and receive forgiveness, will that be brought up again when we stand before God?\n17. 57:03 Would you ever recommend The Message Bible? Any possible problems you see with it?\n18. 58:53 Do you think some people focus too much on extravagant mission trips or campaigns instead of evangelizing by acting good in the world?\n19. 1:02:13 In 1 Corinthians 6: 12 & 1 Corinthians 10: 22, Paul says all things are lawful.

    "description": "Are there what appear to our eyes to be significant, deliberate, factual changes about the life of Jesus in the Gospels? Did the gospel writers seem to fabricate significant details about Jesus? If so, was this an expected and appropriate practice when writing a Greco-Roman Biography?

Even if you don't agree with my guest (I'm not entirely sure what all my own views are on this issue) I think it's valuable to hear what she has to say because she has gone to such great lengths to bring clarity to a pretty fuzzy area of scholarship where I am genuinely concerned that some well-meaning, wonderful Christian scholars are making some significant mistakes.\n\nGet Lydia McGrew's book \"The Mirror or the Mask: Liberating the Gospels from Literary Devices\" https://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Mask-Liberating-Gospels-Literary/dp/1947929070/\n\nLydia's new YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwhBk0vUSg_6prKkR82IDQ\n\nDr. Mike Licona (a genuine Christian who I respect) has a series of videos responding to Dr. Lydia McGrew's book which you can watch on this playlist on his YT channel https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPGCP1zKznR06Jxb5RaQYrNIiH7xR7ZR\n\nLydia McGrew did a series of videos in response to Mike Licona's series and you can watch that playlist on her YT channel at this link https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe1tMOs8ARn0S9CsFG47bKjcYxsnHujhg\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

And what is the one “point” you see as the hardest to reconcile?\n2. 16:17 Jesus cast out many demon-possessed people on Earth. With the explosion of the human population and religions, one would think this phenomenon would be more prevalent today, but it’s not. Any insight?\n3. 18:31 What's your response to the idea that Isaiah was written by multiple authors?\n4. 20:06 Do you believe that God is a matchmaker for Christian couples? The idea of waiting on “the one” whom God has chosen as your spouse? Some pastors say this is a waste of time, or unrealistic.\n5. 24:49 Is it biblically o.k. for a trinitarian Christian to marry a Oneness Christian?\n6. 25:41 In constructing a biblical theology, where do we start? How do we construct a biblical method for doing theology?\n7. 28:00 Any advice for a Christian who lives with parents that are always swearing, drinking, and watching vulgar things? Whenever I give them my opinion, they think I'm being judgmental. Am I?\n8. 30:09 My country, Armenia, a Christian Nation since 301AD, is defending their lives from genocide by Turkey & Azerbaijan. What are some actions I can take as a Christian? That is, can I go to war if it is to defend?\n9. 32:04 What separates us from an angel? They had (have?) free will too, right? Is it still possible for them to fall from grace/Heaven if they choose?\n10. 33:52 Have you heard of the Berisheet Prophecy in Genesis 1:1 regarding end times? It is something I've run into a lot recently and wanted to know if you have any thoughts on it.\n11. 34:46 My JW friend says the Greek for “soul” just refers to any living being (person or animal) and that the “immortal soul” is taken from the Greeks and was not a Jewish belief. How would you respond?\n12. 36:22 Do you plan to do more verse-by-verse studies of other books of the Bible? (Mark is great!)\n13. 36:59 Is it a sin for a Christian not to vote in elections? Will not voting negatively affect one's relationship with God? Thoughts or advice?\n14. 38:44 Is it better not to give if you can't do it cheerfully/lovingly, or would it be better to give even if reluctantly in order to pick up your cross and try to imitate Jesus? (I don't mean just money.)\n15. 40:39 What is the purpose of a church service? Should it primarily be for believers, or should it be intentionally inclusive of those in attendance who are not saved?\n16. 43:00 How do you respond to people who use verses like 1 John 3:6 to say that, as they mature in the faith, Christians come to a point where they will completely stop sinning?\n17. 46:05 I’ve been told by Christians that their relationship with God is personal and they don’t wish to discuss anything in regard to religion. Is this biblical?\n18. 48:18 What is your favorite Bible verse? (A verse that you would look at daily that gives you courage and strengthens you…or multiple?)\n19. 50:07 Where is God's help when fighting a porn addiction? Why does it seem that crying out in prayer yields little help, and even when resisting the temptation, I'm left exhausted?\n20. 54:54 Should Christians follow OT dietary laws? Many people point to Acts, but I'm stuck on the prophecy in Isaiah 66: 16-17 where eating pork still seems to be detestable to God, even in the end times.Every Friday at 1pm PT\n\nA biblical survey of the doctrine of divine hardening, which seem incompatible with Calvinism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMuiT_R0zFQ&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHu8PlY0J-G2B9Pyp59S0pLZ&index=4\n\nMy video on how faith is not a work and how this relates to Calvinist teaching. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxakEl8BYBE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHu8PlY0J-G2B9Pyp59S0pLZ&index=1\n\nAfter my first video on Limited Atonement I got a rebuttal video from Dr. James White and I did a MUCH more in depth response to the Calvinist reasoning and to Dr. White in a second video (both are linked below and you can find Dr. White's video in the description of the second)\n1st on Limited Atonement: https://youtu.be/DAKyQrAO3ps\n2nd (deeper theological discussion) on Limited Atonement: https://youtu.be/shpZMRhr4uM\n\nFor the question on obeying dietary laws here is my playlist on the Hebrew Roots movement.

    "title": "Does This Verse Belong in Your Bible: The Mark Series pt 46 (11:26)",
    "description": "Here is some more info from Wesley Huff on some specifics I didn’t get into in the video. \n\n“I think at face value it looks less like an example of homoiteluton and more of an assimilation of Matt. 6:15. It's included in most later MSS from my look but from both internal and external considerations doesn't appear to be viable as going back as an original reading.\n  Its absence from Vaticanus and Sinaiticus is significant, the text of Mark in those two is as stable as you can get. Not to mention that Codex Washingtonianus has it missing and Codex W is pretty important in being a witness to multiple text type variations (it includes Alexandrian, Byznatine, and Western text-type examples). Mind you, Codex W's section between Mark 5-16 is a bit of a hodge-podge textually, but it still remains pretty reliable throughout nonetheless. The oldest Syriac manuscript, the fourth-century Sinaitic Palimpsest, does not contain the verse, nor do the Palestinian Syriac copies which all raises questions of authenticity in my eyes.”\n\nWhy is this verse missing from the ESV translation? Why does it have brackets in the NASB? Here's a summary of the reasons why this verse may not be original and how I think we should think about it. This is the shortest video in the whole Mark series so far and I'm just tossing it out there in the middle of a bunch of other content but I thought it was worth taking some time to discuss. \n\nHere's the playlist to my three videos on manuscript issues and translations of the Bible (which I mentioned in the vid) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WclIZwBFhq0&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuzJhPtmrgqpVoXhjvqiIjW\n\nHere's the entire Mark series playlist.

    "description": "This was an \"in your face\" moment between Jesus and the leaders of the Jews. But what strikes me the most isn't just Jesus' rebuke of the leaders, or how cleverly He does it (so that they cannot charge Him with a crime), or how Jesus integrates Isaiah 5 into this parable of the vineyard. What strikes me the most is how they could be totally aware of the failures of their forefathers and totally blind to those same issues when they were to be found in themselves.

Will we see Him immediately, or is there some type of \"soul sleep\" that happens?\n2. 8:29 What do you think about pages like \"Memes for Jesus\"? Is it ok to make jokes about Bible stories or situations?\n3. 11:29 Premil, Amil, or Postmil - which view is the most correct?\n4. 13:37 Recently, many people have been uploading videos of their \"prophetic dreams,\" with many implying that the rapture will be within the next couple of months...What do you make of these dreams?\n5. 17:52 How do you answer a friend that says that \"spiritualism\" (all new age stuff, tarot, yoga, manifesting) needs to be rescued from the New Age & that spiritualism is pure and is what Jesus practiced?\n6. 23:08 We are proud that the NT is based on eyewitness accounts, but how could the Gospel writers have known what Jesus said and did while He was alone, like in the desert or the garden of Gethsemane?\n7. 26:20 Does the Bible support celebrating birthdays and Christmas? Recovering JW here.\n8. 30:36 If I get raptured before the Tribulation, will I, from my new place of residence, be able to do something good for my loved ones who were left behind on Earth?\n9. 32:34 Speaking of whether or not we go directly to Heaven or Hell when we die, what are your thoughts on the comma in Luke 23: 43? A lot of mortalists say it belongs after the word \"today\" instead of before.\n10. 36:38 My entire family is Pentecostal. They say I'm demon possessed and a male chauvinist because I believe Paul's teachings on women. Am I wrong to think that those family members may not be saved?\n11. 40:31 Have you seen \"The Chosen\" series? If so, what do you think of it?\n12. 43:45 I was reading Galatians, and got confused by Galatians 3: 23. I know that we are saved by our faith and not by the law, but what does it mean to be \"confined to\" and \"imprisoned by\" the law?\n13. 46:48 If Jesus was raised back to life as a human with a body, and not as a spiritual being, then how did He suddenly appear in the locked room with the disciples?\n14. 48:02 I would love to know your thoughts on what it means to pray \"in Jesus' name\" such as in John 16: 24.\n15. 50:10 If a man wants to be water baptized, do they need a specific level of understanding of the Bible and Christianity, or just the desire and a simple understanding of baptism?\n16. 51:39 How can I renew my love for God when He seems commonplace?\n17. 53:26 I have left a \"Word of Faith\" church and I am actively speaking out about their false doctrine, but it is affecting my relationship with my sister. What should I do?\n18. 55:04 How do we draw the line between wrestling with God and having vain repetitions in our prayers? How long is it appropriate to keep praying for something?\n19. 56:45 I am an aspiring pastor, and I hope to be the shepherd of a church one day. Until then, what are some good things for me to be doing? How can I prepare myself better for pastorship?\n20. 59:14 How do I speak to a pastor who tends to use feel good phrases like \"you are enough\" and \"Jesus came to bring a piece of Heaven to Earth\"? I find these phrases unbiblical.\n\nEvery Friday at 1pm PT\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "title": "The Catholic Magisterium Is a LOT Like the Sanhedrin: The Mark Series pt 44 (11:27-33)",
    "description": "It seems eerie to me how similar the claims that Roman Catholicism makes are to the claims that the Pharisees and Sanhedrin were making in the time of Christ. The Pharisees claimed to have and oral tradition that wasn't written down but was handed down through an elder-succession from Sinai to Jesus' time (which was simply not historically true). They claimed that this tradition was equal in authority to the written word. They claimed that they had a special right to interpret that Bible and felt more authority than they really possessed. They thought they were sitting in Moses' seat and carrying the continuation of his authority in their own role. Well, all of these points are alive and present in the claims of the Roman Catholic Magisterium. They claim to have an oral tradition that wasn't written down but is equal in authority to the New Testament (which is simply not historically true). They claim to have special right to interpret the Bible. They claim to have special authority over God's people due to a claim that they have apostolic succession in their leadership roles. They claim to sit in the seat of Peter and carry the continuation of his authority in their own role. All of the parallels make it really interesting when Jesus simply dismisses the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees in the New Testament. In other words, we have a sample of how Jesus might respond to modern Roman Catholicism in the way that He responded to the 1st century Sanhedrin. And I think we should respond the same way. \n\nThis is part 44 of a verse by verse study through the Gospel of Mark.\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:12 Are Christians supposed to \"tithe\"?\n2. 10:17  To what extent should Christians protect and retaliate? Should we do what we can to stop others from abusing others?\n3. 16:14 Someone wants to disciple me, and is asking for payment, citing Luke 8:1-3, Galatians 6:6, 1 Timothy 5:8 & 5: 18, Acts 2: 42, and 2 Samuel 23:8-17. Is being discipled similar to going to school, that you'd need to pay for it?\n4. 19:20 Hebrews 10: 26-27 seems to teach a non-merciful judgment for those who reject the Gospel but know its truth, does this mean mercy will be shown to those who haven't heard?\n5. 23:36 I grew up Lutheran but lately I’ve had doubts about how biblical Lutheran doctrine is. Would you consider covering it sometime? God bless you ministry, you’ve been a huge blessing!\n6. 25:07 Should we repent and ask the Lord for forgiveness of sins we commit in our dreams?\n7. 26:09 What is your practical advice for young man in small local church with growing call to do the ministry of the Word? It's a circle without ordained ministers, only lay preachers. Thank you!\n8. 30:00 How should I understand the warning against apostasy in Heb 6:4-6? It's hard to believe the experiences described do not refer to true believers. Yet salvation isn't earned, so how could it be lost? \n9. 30:54 If the Bible says that works born from within = no boasting/bad fruit, and works born from the Spirit = good fruit, then why do we think that faith born from within (prior to regeneration) is fruitful faith? Wouldn't faith born from our fallen nature be insufficient? Wouldn’t we be incapable of bearing ‘good fruit’ faith? (Similar to saying we had good works alone.)\n10. 36:15 Some folks on Facebook were flipping out about idea of \"Q\" that scholars talk about as a potential source material. Is it another Gospel? Can you speak to what the idea of \"Q\" as used in scholarship discussion is, to help calm some nerves?\n11. 39:01 What are your thoughts as to professed accounts of people (selling books about) visiting either Heaven or hell?\n12. 42:49 In John 3, what does the Bible mean by “unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God”? Is \"born of water\" referring to baptism, or is it referring to actual birth?\n13. 44:02 Is being charismatically \"slain in the Spirit\" biblical (falling backwards, animalistic sounds, etc.)? If it is, how do we discern someone being \"slain in the Spirit\" vs. being demonically possessed?\n14. 48:21 As an unemployed Christian, I feel convicted that I should not work at the cannabis sector, despite the fact that there are so many job opportunities now. As a Christian, can I apply to this sector, or not?\n15. 49:56 Many people are prophesying right now. It seems like the Lord is pouring His spirit out just like He prophesied. What are your thoughts on that?\n16. 51:37 I've heard you talk about annihilationism. Could you please expand on why you think it is not biblical. Does it affect any other doctrines? Can we disagree?\n17. 53:11 I’ve heard Calvinists say that God is not guilty for sin He decrees, because His purposes are good. This seems like a version of the “ends justify the means.\" Is this a biblical way of thinking?\n18. 55:45 What do you think of Grace Community Church disobeying the government of California by keeping their church open (since we are told to obey the government, but also to meet together as the Church)?\n19. 59:17 1 Cor 6: 19-20 is often quoted at people who use tobacco or sometimes those who are just overweight. What is the biblical basis (if any) for maintaining our bodily health?\n20. 1:04:58 What is Gossip? Is it simply sharing personal information about someone without their permission, even in a nice way? That is how I have understood it to be.\n\nHere is the podcast on interpreting \"born of water\" in John 3. Let me preface with this before you listen to it. I don't agree with all the reasoning here, in particular some of the objections to the evangelical view seem weak, but I do think the conclusion is probably the right interpretation of the passage. Also, some of this content will be hard to track with but in the end I think it's valuable and even if you don't get it all, that's how you really grow; listening to content that goes just a bit over your head. https://nakedbiblepodcast.com/podcast/naked-bible-330-the-exodus-and-john-35/\n\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "title": "A Serious Study of the Best \"Name-It-and-Claim-It\" Verse Ever: The Mark Series pt 43 (11:22-25)",
    "description": "This, right here, is probably the most powerful \"name-it-and-claim-it\" verse in the Bible. \n\nMark 11:23–24 (NASB95)\n“Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him. \n“Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.\n\nHonestly, I really struggled in prep for this study. At first I found myself wanting to just make sure that this passage wasn't used for the kind of stuff Kenneth Copeland teaches. \nBut I sensed that, in my desire to avoid a particular interpretation, I might be blinding myself to what the passage is saying. So, I took a different approach, one that I try to always take but one that was particularly difficult for me to do this time around. I took myself out of the debate over \"name-it-and-claim-it\" teaching in the 21st century and instead sought to thoroughly understand how this radical passage makes sense in the context of Mark and the rest of the New Testament. The result has been a really rewarding study on the power of prayer and the reality of faith in the midst of suffering. This passage doesn't fit \"name-it-and-claim-it\" and it doesn't fit cessationism either. My hope is that I can bring clarity with this study and stir up faith. Faith for miracles and faith for suffering. \n\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

The Exodus, flood). Any advice on resources to help him?\n5. 21:26 Can you please explain the parable about using your talents, and how we can be sure about what our gifts are?\n6. 25:44 What are your thoughts on the Lutheran Church? Is the liturgy/tradition a hindrance to the Gospel and true repentance, or is there any value in it?\n7. 28:59 How do you understand 1 Thess. 5: 23? Is Paul saying that every person has a distinct spirit, soul, and body, or just that everyone has a material and immaterial nature? Also, how are spirit & soul different?\n8. 31:41 People often use Proverbs 18: 21 to say that our words have power, and that we can use them to speak things into existence. Is that the true meaning of the verse? Are there any verses that support that point?\n9. 36:17 What does it mean that God made the world through the Son in Hebrews 1:1-2? Is using the word “through” different than using the word “by”?\n10. 40:04 How do I know the Holy Spirit? Are there any teachings about having a relationship with Him which are not focusing only on the gifts?\n11. 42:20 Would it be appropriate for a Christian to attend a same-sex \"wedding\" of a family member/friend, or would that express acceptance of the union?\n12. 43:46 For several years, when thinking about the afterlife, I've felt strong anxiety and I fear that these feelings might indicate that I don't love God. Any thoughts and/or tips on this?\n13. 49:29 Do you think there is such a thing as neutral/common ground in apologetics? Or are our presuppositions so important that they have to be addressed before any evidence may be be examined, as presups say?\n14. 52:29 How do you think biblically about RPG video games such as Elder Scrolls? Most RPGs you can play as a Warlock using fantasy magic. Does the content and nature of a game affect your game choice?\n15. 57:19 Is there scientific evidence that speaking in tongues real?\n16. 57:58 Can you please explain what Jesus meant when He said to sell your cloak and buy a sword in Luke 22: 36?\n17. 1:00:35 I'm confused about fasting...should all Christians fast from time to time as a reminder that God is our true need? I've just never felt compelled to skip meals to grow closer to God.\n18. 1:04:18 Hi Pastor Mike, I was wondering how the pharaoh's magicians were able to duplicate changing their staffs into snakes as Aaron did when accompanied by Moses in Exodus.\n19. 1:07:19 How would you respond to a person who sees the Church as a historically bloody and evil organization?\n\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

Tim has spent a good deal of time refining this argument in his PhD studies and we're going to get an accessible breakdown of how it works. Now, Tim doesn't normally have an eye patch but since he didn't send me over a better photo I'm punishing him... and really, I just thought it was funny. I hope this breakdown of the \"free will argument against naturalism\" will be not only personally enlightening and convincing to you but will become another tool in your own intellectual toolbox of ways to help others see the truth of Jesus Christ.\n\nHere's Tim's web site and specifically an article on the problem of evil and how he answers it. Tim has TONS of free articles you may be interested on his site in addition to this one. https://freethinkingministries.com/3-circles-all-the-problems-of-evil/\n\nAnother article from Tim on \"unjustified suffering\" https://freethinkingministries.com/a-thought-experiment-vs-unjustified-evil-suffering/\n\nTim's YouTube channel, which he intends to utilize more in the future, has a video he asked me to share with you on how he handles divine determinism which many Calvinists affirm. https://youtu.be/qFKg0veH7fo\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Every Friday at 1pm PT!\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 Introduction & Cat Cam!\n1. 0:16 How should we correctly interpret \"by His stripes we are healed\" in Isaiah 53:5? Has physical healing for today been purchased through the atonement?\n2. 11:22 Can you explain why Old Testament sacrifices and offerings were \"seasoned with salt\"? Is there a spiritual/messianic picture or element involved in that?\n3. 13:49 We are told to have a large amount of faith, but Jesus said that faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains. So what does that mean, in terms of faith?\n4. 16:10 Is it biblical to sign a marriage contract before you marry someone?\n5. 17:39 If you've had an abortion in the past, is it hypocritical to stand against it now, and would it be hypocritical to have a baby afterwards or think that you deserve to have a child afterwards?\n6. 23:07 What does the Bible teach about masturbation? Is that act permissible for a follower of Christ?\n7. 29:20 Do you share the opinion that we shouldn't ask God to heal diseases, but instead should speak over the sick person as if we have authority over sickness? Should we do it like Peter in Acts 3:6?\n8. 35:02 What do you think of denominations? Are divisions ok, and can multiple factions of Christianity be legit?\n9. 37:33 What are your thoughts on the apparitions of Mary at Fatima and messages given to the shepherd children?\n10. 40:39 What is the \"witness of the Spirit\" mentioned in Romans  8: 16? Is it an experience like John Wesley's \"strangely warmed\" heart? How do you obtain the witness if you don't think you have it?\n11. 43:58 What is the best way to study the Bible? Should I start in Matthew, or maybe Genesis?\n12. 45:28 Mike what happened in Gethsemane? Was Jesus Christ separated or forsaken by the Father?\n13. 48:39 What does Mark 16: 17-18 mean? I grew up in the prosperity gospel, and my family and 80% of my country is in it! I would really like to help them open their eyes to it.\n14. 51:02 I know you're not a Calvinist, so are you Arminian, Molinist, or none of the above?\n15. 51:41 Does Matthew 6: 14-15 imply that forgiving others is necessary for salvation?\n16. 52:31 Do you have any counsel on how to be discerning and grow in the Lord without constantly worrying about every new heresy and false teaching that crops up?\n17. 53:30 How should I approach a growing issue at my church where the Bible is not being preached, the pastoral staff is beginning to go off base, and the lead pastor bulldozes over people?\n18. 54:55 To what extend should we try to rectify our sins? (e.g. should two Christians who fornicate then marry?)\n19. 55:55 Where was Jesus' spirit during the 2 days he was dead?\n20. 56:36 How to you stop bitterness and hatred from being in your heart, if you’ve held onto it for years?\n\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me. Clarity is paramount.\n2) Wait till we go live before asking. We don’t take questions until then.\n3) Put a “Q” at the beginning of your question.\n4) Please only ask once, our mods are checking the chat continually.\n5) I’m truly sorry if I’m unable to get to your question. I know its a bummer, but I am doing my best.\n6)    If you arrive late we may have already gathered 20 questions. Please check the live chat to see if we are full on Qs.

    "title": "TOP Atheists BEST Arguments Against God. How Bad Are They?",
    "description": "0:00 Introduction\n1. 6:23 We Are All Atheists\n2. 24:46 Religion Only Exists Through Indoctrination\n3. 33:10 Atheism Is Instinctual\n4. 48:06 Religion Is Desperation\n5. 1:00:58 The Problem of Evil\n\nAn atheist offers what he sees as the best arguments against God. I admit ahead of time that this is mostly low hanging fruit. But I also would say that this sort of atheist reasoning is so prevalent that it needs to be addressed. That being said, this stuff is pretty bad. I want to offer a breakdown of this atheist's article which is perhaps a pretty serious commentary on some of the problems in pop-atheism. All in all there are 4 really bad arguments and 1 really tough one. I'll try to get to all of them but when I did this for my small group yesterday I was only able to get to the first four. We'll see how it goes. \nThis video is in lieu of the Mark series which will pick up in TWO weeks. \n\nLink and more links to stuff you probably want to see\nThe original article I'm responding to is here https://owlcation.com/humanities/Top-Atheists-Their-Best-Arguments\n\nThe Kalam Cosmological Argument (this is so thorough and simple it can be used in line at Disneyland or in academic debate)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrgSbFhHCmU\n\nA teleological argument from the design in the universe presented by a physicist.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58brbYwN0Q0\n\nA playlist of videos going deep into a moral argument for God by one of my favorite people, William Lane Craig.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuenDhnk7fxcfPYUKwDASyK\n\nThe argument from beauty (and yes, you should take this more seriously than you do) https://youtu.be/Jz7phjZa3EM\n \nA ridiculous amount of evidence for the resurrection of Jesus presented by two historians https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6XhMySxdY  \n\nTo show the unity of the Bible here is my Jesus in the Old Testament series. I think this is a very strong cumulative case for \"unity\" which is best explained by inspiration.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596\n\nFor parents wanting to teach their kids critical thinking, here's a resource on Natasha Crain's blog for Christian parents. She not only teaches you to teach your kids to think critically, she teaches you to think critically as well. https://natashacrain.com/\n\nExtraordinary claims don't require extraordinary evidence. Seriously, let's think critically about this slogan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GRAI-us4es\n\nA great resource for the problem of evil is Clay Jones' book \"Why Does God Allow Evil\". I'm giving this to you as a book instead of a video as I honestly think it's going to be more helpful to read this one instead of casually watching a video. This topic is tremendously difficult and the patience and thought that reading invokes is going to serve you well as you process it. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07117FSWD/\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Every Friday at 1pm PT!\nTime Stamps!\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:33 Since Jesus flipped over tables in the temple, does that give people an excuse to have violent protests today?\n2. 9:59 I've been dealing with doubts lately, and it never seems to be the cause of any intellectual problem - It feels like an attack. How would you handle this?\n3. 12:39 We can see in the Bible that we are to care for the orphan, widow, etc. and uplift those whom society shuns. Should this play out differently in the life of a believer than it does currently in the world (e.g. many people, especially in my young student circles see political action/ideals like socialism or communism as the way forward in this)? Basically, do you think there’s a difference between biblical justice and modern social justice?\n4. 22:00 Any suggestions of Christian resources/ministries for women struggling with pornography? Why does the church focus more on men with this sin?\n5. 24:09 What are your thoughts on the Enneagram and its origins? Some research states that it was created by desert fathers and mystics, however, some churches point its origins to Catholicism.\n6. 26:46 You say we are saved by faith alone and not by works, so how can you say someone is not saved if they live in a homosexual lifestyle? Isn't that blending faith and works? So which works are required?\n7. 29:55 How do you know if you believe in your heart vs just logically thinking in your mind that the evidence points more toward Christianity being true than false? referring to Romans 10:9\n8. 32:51 Romans 6: 23 says, “for the wages of sin is death”...what kind of death it is referring to? Is it an eternal death? A physical one on Earth? A spiritual death?\n9. 34:55 Have you heard of the dreams of Pastor Dana Coverstone? If so, what are your thoughts?\n10. 37:42 Why is God the Father just called \"God\" in the NT? He doesn't typically have the descriptor \"the Father\" added, where as Jesus is specifically called the Son and the Spirit is called the Spirit?\n11. 40:15 What in your mind is the difference between simple sexual attraction and lust, if any? It seems like too many Christians conflate them as one and the same.\n12. 45:03 1 Cor 13: 10 is so controversial. If \"the perfect\" means the Bible and not Jesus, then spiritual gifts have ceased - so wouldn't that leave so many in deception and false understanding?\n13. 48:11 Was God angry with Eli as a father or as a priest for not keeping his sons in check?\n14. 50:07 What do you think about the Book of Enoch?\n15. 52:13 We relocated, and the pastor at the church we are going to and want to join has been reading out of The Passion Translation more and more. Should we rethink our decision?\n16. 53:51 How can I lovingly bring up and reveal the errors of the prosperity gospel to friends and family?\n17. 55:09 If I am truly seeking God, will He show up for me?\n18. 55:31 I've been reading lots of reports of exploitation of the laborers who make the products we use everyday (chocolate, phones, etc.) Should we as Christians boycott/abstain from these things?\n19. 55:57 Are Christians allowed to read and study the Quran? In Denmark I have to take a class on religion before I can study theology at the university, but I feel convicted when reading. Should I stop?\n20. 57:31 Why was the tree of knowledge of good and evil bad? Isn’t wisdom generally regarded as a good trait in the bible?\n\nHere’s how you get your questions answered in the Q&A\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me. Clarity is paramount.\n2) Wait till we go live before asking.

    "description": "Jesus isn't \"acting like Jesus\" here. He does a number of things that simply don't fit our modern pacified version of Jesus. And that's a good thing. I don't want to fall into the pacified version of Jesus that our culture likes but I also don't want to act like Jesus' radical and aggressive actions of cursing the fig tree and kicking people and animals out of the temple while flipping tables is somehow an excuse for me to overstep my own authority and act sinfully in my own anger just because I think I am in the right. But, there's more to this passage than just finding the balance of how we can apply Jesus' extreme actions.

How do you hear from God? Does He send thoughts?\n6. 22:27 My church is having an indoor wedding tomorrow, despite the local government's current mandate prohibiting indoor ceremonies. Is this in accordance with God's Word? (Romans 13, 1 Peter 2: 13)\n7. 27:25 Shouldn't Christians practicing polygamy have the same moral obligation to obey God's commands on marriage as divorced Christians who should pursue restoration?

It seems to me that the moral slip-slide of our culture is heading toward a time when more and more of us will be confronted with the topic of polygamy. \n\nThis is one of my final videos in the series I have done on divorce and remarriage.

    "title": "When Jesus Was Really Ironic: The Mark Series pt 41 (11:1-11)",
    "description": "OH MAN! I forgot to mention a really cool historical insight we get from the Mishnah! Apparently, Jews were expected to enter Jerusalem on foot when travelling there for Passover. This means that when Jesus entered on a donkey it would have stood out as particularly odd and unique. This give us another reason to see the profound and deliberate proclamation to be the Messianic King. \n I meant to share that during the study to help those who might think, \"so what, lots of people ride donkeys into Jerusalem\". This was obviously a lot more than just a donkey ride.\n\nSometimes it's the passages we find the most familiar that we have the most new stuff to learn from. This will be a careful study of the \"Triumphal Entry\", or \"Palm Sunday\" where we intend to get a deeper understanding of the passage and hopefully a greater appreciation for how strategically ironic the whole thing is. Mark 1:1-11 is probably the most ironic passage in the book, in my opinion. \n\nHere's my study on 24 ways Jesus fulfilled Passover. https://youtu.be/A-_6rpQ4zLg\n\nHere's my study on Daniel 9 and it's connection to the timing of Jesus' sacrifice. https://youtu.be/pK5RsOaVy4U\n\nSee the WHOLE Gospel of Mark playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "Every Friday at 1pm PT!\n\nQuestion Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1. 0:47 Since there is no marriage in Heaven, are married couples going to be strangers in Heaven?\n2. 5:11 If I’m not mistaken, you hold the view of conditional election, prevenient grace, and total depravity (though maybe not to the extent of the Calvinist). ​My question is, if Christ dies for all people and all sins, why does a sinner have to overcome the sin of unbelief on their own?\n3. 8:38 A friend, at age 12, signed his soul over (in a blood pact) to Satan, in an at-home ceremony. He was a kid, but he now feels that he cannot be saved. Please comment on this deal with the Devil.\n4. 10:01 What are your thoughts on Proverbs 16:4? Does that passage suggest that God created (perhaps predestined) the unsaved for judgment or condemnation?\n5. 13:40 You inspire me to study my Bible verse-by-verse, but I don't know where to start! I was wondering what study resources you use or would recommend for someone not familiar with the original languages.\n6. 18:16 How should I speak to someone who is going to die because of cancer, while another Christian got her hopes up that her cancer wouldn't return, claiming that \"God said\" it wouldn't? And how should I speak about evil & suffering to her?\n7. 22:31 You mentioned, in Part 2 of your Mark series, that John the Baptist was the one setting the way for the Lord (Yahweh). Why, then, did you use the word \"Yahweh\", when Logos displays the Hebrew word there as \"kyrios\"?\n8. 24:32 Verses like Jeremiah 29: 11 are quoted a lot to us, and I get confused while trying to understand whether God was speaking only to a group of people back then specifically, or whether we can still apply those verses to us personally today.\n9. 28:18 I go to a liberal Christian university, and the Bible teaching here is untrue. Scripture and the Gospel are undermined consistently. How do I properly address these issues in my Bible class?\n10. 30:40 Why does Paul teach that we are saved by faith alone and not by works, but Jesus teaches that works (like obeying the commandments) are necessary to get into the Kingdom of God?\n11. 32:06 How does Matthew 28: 18-20 apply to each individual Christian, and how does one make a disciple? Is it just evangelism and baptism of a lost person, or is it overseeing their growth?\n12. 35:28 Could you please share your testimony, and the struggles you may have had as a new believer?\n13. 36:57 It is said that Jacob fought against God in Scripture, but the text refers to a fight with an angel...Is God the Angel of the Lord?\n14. 39:20 Can someone who commits suicide go to Heaven? I’ve heard it argued that if they were true believers who just happened to commit that act in a moment of weakness/confusion, they are still saved. Is that biblical?\n15. 42:53 I don't understand the biblical idea of \"the elect\"...Does that mean some people cannot be saved, no matter what?\n16. 44:06 My husband grew up Catholic, and his family keeps telling us we \"aren't really married\" because we were not married by the Catholic Church. How can we lovingly respond to them with biblical truth?\n17. 46:31 What if someone gets an unbiblical divorce, but their ex-spouse is already remarried, making reconciliation impossible? Are they free to remarry?\n18. 47:41 I have a question about 1 Timothy 2: 12-15...Due to the text, does this make co-ed bible studies unbiblical? what about women's ministry?\n19. 50:50 How do I address a lack of plurality in leadership? We have one pastor who teaches every sermon & every class, and no elders. How do I bring up this issue with the church, when we're relying too much on one person?\n20. 53:11 Why do we, as Christians, not keep the Sabbath, even though it is part of the moral law? It is written by the finger of God in stone, not just spoken to Moses like the Mosaic Law. Shouldn't we keep it?\n21. 1:01:05 In 1 Samuel 28, Saul talks to Samuel and asks for his help. I think it's sinful to pray to the dead, but am I right in thinking this? Catholics pray to Mary and other saints, too. Is that biblical?\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org\n\nHere’s how you get your questions answered.\n\n1) Please reread your question before you ask to ensure that it will make sense to me.

    "description": "Some times we have been so indoctrinated into unbiblical ideas about faith, healing and prayer that we don't notice when the Bible is trying to correct us. As we study this passage I'm going to try and point out specifically how Jesus is not giving us the hyper-charismatic or new age views on prayer, healing and faith. But there is a risk that in refuting these false ideas we will miss out on the wonderful things God is trying to communicate. The Bible isn't just telling us what NOT to believe but also what TO believe. So, we are going to embrace what it says about faith, healing and prayer... all of it. Unlike the new age and hyper-charismatic tendency to ignore context and distort things to fit their movement and the \"vibe\" they are trying to create in their communities. \n\nAre you interested in the supposed contradiction regarding the healing of the blind man?

Can you help me to help him?\n3. 16:15 Do you have any advice for someone just starting out in ministry, especially as a missionary?\n4. 17:51 What are your thoughts on 1 Corinthians 11, regarding women wearing head coverings while praying or prophesying? We only stopped in the later half of the 20th century.\n5. 18:50 Could you do an in-depth study on believers committing deliberate sin and/or struggling with condemnation? \n6. 21:01 What is a biblical view of entertainment? \n7. 25:27 How can I trust manuscripts, especially ones from Alexandria?\n8. 27:08 My friend recently said she \"still feels the presence of her dead loved one.\" What is the biblical and loving response to this?\n9. 29:20 I grew up a \"Christian\", but now, after trials which have caused me to turn to God in prayer, I have become more loving toward God and others. Was there a time when I may not have actually been saved, before this?\n10. 30:40 If a person is genuinely suffering from gender dysphoria, and as a result, they dress as the opposite gender, are they living in sin? What can they do to overcome gender dysphoria?\n11. 35:16 Can you please explain the Parable of the 10 Virgins in Matthew 25:1? What does the oil represent? Some say it represents the Torah, and others say it represents the Holy Spirit. \n12. 40:11 What is your take on Jonathan Cahn and his books?\n13. 40:29 What is the significance of Jesus' sacrifice being done through the eternal Spirit? Was Jesus separated from the Father?\n14. 43:41 What is your interpretation of John 6: 44? What is the \"drawing\" here referring to?\n15. 48:51 I am a school bus driver who is struggling to share Jesus with students, as it would be against school policy to do so. Is it more biblical for me to obey school policies, or to obey God's command to spread the Gospel?\n\r16. 50:34 Can someone lose their salvation?\n17. 52:49 Are \"tongues\" overrated? I grew up hearing that tongues were like a special status symbol to give you better access to God, but is that biblical?\n18. 55:31 Some people say that not everyone can go to Heaven, because then, Heaven would be spoiled by bad people. But others say that by believing on Jesus, anyone can go to Heaven. Can these two be reconciled?\n19. 57:25 How do you properly repent from a sin?\n20. 58:26 Is having a more conscientious acknowledgement of God's presence unto repentance of sin a symptom of being indwelt by the Holy Spirit?\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "I honestly think that most pastoral abuse would stop if we would take seriously Jesus' teaching in this passage. \n We sometimes miss the forest through the trees when it comes to studying verse by verse. So, I'm going to start this study with a survey of how the Gospel of Mark repeatedly is contrasting the true mission of the Messiah with the false expectations of the disciples and the Jews of Jesus' day (and modern day Judaism as well). Then we will see how big of a deal it is when Jesus tries to correct our thinking on the topic of servanthood as greatness and leadership as servants.\n\nDo you want to go through the whole book of Mark with me vs by vs, covering theology and apologetics in detail? https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

Is it wrong of me to be wary of mainstream churches that seem to be too \"seeker-friendly\"?\n3. 15:18 How do you respond to Richard Carrier's argument that Jesus was in outer space and the Apostles where schizophrenic or schizotypal?\n4. 18:29 In Romans 5: 12-21, does our nature inherit the guilt of Adam's sin, or are we only guilty of our own sin?

So why is this teaching wrong?\n3. 22:55 What are your thoughts on \"corporate responsibility\" for pas sins, and \"individual responsibility\"? Can both be true? I see both in the Bible.\n4. 25:24 Can you explain the Parable of the Talents? In Matthew 25: 14, what are our \"talents\", and why do the two servants get different rewards, when they both increased the amount by 100%?\n5. 33:55 What does God say about men who abuse their wives emotionally, physically, etc.?\n6. 35:49 What are the biblical definitions of sin, transgression, and iniquity? How can I be certain that the sins I've committed, while knowing they were wrong, are forgiven?\n7. 38:49 What are your thoughts on the \"new perspective on Paul\"? \n8. 41:43 Why did God put the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden just to test Adam & Eve? \n9. 44:38 What advice would you give to a woman who is interested in doing ministry in apologetics? How can women pursue this calling while being careful to stay within the parameters set in Scripture? \n10. 46:03 If the punishment for sin is eternal suffering, how was it sufficient for Jesus to suffer temporarily?\n11. 48:02 Is there any evidence for the biblical Exodus? If so, will you be making a video on this topic? \n12. 49:42 How strongly do we need to believe that Jesus is Lord in order to be saved?

    "description": "Jesus' interaction with the rich, young ruler has been used by some to promote socialism and others have approached it looking for an explanation of justification like what we find in Romans. After spending some time on this passage and in the Gospel of Mark as a whole I think both of these approaches are wrong. This will be a careful, vs by vs study of Jesus' interaction with the rich man in Mark 10. We'll look at some controversy about this passage but our main concern will be to hear Jesus' radical call to come to Him for salvation, which is impossible for us to obtain without Him, and to come fully invested in His kingdom. What Jesus teaches through this encounter gives us not only an offer of salvation but a call to discipleship, where Jesus is not only a source of forgiveness, He is the very purpose of our live's and choosing Him means choosing His kingdom over our own or the kingdom of this age. It's that last part that I think people overlook when teaching on the rich man and I hope that this study helps you to understand it well.\n\nFor all the videos in the Mark click here - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nI make content all the time that is meant to help us think biblically about everything and to know and defend the truth of the Christian worldview. \n\nMy website https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "People in Jesus' time had a bad attitude about marriage, just like today. They seemed to think it was a person's right to divorce whenever they decided they wanted to, just like today. But Jesus corrected this by pointing them toward the nature of marriage and showing that marriage it a holy and wonderful union that God Himself has created. Jesus takes away their excuses and calls them to get back to the heart of marriage rather than seeking excuses to divorce. It was a message people desperately needed to hear at the time, just like today.\n\nHere's my big video on divorce and remarriage and everything the Bible says about it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2pC6ZikbYo&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHtBvJzugPJp9P5X1T-hA91j&index=2\n\nHere's the entire Mark playlist where we are working through the whole book of Mark verse by verse. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF",

    "description": "I went down a rabbit hole of research to find out how some people have taken Jesus' teaching on divorce to mean the opposite of what it seems like He was saying. The issue is whether there is a special definition of \"put away\" as compared to \"writ of divorce\". On this peculiar view \"put away\" is taken to mean \"send away a spouse without a divorce certificate\", which means that if you are \"put away\" you are still married. On the other hand, \"writ of divorce\" (or certificate of divorce) is taken to refer to an actual divorce with a divorce paper. Here's why this view is wrong.\n\nHere is the playlist to all my videos on divorce and remarriage. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHtBvJzugPJp9P5X1T-hA91j\n\nMy web site https://BibleThinker.org",

    "description": "It may seem peculiar but I think that this solves a riddle about why scripture speaks the way it does on the topic of divorce. Jesus acknowledged divorce but taught that it didn't always free you from your moral obligation to your prior spouse. Paul, in 1 Cor 7, taught that a divorced couple was really divorced but still obliged to get back together or stay unmarried. In my view, this view comes naturally from taking the Bible at face value on it's teaching on divorce and remarriage.

But, despite incredible agreement on many primary issues such as the inspiration and authority of scripture, the Trinity and the death and resurrection of Jesus, there remains the fact that Roman Catholicism teaches errors that seem to compromise the very gospel itself. I really wish I could affirm that the gospel is still in tact in the council of Trent or the Catechism of the Catholic Church, but I am honestly convinced it's not. So, with a heavy heart I think we need to talk about it.

    "description": "1. 0:00 Intro and explanation \n2. 1:56 In Jeremiah, God divorced Israel but didn’t marry someone else - he offered them restoration! Doesn’t this undermine your case for remarriage?\n3. 6:08 If a person who illegitimately divorced their spouse is unmarried and repentant and if their former spouse has remarried, may that person marry someone else?\n4. 9:04 If the punishment for adultery was death under the law then how can adultery be a cause for divorce? \n5. 19:49 Is addiction to porn considered sexual immorality and therefore, grounds for divorce?\n6. 22:54 Does the requirement for leaders to be the “husband of one wife” mean that a divorced man can’t be a pastor? \n7. 44:20 What do you do when a spouse wants to separate but not divorce, leaving you in limbo?\n8. 50:33 What about domestic abuse such as verbal/spiritual abuses?\n9. 55:42 If a person becomes a Christian after an invalid divorce, and reconciliation is not an option (former spouse is remarried), is that person free to remarry? \n10. 57:42 Mike, you’re saying marriage isn’t really for life. Two don’t become one-flesh?\n11. 1:00:06 If adultery justifies divorce and the man who divorces his wife commits adultery then why is the innocent woman in Luke 16 vs. 18 not allowed to get remarried?  \n12. 1:06:28 What’s with the jar of gummy bears in the background?\n13. 1:07:14 What about the mass divorce that God commanded in Ezra and Nehemiah?\n\n‬‬‬‬‬‬‬................................ Conclusion of Pt. 1 ................................\nThe questions below will be answered in future videos on this channel. Subscribe and click the \"bell\" icon to get notifications when those short videos come out! ~\n\n14. When are two people considered “married” in God’s eyes? Is living and sleeping together enough? \n15. What if a polygamist gives his life to Christ? Do they stay married to all their wives?\n16. Can you please elaborate on what is meant by \"still being morally obligated\" after a divorce? \n17. Can you explain what Jesus meant by “because of the hardness of your hearts” and comment on Roman Catholic annulment?\n18. Some teach that the key to understanding the Bible is knowing the difference between “putting away” and “writ of divorce”. What’s up with that? \n19. Is not one of the highest laws to forgive? Doesn’t Jesus say to forgive 70 times 7? If Jesus forgives Israel (see Romans 11), shouldn’t we, in our marriages, be forgiving all the time and never divorce?\n20. What about a spouse who keeps draining the bank account and refuses to stop?\n21. You have said adultery, abandonment, and abuse (lots of ways out of a marriage) are exceptions to divorce and remarry---why would the disciples be shocked in Matthew 19 if that's what Jesus truly meant?\n22. If you can justify divorce with adultery then why not just go commit adultery to get out of a marriage as some people have?\n23. Is it possible that Jesus was just talking about king Herod and we’ve misunderstood?\n24. Since priests are forbidden from marrying a divorced woman does this mean it was allowed for everyone else under the O.T. Law?\n25. Could Deut. 24 really be showing us that second marriages are invalid and adulterous, which is why she can’t go back to her first husband?\n26. Given Deut. 24, should we also say today that remarrying an ex-spouse who you filed a certificate of divorce for is also not allowed?\n27. Can I tell you whether to divorce or not?\n28. Why I’m concerned about saying “abuse” justifies divorce.\n29. Should ANY second marriage be broken up?\n30. Have I changed my mind on my teaching?\n\nHere's the playlist on divorce and remarriage which has my LONG video on the topic https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHtBvJzugPJp9P5X1T-hA91j\n\nOn a biblical view of \"interracial marriage\" https://youtu.be/HEJKLvacY2I\n\nMy web site https://BibleThinker.org",

If you want to go deep on this topic then I recommend reading several authors, especially those you disagree with.\nARTICLES:\nJohn Piper, “Divorce and Remarriage: A Position Paper” https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/divorce-and-remarriage-a-position-paper \nRaymond Westbrook, “The Prohibition on Restoration of Marriage in Deuteronomy 24:1-4” https://www.wisereaction.org/ebooks/westbrook.pdf this is where he gives his case for the first marriage involving a man keeping the ketubah and the second marriage involving the woman getting it.\nWayne Grudem, “Grounds for Divorce: Why I Believe There Are More Than Two” (the infamous paper delivered at last year’s ETS)  http://www.waynegrudem.com/grounds-for-divorce-why-i-now-believe-there-are-more-than-two/\nDavid Instone-Brewer’s article on ancient marriage and divorce papyri. http://www.tyndalearchive.com/Brewer/MarriagePapyri/1Cor_7a.htm\nThe Damascus Document https://www.academia.edu/28913750/The_Damascus_Document_CD_2005_\nCarol Osburn article refuting David Pawson’s view that the Greek shows second marriages are continual adultery. “The Present Indicative in Matthew 19:9” https://digitalcommons.acu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=restorationquarterly\n\nBOOKS:\nDavid Pawson - “Remarriage is Adultery Unless…” https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00564TNV2/\nGordon Wenham, “Jesus, Divorce, and Remarriage: In Their Historical Setting” https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083ZN5ZQ3/\nWenham, Heth & Keener, “Remarriage after Divorce in Today’s Church: 3 Views” https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050O6P1O/\nDavid Instone-Brewer, “Divorce and Remarriage in the Bible: The Social and Literary Context” https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q3L4VY/\nSee reviews of Instone-Brewer’s work here (Gagnon’s negative review and I-B’s response are particularly interesting) https://www.divorce-remarriage.com/ \nCraig Keener, “…And Marries Another: Divorce and Remarriage in the Teaching of the New Testament” https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801046742/\nJay E. Adams, “Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the Bible” probably the single book I’d recommend if you were only going to read one book and wanted extended advice for pastoral ministry along with simple but thoughtful treatment of the Bible passages in question.  https://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Divorce-Remarriage-Bible-Adams/dp/0310511119\nD.A. Carson’s commentary on Matthew https://www.amazon.com/Matthew-Expositors-Bible-Commentary-Carson-ebook/dp/B01N2BKWIG\n\nThere are a number of commentaries and quite a few other scholarly articles I used in my prep that I’m not including here.

She has three books that all follow the format of unpacking important questions about God, Jesus and Christianity with the help of short chapters that answer those questions quickly and thoughtfully. My favorite part of her books is the conversation guides which help parents to talk to their kids about those questions in a healthy, educational and interactive way. \n\nHer blog and resources can be found here. https://natashacrain.com\n\nThe book is \"Talking to Your Kids about Jesus\", I HIGHLY recommend it and it's available here. https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Your-Kids-about-Jesus-ebook/dp/B07VLC3MQY/\n\nMy web site is here. https://biblethinker.org",

Can we do it, and if so, how? What do we need to be aware of?\n2. 14:43 In 1 Corinthians 15: 2, what does Paul mean when he says, \"...unless you believed in vain\"?\n3. 17:48 Since you say that Ephesians 2: 8 does not teach that faith is the \"gift of God\", does it originate with us then? How does that square with 1 Corinthians 2: 14, since the \"natural man\" cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God?\n4. 25:36 To what extent is Satan involved in the sins of mankind? Some believe that he has little to do with the current sins of man, but others believe he is at the heart of every temptation.\n5. 28:47 In your opinion, who is the \"he\" referring to, in 2 Thessalonians 2: 7? Do you think this verse pertains to the rapture?\n6. 32:48 What do you believe about \"Mystery Babylon\"?\n7. 34:21 What are some practical things I can do to help further God's Kingdom through apologetics?\n8. 37:13 What would you say to an atheist who agrees with Christian values but can't get around the idea of the existence of a \"higher being\"?\n9. 39:20 What do I say to someone who says they can't believe that the Bible is the Word of God because it's \"been tampered with\" by many people?\n10. 41:07 Can you please do a study on 1 John? 1 John makes it seem like we have to be perfect (literally), which seems works-based.\n11. 45:16 What does 1 John 5: 16 mean? What are some responses to \"future judgment\" verses and  verses about future temple sacrifice being used to get believers to observe the Torah?\n12. 47:37 Question about divorce & an announcement about upcoming content\n13. 48:43 Is baptism required for salvation?\n14. 50:20 My current church is unsteady and I've found a new church that I love. How can I leave my current church in a loving manner without causing hurt?\n15. 51:53 Sometimes I feel intimidated by the Catholic Church's claim of authority and the claim that non-Catholics are damned. Do you recommend any verses for me, and may I have your advice?\n16. 55:04 How do I explain to a 17 year old that we have \"free will\" when God knows the outcome? If God knows what I'm going to do, did I really have the choice to do it?\n17.  56:34 Is it a good analogy to think of the Trinity like the \"body, soul, and spirit\" that we have?\n18. 57:56 What are we to make of the name Jehovah?\n\nMy web site is https://Biblethinker.org\n\nMy original flat earth video showing that the Bible does not teach the earth is flat. https://youtu.be/qePiXK_8Agc\n\nMy long debate with my friend Dean Meadows on baptism and whether or not it saves https://youtu.be/x2TfBVNuuY8",

    "description": "The next live stream is planned for Tuesday at 5pm PST. Hope to see you there!\n\nSome people have sadly misunderstood the words of Jesus here and cut off parts of their bodies as a way of avoiding sin. Not only does this fail to keep you from sinning, it isn't what Jesus wants. Today I'll be teaching on what Jesus meant by \"cut off your hand\", \"cut off your foot\" and \"gouge out your eye\". His words, when understood rightly, are still extreme, they just aren't about causing physical harm. Another HUGE issue in this passage is Jesus trying to wake us up as to the eternal consequences of choosing sin over God. May we be woken up and may we follow his commands to be salt in this world. \n\nHere's the whole Gospel of Mark playlist. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF",

    "title": "Oops. I guess I'll do Q&A instead.",
    "description": "0:00 - Intro\n1. 3:14 {Inspiration of Scripture?} When we say that Scripture is “inspired,\" does that mean it was directly dictated by God?\n2. 5:43 {How Does the NT Define Righteousness?} Is it accurate to say that the difference between \"the law\" and \"grace\" in the New Testament is primarily (or entirely) about how righteousness is established, not what specific acts are sins or not sins?\n3. 9:03 {Why is the Last Supper Called \"The Passover Meal\"?} Jesus said He was not going to eat Passover with the disciples in Luke 22:16, why does the church call the Last Supper the Passover meal?\n4. 11:54 {Schellenberg's Work?} What do you think of Schellenberg's hiddenness of God?\n5. 12:24 {How Do We Lead Children to God?} What are some songs, stories, subjects, etc. to lead children to God? Also, how to be simple yet factual - in other words, being factual about Noah's ark to not breed later skepticism.\n6. 14:26 {About Researching Bible Prophecy} How do you go about gathering information from scholars, etc. when you are researching Bible prophecy?\n7. 17:08 {Is God Omniscient, is it Important?} Can you speak to \"Open Theism\" that God doesn't know the future, and that our free will shapes the future beyond His knowledge? And also, if viewing God as \"omniscient\" is essential.\n8. 21:11 {Which End Times View?} Pre-mil, Post-mil, or A-mil view on end times?\n9. 24:54 {Lying to Protect Others?} Is lying for protection or to get out of a situation bad? Rahab lied to get out of a situation, and David's wife deceived Saul to protect David. Was that bad?\n10. 28:23 {Mary Magdalene in the NT?} Why do you think Mary Magdalene was not talked about more in the New Testament?\n11. 30:24 {Divine Hiddenness?} What do you think of the \"hiddenness of God\"?\n12. 33:12 {Why Was it OK for the Midwives to Lie?} Can you please explain why the Hebrew midwives were commended for lying?\n13. 34:29 {Are We Dividing by Trying to “Figure Out” God?} Do you think that a lot of the disagreements of predestination, free will, and Calvinism are mostly due to us humans trying to systematize how God's end of the equation works?\n14. 37:50 {Why the ESV?} Why do you prefer the ESV over other translations?\n15. 41:04 {Paul the Last Apostle? ~ PART 1} Is there biblical support for Paul being the last apostle?\n16. 42:41 {Abrahamic Covenant vs. New Covenant?} If the Abrahamic Covenant and the New Covenant are both saving, then why the law?\n17. 43:48 {Heard of the KJVER?} Have you ever checked out the KJVER (King James Version Easy Read)? I love it!\n18. 44:23 {Should Christians Always Be Serious?} I have a very clean sense of humor, but yesterday my pastors made it clear that I need to be more serious to be effective. Is it true that saved people must be serious?\n19. 45:24 {Galatians 3:16, Replacement Theology?} Please help explain Galatians 3:16. People use this to defend replacement theology.\n20. 47:38 {YouTube Tips!?} Can you please give us a quick overview of your livestreaming set up? We love your bible skills, now we also need your tech skills!\n21. 49:57 {Hell & Eternal Punishment?} What is your take on hell? Do you believe it is a place of eternal torment?\n22. 52:47 {Trinity Theology in 1 John}\n23. 56:10 {Why Aren't We Preaching: \"The Gospel of the Kingdom\"?} John the Baptist, Jesus, and even the apostles in Acts were preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom. Are we wrong to neglect this in the Gospel?\n24. 57:45 {About Vaccines & Microchips}\n25. 59:33 {Annihilationism in Matthew 10:28?}\n26. 1:02:08 {Psalm 91 & Satan Tempting Jesus}\n27. 1:04:02 {Should \"The Woman Caught in Adultery\" be in Scripture?}\n28. 1:07:45 {Play Your Guitar!?}\n29.  1:08:27 {Is it Wrong to Teach Calvinism?}\n30. 1:09:52 {Paul the Last Apostle? ~ PART 2}\n31. 1:12:34 {About Reading Job} Do you have any advice for reading the book of Job?\n32. 1:14:22 {Be a Guest on \"Unbelievable\"?}\n33. 1:15:38 {Don't Show Hospitality to Non-Believers?}\n34. 1:18:29 {Can Promises From the OT be for us Today?} \n35. 1:20:57 {Does the Bible Teach Geocentric Model? & OSAS?} Does the Bible teach that Earth is the center of the universe (geocentric model)? Also, is once saved always saved biblical?\n36. 1:24:09 {How Does God's Wrath Pour Out?}\n37. 1:26:16 {Systematic Theology?}\n38. 1:27:30 {Live Talk With James White?}\n39. 1:28:49 {Answering Those Who Claim the Bible is “Dumb”}\n40. 1:31:22 {Why Won't God Show Up After Seeking Him?}\n41. 1:33:12 {Advice For Christians Losing Motivation}\n42. 1:35:03 {Which \"Sola\"? & Favorite Prophet?}\n43. 1:37:06 {Hebrews 10:26, OSAS?} Thoughts on Hebrews 10:26 regarding the possibility of losing salvation? \n44. 1:41:19 {Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit?}\n\nVideo on the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit https://youtu.be/KmCHX8-2Smo\n\nHere's a link where you can support my ministry.

    "description": "Dispelling popular myths about Mary Magdalene and giving you an actual survey into the historical data about her. The stuff you see about Mary Magdalene in movies, plays and even in news articles is so bad it hurts my brain. And after this, it may hurt your brain too. If you want the lowdown on the \"true Jesus\", the \"authentic Jesus\", the \"real Jesus\" then you're going to have to face the fact that our best information about Jesus is found in the documents of the New Testament. The \"itch\" that many people have to find a Jesus different than that which we read about in the Bible has lead them to embrace a lot of weird, unsubstantiated and just plain dumb ideas. \n\nMy guest is Wesley Huff and you can find his teaching on how we got the canon of the New Testament here - \"The books that didn't make the Bible\" -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_LxbnmEEGA\n\"Why chose the books of the Bible?\" (interview with Tim Barnett) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyNpV42_xwg\n\"Books of the Bible and Lost Gospels?

    "description": "Question Timestamps for Quick Reference:\n0:00 - Introduction\n1. 1:39 How do you reconcile Luke 9: 50 and Luke 11: 23? How do we understand them in their proper context, and how can we apply them in our lives today?\n2. 5:18 Regarding your recent \"flat Earth\" video, what does the Bible say about other planets and their purpose for being created?\n3. 8:11 Is it possible that Christians made up martyrs' claims to make their claims about Christianity hold more value and truth to the people in later centuries?\n4. 11:58 What is the biblical way to proceed when a member of your church shares a clearly \"new age\" message, believing it to be a \"call to prayer\"?\n5. 14:23 How do I fire people at work and still show grace and be a godly leader?\n6. 15:51 Have you had the opportunity yet to study deeper about whether or not we can lose our salvation?\n7. 17:11 Matthew 6: 25-34 talks about not worrying, and that God knows what we need and will provide. But how can that be true when there are Christians who suffer without \"the essentials\"?\n8. 24:13 Why circumcision? Of all things, why did God choose that as the sign of the covenant? What is the history/meaning behind it?\n9. 26:15 Can you please teach on remarriage after a divorce of 2 Christians? Is it sinful for one spouse to remarry if the other person is not willing to reconcile?\n10. 27:01 How would you suggest I help other believers understand that Christians are not immune to the troubles of daily life in a way that will not cause them to be fearful/anxious?\n11. 29:42 I have an unbelieving sister & niece in homosexual relationships. We have a good/loving relationship with them, but have not allowed their partners into our home. Should we reconsider this approach?\n12. 30:56 What would you say to someone who is trying to compare mythology to Christianity?\n13. 33:11 I was recently asked, \"How can I trust your (or any other person's) interpretation of a Bible verse?\" and \"If the Holy Spirit is helping both you and I interpret, then why might we disagree?\" Thoughts?\n14. 36:07 Is the rapture \"pre-tribulation\", \"post-tribulation\", or \"pre-wrath\", and where does the Bible say?\n15. 39:41 Do you think Jeremiah 17: 13 is a prophecy of John 8: 1-11?\n16. 41:53 I would like to serve the body by making videos, but I'm afraid my sin is too great to be any sort of teacher. Should I deal with my sin first, or am I still able to be a teacher in spite of it?\n17. 43:51 What does it mean to \"boast in the Lord\", and how should we do it?\n18. 44:40 Did Jesus cause or permit drunkenness by providing more wine to (assumably) drunk guests? What is drunkenness?\n19. 48:22 Do you have any advice for starting a Christian YouTube channel?\n20. 49:21 What is your view on Christians writing fiction and fantasy books?\n21. 50:16 In Genesis 4: 13-17, how was Cain afraid of someone finding and killing him, and how did he get a wife if he, Adam, and Eve were the only people on Earth at this point?\n22. 53:41 If we are all happy in Heaven/Paradise, will we not be sad/mourning for those in Hell/Sheol?\n23. 57:23 Is there hope for Christians struggling with continuous sin like pornography? Or is repentance/struggling through it sufficient?\n24. 58:06 Who is the word \"Lord\" referring to in 2 Corinthians 3: 17? Is it implying that Jesus is the Holy Spirit?\n25. 1:00:59 In the Genesis 6 reference to the \"sons of God\", who is that referring to?\n26. 1:02:37 How do I know if I have blasphemed the Holy Spirit?\n27. 1:03:07 Question about Mark/Olivet Discourse\n28. 1:03:36 Can a Christian read Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle?\n29. 1:04:47 Is there good evidence for the Exodus?\n30. 1:05:34 How would you answer a Christian who claims (using 1 Jn. 2: 1) that believers don't have a \"sinful flesh\" after being born again, ignoring other verses?\n31. 1:07:15 How is annihilationism not the obvious teaching of Scripture, when eternal life is dependent upon salvation and substitutionary atonement requires that the proper punishment be served?\n32. 1:09:11 Does every sin you've committed have to be confessed, or does faith in Jesus cover all past and future sins?\n33. 1:10:00 Can you explain a biblical argument for or against infant baptism?\n34. 1:11:20 Do you think the Sabbath was a picture of the Gospel (resting from works, Hebrews 4)?\n35. 1:12:05 Is the Apologeticon event still happening? What happens if I already bought a ticket?\n36. 1:12:43 Should we do baptisms for the dead?\n37. 1:12:58 What are your thoughts about those who argue that Paul was actually a false apostle? (Specifically, the \"Jesus Words Only\" group, and the claim that John was talking of Paul in Revelation 2: 2)\n\nIf you love this ministry and want to help support my work please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "description": "At first it seems like this story is dropped awkwardly into Mark 9 with no apparent reason. But studying the passage more carefully shows that it may well be a deliberate act on the part of God to illustrate the need for faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus. This poor boy, afflicted by a demon for years, seems to be a representation of Jesus on the cross and how challenging it would be for the disciples to trust in a Messiah who would die. This passage also has something that is hugely important to me personally; the father of the child crying out, “I believe, help my unbelief!” The fact that Jesus received the conflicted faith of this man shows me that He receives us when our faith is equally conflicted. Thank God for His patience. \n\nThis is part 31 in the ongoing Mark series, here’s the whole thing! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF \n\nIf you love this ministry and want to help me keep making free content, please click here.  https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

I'm not here to mock anyone. I respect people on both sides of the issue.\n2- I'm not going to get side-tracked on questions about geocentricity, the firmament, or ANE views outside the Bible. I'm just focusing on the flat earth question.\n3- I'm going to methodically handle the proof-texts used by flat earth proponents to support their views. I only want to ask \"do these verses support a conclusion that the Bible teaches a flat earth?\"\n4- I'm not interested, in this teaching, about what \"science says\" or questions of conspiracies. I'm only asking about the Bible. \n\nThe simple method here is to have a sober look at the passages used to support a flat earth theory and show what they are really saying, in context. This video is meant to be a helpful resource for those who sincerely want to ask whether or not the Bible, on it's own, is teaching a flat earth. \n\nLinks you may be interested in.\nThe full Dean Odle video I played clips of (really bad exegesis) https://youtu.be/hIMIAdyWEIg\nStrong's concordance for \"platus\"  https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/platus.html\n\nWant a BibleThinker mug? https://www.zockollpottery.com/product-page/bible-thinker-mug\n\nThanks to supporters I can study all day and make completely free videos teaching theology and apologetics.

Do you think it matters a great deal either way/affects the intention/theology of the event? \n     2. 6:41 Have you ever heard of John G. Lake Ministries, or Curry Blake? If yes, what are your thoughts on their theology? If no, can I pay you to research them? \n     3. 7:35 Can you explain the reason Jesus cursed the fig tree in Mark 11? \n     4. 11:27 What does it mean to be “born of water” in John 3: 5? \n     5. 15:13 Is Romans 1: 20 a good verse to help refute the doctrine of “Total Depravity”? \n     6. 16:59 How do you love God more? \n     7. 18:28 I feel the Enemy attacking me as if he’s trying to make me fall. Please help me. What can I       do, or what verses should I read? \n     8. 20:22 How should we reconcile the baptism verses in the book of Acts (Acts 2: 38, 19: 5-6, 10: 48, 8: 16) with Matthew 28: 19? \n     9. 27:29 Why can’t we be forgiven after death if God’s mercy is forever? \n     10. 28:24 Do you believe we can lose our salvation? \n     11. 29:22 Why did God permit the serpent to deceive Adam and Eve? \n     12. 31:21 I’m starting Bible college in August. Any advice for me? \n     13. 32:00 Why do we translate Yeshua into Jesus and not Joshua? \n     14. 33:19 Do women need to wear head coverings when praying or prophesying? \n     15. 33:35 In 1 Corinthians 3: 15, it seems to mention that even “carnal Christians” can be saved. Does this mean Heaven will have some form of hierarchy among Christians? \n     16. 39:08 What is the best way to use apologetics to witness to your family? \n     17. 40:02 Can you explain “saved by faith alone”? Does that mean even if you go on sinning you still have salvation just because you believe? \n     18. 42:37 What is the difference between a false teacher and someone whose interpretation you simply don’t agree with? \n     19. 43:42 What is your opinion on nudity in art? \n     20. 46:03 I know the evidence for Jesus’ resurrection is very strong, but what about the evidence for His virgin birth? \n     21. 47:49 What is your take on Acts 4: 32-37? Why don’t we see this practice more in congregations today? \n     22. 51:25 What powers or abilities do demons have? \n     23. 55:27 Why can an atheist appear to be a better person than a Christian? \n     24. 56:44 Why would God ever order someone to be killed (ex: in the Old Testament)? \n     25. 1:00:57 Speaking in tongues is something that really confuses me. Is it real? \n     26. 1:02:32 How does one make sure that he does not elevate Christian thought and scholarship above God, especially in disciplines like apologetics? How do you avoid making intellect an idol? \n     27. 1:05:11 Who is the Bride of Christ and the 144,000 in the book of Revelation? \n     28. 1:06:01 Do you think people should go to college to become a pastor? \n     29. 1:07:06 I left a church because they taught KJV onlyism and only sang hymns. They thought that contemporary worship music was worldly and not pleasing to God but I really liked the warm, loving people. \n     30. 1:09:24 What good apologetic books do you recommend? \n     31. 1:10:27 My Christian friend says we should not offend people while sharing the Gospel. My understanding was that they must get offended in order to be convicted of their sin and see their need for Jesus. What are your thoughts? \n     32. 1:11:40 What can you share about the “old Earth/young Earth” topic of discussion? \n     33. 1:13:37 What is your opinion on Christians doing yoga? \n     34. 1:13:54 How do we know if Joseph Smith was wrong theologically but the Book of Mormon is right? I see more contradictions within the D&C and not really in the Book of Mormon. \n     35. 1:15:53 Where is your church located?\n\n\nIf you want to support the work I do with this ministry then click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "description": "The majority of scholars think that Mark has unintentionally reduplicated the story of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes. It turns out that they are wrong for a number of reasons. In this study through Mark 8:1-10 we will try to understand the deep theological meaning of the passage as well as answer scholarship which has been unable to see the forest through the trees. \n One of the major issues with scholarship when it comes to the gospels is an unwise assumption that Mark is based on a bunch of stories about Jesus floating around a community of people, changing over time, and finally being written down after the fact. The evidence shows that Mark is not the result of a community who changed stories over time. It's from eye witness testimony! If you want more on this please listen to the first video in the Mark series where I go through \"Who Wrote Mark\" and discuss evidence of it's eye witness sources.

To study proverbs is to methodically gather wisdom much like the way a farmer gathers in his crop, knowing that it will be essential for the future. I'm hoping this little tour through Proverbs 27 will ignite in you an appreciation for the book and renew your own hunger for wisdom.

    "title": "The Spit Healing of Jesus: The Mark Series part 25 (Mark 7:31-37)",
    "description": "Jesus put His fingers in a man’s ears and His spit in the man’s mouth. Do you know what it means? We will cover the deep theological meaning behind this act and also deal with some critical objections to the reliability of Mark. Critics say that Mark doesn’t understand the geography of Israel because of Mark 7:31. Some will even say that Jesus is copying pagan rituals when He heals this way. Well, that’s silly and I’d like to share why.\n\nMark 7:31–37 (NASB95)Again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis. They brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they implored Him to lay His hand on him. Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva; and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!” And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly. And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it. They were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”\n\nThis is the article comparing Epidaurus with the Gospels, in which the author says, \"An influence of Epidaurus on the Gospels is not possible to trace.\" https://www.academia.edu/29349556/The_differences_between_the_healing_stories_from_Epidaurus_and_from_the_Gospels._R%C3%B3%C5%BCnice_mi%C4%99dzy_opisami_uzdrowie%C5%84_z_Epidauru_i_z_Ewangelii\n\nHere's the whole Mark series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nIf you love this ministry and want to support the free content I produce please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "description": "One of the most important things in the Gospel of Mark is the identity of Jesus. But many people don't realize that Mark is telling who Jesus is through the stories about what Jesus did. When we look at the text carefully we can see one amazing revelation after another revealing the \"high Christology\" of the gospel of Mark. In other words, the skeptics who sometimes claim Mark has a low view of the person of Christ are completely mistaken. In the passage we are in today (6:45-56) we will see that Jesus' walking on water has an interesting connection to the book of Job and, once again, is best explained by connecting the person of Christ to God Himself. I'll also tackle some challenges to the accuracy of the Gospel of Mark when he talks about the journey's of the disciples across the Sea of Galilee. \n\nThe whole Mark series playlist is here. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nHere are the links I mentioned in the video.\nMy video on \"Biggest Bible Contradictions\" where I unpack today's issue (and more) with maps on screen.   https://youtu.be/7zS4VgFDf8s?t=2719\nRichard Bauckham's lecture on the accuracy of Mark's geography https://youtu.be/F4THNI0CxbE\nSteve Hays' article on today's apologetics topic. https://triablogue.blogspot.com/2016/08/was-mark-confused.html\nLydia McGrew's article on the same http://lydiaswebpage.blogspot.com/2016/08/but-wait-theres-more-refuting-claim-of.html \nJonathan McLatchie's article on the same. http://www.answeringmuslims.com/2016/08/is-mark-confused-about-location-of.html\nI've shared all three so you can see how different people handle it.\n\nIf you have the funds and want to help me continue doing this ministry and producing all my content for free then please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "title": "Non-Christians Ask Me Questions",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\r\n**QUESTIONS FROM NON-CHRISTIANS** (thanks to Sarah Zimmerman for making these)\r\n0:00 Intro\n1. 3:37 How do you explain to non-Christians that Jesus indeed was a real person?\r\n2. 8:30 Do you struggle to accept the teaching in 1 Timothy regarding women's roles in the Church? Do you ever find it hard to reconcile your human sense of justice with what the Bible says?\r\n3. 11:32 If it's so obvious that Christianity is true, why do the overwhelming majority of scientists and people with high IQs not believe in God? (Not just 1 or 2, but the majority.)\r\n4. 14:52 What do you say to what seems as sexism in 1 Corinthians 11 and 1 Timothy and the Old Testament, how women are treated as ''second class''?\r\n5. 17:43 We have a will, but we cannot choose our will. If we can't be perfect on our own, why are we deserving of punishment for being imperfect?\r\n6. 21:04 Why is theism a better view than atheism and agnosticism?\r\n7. 26:52 What would you say to an Egyptology expert who comes to believe that Jesus existed, died, rose, and reigns but refuses to give Jesus allegiance because of His belief in the historical Exodus?\r\n8. 30:14 In Genesis 3, the serpent tells Eve that the fruit would not kill her, but would open her eyes - and that's what the fruit did. So why do Christians call this interaction a deception or a lie?\r\n9. 33:24 My brother doesn't believe the Bible, arguing that there are much older religions that Christianity copies (ex: the Virgin Birth and other aspects that are the same). How would you respond?\r\n10. 36:10 How do you reconcile the disputed letters of Paul? Do you believe translations like the NLT, ESV, etc. are still infallible, compared to the original Greek manuscripts?\r\n11. 38:34 Jesus says about false prophets, \"By their fruit you will recognize them.\" (Matthew 7 :16). We can see \"fruit\" in the lives of many Mormons, Bahais, etc. How do you explain that?\r\n12. 41:21 How does secular marriage between 2 people of the same gender affect Christianity? Why do Christians spend so much time advocating against something that isn't relevant to them?\r\n13. 44:36 Why is the doctrine of inerrancy so important? Why believe it, if prophesies don't indicate inerrancy?\r\n14. 46:14 What is your response to the claim that Ephesians is a forgery due to having longer sentences than Paul's other epistles?\r\n15. 47:44 I sometimes call myself an \"agnostic Calvinist\". If God is real, He hasn't \"selected\" me. If He wants me to be saved and I desire to understand Him, but I am unconvinced by the Bible, where do I stand?\r\n16. 51:13 What is your advice for someone who finds the arguments for Christianity someone persuasive, but always seems to fall short of having actual faith? (Still having severe doubts/reservations.)\r\n17. 52:58 Don't the first 11 chapters of the Bible seem ridiculous? (Ex: Spiritual beings having sex with women and producing giants, and humans living nearly a thousand years old.)\r\n18. 56:09 Is it forbidden for Christians to have more than 1 wife? In my country (South Africa), it is legal in some parts to have more than 1 wife, and this is a question I get from my people.\r\n19. 58:36 There is good evidence that an all-powerful being exists. What is the evidence for the nature of this all-powerful being? An all-powerful being would have absolute power to deceive. \r\n**QUESTIONS FROM CHRISTIANS**\r\n20. 1:01:25 If your pastor's total focus is on divine healing and wants to call his church a \"healing center\" for the purpose of bringing in the lost, should I stay, or find a different church?\r\n21. 1:02:15 Do \"once saved, always saved\" people and \"lordship salvation\" people agree with one another, and only argue over semantics?\r\n22. 1:03:24 Are you going to make any more worship songs?\r\n23. 1:04:11 How would you explain to non-Christians that it's not unfair or inconsistent that we, as humans, are represented by Adam, thus inheriting Adam's sinful nature?\r\n24. 1:06:18 How do I explain to deists the divinity of the Scriptures? Most reject the Scriptures because \"men wrote them\". How do I refute this?\r\n25. 1:09:04 If certain cessationists believe that God doesn't speak anymore, is this blasphemy? Are they saved? How can one serve God and not hear from Him, when Scripture suggests that God does speak?\r\n26. 1:10:52 Isn't it unfair to be born predisposed to Adam and Eve's sin? (The curse of being born sinners.)\r\n~ CAT CAM ~ 1:11:37 \r\n27. 1:12:16 How do you read Romans 1: 16? Is it that the \"power of God\" is what saves those who believe, or that the Gospel IS the power of God AND what saves those who believe? Or both? \r\n28. 1:13:52 If God is not the author of confusion, then why are there so many different interpretations of Scripture?\r\n\r\nMy work in this ministry is fully supported by donations and I intend to keep it that way so that everything I produce can be offered for free.

    "description": "This stuff should be obvious to all Christians but sadly, progressives have a way of making obvious things very confusing. Here's a look at what the book of Romans teaches about Christ's penal substitution. It gives us clear support for the idea that Jesus died in our place, suffering the penalty we deserved because of sin and thereby provided a way for us to be forgiven so that God could forgive us of our sins without violating His own righteousness and justice by failing to punish sin. This is a beautiful and biblical truth that is being fought against by an increasing number of those who call themselves Bible believing followers of Jesus. Well, I'm not here to rip on them, I'm here to help those who want to see for themselves how the scripture teaches this wonderful truth about the cross.\n\nHere's the whole playlist on Penal Substitutionary Atonement (or how Jesus saves us through the cross) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHttVR0rkvhBfA-IKrg5SGcp\n\nMy work in this ministry is fully supported by donations and I intend to keep it that way so that everything I produce can be offered for free.

    "description": "When Jesus fed the 5,000 it was meant to teach them something really significant about who Jesus is. This meaning was largely lost on the people at the time and people in our time have much the same problem. In this passage we see Jesus as The Prophet like Moses. We also will get a taste of some \"undesigned coincidences\" which help confirm that the gospels are accurate accounts of actual history rather than the radically evolved oral traditions that some scholars suggest they are. There's also a wonderful lesson for those who are overworked in ministry and seeking to figure out how to balance their own needs and the needs of serving others. I hope the balance in this passage helps you balance your own life and to know how to take care of yourself, take appropriate breaks and remain unselfish while doing so.  The miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 is pretty amazing and there's a lot we have to learn from it, but nothing is so wonderful as the light it sheds on the identity of Jesus.\n\nIf you want to help support this ministry so that I can continue to make free theology and apologetics content then please click here to visit my web site.  https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

In addition to the discussion on what lead to John's murder under the orders of Herod we will also get into some apologetics issues surrounding the death of John that skeptics bring up, which actually give us more reason to trust what Mark says. \n\nHere's the video I mentioned from Inspiring Philosophy on the topic of supposed contradictions in the death of John the Baptist. https://youtu.be/FZpEnHtO7b4\n\nHere's a link to the full Mark playlist. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nIf you love this ministry and want to support my continued work please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "description": "This is the Old Testament Passage that most clearly shows that Jesus died in our place as a substitutionary sacrifice for us because of our sins. It shows that Christ was our sin bearer and our sin offering and that His sacrifice justifies us. It's also the passage most often ignored by those who deny Penal Substitutionary Atonement. In other words, it's important. \n We will look at how this passage, with the relevant background understanding of the Levitical sacrifices undeniably teaches that Jesus justifies us with a substitutionary sacrifice according to the will of God. I will cover the debate on this passage as well and even get into why the Septuagint (LXX) translation of Isaiah 53 doesn't give us good reason to reject what we read in the Hebrew text.\n\nThis is part 3 in a series on Penal Substitutionary Atonement.

    "description": "In an attempt to help you learn how to better analyze and apply commands to the 12 apostles we look at when Jesus sent the Twelve out two by two, telling them to take no money and no extra supplies. We'll see that this command does not apply directly to us but we'll also see that there is still a simply and biblical way to apply it into our lives, a way that I think the Holy Spirit intended for us to find. In this study we'll also look at the use of oil in healing. \n I hope this helps equip you to better evaluate and apply passages of Scripture which may not directly be about you but are indirectly teaching you truths about following Jesus.\n\nThe whole Mark Series is right here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c7jWg60N_0&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nIf you love this ministry and would like to help support my work please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "description": "Sola Scriptura is the idea that the Bible is the final authority on what Christians believe and how we live. In this video I’ll explain it simply, give some biblical reasons to support Sola Scriptura and deal with some Catholic rebuttals to it. I’m hoping this is a charitable and gracious experience for everyone even though I know it will be hard stuff for some people to hear. I am convinced this is a huge issue because so many of the teachings of Roman Catholicism are not found in Scripture but in selected traditions. \n Some points from the video are. \n1- Sola Scriptura is a natural understanding of what it means to have inspired Scripture. \n2- In Old Testament times they were to test future teachers and teachings by the Scripture they had received. \n3- in the New Testament the gospel, once communicated, was to be held to no matter who came to teach otherwise. This absolutely requires individual understanding of the gospel (which is in the New Testament) and the ability to tell any potential “authority” to take a hike. \n4- challenges about denominations or the origin of the canon are not defectors for Sola Scriptura. \n5- Striking Parallels between Catholicism and Pharisaism seem to demonstrate precedence for how to deal with supposed church authority when it ads tradition to the commands of God. \n\nIf you want to support this ministry please click here https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

    "description": "Was Nazareth fake? Was Mary a perpetual virgin? And what can we learn from Jesus being rejected in His hometown of Nazareth? I admit that today's study may seem a bit random but I think you will find it interesting and have some insights that will bless you. \n  Rene Salm wrote a book suggesting that Nazareth was a myth and even though it has been debunked it still shows up on popular atheist web sties today. We'll also deal with the Roman Catholic claim that Mary remained a virgin her whole life and never had children after Jesus. This claim is made even stronger when we realize that the Roman Catholic Church says anyone who says Mary did have other children has committed a mortal sin and will be condemned. Scripture, on the other hand, says that Jesus had brothers and sisters. \n  All of this is in context of our continued series through the gospel of Mark. We will continue this study weekly until I've taught through the whole book verse by verse, tackling issues of theology and apologetics. \n\nHere's the whole Mark series playlist. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuGenHwUdeiQ5M-uj5XW4sF\n\nIf you want to support this ministry you can click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

I'll cover biblical data, historical data, moral objections and more so that you will understand the doctrine, how to defend it and what's really wrong with this modern move against the biblical teaching on Jesus' sacrificial death.

    "description": "A lot of leaders who reject Penal Substitution will say that it was invented by Calvin or Anselm and that the early church held to Christus Victor or Ransom theories of the atonement. This turns out to be a painful distortion of history. I mean, this is pure historical revisionism in the name of teaching bad theology! I was shocked to find out how badly church history has been twisted by progressive leaders who, whether they realize it or not, are teaching unbiblical views of how we are saved. \n  In this video you'll hear quotes from many church fathers on the topic of whether the cross included a penal and substitutionary aspect. You'll get needed clarity to help you see through the historical revisionism of guys like Greg Boyd, Steve Chalke and others. And you'll be equipped to head into the next video in this series on Penal Substitutionary Atonement.

Is the Body of Christ separate from Israel?\n9. 24:41 If Jesus, being God, knew He would defeat death, what is the significance of His sacrifice? I understand His resurrection is a pillar of the faith, but how can Jesus being dead for only a few days 'count'?\n10. 27:16 What is meant by the phrase \"sharing the Gospel\"?

Or does it mean that He planned on sin and the fall happening?\n21. 47:49 Do you have any tips for a new believer who wants to begin looking into theology and researching topics in the Bible?\n22. 48:30 Is it ok to listen to music that is not classified as \"Christian\" but has no bad words/profanity?\n23. 50:55 Should we go to church at all if we've been watching Bart Ehrman videos and we're not sure?\n24. 54:30 Do 12-step programs reconcile with being a Christian?\n25. 55:40 Why are there so many denominations and only one true God?\n26. 56:54 When we die, will we go to Heaven, or are we all dead until Jesus comes back?\n27. 57:19 Some Christians who claim to not believe in sinless perfectionism say if we can go without sinning for minutes or hours, we can go without sinning for days, weeks, or months.

I forgot to mention it during the study but Gadara was a well known city about 6 miles from Galilee with some territory reaching all the way to Galilee. Matthew seems to be using a different way of referring a region toward the south/east of the Sea of Galilee.\n When it comes to the issue of demons I hope to provide a needed balance where we embrace the biblical worldview and reality of demons while being able to acknowledge other possible causes of illness.

    "description": "Suicide is a big issue that most of us haven't thought about very carefully.\n I'm not going to pretend to have all the answers, or easy answers. But what I can do is analyze some of the issues related to suicide from a biblical worldview and try to point you toward biblical help. I need to offer a disclaimer though. Some of what I share here is going to be based not just on the plain teaching of scripture but on my own experience as a counselor, friend and human being. I want you to consider and weigh what I share rather than thinking everything out of my mouth is clearly taught in scripture. My goal isn't to say that I have figured it all out but to offer some clarity and some help to those who deal with their own suicidal thoughts or the life-devastating impact of the suicide of a loved one.

These four parables are found in Mark 4:21-34 and they include the parable of the lamp on a stand, the parable of the measuring scales, the parable of growing seed, and the parable of the mustard seed. \n  Unlocking the parables of Jesus depends simply on learning the pattern of interpretation Jesus established when he explained the parable of the soils and that of the tares. In this study we will give special attention to the meaning of the birds in the parable of the mustard seed because this is not only debated, it's also really interesting. \n\nIf you love this ministry and want to support its mission please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate\n\nIf you want a BibleThinker coffee mug you can order one here.

Are there some “gray areas”? \n~ 2. 6:20 My fellowship did a salvation prayer which didn’t involve any confessing or repenting, just believing. Does this mean those who prayed the prayer were not really saved? \n~ 3. 11:21 Can you explain your non-Calvinist interpretation of Isaiah 63: 17? \n~ 4. 15:07 What does it mean to “pray in the Spirit”? My pastor said it means praying in tongues, and he said we can all pray in tongues. Thoughts? \n~ 5. 17:47 Does Hebrews 12: 2 teach “irresistible grace”? \n~ 6. 20:53 What is your opinion on birth control used within a marriage relationship? \n~ 7.  23:08 In Matthew 25, concerning the 10 virgins, my teachers have said the oil represents the Holy Spirit – but how can you run out or get more of the Holy Spirit (especially if you’re not saved)? \n~ 8. 24:12 I work with a non-profit whose core value is hearing God’s voice, and everything we do must be based on a specific “word from the Lord”. I’m struggling with understanding how God speaks to us, and whether or not this practice is biblical. \n~ 9. 28:48 Do you have any opinions on Preterism, and will you ever do a study on eschatology? \n~ 10. 29:51 If our life is in our breath, can’t we justify abortion, since babies in the womb don’t breathe air? \n~ 11. 33:20 Where was Jesus seated before He was at the right hand of the Father? I’m trying to envision this in my head.\n\nI'll be doing a shorter than normal live stream today and taking some of your questions from the live chat.

Covering Mark 2:23-3:6 Jesus corrects the Pharisees for adding their traditions to God's commands as well as for missing out on the heart of God's commands. We'll look at how Jesus' claim that \"the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath\" is both a claim to deity and a claim to have the right to explain the meaning of the Old Testament law.

    "title": "Responding to Calvinist Arguments for Limited Atonement",
    "description": "In this video I will be handling the following Calvinist objections to the idea that Jesus died for all people.\n1) Trinitarian Harmony in the Atonement. This involves the idea that there is conflict between the intention of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit if Jesus meant to die for all people.\n2) The idea that if Jesus tried to save all people but didn't then He failed. Therefore Jesus didn't try to save all and didn't die for all people.\n3) The idea that Jesus' atonement and intercession are the same in extent and application.\n4) Dilemmas Calvinists sometimes present as logically forcing you to affirm limited atonement. In particular we will look at John Owen's dilemma/trilemma \n5) The double-payment or double-jeopardy argument. This says that if Jesus died for all then to punish anyone in the future would be to punish sin twice and would threaten God's justice. \n\nI'm actually covering more than this but this is the main focus.\n\nHere is my original video making a case for unlimited atonement https://youtu.be/DAKyQrAO3ps\n\nHere is Dr. White's video in response to my video (most of what I'm reacting to today was found in his response) https://youtu.be/BruZNUk2ltA\n\nHere is a playlist of all my videos related to the topic of Calvinism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxakEl8BYBE&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHu8PlY0J-G2B9Pyp59S0pLZ\n\nFinally, this is an in house discussion and I affirm Calvinists as my beloved brothers and sisters and would welcome them in full fellowship (and so should you). \n\nIf you love this ministry and want to partner in supporting it please click below to go to my web site. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate\n\nBibleThinker mugs are available here https://www.zockollpottery.com/product-page/bible-thinker-mug",

    "description": "I've been meaning to give a full update on what's going on with this online ministry for a while now. Today's the day! \n\nQuestion Time-Stamps for Quick Reference:\n1. 28:51 How can we justify God wiping out the Canaanites in\nthe Old Testament? A lot of skeptics would say that it was genocidal.\n2. 32:18 I’ve been taking courses on proper hermeneutics, and\nI feel ready to study God’s Word, but I’m intimidated by the fear of\nmisinterpretation/not knowing where to start. Suggestions?\n3. 33:52 Why does the NIV call Jesus Satan? (Isaiah 14: 12\nand Revelation 22: 16)\n4. 36:00 How do I approach a family member who may be dying\nsoon and thinks they are saved, when in my gut I truly question their\nsalvation?\n5. 37:08 Why don’t you see Luke 21 (at least the beginning)\nas fulfilled prophecy?\n6. 39:25 What is the difference between godly grief and\nworldly grief, and how can I repent better, specifically when dealing with lust\n(2 Cor. 7: 10)?\n7. 44:33 Can you explain what the sevenfold spirit is, in\nRevelation 1: 4?\n8. 48:40 What are your views on Complementarianism/Egalitarianism?\n9. 52:36 Are you going to release any new worship music?\n10. 53:05 Would you be able to discuss Lutheran theology\nsometime?/Also, would you be able to teach about eschatology and Heaven?\n11. 53:58 Why has God stopped performing “big signs” like in\nthe Old Testament? (ex: burning bush, parting the Red Sea, fire from Heaven…etc.)\n12. 55:21 How can we differentiate between someone claiming\nnew revelation from God above the Bible, and revelation as in a word or prophecy,\nsuch as 1 Corinthians 14: 30?\n13. 57:53 Do you have any suggestions for a\ndevotional that would grab my attention but be exegetical in its content?\n\nI teach a Sunday evening Bible study at Hosanna Christian Fellowship, here's the info if you want to come for a visit. Be mindful that we have two buildings and this is the correct address for my study. \n16523 Bellflower Blvd.\nBellflower CA, 90706\n- Starts at 5pm. Park in the rear. Look for the dove.

    "title": "Does This Verse Teach Cessationism? And a Bit On Bethel. 1 Cor 13:10-12",
    "description": "Some cessationists (those who believe that the gifts of the Spirit are not for today) will say that 1 Corinthians 13:10-12 teaches that after the Bible was fully delivered to the church we no longer expect to see the gifts of the Spirit operating. While I think cessationists can give us valuable insights I think this  particular passage is used wrongly when they use it to support cessationism. I'll be giving an analysis of 1 Cor 13:10-12 and interacting with the views of some cessationists. I want to point out that there are plenty of cessationists who are with me on this passage and say not to use it in support of their position. So don't consider this a debunking of all cessationism but merely a refutation of a misuse of 1 Cor 13.\n\nHere's the article I referenced from the Master's Seminary https://www.tms.edu/m/tmsj14g.pdf \n\nIf you love this ministry and want to help support me continuing to make free content then please click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate\n\nIf you want your own \"BibleThinker\" coffee mug then click here (and be sure to read the page for instructions of shipping discounts and details) https://www.zockollpottery.com/product-page/bible-thinker-mug\n\nI often get asked about what Bible software I use.

To be honest, I really can understand why they interpret it that way, even though I disagree. This video will analyze Matthew 5:17-19 and Matthew 28:20 as they relate to the Hebrew Roots teaching as well as looking at some other often misunderstood things about the Law of Moses. \nNext week I will pick up where I've left off this week and cover more content from the New Testament on the topic of whether Christians are under the Law.\n\nHere’s the first video in this series on the Hebrew Roots movement. https://youtu.be/QR7xTYhXEbo\n\nMy ministry is all about teaching and defending biblical truth in order to help people learn to think biblically about everything.

    "description": "I (Mike Winger) recently had the honor of teaching and leading communion in at my fellowship. As I prepared I thought that the Lord was leading me to teach on the topic of handling terrible stresses and heart breaking worries in a biblical way. This isn't just a self-help study for those who feel stressed by non-issues. This is biblical help for those who are worried to death or feeling totally overwhelmed by the anxieties and stresses they are facing in their lives. I pray that the truth of the Scripture comforts your heart as you put your hope in Christ and are reminded of how that hope impacts your troubled heart.\n\nThis online ministry (BibleThinker) is made possible by the support of people like you.

How do I find objective evidence in a sea of biased online content?\n7. 14:52 Is the Kalam Cosmological Argument a bad argument that has been thoroughly debunked, as many atheists claim?\n8. 21:02 Is the idea of there being modern-day apostles biblical?\n9. 23:58 In 1 John 4: 2, can this test really be considered sufficient? What about those claiming to speak by the Spirit and readily confess Jesus Christ, but push false teaching?\n10. 27:20 When are you going to write a book?\n11. 27:50 Does God change with culture? As time passes in the Scriptures, it seems as though God’s punishments for sin lessen in severity. He kills many in the O.T. but not very many in the N.T.\n12. 30:52 Is the Sabbath Saturday or Sunday, and does it matter for Gentiles?\n13. 32:23 Did Jesus have a human body before He came into the world 2,000 years ago?\n14. 35:40 Atheists bring up the Hebraic cosmology now with the rise of “flat Earth”. What is your view on how we interpret the Bible scientifically?\n15. 38:41 If there is a song with questionable lyrics or meaning, is it O.K. to sing it with different, more godly lyrics?\n16. 40:15 Can you do a biblical look at Arminianism? \n17. 40:32 How can we currently pray for Pastor Mike?\n18. 41:24 What do I tell Christians who tell me I don’t have to keep the Sabbath, or that I can change it to any day I want?\n19. 42:57 What are your thoughts on “eternal security” and Hebrews 6 and 10?\n20. 44:02 Why do some people say that the woman caught in adultery in John 8 is Mary Magdalene? And why did they stone her and not the man who was with her?\n21. 45:25 What are your thoughts on the Orthodox church?\n22. 45:41 How should Christians deal with the issue of immigration, and what about the issue of criminals entering the U.S.?\n23. 47:10 Question about future punishment, holidays, and the Mosaic law.\n24. 48:19 In John 20: 17, why did Jesus not want Mary Magdalene to touch Him?\n25. 51:43 What is your opinion of N.T. Wright’s view on Paul and his epistles?\n26. 52:09 How should Christians apply Matthew 6: 14-15 to life situations?\n27. 54:56 Is the idea that “God doesn’t give anyone more than they can bear” a biblical idea? (Especially concerning suicide)\n28. 56:54 Is it a biblically defensible position to say that God the Father NEEDED Jesus’ sacrifice in order to cleanse us for the purpose of indwelling us with the Holy Spirit?\n29. 58:23 Do you think you would believe in the resurrection of Jesus, were it not for the testimony of God?\n30. 59:32 How can I biblically deal with my struggle with lust? I pray every day about it and I repent, but I still feel enslaved.",

    "description": "Examining the slogan \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\". It may seem simple and true when you first hear it but when you really think it through it's full of problems. In reality this slogan is often used to keep people from following evidence to things they simply don't want to believe in or things that they don't already believe in. This video will be an attempt to thoughtfully work through this issue in the hopes that it will help people to avoid the subjective confirmation bias that tends to come with the slogan, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"\n\nI mentioned an upcoming interview with Dr. Tim McGrew on the topic of Extraordinary Events Require Extraordinary Evidence?\" on Capturing Christianity's YT channel.

    "title": "Answering Questions From Live Chat Today on Theology, Apologetics and the Christian Life",
    "description": "Question Time Stamps for Quick Reference:\n1. 2:16 If Jesus is not the Father, why did He say He was in John 14: 9?\n2. 7:06 Does God, at times, want a believer to be wealthy, pursue wealth, have a big house, or buy an expensive car? Would you trust someone whose prophecy is weighted toward wealth and success?\n3. 11:40 There’s a video going around by Creation Liberty Evangelism, that the word ‘repent’ (metanoia) means “godly grief and sorrow”. Is there any merit to this teaching?\n4. 16:55 Do you have any study tips for someone starting to dig deeper into the Bible? (Note taking tips, how to determine whether a source is credible, questions to ask while studying…etc.)\n5. 20:38 Matthew 27 mentions saints being raised from the dead. No one else mentions this, even in the other gospels. Why?\n6. 25:05 What were your thoughts on the debate you moderated between Hovind and Garte?\n7. 27:12 Do you believe that those who teach false doctrines (for ex., that homosexual relations are o.k.) are in a sense rejecting the true Jesus/true gospel since they preach something counter to the gospel?\n8. 31:55 Is there any secular historical or archaeological evidence for the Exodus?\n9. 33:29 Could you please comment on 1 Timothy 2: 11-15 about women being “silent” and not having authority in church, particularly about how they are “saved through childbirth” in verse 15?\n10. 44:37 People claim that the idea of a pre-trib rapture was made up very recently and was not originally believed by the early church fathers. Is there any validity to this claim?\n11. 45:16 Should I stay in a church where they use materials by false teachers, or are reluctant to address the issues of false teachings/teachers?\n12. 47:43 What are your thoughts on being “slain in the Spirit/drunk in the Spirit”, and in regards to tongues, are the “unknown utterances” that Paul talked about the same as what people call “tongues” today?\n13. 53:56 Are ghosts real, or are they evil spirits?\n14. 55:03 Have you heard of the International Christian Church? They seem to have a legalistic doctrine that controls and manipulates their members. What do you think?\n15. 56:27 I’ve heard different takes on the connection between the rapture and the 3rd temple. Some people say the temple has to be built prior to rapture, and others say it doesn’t. Where do you stand?\n16. 57:25 What is the biblical view on women teaching men in a pastoral role or having a leadership position in church? \n17. 59:09 How would you evangelize to a pantheist and prove pantheism false? And how would you evangelize to a polytheist (such as a Hindu) to prove their religion false?\n18. 1:01:19 Does the baptism of the Holy Spirit happen at salvation, or after?\n19. 1:02:30 Why does Jesus refer to Mary’s God as \"His God\" in John 17? \n20. 1:04:03 What are your thoughts on preterism?\n21. 1:05:49 Are Christian head coverings biblical?﻿\n \n\n\nI just got back from vacation and I am unable to prepare content for tonight's live stream so I'm doing a Q&A instead. I hope this will be beneficial for you and that you will have some of your own questions answered.

We will talk about the early second century writings of Papias, the introduction to the gospel of Luke, the riddle of names in the gospels and the issue of genre. All these elements are like arrows pointing to one big fact; the gospels contain the record of eye-witness testimony and attempts to treat them as though they are a hodgepodge of rumor which are far removed from the original sources simply fail. \n\nJesus and the Eyewitnesses - excellent book by Richard Bauckham https://amzn.to/2TWYuzz (this is an affiliate link)\n\nIf you want to support my continued work on theology and apologetics click here. https://biblethinker.org/index.php/donate",

As a YouTube viewer I have watched the video and read the YT policies on “spam, deceptive practices or scams” and think that this video was falsely flagged. If you still deem his video a violation of YT policies then please let Mike know specifically what he did wrong so that he can comply with YT policies in the future and avoid further consequences. I love his content and don’t want it to be deleted because of a misunderstanding.

The answer to this ONE question is also the answer to every pro-choice argument. It's simple. When we realize the nature of the thing being aborted we see that every pro-choice argument fails and this is why they work so hard avoiding the issue of what an abortion kills.\n\nLinks you may like.\nAbort73 is a web site that gathers incredibly useful data for making the case for life. https://abort73.com\n\nLife Training Institute is a worthwhile organization that educates and debates on the topic of abortion to change minds and culture.

On the other side we have some who recognize a liberty to get a tattoo while forgetting to partner this liberty with wisdom and love. Both of these errors causes division in the body of Christ.

When you first read this passage it may seem like the Bible is banning Christmas trees but this is the result of making two big mistakes. First, the mistake of anachronism in acting like they had any concept of Christmas trees or anything like Christmas trees back then. Second, the even bigger mistake of not reading the passage in context. It is clearly about idols, not Christmas trees. Now, Christians don't NEED to go and get Christmas trees but I really hope that we will stop condemning each other over silly things and stick to the issues of the gospel, good doctrine, walking in love and being a light in the world.

I'll also deal with Zahnd's extensive use of rhetorical tactics of shaming those who don't hold his view and straw manning the position of biblical Christianity. Brian Zahnd functions more strongly as a rhetorician and poet than a theologian but I'm going to try and bring clarity to exactly where his gospel goes wrong and why his Jesus is really just a mirror image of Brian Zahnd rather than the true Jesus.

Specifically, we are told not to bottle it up and not to let it out. But if that's the case, how are Christians supposed to deal with anger? The biblical answer is to \"put it off\".\n\nIn other news, here is a link to my recent talk with atheist Skylar Fiction on moral issues and the Bible. https://youtu.be/1kXZSTGdfWw",

Also, what are your thoughts about Pastor Jeff Durbin of Apologia Church?\n4. 12:20 What do you think about Ben Shapiro?\n5. 14:19 Do you think Christians should make an extra effort to talk to Jehovah's Witnesses, or just witness back when they come to our doors?\n6. 15:39 Some thoughts about Reformation Day\n7. 17:33 Was the American Revolution a violation of Romans 13:1-7 (submitting to government)?\n8. 20:18 How serious should we take the \"church fathers\" (pre-Nicaea) when it comes to theology? Were the apostles complete failures at teaching them, if their theology is different than ours?\n9. 25:00 In light of 2 John 1: 11, should we separate from William Lane Craig because he accepts Catholics as brothers in Christ?\n10. 29:29 As a youth pastor, what should be our main focus while teaching the youth? Is it wrong to be teaching them more about outreach than about Jesus?\n11. 32:47 Why do you believe in God? Is it because of your family? Is it because you're weak?\n12. 37:17 Can you please give me some wisdom or counsel on how to avoid major impatience leading to anger while driving in traffic?\n13. 39:12 What do you think of \"Oriental Theology\"? (I'm a \"Coptic\" member.)\n14. 41:22 Is killing someone in self-defense or helping someone in a deadly encounter wrong in God's eyes?\n15. 44:21 What are your thoughts about soldiers who have to kill people?\n16. 45:26 What would your response be to someone who demands evidence for Hell?\n17. 48:30 Who is the man who runs away naked in Mark 14: 51-52?\n18. 50:43 How do you reconcile the teaching of Colossians 1: 13 (Christians being delivered out of darkness and into the Kingdom) with premillennial teaching that the Kingdom hasn't come yet?\n19. 52:50 Was Jesus a \"socialist\"?\n20. 54:35 Can you explain 1 Corinthians 11 and whether or not the Bible is \"sexist\"?\n21. 1:03:16 What is your testimony of how you came to know Christ?\n22. 1:05:11 Is there anything God could do that would be immoral? How do you know that He's good, apart from accepting His Word at it?\n23. 1:08:36 How do we know that the book of Hebrews is inspired, since we don't know who wrote it?",

Understanding direct fulfillment, typological fulfillment, double fulfillment and analogical fulfillment is key to being able to understand how the New Testament handles fulfilled prophecy. \nThis is part 9 in the Jesus in the Old Testament Playlist - Here is the whole playlist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWlpQauXiTU&index=1&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO",

We will be looking at what he said in context and will see that the Bible withstands the many criticisms he has for it. We will look at the prophecy of the suffering servant in Isaiah 53, the prophecy of the crucifixion in Psalm 22 and of the destruction of Tyre in Ezekiel 26. \n I ask that the comments reflect mutual respect in the midst of disagreement.

I will lay out some reasons for why I see him as a type of Christ and we will learn some principles to add to our tool kit for finding other types of Christ in the Old Testament. \n  Melchizedek shows up out of nowhere in Genesis 14 and then, in Psalm 110 we hear a promise from God that the Messiah will be a priest after the order of Melchizedek. Finally, the book of Hebrews offers us divinely inspired commentary on the nature of Melchizedek, and that is where the real debate lies. Is Hebrews speaking of Melchizedek in a literal sense or in a literary sense when it says \"without father without mother and without genealogy\"?",

This is the best part of your advice\n  But don’t just quote a verse… be rightly applying it\nJeremiah 23:22 (NKJV) 22But if they had stood in My counsel, And had caused My people to hear My words, Then they would have turned them from their evil way And from the evil of their doings. \n  There’s POWER in it.\n\nDo you have more advice on giving advice?

We are constantly being called to live a more Christ-like life and to allow God to transform our attitudes and actions. In preparing this Bible study I found that my own life was changed and it made me really excited to share these wonderful truths with you! \nRomans 12:9-11 has a very serious character challenge for us. It reminds us of what kind of person Jesus really was and what type of person a Christian is supposed to be. \nIf you want to do Bible study, verse by verse through the whole book of Romans then just follow this link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRwWLeKhViQ&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHvQ9G4NCvuiN4Evbp13uQa1 \n\nThis YouTube channel is dedicated to thinking biblically about everything.

    "description": "We look today at the gifts of teaching, exhortation, giving, mercy, leading and serving. To get a more biblical philosophy of the church. To understand how the gifts of the Spirit are to operate in a local fellowship of Christians. What astounds me as we look into Romans 12 is the universality of the gifts of the Spirit and the call to all of us to do our part in a godly way. This means that many believers today should probably be more involved in using these gifts than they already are. The pastor isn’t the only gifted person in the church! You too have gifts and a calling to use them! \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MikeWingerBibleThinker/\nhttps://twitter.com/MikeWingerii\nhttp://www.hosannachapel.org/\nhttp://biblethinker.tv/",

    "description": "Toward becoming more biblical about the gift of prophecy, humility and church in general. Often the debate is over whether the gifts are valid today and we stop short of asking, \"but what does the Bible say about how they are to be practiced?\" This results in some reckless attitudes toward things like the gift of prophecy. Although this message deals with humility and unity I really think some important and needful points are made regarding prophecy. This is info that our churches need today. I speak openly about Bill Johnson and Bethel Church in Redding, CA. But I do not do so out of spite or a lack of grace. I do so because of a desire to help them and the large number of churches around the world being impacted by the same issues I see coming from that ministry. We don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater but it would be nice to get rid of the bathwater and to be a more biblical church.",

See exactly what's wrong with his reasoning when he tries to convince you that harmonizing the gospels is impossible.

    "description": "IMPORTANT UPDATE: \nIt's been over 5 years since I posted this video and I have a really important update for you.\n\nOne of my concerns in the video was that it was so difficult to find an accessible resource that walked you through this topic well and this was my motive for making one. But I have just found a resource that handles this issue MUCH BETTER than I did and I want to share it with you now. \nDr. Jonathan McLatchie (a brilliant scholar) just posted a 90 page, well-footnoted treatment of the dating of Daniel and it is far better than my treatment in this video. I even went back and edited out some stuff from my video after reading his paper! I think it's a thoughtful, balanced and thorough treatment of the subject and while it might be just a bit challenging for laymen I think it's still well worth your time. Jonathan gives strong support for the early date, shows where some common arguments in defense of Daniel fall short (even some I shared in the video, which I have edited out to keep from providing any poor arguments in support of the early date, which I am still quite strongly convinced of), and even gives some new support for the early dating that I wasn't aware of before! \n\nHere's what I edited out, since I'm sure many will be interested.\n- Critics say that Belshazzar was not Nebuchadnezzar's son and I responded by quoting Herodotus who gives room for us to think that Belshazzar's grandfather was Nebuchadnezzar. However, Herodotus may be unreliable on this account and it is simpler to say that the \"Son of Nebuchadnezzar\" claim is about claiming to rightfully sit on the throne of Nebuchadnezzar and not a claim to be a biological descendant. Jonathan's article supports this perspective well.\n- I edited out some of my claims about the motives of critics. I've grown as a follower of Christ in the last several years and would not now make any conclusions about the motives of people with such broad strokes. Even if it could be true of some people it's a hasty generalization to make of all. In hindsight and with a few more years of life under my belt I see that I was being rude and I'm sorry.\n- I had said that Nebuchadnezzar was not known to be a builder by historians in the 2nd century BC but that's proven wrong by Jonathan's article when he shows Josephus quoting a 2nd century historian on the topic. This wouldn't be a strike against the early date for Daniel but it should not be used in support of it either. It's a non-issue when it comes to dating. \n- Finally, I removed a brief reference to Daniel being made a \"third ruler\" in the kingdom as support for Belshazzar being the 2nd ruler under his father. This is possible but it's equally possible that the queen mother was the 2nd ruler, in which case the point had nothing to offer us in supporting or refuting the early dating of Daniel.\n\nI'm grateful to Jonathan for helping us defend the Christian faith with even greater accuracy and intellectual integrity.\n\nHERE is Dr. Jonathan McLatchie's excellent work on the dating of Daniel https://jonathanmclatchie.com/the-authenticity-of-the-book-of-daniel-a-survey-of-the-evidence/\n\nThis is part of a series on Evidence for the Bible.  \nThe previous week's video on the provably fulfilled prophecy of Daniel 7-8 is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfQCgNLV6Rw \n\nFull \"Evidence for the Bible\" playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjnwldgqN8c&list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHuhA0RPKZFHVcjIMN_-F596",

It is wonderful when women realize how much of scripture is actually gender inclusive. It's also wonderful when we realize we don't need to change the Bible to fit with modern hypercritical feminist ideas, we just need to read it as it is.",

I love Atheists and talking with them in mutually respectful dialogue. \n\nIf you want to comment on my video\n    1) I welcome disagreement and controversy\n    2) please be respectful and family friendly in your comments\n    3) please deal with one topic at a time\n    4) if you have ideas for future videos let me now\n\nOmnipotent does not imply \"capable of anything\". Being all powerful does not mean being without constraints of character. God is not able to do contradictory things because He is rational. It is not philosophically sound to set up a false version of omnipotence and then try and disprove it with an irrational idea. Omnipotence is a theological term, so the best sources for an understanding of it are theological dictionaries and works.\n\nhere are excerpts about \"Omnipotence\" from theological works\n\"Divine power is only limited by the absurd and self-contradictory...\nGod can not do anything inconsistent with the divine nature.\"\n\"Dogmatic Theology\" by Shedd, Third Edition pg 289\n\"God is all powerful and able to do whatever He wills. Since His will is limited by His nature, God can do everything that is in harmony with His perfections\"\n\"The Moody Handbook of Theology\" pg 195",

    "title": "\"Love Is\" - what REAL LOVE is, according to the Bible.",
    "description": "What is love? According to the Bible, love is something more grand, gracious, holy and humble than what we often see portrayed in life today. This video explores some of the things that the Bible reveals about love. Most importantly, that God Himself is love. \nEach concept in this video comes straight from the Bible, keep reading to see those verses...\nAccording to the Bible\nLove is the greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-31)\nThe top priority of a follower of Christ (John 15:12)\nIt fulfills all of the laws of God (Galatians 5:14)\nIt is the character of God (1 John 4:7)\nIt never harms a neighbor  (Romans 13:10)\nIt considers everyone a neighbor (Luke 10:29-37)\nIt inspires more love (1 John 4:19)\nLove is the ultimate work of the Holy Spirit in our lives (Galatians 5:22)\nIt isn't self-seeking, self-gratifying, self-glorifying (1 Corinthians 13:4-5)\nIt never thinks sin is OK (1 Corinthians 13:6)\nAfter suffering for a long time, it is still kind (1 Corinthians 13:4)\nIt covers other people's sins without excusing them (1 Peter 4:8)\nIt's free (Romans 5:6-8, Ephesians 2:8-9)\nIt doesn't seem to have any boundaries (John 3:16)\nIt's not just emotions but a set of actions and attitudes (Ephesians 4:20-5:7, 1 Corinthians 13:4-6))\nSomething you can put on even when you don't feel like it (Colossians 3:14)\nLove, self-sacrificial (John 10:18, 15:13)\nSelfless (Isaiah 53:4-6)\nAccording to the Bible, God is love. (1 John 4:8, 16)\n\nI recorded this video with volunteers from my church, I hope it blesses you.\n© Mike Winger 2012\nWritten, directed, produced, edited by Mike Winger\nMusic © Catalyst used by permission.
