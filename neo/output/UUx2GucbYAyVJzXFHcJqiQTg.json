I address Mike's claims about Philip Payne and Craig Keener specifically and show that Mike has not refuted egalitarian arguments which utilized aspects of the grammatical structure of 1 Timothy 2 (What Mike refers to as the \"Paul's opinion\" strategy), nor has he refuted egalitarian arguments which emphasize the context of 1 Timothy (what Mike calls the \"bunch of female false teachers\" strategy). In doing this, I show that Mike has failed to meet his burden of showing that women should be restricted from ministry.\n\n00:00 Intro\n7:10 Preliminary Remarks\n12:50 \"Paul's opinion\" section\n49:47 \"Bunch of female false teachers\" section\n1:58:20 Conclusion",
