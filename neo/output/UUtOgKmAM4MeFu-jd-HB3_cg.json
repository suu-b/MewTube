    "title": "Joe Schmid replies to Craig: Why God’s Proof Backs Atheism",
    "description": "In this video, philosopher Joe Schmid delivers a powerful rebuttal to William Lane Craig’s recent criticisms of his paper — published in Nous — which claims that the modal ontological argument traditionally used to support God’s existence gives an advantage to the atheist. \n\nPreviously on this channel, Joe explained the core arguments from his paper. Craig attempted a quick defense in response. Now, Joe returns to defend his conclusions, expose the flaws in Craig’s critique, and show why this classic Argument for God may favour atheism instead. \n\nYou can read Joes paper here :\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nous.70009\nand you can see William Lane Craig's full reply here:  https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/reasonable-faith-podcast/id252618197?i=1000740229943\n\nCORRECTION FROM JOE : Thanks to Wade Tisthammer (in a comment under this video) for bringing my attention to the following error in the video. The error is at 1:05:38, where I misstate what Craig said. The immediate context is Kevin talking about normal systems weaker than S5. He then paraphrases me as arguing that the RMOA only requires KT, whereas the MOA requires not only KT, but additional axioms. In response to this, Craig says \"You can get K systems that he [Joe] refers to by adding axioms to... S4, but these K systems are not included in S5, they are not a subset of S5\". I, however, mistakenly interpreted Craig as saying K systems as such are not a subset of S5. Instead, Craig says \"these\" K systems, referring to ones earlier in his sentence. I sincerely apologize for this misinterpretation. Mea culpa, and I'll do better next time. I also consequently retract and apologize for my remark that Craig seems not to understand S5. Notably, though, as Tisthammer points out, even under this corrected interpretation, Craig still seems to be seriously misunderstanding the paper here. Craig talks about the K systems that I refer to , but I only refer to K systems that are subsets of S5. (This is what threw me off in my interpretation, btw.) Nowhere do I talk about a K system which adds axioms to S4 which are not part of S5. So, it seems to me that Craig has still misunderstood this part of the argument (and he wouldn't have to be seemingly guessing what we were arguing if he had carefully read the paper).\n\nAlso, for Table 1 at 1:06:40, \"equivalence\" should say \"euclidean\"\n\n00:00\nIntroduction to the Ontological Argument\n01:33\nExplaining the Modal Ontological Argument\n03:06\nThe Reverse Argument for Atheism\n04:59\nLogical Asymmetry in Arguments\n06:24\nThe Paper's Contribution to Atheism\n06:58\nCraig's Response to the A Priori Argument\n07:44\nValue Argument and Its Implications\n09:30\nResponses to the Value Argument\n11:13\nModal Continuity and Its Controversies\n13:40\nInfinite Degrees of Value\n16:31\nCraig's Dilemma on Infinity\n19:00\nQualitative vs Quantitative Value\n20:24\nSymmetry Restoration in Arguments\n25:16\nDisvalue and Its Implications\n28:50\nMaximal Greatness and Its Nature\n30:34\nThe Absurdity of the Symmetry Breaker\n32:16\nStructuring the Argument: Clarity vs Complexity\n37:12\nParody Arguments and Their Implications\n38:11\nJustifying the First Premise\n44:11\nControversies in Modal Logic\n49:48\nThe Strength of the Reverse Modal Argument\n59:46\nDebunking Misconceptions in Modal Logic\n01:05:51\nThe Validity of the Reverse Modal Ontological Argument\n01:11:59\nPhilosophy Beyond Exercises: The Seriousness of Argumentation\n01:16:31\nAddressing Misrepresentations and Academic Integrity",

ICraig openly admitted to a mistake in  his retrospective review, but glosses over its importance that we highlight here. \nCraig also continues to be deeply confused about the Borde–Guth–Vilenkin (BGV) theorem.

    "description": "In this exclusive video, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Sir Roger Penrose directly addresses and debunks claims made by Intelligent Design advocate Stephen Meyer, who has misrepresented Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) model to support creationist arguments.\nWe also talk to Niayesh Afshordi, who has worked on his own version of CCC called Periodic Time Cosmology (PTC). \n\n💥 Penrose, one of the world’s most respected theoretical physicists, sets the record straight on what CCC really proposes—and why Meyer’s interpretation is scientifically inaccurate and misleading.\n\nWhether you're interested in cosmology, the origins of the universe, or the clash between science and pseudoscience, this conversation delivers clarity, credibility, and insight. \n\nFor more on CCC check out our book Battle of the Big Bang \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ye24wdnb\n\nOr our longer video on CCC here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVDJJVoTx7s&t=63s\n\nTimeline \n00:00 introduction \n00:55 singularity \n3:31 getting the name wrong \n3:56 CCC explained \n4:50 the patch problem \n6:13 the phantom field \n8:33 low entropy mystery \n11:19 a massive problem \n15:41 other scientists \n16:17 is CCC fine tuned?\n16:56 physically plausible \n18:01 debunking the fine tuning argument",

    "description": "What happened before the big bang?  After being asked by BBC Sky at Night Magazine to write an article about what came before the Big Bang, here’s a video…\nFor decades, we've been told that time, space, and matter all began with a singularity—but that idea is no longer solid. In this video, we challenge the outdated view of the Big Bang as the \"beginning\" by going straight to the source: Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking. Both helped create the singularity theorems. I've interviewed both of them and here you can see that neither believe the singularity. \nSo if the Big Bang wasn't the beginning... what came before it?\nIn this video  we explore 10 radical models that attempt to answer this ultimate question, including: Penrose Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, Eternal inflation, black hole genesis, holographic cosmology, string cosmology, loop quantum cosmology, variable speed of light theory and self creating universes.\nYou can buy the book Battle of the Big Bang, that explores this in more depth here:\nhttps://tinyurl.com/5n882ejk\nTimeline:\n00:00 intro \n00:22 Penrose and Hawking \n2:01 eternal inflation \n2:57 Hawking Hartle No Boundary Proposal \n3:43 tunnelling from nothing \n4:14 string cosmology \n5:15 big bounce \n5:50 cyclic universe \n6:25 black hole genesis \n6:51 varying speed of light \n7:24 holographic cosmology\n8:00 self creating universe",

Recently, it has been revived, especially as it seemed to precisely predict the mass of the Higgs Boson.

What are these paradoxes ? and how can a critic of the Kalam respond?Well our very own Alex Malpass has teamed up with Joe Schmid of the Majesty of Reason and published a paper in one of the worlds leading philosophy journals Mind. \nYou can find that here\nhttps://philarchive.org/rec/SCHBPC\nWe talk about this paper and related issue and see why how to reply to this new Kalam. \nA timeline is here:\n00:00 introduction \n2:40 Grim Reaper paradox \n7:43 The Kalam argument \n9:25 Causal Finitism \n12:40 The UPD\n23:05 The Problem with causal finitism \n37:20 Physics \n44:30 Mysterious Force \n57:33 The Patchwork Principle \n\nJoe's papers on this topic:\n“Branching Actualism and Cosmological Arguments”, Philosophical Studies (2023, with Alex Malpass). Here we use branching actualism to criticize the use of patchwork principles in support of the Grim Reaper Kalam.\nhttps://philpapers.org/rec/SCHBAA-22\n“Benardete paradoxes, patchwork principles, and the infinite past”, Synthese (2024). Here I develop another problem for the use of patchwork principles in support of the Grim Reaper Kalam.\nhttps://philarchive.org/rec/SCHBPP-3#:~:text=Benardete%20paradoxes%20involve%20a%20beginningless,impossibility%20of%20an%20infinite%20past.\n“The End is Near: Grim Reapers and Endless Futures”, Mind (Forthcoming). Here I criticize the Grim Reaper Kalam by developing a symmetrical Kalam-style parody argument, based on a future-oriented Benardete paradox, for the impossibility of an endless future.\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mind/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mind/fzad065/7492631?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\n“Grim Reaper Paradoxes and Patchwork Principles: Severing the Case for Finitism”, Journal of Philosophy (Forthcoming, with Troy Dana). Here we develop two problems for the Grim Reaper Kalam. One is a companions in guilt argument based on a new finite Benardete-like paradox. Another relates to a mistaken assumption about the intrinsicality of the Reapers’ realized powers/dispositions.\nhttps://philarchive.org/rec/SCHGRP-4\n\n“Benardete Paradoxes, Causal Finitism, and the Unsatisfiable Pair Diagnosis”, Mind (Forthcoming, with Alex Malpass). Here we argue that the unsatisfiable pair diagnosis is the best solution to Benardete paradoxes, and in particular that it is much better than causal finitism. We also raise yet another challenge to the use of patchwork principles on behalf of the Grim Reaper Kalam.\nhttps://philarchive.org/rec/SCHBPC\n\nWe've now set up a facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/994473845741616/?ref=share_group_link&mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=46MWMO2CqxFVvIiN&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fg%2F15rmAnMGZP%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr",

That a black hole should be replaced with a fuzzball. In this film, we talk to the father of Fuzzballs, Samir Mathur, and his close colleague Nick Warner, a former student of Stephen Hawking, who explain how fuzzballs can solve Hawking's greatest mystery, the information paradox. We also talk to astrophysicist Niayesh Afshordi, the father of black hole echoes, who'll reveal how they might enable us to peer inside a black hole and tell if string theory's fuzzballs are really lurikng inside.And if the black hole singularity is resolved, what about the Big Bang ?

    "description": "The problem of animal suffering (a version of the problem of evil)  has recently been described as the biggest problem for Christianity. However, a new paper in the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion suggests that the problem is far worse than imagined. Here,  we explain why and counter attempts by theists to reply. \nThe film has 3 sections:\nSection 1 \nWe meet the authors of this paper and others who explain the EPAS (The Expanded Problem of Animal Suffering). \nSections 2 \nWe review various theistic replies to animal suffering and show how atheists, agnostics and other religious skeptics reply.\nSection 3 \nWe discuss claims made by leading Christian thinkers like CS Lewis, Michael Murray, Richard Swinburne, and William Lane Craig that neuroscience implies we should downplay animal suffering. This is something we tackled many years ago, but since then, a rare patient who had key cortical regions knocked out enables us to do a direct experimental test of the claims of these theologians. Namely testing his pain perception. The results were published in a paper in Philosophical Psychology, and the authors of that paper are in this video explaining why these findings are devastating for the one explanation that might undermine the Expanded Problem of Animal Suffering. \n\nThis film stars the authors of both of these papers, including lead author Phil Halper (aka skydivephil),  philosopher of consciousness Ken Williford, neuroscientist David Rudrauf, pain expert Perry Fuchs, as well ethicists Peter Singer and Mark Bernstein, and philosopher Joe Schmid and  Within Reason host Alex O'Connor  (the artist formerly known as cosmic skeptic). \nA timeline of the film is below. \n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:16 The problem of time \n1:55 The problem of creation \n3:00 The problem of divine commands\n4:15 The problem of divine actions \n7:53 The problem of the Anthropocene\n8:42 Answering theists' replies introduction\n8:48 Nomic regularity \n11:33 Soul making \n14:02 Justified genocide? \n16:23 After-life compensation \n18:29 A Pre-Adamic Fall \n20:39 Skeptical Theism \n25:32 Other arguments \n26:07 The Expanded Problem vs. Theists replies \n28:17 Do animals suffer?

In the film we report on a new tension called the S8 tension. This has the potential to be even more significant than the Hubble tension. Solutions to it may even change the origin and fate of the universe, describing a time before the Big Bang and dark energy that is not a cosmological constant which may lead to very different fate to the universe. It may also enable us to find signs of quantum gravity theories like String theory or casual sets in the sky.

The reason for this is that, unlike bounce models with a net expansion each cycle, our model has an effective contraction during the conformal phases. Periodic time, therefore, has a unique character in which it reuses the power spectrum from the previous cycles, which is confined to a given form due to the constraints of the system, rather than removing the old power spectrum and needing to produce a new one.\"",

This film does not try to argue that God doesn’t exist only that the fine-tuning argument is not a good reason to believe in God.

    "description": "Do we live in a multiverses or a cyclic universe? Most cosmologists today accept the universe underwent a very rapid period of expansion called inflation. But inflation seems to lead to an infinite  multiverse. Not everyone is happy with this multiverse ; and some cosmologists have sought alternatives to inflation. These alternative schemes are often cyclic. The chief proponent of one such cyclic model is 2020 Nobel Prize Winner Sir Roger Penrose. In this video the father of inflation Alan Guth and Sir Roger discuss the pros and cons of the inflationary multiverse versus Sir Roger's  Conformal Cyclic Universe. \nWe highly recommend watching our film on eternal inflation with Alan Guth and colleagues \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqjsZEZMR7I&t=2486s\nand our film on CCC with Roger Penrose and colleagues \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVDJJVoTx7s\nand other films in our Before the Big Bang Series which features Stephen Hawking, Alex Vilenkin and others. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry_pILPr7B8&list=PLJ4zAUPI-qqqj2D8eSk7yoa4hnojoCR4m",

Here Christian theologian, Randal Rauser  and I discuss this topic in depth. We review the problem of animal suffering and go through many of the proposed solution theologians have suggested. On several of them , both atheist and theist agree they dont work. Of course not an all, and thats where the disagreement lies.",

    "title": "Before the Big Bang 8: Varying Speed Of Light Cosmology (VSL)",
    "description": "Cosmologists challenging the foundations of physics  are featured in this documentary on VSL. Variable Speed of Light (aka varying speed of light) suggests that it wasn't the expansion rate that was enormously higher than today in the early universe., but instead it was the speed of light. VSL theory is an alternative to the standard picture of inflationary cosmology and has mind blowing implications for the way we think about the origin of the universe and other mysteries of physics.We explore whether the big bang was really the beginning, is time quantum? how do we think about black holes in this framework, experimental probes of the theory and even the possibility for interstellar travel if the speed of light is not a constant. \nVSL is a rival to inflationary cosmology and should you wish to learn more abut that, watch our film with the father of inflation Alan Guth  ( and others) here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqjsZEZMR7I&index=4&list=PLJ4zAUPI-qqqj2D8eSk7yoa4hnojoCR4m\n\nPlease like and Subscribe.

    "description": "This is part update, part remake of our earlier film on Sir Roger Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology(CCC). If you haven't seen the first one, don’t worry, you don’t need to. If you have seen our first film there is plenty of new material and updates that weren't covered . So hopefully both audiences should be catered for in this version. We also give a layman explanation for Twistor Theory. \nThe film is a part of  series fo films exploring competing models of the big bang, In previous episodes we have interviewed cosmologists such as Stephen Hawking, Alan Guth and many other leading figures in the field. \nYou can see those episodes here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79LciHWV4Qs&list=PLJ4zAUPI-qqqj2D8eSk7yoa4hnojoCR4m\n\nWe want to remake the first two films in this series as the quality of these we feel was low. Also in the case of CCC,  there have been many fascinating new developments since the first film came out. \nThere were will be future films on other models too. \nConformal Cyclic cosmology is a scheme whereby the universe is seen to be cyclic even though it never recollapses and bounces back out. Instead it undergoes whats called a conformal rescaling. What’s that ? Watch the film, all will be explained. CCC promises to solve many deep mysteries in cosmology such as why was the entropy of the big bang so low? What happened before the big bang? where does the dark matter in our universe come from? We address both the theory of CCC and the possibility of experimental verification. We also address criticisms of the theory. \nAll of the scientists in the film saw a draft and approved it before release. \nA detailed description of the topics discussed is below:\n0 Introduction \n1:03 What is CCC?\n1:51 Explaining conformal geometry \n3:31 Connecting conformal geometry to cosmology \n5:24 How to remove the singularity with a conformal rescaling \n8:05 Solving  the low entropy mystery \n10:30 CCC and the information paradox \n13:28 firewalls\n14:28 Is the entropy fine tuned for life?\n15:33 The creators aim \n17:31 Fine tuning: is it real ? necessity? multiverse or cycles?\n20:21 How CCC explains dark matter \n24:49 Has LIGO seen hints of CCC?\n26:24 Responding to Sabine Hossenfelder \n28:55 Circles in the CMB Sky, evidence for CCC?\n36:17 BICEP 2, B modes and primordial magnetic fields\n38:40 Responding to William Lane Craig \n44:15 Cosmic Jerks and Snaps \n46:38 Twistor Theory \n51:39 do we need quantum gravity? challenging the conventional view \n53:23 CCC and back holes \n54:50 summing up",

    "description": "Richard Gott , co author with Neil De Grasse Tyson of \"Welcome to The Universe\"  argues the key to understanding the origin of the universe may be the concept of closed time like curves. These are solutions to Einstein's theory that may allow time travel into the past. in this film, Richard Gott of Princeton University explains the model he developed with LIxin Li . Gott explores the possibility of a closed time like curve forming in the early universe and how this might lead to the amazing property of the universe being able to create itself.  Gott is one of the leading experts in time travel solution to Einstein’s equations and is author of the book “Time Travel In Einstein’s Universe”. \nThis film is part of a series of films exploring competing models of th early universe with the creators of those models.

    "description": "In this film Stephen Hawking, James Hartle and Thomas Hertog explain their model of the early universe: The No Boundary Proposal. In the 1960’s and 70’s Hawking and Penrose showed that according to classical general relativity, given some minimal assumptions the origin of an expanding universe is a singularity: a point of infinite density and spacetime curvature. But this and other singularity theorems do not take into account the strange world of quantum mechanics. So in the 1980’s Hawking and collaborators started to build a model of the big bang that included quantum effects.The result is the No Boundary Proposal, a model that may be able to explain some of the deepest mysteries of the cosmos such as, is there a multiverse? how is there an arrow of time and what really happened a the big bang? \nThis is the fifth in a series of films exploring competing models of the early universe.

    "title": "Before the Big Bang 4 : Eternal Inflation & The Multiverse",
    "description": "Interviews with Alan Guth & other leading cosmologists going into far more depth than average tv show but still accessible to the interested layperson.  \nWhat happened before the big bang? In this series of films we explore competing models of the early universe, with this episode focusing  on the dominant paradigm for early universe cosmology: inflation. The father of inflationary theory Alan Guth takes us on a tour of inflationary theory and explains why cosmologists find it so compelling and why it leads to a multiverse. Fellow theorists Anthony Aguirre and Yasunori Nomura help us explore more of the details of the theory and try to answer many of its challenges.  George Efstathiou, one of the world’s leading observational cosmologists (who gave the press conference for the European Space Agency’s Planck cosmology results ) helps us assess the empirical status of the theory. \n\nWe cover such topics as what is the history and  evidence for inflation? how does it lead to a multiverse? Is there empirical evidence for a multiverse? How did the arrow of time form? What is the future for cosmology?

    "description": "This series of films explores current views from leading scientists on what may have happened before the big bang. \nIn our first film in this series we interviewed Abhay Ashtekar the father of loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology to see what it had to say about the nature of the big bang. \nIn this film, we look at some of the approaches inspired by string theory. Here we interview the father of string theory, Gabriele Veneziano, also one of the first to try and apply it to the big bang. \nBut string theory has more than one approach to the issue of what was before the big bang, if anything. So in this film we also interview David Wands, Professor of Cosmology and Director of the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth, who has reviewed several string inspired models. Professor Mairi Sakellariadou of King’s College London who specialises in applying quantum gravity models to the early universe. Lastly, Ali Nayeri, who works on a model of the universe known as “string gas cosmology”. \nAs in our previous films we discuss some of the challenges these theories face, and how they might be experimentally tested. As well as looking at other issues such as is there a mulitverse and did the universe have a beginning?\nAll of the scientists who were interviewed for the film were given a draft for any corrections or clarifications. All approved it for publication. One additional clarification Mairi Sakellariadou wanted to add was “My discussion about space-time dimensionality refers to the string gas scenario, namely the decompactification of 3 spatial dimensions (the interplay between winding and momentum modes, the duality between large and small spaces).\nMy paper refers to the brane scenario: within the higher dim bulk, branes of all dim are embedded and as we have shown interactions between branes lead to the decay of higher dim branes while 3dim and 1dim branes remain; one of the former could play the role of our universe while the latter are the so-called cosmic superstrings, the analogues of field theoretical 1dim topological defects, called cosmic strings.”\n\nIt should be noted that since this film was made the BICEP results were shown to be consistent with dust from foregrounds, rather than gravity waves. \nAnimations provided by Ali Nayeri and Alex Bennett. \nMusic is from Sigur Ros and is used with permission, see their web site FAq , music use:\n“can i use music by sigur rós in my film or video?”you can use sigur rós's music as long as it won't be used for commercial purposes”.",

We flew to Iceland as we had seen on Space weather.com they would arrive and most likely trigger a geo magnetic storm that weekend.  This is a small snapshot of what we saw staring about 2300 hrs that night. \nDuring a display of aurora many different patterns can occur, but according to NASA the most spectacular is the corona, it is this event you see here. \nMost \"videos\" of the northern lights are shot with time lapse stills.

    "title": "Before the big bang 2 - Conformal Cyclic Cosmology explained",
    "description": "The conventional view that time began at the big bang is often said to be based on what is known as Penrose Hawking singularity theorems. In our last film, Abhay Ashtekar and Ivan Agullo argued that a singularity is replaced with a bounce in quantum gravity. In this film, we interview Sir Roger Penrose, one of the authors of the conventional narrative who presents an alternative view which he calls CCC (Conformal Cyclic Cosmology). In CCC the big bang is not the ultimate beginning but it did not arise from a bounce; instead the universe rescales itself, losing track of how big it is as massive particles disappear (and hence the ability to measure space and time) in the remote future. This cyclic behaviour may be extended to the infinite past and future.\nWhilst Roger Penrose and Vahe Gurzadyan's claim that there was evidence for CCC in the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) was not accepted by the wider community, what's less well known is that a new team led by Prof Krzysztof Meissner (University of Warsaw, CERN) has claimed a confirmation of CCC in a new study. We discuss this with Professors Penrose and Meissner and put to them many questions regarding this new model.\nThe film is intended for a lay audience that has an interest in cosmology and the origin of the big bang. The interviewees were asked to check a draft of the film to make sure they had not been taken out of context in the edit and there are no scientific mistakes.\nAnimation credits: \nBig bang/expanding universe animation: Alex Bennett\nColliding galaxies: NASA\nFor more material read Roger Penrose' book\nCycles of Time:\namazon.co.uk/Cycles-Time-Extraordinary-View-Universe/dp/0099505940\nTechnical paper on CCC from the Journal of Physics:\niopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/229/1/012013\nPaper claiming circles in the CMB:\nlink.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjp%2Fi2013-13022-4\nPaper denying circles in the CMB:\narxiv.org/abs/1012.1305\nMeissner's paper claiming confirmation of circles:\narxiv.org/pdf/1307.5737.pdf\nTed Newman's paper on CCC:\narxiv.org/abs/1012.1305\nSean Carroll's article on CCC and debating William Lane Craig:\npreposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/12/07/penroses-cyclic-cosmology/\npreposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/09/25/let-the-universe-be-the-universe/\nWilliam Lane Craig podcast on CCC:\nreasonablefaith.org/truth-free-will-and-cosmology\n\nMusic is by Sigur Ros and is used with permission.

    "description": "What happened before the big bang? It's one of the most popular questions in astronomy.  When the observable universe is smaller than an atom our classical theory of gravity, Einstein's theory of General Relativity, breaks down and needs to be modified with a theory that can also accommodate the physics of the sub atomic world, quantum mechanics. Armed with a quantum theory of gravity cosmologists may be able to tackle the question of what happened before the big bang. Loop quantum cosmology is considered one of the most promising candidates for such a theory. In this film we interview some of the leading scientists in the field to explain this exciting theoretical development. We ask what happened before the big bang? Is there a multiverse? Why was the entropy of the universe so low in the past? Could the Planck spacecraft anomalies be signs of the pre big bang universe? How do we test these ideas? Should we accept the claims that the universe really has a beginning?\nIn some sections of the film there is CGI animation to help visualise the evolution of the universe. These are for illustrative purposes only and should not be taken too literally. For example, the big bang is not an explosion from a single point and a quantum bridge would not really look like a tunnel; the universe is 4-dimensional, not 2- or even 3-dimensional, so these images are simply to assist the explanation.\n \nAll of the video was shot by us on a Sony VG900 full frame video camera. Other images were provided by:\nOpening photos: our teacher and friend Roger Wesson (European Southern Observatories)\nEternal inflation animation: Anthony Aguirre & Nina McCurdy (University of Santa Cruz), Joel Primack and Nancy Abrams \nHourglass universe, continuous space time and Big Bang Observer animations: Alex Bennett\nSpin foam animation: Thomas Thiemann (FAU Erlangen -Nurnberg), Middle Science Communication (Potsdam), Exozet (Potsdam)\nGamma Ray Burst: European Southern Observatories\nBlack hole simulation: William East (Princeton University)\nThanks to Sabine Hossenfelder at Backreaction blog.\nThanks also to Marcus at physicsforums.com\nMusic is \"Shot in the Head\" by Moby and is used with permission.\nSource material is embedded within the video; click pause to read more details.\n \nThe content of the final version of the film was checked and approved by the interviewees.

    "description": "Debunking the claims of Muslim blogger Adam Deen on evolution, The previous version of this video attempted to debunk the claims of Muslim blogger Adam Deen who claimed many biologists cast doubt on evolution. I showed shots of all my source material refuting these claims. these included shots of Adam's blog. In the spirit of open debate and dialogue Adam decided his copyright was more important that allowing a critic to respond with source material and had my video pulled from you tube. I have re edited the video using shots of a posting Adam made on a public forum. PLease spread this video and show that attempts at censorship will not work.",
