This year we handled over 100,000 trauma cases, administered 45,000 vaccinations, and distributed more than 184 million gallons of water. \n\nMSF has been working in Palestine since 1989 and calls on the Israeli authorities to ensure that INGOs can maintain and continue their impartial and independent response in Gaza.",

Thankfully, our colleagues were already in a shelter space and no one was injured.\n \nWith the front line shifting rapidly, hostilities becoming more unpredictable, and damage to civilian and medical structures now a regular occurrence, Sloviansk is now too dangerous to be a permanent base for our staff.

    "description": "After two years of intense war that has destroyed the health care system, 16,500 Palestinian patients need urgent medical evacuation from Gaza.\n \nOnly a tiny fraction have been able to do so. We call on Israeli authorities to facilitate medical evacuations of all patients who require care unavailable in the Strip, without prejudice to their right to a safe, voluntary, and dignified return to Gaza.\n \nDr Hani Isleem was part of the MSF team that coordinated medical evacuations with the Swiss authorities. “Watching patients die while waiting for evacuation is the worst feeling imaginable.”",

    "description": "In early 2025, our teams in El Geneina Teaching hospital, West Darfur had identified a critical gap in maternal care. \n\nSafe delivery services were almost non-existent. \n\nOnly two public hospitals in the entire state remained functional, private facilities were unaffordable, and rural areas had no ambulances or referral systems. \n\nTo help fill this gap, MSF had reached an agreement with an international humanitarian actor in El Geneina to manage maternity services at the hospital. But shortly before their work was due to begin, they withdrew after losing their USAID funding, leaving this critical gap in care still unmet, to which MSF had to urgently find an alternative solution.\n\nIn March 2025, we partnered with the Sudanese Family Planning Association (SFPA), a local Sudanese NGO, to ensure continuity of care. Through this collaboration, MSF now finances SFPA to provide free, non-complicated deliveries, while our teams continue to manage complicated deliveries inside El Geneina Teaching Hospital. \n\nIn a rapidly changing humanitarian landscape, our teams in El Geneina are building pragmatic partnerships to keep essential health services running, and to save lives.",

    "description": "In South Sudan, many children struggle to keep their type-one diabetes under control. The MSF clinic at the Aweil State Hospital is currently only able to provide them with vials of insulin that they need to store in clay pots to keep the insulin cool enough in the hot climate. Patients need to come to the hospital on a monthly basis to collect their supply of insulin and for their monthly check-ups. However, many live in rural areas and cannot afford the cost of transport, so they miss their appointments – and they also often run out of insulin. \n\nInsulin pens and glucose monitoring devices are making it easier for patients in South Sudan to manage their diabetes and avoid future complications. In order to expand access to these life-saving devices, manufacturers must lower their prices.",

    "description": "In Burundi’s Cibitoke health district, MSF teams are supporting 20 health centers to implement a “triple protection” strategy against malaria. This includes malaria vaccination, long-term preventive treatment, and providing insecticide-treated mosquito nets—all at the same time. This simple and inexpensive strategy has yielded a significant drop in malaria admissions—especially of severe cases—compared with the same period last year.",

    "description": "Avril Benoît has served as the CEO of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières USA (MSF USA) since 2019, leading the organization through a period of remarkable growth and change. Avril spent 19 years working with MSF across various leadership roles in headquarters and in project assignments around the world, including Haiti, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, and many more countries. \n\nAt MSF offices around the world, we maintain a healthy custom for top leaders to step away after serving roughly six years. This regular opportunity for leadership renewal helps make space for fresh perspectives and keeps our organization nimble.  \n\nAs Avril passes the baton to a new CEO of MSF USA, we celebrate her incredible journey with MSF over the past 19 years. “Our organization, and the entire MSF movement, is stronger thanks to Avril and the team she has built,” said Dr. Rasha Khoury, MSF USA Board President. “During Avril’s tenure, we faced the COVID-19 pandemic, the racial reckoning in the US and in the aid sector, and extraordinary emergencies such as the war in Sudan and genocide in Gaza. We are immensely grateful to Avril for successfully steering the organization through these turbulent times.”",

Cholera is a highly contagious intestinal disease that has existed for centuries and continues to infect between 1.3 to 4 million people and kill up to 143,000 people worldwide each year.

With timely response, the right tools, and a commitment to equity, we can prevent countless deaths and hopefully bring cholera to an end by 2030.  \n\nIn this video, we explain how Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) responds to cholera outbreaks around the world, and we answer common questions about this deadly disease: What is cholera?

    "description": "August 25, 2025, marks eight years since the campaign of extreme violence by the Myanmar authorities against Rohingya people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in 2017. Myanmar's military forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, where the new arrivals joined thousands of other Rohingya who had left during earlier waves of violence and persecution in Myanmar. Most of these refugees still live in fragile shelters in overcrowded settlements. They are not permitted to work and must rely on dwindling humanitarian aid for survival. \n\nThe Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority who have lived in Myanmar for hundreds of years. Because they are denied citizenship by Myanmar’s government, they are officially stateless and face particular challenges obtaining access to health care and other basic rights.\n\nIn this video, Rohingya community members, artists, and advocates in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, describe how they feel about their situation and why they have adopted the taro leaf as their symbol.\n\nCredits:\nNurul Islam, bamboo weaving\nNuru Sabar, fish net weaving\nMohamed Kolim, woodworking\nSenu Anara, embroidery\nMr. Kali and Ms. Beshi Bala, ceramics\nSahat Zia Hero, photography\nRayhana Begum, cuisine\nMohammed Yakub, storytelling\nMohammed Faruk with ten Rohingya children, illustration\n\nRead more about the Rohingya: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/focus/rohingya-refugee-crisis\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

On top of that, we continue to see patients who are getting shot or crushed at aid distribution sites.”  \n\nOur teams are receiving an increasing number of malnourished patients while they themselves struggle to find sufficient food. Among screenings at MSF facilities in July, 25 percent of children aged 6 months to 5 years old and pregnant or breastfeeding women were malnourished.

    "description": "Emad was evacuated with his family from Gaza to France in March 2025. Together, they survived 17 months of hunger, bombings, and multiple displacements. A nursing supervisor, Emad has worked with MSF for the past nine years in several health facilities in Gaza. His 7-year-old daughter, Sila, suffers from a congenital heart condition, which eventually led to their evacuation to France, where she is now receiving medical care. Currently, at least 12,000 patients, including thousands of children like Sila, need to be evacuated urgently from Gaza to access vital medical care.

    "description": "What is happening in Sudan?\n\nOn this first episode of The Humanitarian Lens podcast from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) USA, join host Avril Benoît and MSF doctor Mohammed Fadlalla for a deep dive into the spiraling humanitarian emergency in Sudan.\n\nMore than two years of war in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have left more than 30 million people in need humanitarian aid. More than 12 million have fled their homes, including millions of refugees who have crossed into neighboring Chad and South Sudan.\n\nSudan's health system has been pushed to the point of collapse, and medical needs in the country are dire. And this crisis is unfolding amid unprecedented cuts to international humanitarian aid, not only from the US government but other nations, which have caused massive disruption to global health and humanitarian programs.\n\nDr. Fadlalla has completed multiple assignments in Sudan with MSF over the past five years, including most recently in Omdurman, Sudan’s second most populous city. In this episode, he shares his experience coordinating medical activities, working closely with locally hired Sudanese colleagues and staff from Sudan’s Ministry of Health in two hospitals in Omdurman from mid-November 2024 to March 6, 2025.\n\nLearn more about the crisis in Sudan and MSF’s work on our website: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/sudan-crisis-response\n\nFollow MSF USA on social media for updates about our medical humanitarian work. \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/doctorswithoutborders/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/msf-usa\nBlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/doctorswithoutborders.org\n\n00:00-00:43 - Mass casualty events in Sudan.\n00:46-01:40 - What's happening in Sudan?\n01:42-03:20 - Dr. Mohammed Fadlalla, his background and experience in Sudan.\n03:20-06:52 - What working in the city of Omdurman was like, a description of the context and the two hospitals that MSF supported.\n06:52-09:22 - What the MSF medical team did day to day, the kinds of cases they saw, what the needs were.\n09:22-11:11 - Dr. Fadlalla’s recent experience in Omdurman as compared to his previous experience in Sudan.\n11:11-14:47 - Avril Benoît describes the people and conditions she witnessed in Darfur in 2024 and in previous visits to the region. \n14:47-16:16 - Heartbreaking situations Dr. Fadlalla experienced in Omdurman, including the case of a malnourished child.\n16:17-17:42 - The difficult situation of the elderly in Sudan and in other war-affected areas.\n17:42-20:20 - Dr. Fadlalla describes witnessing how civilians are impacted by the war in Sudan.\n20:21-22:29 - How Dr. Fadlalla communicates about his experiences at home in US after he returns from Sudan.\n\n#podcast #youtubepodcast #newspodcast #worldnews",

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) invites you for a virtual tour of our medical and mental health projects in Mexico City on Tuesday, June 17, at 12:00 pm ET.   \n\nIn May 2023, the United States introduced legislative changes that severely restrict access to asylum, which has had a significant impact on the people who end up stranded at Mexico's northern border. Migrants continue to live in dire conditions, with little access to protection, shelter, water and sanitation, or medical care. Furthermore, many of them have been traumatized by exposure to violence during their journeys. Despite this, Mexico recorded an unprecedented number of migrants last year.\n\nSince 2017, MSF has been providing specialized multidisciplinary care to people who have experienced torture or extreme violence at our Comprehensive Care Center (CAI) in Mexico City. Many of the patients at this facility are migrants or asylum seekers who have experienced violence along the migration route. Doctors, phycologists, social workers, and physical and occupational therapists help these patients heal from trauma and connect them with the resources they need to adapt to their new lives in Mexico.\n\nWe will meet a few of these dedicated MSF staff members during our virtual tour of CAI, and will hold a live discussion with Joaquim Guinart Verdaguer, MSF project coordinator at CAI, and Mercedes Alarcón, medical doctor. We will also hear testimonies from Cassandra Melendez, community health promoter, and Isaac Torres, psychologist. The event will be moderated by Avril Benoît, MSF USA’s chief executive officer.\n\nJoin us to learn more about MSF's work and how teams are responding to growing challenges at Mexico's northern border.",

MSF also works with other vulnerable groups like young people experiencing homelessness, as well as those living with disabilities. These identities and experiences can often intersect, which further increases vulnerability. \n \nAll too often, the people we work with have already found themselves excluded from the mainstream health care system.

It's in the middle of the desert, isolated on all sides, in a region where there is almost nothing to do. \n\n The climate is harsh, with extreme heat and hardly a tree under which to shelter from the sun. Living conditions are extremely difficult: recurrent shortages in food distribution, very limited access to water and electricity, and the only structures are made of straw or plastic-and are not secure.  \n\nIn the camp, our mental health teams help refugees and host communities. We have community spaces where mental health counsellors offer individual sessions. Among the main symptoms observed, our teams mention psychological distress, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, and mood disorders such as depression and psychotic symptoms.Those under the age of 20 are also greatly affected, as they struggle to envisage a better future and are more vulnerable to chronic stress and anxiety.",

This event shines a light on their courage, compassion, and the critical role they play in providing lifesaving medical care in the toughest circumstances—from the front lines of war to natural disasters and beyond. Together, we’ll explore how our female staff continue to make an impact and inspire others in times of crisis. \n\nJoin us for a conversation with Dr. Rasha Khoury, president of the MSF USA Board of Directors, and Avril Benoît, MSF USA chief executive officer. The event will be moderated by Kavita Menon, MSF USA chief communications officer.

Actual figures are likely higher due to restricted access to conflict areas.  \n\nThere is a huge need for physical and psychological rehabilitation care that will continue long after the war ends. Many more emergency and longer-term needs continue to grow—for chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes, stroke, kidney diseases, and more. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

In the northwest, we continue to provide people with medical care through our existing mobile clinics, health facilities, and hospitals. Since the end of November, we have donated trauma and surgical equipment to hospitals across this region. We’ve also provided hundreds of families with hygiene kits, mattresses, and blankets. \n\nVideo: 2023. #Syria #displacement #health #doctorswithoutborders",

Each week on average in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, MSF provides care to more than 1,100 patients on an outpatient basis, 54 children with emergency conditions, and more than 80 new survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. MSF is suspending all medical services except to already hospitalized patients at our five medical facilities and our mobile clinics in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, who will continue to be in MSF’s care.

    "description": "One year after the start of the war in the Gaza, the death toll is enormous and the living conditions extremely precarious. Isabelle Defourny, president of MSF France, visited Gaza in early October.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nIn Gaza today, over 80% of the population is displaced.\nOn site, the scale of the destruction is extremely shocking.\nAt least 80% of the buildings were destroyed. Almost all our local staff have lost their homes.\n1.5 to 1.6 million people are now living in a small strip in the humanitarian zone, which is an area of 40 km² (15 square miles). I've rarely seen a camp so crowded. People are literally crammed on top of each other, with hardly any space between shelters, with very little water, very little food, with very few ways of ensuring their hygiene.\nIt's hard to find medical priorities in Gaza today, because everything is urgent. There are an estimated 90,000 war-wounded people.\nBut today, we're limited by the amount of aid that can't get into the Gaza Strip.\nThe slow arrival of humanitarian aid has a direct impact on our activities. We have just opened two field hospitals, two tented hospitals with a total capacity of 220 beds. But today, only 25 beds are open.\nAnd this is mainly because we lack the medical equipment, medicines and renewable materials needed to open more beds.\nThe hypocrisy of Israel's allies, including France, is particularly shocking. On the one hand, they softly condemn the consequences of Israel's war. On the other hand, they continue to support Israel, politically and militarily.\nIt is urgent that they use all their influence to obtain, at last, a ceasefire. A ceasefire is more necessary than ever for the people of Gaza. It is also essential for humanitarian aid to arrive in sufficient quantities to cope with the current crisis.",

    "description": "After one year of devastating war in #Gaza, the situation in the Strip remains dire. Our teams in Gaza are witnessing firsthand how this war has turned Gaza’s chronic humanitarian crisis into a catastrophe. Since last October we’ve continually spoken to media outlets to raise awareness about the scarcity of essential supplies like fuel, electricity, clean food, and water. We've warned that because lifesaving health care is increasingly inaccessible, the risk of disease and starvation will only grow if bombardment continues.  \n\nWe can only adapt so much to the extremely volatile conditions on the ground to try and meet the needs of our patients as best we can. What we need is an immediate and sustained ceasefire and an end to the blockade on Gaza. #ceasefireingazanow #ceasefireingaza #humanitarianaid #worldnews #doctorswithoutborders #news \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

To make matters worse, no humanitarian supplies have been allowed to enter this part of the Strip since 1 October.\n\nTens of thousands of people are pushed to move south to the overcrowded, so-called humanitarian zone between Al-Mawasi and Deir Al-Balah, where one million people are already living in inhumane conditions.

Abdul Rahman was then shuffled from one medical location to another until he was granted medical evacuation to a hospital in Cairo. A few months later, he was transferred to A Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospital in Amman where he received another surgery. He now practices daily physiotherapy to encourage the healing of his bone and is slowly recovering. \n\nWhile our teams in Amman are treating the few Gazan children we have managed to transfer for rehabilitation after they were medically evacuated to Egypt, thousands remain trapped in Gaza. Israeli authorities need to approve more medical evacuations so patients can receive the specialized care they need. #worldnews #news #doctorswithoutborders \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

When the rain comes and water is stagnant, mosquitoes breed, and the parasitic infection occurs through a bite. Climate change is also impacting the behavior and survival of the mosquitoes that carry malaria.  \n \nThe most basic prevention measure is to avoid bites. This can be done through indoor spraying of homes with safe, long-lasting insecticides and/or by sleeping under mosquito nets treated with long-lasting insecticide. More recently, antimalarial drugs have been used to prevent infection among the most at-risk people for limited periods of time.",

The war has destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure, forced people into unhygienic and appalling living conditions, and disrupted routine vaccinations—perfect conditions for diseases like polio to spread.

MSF is supporting Tucson-based nonprofit groups that are bringing humanitarian aid to migrants and asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border near the Sonoran Desert.",

    "description": "Many migrants and asylum seekers find themselves trapped for years in Libya on their journey toward North Africa and Europe. Despite the presence of international organizations and the existence of evacuation and resettlement processes, their chances of leaving the country legally are slim to none. “Out of Libya” follows the stories of three migrants who managed to escape from Libya: Even, Rosine, and Simon, all of whom were patients of Médecins Sans Frontières teams on their journeys.  \n\nEven, Rosine, and Simon describe systematic abuse and detention at the hands of smugglers, human traffickers, as well as the Libyan authorities. After years trying to survive in Libya, all three came to the same conclusion: despite the danger, the only possible way out of the country was by sea. \n\nSince 2014, more than 20,000 people have died at sea trying to reach Europe from Libya. Since 2021, a humanitarian corridor has made it possible to evacuate almost 600 people, including around 50 MSF patients from Libya to Italy. A further 1,400 people are expected to be evacuated over the next three years, of whom almost 300 will be cared for by MSF in Italy. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Yoruba Mitchell, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) health promotion and community engagement specialist, describes how MSF treats survivors of sexual violence.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\nTEXT: Effective treatment for sexual violence requires three things.\n\nNumber one: Proactive searching.\n\nWe don't wait for people to go looking for medical care, we go out  and find them.\n\nWe look for them in communities, in refugee camps, and other places where we work.\n\nHealth promotion teams and other trained staff identify patterns of violence in a given location and identify survivors based on that.\n\nFor example, we know that in the Darién Gap jungle, which connects Colombia and Panama, mass robberies are carried out by criminals who also sexually assault their victims.\n\nOur health promoters will ask survivors of the Darién if they were robbed, and then try to find out if they were touched without their consent.\n  \nAnd then they'll see if any of their companions might also need to receive care.\n\nNumber two: Timely treatment.\n\nIt's essential to find survivors of sexual violence early so that we can offer medical and mental health care right away.\n\nWe can help prevent HIV, if the survivor gets treatment within the first hours after an attack.\n\nWe can help prevent unwanted pregnancies if the patient receives emergency contraceptives within five days.\n\nWe can also start preventive treatment for sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea.\n\nNumber three: Confidentiality.\n\nPatient confidentiality is part of medical ethics. All information provided by patients, including survivors of sexual violence, is private.\n\nFrom the moment a patient arrives, our staff informs them that their information will only be used for their care.\n\nTEXT: Medical and psychological services should always be prioritized after an attack. Legal processes should always wait until a patient is receiving care!\n\nRead more about MSF and care for survivors of sexual violence - https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/sexual-and-gender-based-violence\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

The approach aims to lessen the negative health, social, and financial impacts of drug addiction. The clinic also offers services to prevent infections, transmission of HIV, and viral hepatitis, treatment for tuberculosis, mental health care, and more. \n\n“The MAT clinic means a lot to me,” said Michael, a former patient recovering from heroin addiction. “I could certainly be dead if the facility wasn’t around.” \n\nMSF handed over the project to the county department of health and its partners in June 2024, with 556 patients actively receiving care and a total of 1,619 having enrolled over nearly five years. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Every month, MSF reaches hundreds of people in need of this care through its mobile clinics, but the city’s health sector is at a breaking point, and more support is needed. \n\nTRANSCRIPT:\nHaiti is in crisis at the moment, particularly since the assassination of the president in July 2021. \n\nThat has forced the country into a downward spiral of violence. So, for Haitians living particularly in the capital city, Port-au-Prince, to access health care services is incredibly challenging. \n\nWe're talking about a situation where the city is segregated into different areas that are under the control of different armed groups.\n\nWe hear stories that people have left their neighborhood to seek health care in a different neighborhood, but when they try to come back into their neighborhood, they can be terrorized. \n\nThey're even being shot. \n\nFor a pregnant woman to access care throughout her pregnancy and to deliver in a health facility is almost impossible because of the access issues I mentioned.\n\nAlso because there is no free health care. \n\nWe think around 60 to 80 percent of deliveries are happening at home without a skilled birth attendant present, which is an alarming figure. \n\nWe are seeing huge numbers of cases of sexual and gender-based violence, and if care is available, then there are many things that we can prevent.\nWe can prevent HIV infection, we can prevent unwanted pregnancies, we can prevent infections. \n\nBut so many of these survivors never make it to care.\n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/haiti\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

A person carrying the virus can infect up to 90 percent of unvaccinated people around them.  \n\nA vaccine offers almost complete protection after two injections, so making sure that children are double-vaccinated is vital. In many countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), children slip through the cracks and measles are responsible for killing tens, and sometimes hundreds, of thousands of children every year.  \n\nIn 2022, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in DRC vaccinated more than 2 million children in 14 provinces and treated more than 37,000 children with measles; we also supported routine vaccination activities in other DRC provinces where MSF is present throughout the year.  \n\nRead more about MSF’s work on measles at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/measles \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Dr. Hassan recently worked in Gaza with another aid organization.  \n\nRegarding a report released by Save the Children on June 24 stating that an estimated 20,000 or more children are missing in Gaza, Dr. Haj-Hassan said:  \n\n\"I think the report describes them potentially trapped under the rubble, buried in mass graves, unaccompanied from their families. There are multiple ways these children can be, ‘missing,’ but all of them are very horrifying places for your imagination to go.  \n\nI'm not surprised by that figure, even if it was gut-wrenching to see it on paper, just because even in the hospital where I was working, there were many children that would come into the emergency department injured. And when I would inquire of distant family members who had survived those attacks, they would tell me that they don't know where the younger brother is or where the older sister is of this child and family that they were able to retrieve from the rubble.  \n\nAnd ultimately, they're not able to retrieve anybody else from the rubble. And those people are never buried. We don't know what their fate is. We don't know how long they survive under the rubble before they ultimately die of suffocation and their injuries.  \n\nThere were also multiple children in the hospital who were orphaned since October and separated from their families and are now living either as injured patients or as internally displaced persons within the hospital grounds, unaccompanied and being cared for by benevolent strangers from their community.\" \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which overturned the historic Roe v. Wade ruling and the recognition of safe abortion care as a constitutional right. We’ve witnessed firsthand how restricting access to abortion harms the health and wellbeing of the people who need it. \n\nTranscript:\nSafe abortion care is essential health care. It's been two years since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to abortion. Let's talk about it. \n\nMSF doesn't currently work in the US, but we do provide safe abortion care and treatment for complications from unsafe abortion around the world. Country to country, the restrictions and the challenges are different.\n\nBut as a physician who has worked in many countries, I recognize the similarities. No matter where they live, people who are denied access to safe abortion care are at greater risk for complications than those who can access safe care. That can be because they are forced to carry an unintended pregnancy to term with its ensuing complications, or because they are forced to access unsafe means for abortion.\n\nAnother similarity are the economic and psychosocial ramifications of carrying an unintended pregnancy. That's why safe abortion care is an essential part of comprehensive health care. \n\nA few years ago, I was on assignment with MSF. In a country where abortion is restricted. One night, a woman came in heavily bleeding with a life-threatening complication of pregnancy. She needed us to provide safe abortion care to save her life.\n\nThe staff gathered quickly to decide how we would care for her. Not everyone agreed about abortion, but despite our differing convictions and values, we all were united by a single truth that we were there to help reduce her suffering. And that's what we agreed to do. The patient went on to receive high-quality and safe care within our MSF facility.\n\nShe was able to survive and she and her family were so grateful. At MSF, we see firsthand that restricting abortion only harms the health and well-being of the people who need it. Anyone who seeks an abortion, no matter their reason, is deserving of high-quality and dignified care.\n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/abortion\n\n#abortionishealthcare #doctorswithoutborders #safeabortioncare \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) mental health activity manager Davide Musardo describes the unrelenting mental health impacts of the war in Gaza on children and how MSF is working to help them. \n\nTRANSCRIPT:\nWhat we are seeing in little children, especially, are symptoms related to depression, because they lost everything. They lost their parents, they lost their siblings, they lost their house, their toys, everything that makes their daily life normal.\n\nWhat we see are symptoms also of anxiety, stress reaction, acute stress reaction, and many times the desire to die, instead of living this horror they are living in this moment.\n\nChildren are the most affected because they don't have the capacity to explain what is happening to them. They don't have the tools to cope with all these tragic situations.\n\nThe difficulty we are facing at this moment is that there is no space for them to fully recover. This is because they are living in a constant situation of exposure to trauma, to explosions, and to bombings.\n\nAnd this doesn't allow them to start a process of healing that should be done as soon as possible—as soon as we have the ceasefire.\n\nBecause without a ceasefire, it will be difficult [for them] to get over this situation.\n\nWhat we are doing with them is mainly play therapy. It's through play that we get over the trauma, the pain, how to manage the pain, how to manage some emotions that are coming and are not easy to deal with.\n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/our-response-israel-gaza-war\n\n#doctorswithoutborders #mentalhealth #Gaza \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

They continued north through Central America, stopping in Mexico City, where they are currently staying in one of several makeshift migrant camps that have sprung up because the city does not have enough shelters to accommodate all the people who need them. Like many of their neighbors in the camps, the family is applying for asylum in the US. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff visit the camps every day, letting people know how they can get medical and mental health care, including treatment for sexual violence.  \n\nCurrently, the only way for thousands of people stranded in Mexico to access asylum is by making an appointment with US immigration officials through a mobile app known as CBP One. But migrants say the app is unreliable and confusing, and very few appointments are made available each day. \n\nDisclaimer: This interview was conducted in April 2024, prior to the opening of the project in Costa Rica in May 2024.

    "description": "Why do women in Nigeria struggle to provide care for their young children? Several factors, including limited medical facilities, costs tied to travel distance and affording care, and general insecurity contribute to this. In fact, Nigeria currently has the third-highest maternal mortality rate in the world. But beyond childbirth, mothers struggle to find proper care for their young children who fall ill and need treatment. \n\nIn Kano, Benue, Cross River, and Zamfara states, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are providing maternal and neonatal health care, and we’ll be opening a large maternity hospital in Maiduguri in June 2024. In collaboration with the state Ministry of Health, our teams are also providing emergency obstetrics and newborn care at Jahun General Hospital, located in Jigawa state in northern Nigeria. \n\nYet this is still a drop in the ocean when it comes to the immense needs of #women and young children — especially with malnutrition cases on the rise. #doctorswithoutborders  #maternalhealth #maternalmentalhealth #health #mentalhealth\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

The impact of working in such conditions could leave scars that last for years to come.  \n\n\"We've been hearing [how] medical staff in Gaza are heroes,” McMahon says, \"and I think they surely are for what they are doing. And yet it's not a choice. They are all in survival. What else can they do? They have absolutely no time to process what is happening to them.

It’s a highly contagious disease that occurs in places without clean water and proper sanitation—often because of conflict, climate change and weather events. It causes profuse diarrhea and vomiting, and without treatment it can quickly lead to death by intense dehydration. Vaccination is key to preventing the spread of the disease. However, there is currently a global shortage of the oral cholera vaccine due to soaring demand and limited manufacturing capacity.",

Now, people have no access to water and basic necessities and there is no food distribution from aid organizations that can help alleviate the needs. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has re-established a presence in this camp to support the local hispoital and provide medical care. Like in many places in #Sudan, the people in Zalingei have no access to advanced health care, and there is no referral system in place. Our emergency teams have worked to rehabilitate the town's hospital–the only one providing advanced health care in the whole of Cntral Darfur. Our aim is to reopen the maternity, emergency, and pediatric departments, and the operating room. \n\nMSF USA executive director, Avril Benoît, walks us through some of the challenges in Zalingei. \n\n#news #doctorswithoutborders #sudanconflict \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Before handing over activities to the Directorate of Health this year, MSF’s activities in Hawija took a holistic approach to the treatment of chronic diseases, prioritizing mental health care and health promotion, education about lifestyle risk factors, and improving mental well being. In an area where mental health experts are scarce, this has meant investing in coaching local staff to deliver these services to a community that has experienced a crisis. \n\nLearn more at: https://bit.ly/4acM5OX \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Much-needed medications are not reaching hospitals, and a lack of access to care means that usually treatable wounds require amputations. \n\n\"People are unable to receive care on time. So when they come, their wounds are very infected, and you are left with no option but to do surgery—to do an amputation,\" Huster said.\n\nAid that does get through sometimes is not what is needed. \"Trucks with PPE [personal protective equipment] were able to get through,\" she said, \"but we are still waiting for anesthesia medicine, pain medicine, medicine for people who have diabetes, hypertension, or cancer.\"\n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/our-response-israel-gaza-war\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

A military offensive in Rafah will result in even more deaths and destroy the only support that people have left. We need attacks against hospitals and civilians to stop immediately.\n\nA ceasefire in Gaza has never been more urgent. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "“We are the Rohingya nation; we are searching for our shore. Hang on, child; wherever you run, wind, water, and fire will chase you.” \n\nMuhib was haunted by these words, sung by his mother before he fled Myanmar and embarked on a dangerous sea voyage seeking refuge in Malaysia. \n\n\"Lost at Sea\" draws inspiration from Muhib's real-life experiences. He found himself stranded on a fishing boat in the Andaman Sea, where he and others witnessed the loss of 27 lives, underscoring the immense risks faced by those fleeing conflict and persecution.\n\nThe film uses documentary footage painted frame-by-frame with music and poetry from Rohingya artists to tell Muhib’s story in a unique hybrid animation format. This powerful narrative has earned prestigious awards, including the Best International Short Film at the Heroes International Film Festival in Rome and the 4th Chema Castiello Award for Best Short Film.  \n\nLearn more about the film and about the Rohingya people at https://doctorswithoutborders-apac.org/en/remember-the-rohingya\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "This documentary follows the journey of Chimwemwe and Nessie, two Malawian women diagnosed with cervical cancer, as they undergo treatment and travel to Kenya for radiotherapy. \n\nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide and—despite being preventable, detectable, and treatable—it kills hundreds of thousands of women each year. In the landlocked country of Malawi in East Africa, over 4,000 Malawian women fall sick with cervical cancer every year. With 2,905 deaths due to cervical cancer in 2020, the country also has the second highest rate of mortality in the world, after Eswatini. \n\nIn partnership with Malawi’s Ministry of Health, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs a cervical cancer project based in Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in the southern district of Blantyre. The project focuses on providing effective, feasible, and high-impact care to prevent and treat cervical cancer through a comprehensive program that includes screening, consultations, specialized surgery, and palliative care for advanced-stage patients. Radiation therapy, which is considered the first-line treatment for cervical cancer, is currently unavailable in Malawi, though two radiotherapy projects (non-MSF) are ongoing and aim to be operational by 2024. In the meantime, MSF developed a temporary referral system to send some cervical cancer patients to Kenya for radiotherapy. Since 2022, 62 women with cervical cancer have traveled from Malawi to Kenya to receive treatment. \nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The conflict that broke out on April 15, 2023 in Khartoum between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has since then spread across the country, especially in the Darfur regions, with devastating consequences for communities. Most civilian casualties have been people caught in the crossfire or victims of indiscriminate shelling by both parties involved in the conflict. \n\nNear the Chad-Sudan border, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provided surgical trauma care to 1,475 wounded patients in the last six months at Adré Hospital and expanded activities to meet the urgent medical needs of a growing refugee population, as half a million Sudanese have recently sought safety in Chad. In this interview, Jérôme Tubiana, MSF advisor on migration, who has visited Sudan twice since the war started, discusses the dynamics of the conflict and the humanitarian situation in Darfur, where MSF teams operate in El Fasher and El Geneina hospitals. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Six years after being forced from their homes by extreme violence in Myanmar, Rohingya refugees in neighboring Bangladesh are trapped in the camps where they first sought safety. Hope for a safe return home has faded, conditions in the camps are poor and deteriorating, and their situation is not expected to improve. \n\nThe United Nations body responding to the needs of around 900,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh is providing less and less humanitarian assistance, Rohingya people's movements are restricted and tightly controlled, while fighting between groups for territory in the camps has led to violence and killings. \n\nThe reality in the camps—rampant violence, no access to jobs, limited education, inadequate food and health care—affects young people in a particularly destructive way. This documentary looks at what youth in the Rohingya camps are facing now.

    "description": "For more than two decades, Afghanistan's health care system has grappled with longstanding issues of understaffing, underfunding, and an inadequate response to people’s needs within the health system. In an effort to extend crucial health care services and reduce pediatric and neonatal mortality in the northern provinces of the country, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health, initiated medical services at Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital in Balkh province with a focus on specialized pediatric care.\n \nMSF supports a neonatal intensive care unit, providing care to premature and sick newborns, and also runs a pediatric emergency room for children up to the age of 15, which is supported by a triage system to ensure the most critical patients are admitted and given the care they need. As the sole tertiary medical facility and primary referral center in the region, it serves as a crucial hub, with patients often traveling long distances for treatment there.\n\nRead more at https://bit.ly/3H4QVAV\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

A little more than a week before, he had been injured in a blast close to his home.\n\nThis week there's been urgent updates: Fuel and medical supplies have reached critically low levels at Al-Aqsa hospital. Our emergency coordinator warns: “We are running out of essential supplies to treat them.” On December 6, for the first time since the escalation of the conflict, the number of people killed arriving to Al-Aqsa surpassed the number of injured people. 115 people killed in 24 hours.

Many people have taken refuge in and around Nasser Hospital, which MSF supports. Here, MSF patients tell their stories.\n\n\"I was injured in my leg, my back, and my left hand,\" one patient says. \"I had burns and flesh wounds. My mother had her hand amputated, and my little niece was killed. What have these young children done to deserve this?”\n\nDisplaced people taking refuge outside are occupied with trying to find food and water. \"We have a hard time finding bread for the kids, and if we get some we divide it to feed all the family,” one mother says. \"Other than that, [we face] difficulty in [finding] water, especially fresh water.”\n\nThere is little humanitarian aid trickling into Gaza and everything is in short supply—food, water, and medicines. MSF is calling for an immediate and sustained ceasefire and the allowance of badly needed humanitarian aid to cross into Gaza.\n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/our-response-israel-gaza-war\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Dr. Ruba is a Palestinian physician in Gaza who has continued to try to help her patients. Here, she describes her situation after two months of war.\n\nTranscript:\n\nWe are displaced south from the valley, which is supposed to be a safe area, but every night, every day, there are airstrikes. They are targeting everybody. Nobody is safe.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of injuries. We saw burns from different kinds of sources. We saw raw areas. We saw fractures. Also, there are a lot of kids with amputations.\n\nWe have only the primary medical supplies with paracetamol, ibuprofen, and dressings, and unfortunately, we don't have access to our clinic. The Israeli army cut the road.\n\nWe treated a six-year-old female child. She was badly injured with external fixator, and there is a big raw area. She was crying, shouting.\n\nShe was begging for painkillers, for sedation, because she's tired from pain, and she's tired from inability to move her arm. In most of shelters, you will find fleas, you will find all kinds of skin diseases, all kinds of gastrointestinal symptoms, And in one shelter near where I am located, there is hepatitis A spread between people.\n\nIt's really hard to treat them because we don't have access to the needed drugs. We don't have access to anything at all. Water and food, they are not clean.\n\nAnd people are now eating anything they could find, because it's really starvation here. I don't believe that anything I say will change the picture.\n\nMy only message that Palestinians have the right to be treated as human beings, have the right to live. Every day, every night I fear for my kids' life, for my life.\n\nAnd I'm sorry to say that, but after 60 days of war, I'm losing hope, and I am saying that the ones who passed away in the (first) few days, were very lucky.\n\nThey didn't witness two-months of terrifying days and nights. I'm seeing my people suffer, and I cannot do anything. This world is not fair. \n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/our-response-israel-gaza-war\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Communications Manager Faris Al-Jawad, based in the West Bank, spoke to ABC News on November 6, 2023, about what MSF staff in Gaza are reporting and what is happening to children who are left orphaned by the bombing.\n\nTranscript:\nI also like to ask you about this new acronym that has been created, specifically due to this conflict. W-C-N-S-F, which stands for Wounded Child, no Surviving Family. How prevalent of an issue is that?\n\nI mean, the vast majority of the patients that we see, that our teams see in the hospitals around Gaza are indeed children. The other day after the Jabaliya camp was hit, we received many children in Al Shipper Hospital, and one of our colleagues described to me the fact that most of these children arrived without any parents, without any family that were screaming for their parents, screaming for their family. There was nobody there. So our team member had to stay with the children, obviously give them emergency medical care, but also stay with them thereafter because they're alone.\n\nAnd you said that in those cases they were able to stay with those children, but if we're talking about large volumes, what happens to those kids? Do they end up then just staying at the hospital indefinitely?\n\nWell, it's difficult to track, but indeed, the hospitals themselves are loaded with not only severely wounded patients in beds on the ground, in the corridors, but of course, thousands and thousands of people seeking shelter. So it's just carnage. There's no other way to describe it. There's nowhere for people to go. The idea to be able to evacuate these hospitals is just ludicrous. There's nowhere to go. \n\nAnd indeed, leaving the hospitals with patients, obviously, who are sick and ill and in dire shape would mean a death sentence. So it's just an untenable situation. The situation needs to stop, the bombing needs to stop. We need to cease fire now. \n\nQuite frankly, it's just unfathomable how this is still going on. World leaders, I don’t know how they can sleep at night, quite frankly, I do not understand it. We've been saying the same thing over and over again. It seems that our words are just falling on deaf ears sometimes. It doesn't even seem worth doing these interviews to some degree because it seems like nobody's listening.\n\nIf there's someone who's in America, in Canada, in Africa right now who wants to help, is there anything that they can do from home?\n\nI believe it's everybody's wish and responsibility to try and push for a ceasefire. And whether that be the people of the United States or the people anywhere across the world, we need a ceasefire. \n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/msf-violence-gaza-escalates-despite-calls-ceasefire\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

In this excerpt from the interview, she describes what she witnessed—and what her Palestinian colleagues are still experiencing. \n\n\"When everything went off and we got the notice to move south of Wadi Gaza,\nI was texting my nurses at Indonesia Hospital and I said—we lost a nurse [during] weekend one. He was killed when the ambulance outside the hospital was blown up and I was texting them when we got the evacuation orders and I said, 'Did any of you lose staff? Did any of you get out? Like, are any of you coming down this way?’ \n\n\"And the only answer I got was, 'This is our community. This is our family. These are our friends. If they're going to kill us, we're going to die saving as many people as we can.' And I said, 'If I can ever have an ounce of the heart that you have, I will, I will die a happy person.' They were incredible. \n\n\"I would like to send out a reminder that there are civilians seeking shelter there and that my doctors and nurses didn't leave out of loyalty to their community. And I know that there is an idea being pushed right now that anyone that stayed behind is going to be considered some kind of a threat. And I want to remind people that the people that stayed behind are heroes. \n\n\"You’re talking about doctors, nurses in the hospital.\n\n\"I wake up every morning and I send out a text message and I ask, 'Are you alive?'

We understand if you want to leave us.' And they said, 'You are family, too. And we're not going anywhere.’\n\n\"Your staff, the Palestinians who worked for MSF, for Doctors Without Borders, were concerned about your safety.\n\n\"We would have died within a week without [our Palestinian colleagues]. They are the only reason we are alive. \n\n\"It's incredible that this took so long to get Americans, sick people, starting to move through that Rafah border crossing. It's, it's inexplicable.\n \n\"And we were desperate. We did a calorie count at one point based on our supplies and figured out that if all of us, there's 50 people with us, living in a parking lot now, only ate 700 calories a day, if that's all we had, we had two days of food left and that's it. And our national staff took off. We had no cell service at that point, so we had no idea what had happened to them. There's bombs going off all around us because there's no safe place in Gaza.\n\n\"Even getting through that Rafah border crossing. What was that like? \n\n\"They didn't leave our side for a second. \n\n\"You're—the national staff. \n\n\"The national staff. \n\n\"Because they feared for your safety even at the border crossing.\n \n\"They made sure they were standing between us and desperate people. They made sure that they were talking to every official that they could find, trying to push us through, trying to get us on the bus, trying to get us out. \n\n\"And we're sitting there, watching these incredible men who have sacrificed everything for us, who have sacrificed time with their families, their own physical safety, their own water supply they were giving to us. \n\n\"And we're watching them fight to get us across the border, knowing that we were not bringing them with us. And they didn't, they didn't waver. Ibrahim was right in the front with our passports, fighting so hard to get us on, and we get to Arish that night and find out his parents are dead.\"\n\nRead more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/gaza-update-movement-staff-rafah-crossing\n \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

We are providing reliable information to better understand the impact abortion can have on mental health. \n\nLearn more at https://bit.ly/SACisHealthCare\n\nTranscript:\nYou may have heard that having an abortion negatively impacts mental health and can lead to issues like depression. \n\nThis is not true.\n\nIn fact, a landmark study published in 2020 found that the emotion most commonly reported after a safe abortion is relief.\n\nHowever, research has shown that a person's mental health can be significantly impacted if they are denied an abortion.\n\nAround 95% of women who were denied an abortion reported increased feelings of anxiety, lower self-esteem, and lower life satisfaction in the days after being denied an abortion.\n\nScientific evidence clearly shows that safe abortion does not cause more mental health issues than being denied a safe abortion. \n\nOf course, everyone comes to an abortion with different life experiences. \n\nA good indicator of a person's mental health after a desired abortion is their mental health before. \n\nWhat can negatively impact the mental health of someone who has had an abortion is encountering stigma and judgment. \n\nDisclaimer: Everyone is different, and if you have specific questions related to your health, or are considering a course of treatment, you should obtain advice, diagnosis, and treatment directly from a qualified healthcare provider.

Most of the patients are women and children. Many are in the tents set up by MSF because even though they could be discharged they don’t have homes to return to. \n\nTeams in different parts of Afghanistan sent additional supplies yesterday, and the Herat team donated mass casualty medical supplies to the regional hospital, enough to treat 400 people. #globalnews #earthquake #heratearthquake #afghanistan #emergency #health",

    "description": "As a medical humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sees the impacts of climate change on health every day. Extreme weather events wreak havoc on countries and communities, destroying homes and the environment and causing injury and trauma. Beyond that, these disasters can result in vector-borne, food-borne, or waterborne diseases that affect humans. \n\nThe burning of fossil fuels causes air pollution—heat waves can worsen it, creating respiratory issues and heart diseases. And it makes those already affected by these issues more vulnerable. MSF is working to address how we can prepare for and help mitigate the health impacts on the communities we serve.

    "description": "On Tuesday, September 19 at 12:00 PM ET join Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) for a virtual conversation with Phumeza Tisile, a tuberculosis survivor and advocacy officer for TB Proof, and Stephen Anguva Shikoli, national coordinator of the Network of TB Champions. In this live discussion, you’ll learn about their experiences surviving TB, which is still the world’s deadliest infectious disease despite the fact that it is curable. \n\nPhumeza lost her hearing as a side effect of the older regimen of drugs often used to treat multidrug-resistant TB. She has worked in partnership with MSF for years to take on Johnson & Johnson and other pharmaceutical corporations blocking people's access to newer and safer treatments, and was recently profiled as one of the TIME100 Next leaders in global health. Phumeza and Stephen are both extraordinary leaders in advocating for access to lifesaving TB treatments and diagnostic tests for everyone, no matter who they are or where they live.   \n\nWe're hosting this conversation with Phumeza and Stephen in the run-up to the United Nations High-Level Meeting on TB on September 22. MSF and other organizations are demanding that US corporations Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Cepheid pledge to take action ahead of this landmark meeting to expand access to the lifesaving TB drug bedaquiline and GeneXpert tests, respectively. \n\nMSF is one of the largest nongovernmental providers of TB treatment worldwide, and we also advocate for better care for people living with TB. Shailly Gupta, communications advisor for MSF’s Access Campaign, will moderate the discussion, and Dr. Stijn Deborggraeve, diagnostics advisor for infectious diseases for the MSF Access Campaign, will be available to answer your questions. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Here are some things to expect. \n\nTranscript:\n\nEveryone’s abortion feels different. \n\nBut here are some things to expect when considering an abortion with pills to end an early pregnancy.\n\nThere are two medications often used together for a safe abortion – mifepristone and misoprostol. \n\nThere’s decades of research and experience showing how safe and effective these pills are. \n\nIt’s also possible to have a safe abortion with misoprostol alone.\n\nIf you are taking mifepristone, you might not feel much at first.\n\nMost people start to experience cramps and bleeding after taking the misoprostol pills. \n\nSome have light cramping, while for others it’s very intense. \n\nMost people are somewhere in the middle.\n\nCramping is a common sign that your uterus is contracting, and the medication is working. \n\nYou can start taking ibuprofen before the cramps begin, even before you take the misoprostol. \n\nA heating pad or hot water bottle can also help relieve cramps.\n\nThe heaviest bleeding will likely start four to six hours after taking the first round of misoprostol, and you might pass some large clots. \n\nBleeding usually slows down within 24 hours, but it’s normal to have continued light bleeding for a few weeks.\n\nYou might have nausea, diarrhea, fever, or headaches—these can be temporary side effects of the medication.\n\nAfterwards, you should start feeling better and better each day. \n\nIf you start to feel sicker, then you should seek medical attention. \n\nFor more information on abortion with pills, talk to a health provider or go to HowToUseAbortionPill.org.\n\nLearn more at https://bit.ly/48fzZny\n\nDisclaimer:\nEveryone is different, and if you have specific questions related to your health, or are considering a course of treatment, you should obtain advice, diagnosis, and treatment directly from a qualified healthcare provider.

    "title": "How to Talk About Abortion",
    "description": "Ever wonder how to talk about abortion? Here are a few tips to help start conversations around this essential health care and how to use language that's free from judgement and misinformation.\n\nTranscript:\n\nAbortion is common. \n\nPeople have abortions everywhere, every day. \n\nWorldwide, more than half of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion. \n\nIt’s essential health care for millions of women, girls, and anyone who can become pregnant. \n\nSo why don’t we talk about it more? \n\nAbortion is still surrounded by misinformation, myths, and stigma. \n\nThis can lead to an environment of secrecy, where people don’t talk about abortion because they fear judgment and rejection.\n\nIt can even push people to have unsafe abortions—a leading cause of maternal deaths.\n\nThat’s why it’s important for us to talk about abortion. \n\nHere's how.\n\nFirst, start with compassion and understanding of other people’s experiences. \n\nDon’t be judgmental. \n\nBelieving that everyone has the right to make decisions about their own bodies means no one should have to justify their decision to seek an abortion.\n\nIf you are speaking with someone who is against abortion, don’t start a debate. \n\nTry to ask open-ended questions about people’s attitudes and experiences with abortion. \n\nFor example: “If someone you love had an abortion, how would you want that experience to be for them?” \n\nTransformation happens slowly, and usually not by losing an argument. \n\nSometimes, hearing a story or being asked a thoughtful question can be enough.\n\nSecond, choose your words carefully. \n\nAnti-abortion groups use language that is intentionally negative and shaming. \n\nAvoid stigmatizing language. \n\nYou can say “anti-abortion” instead of “pro-life”, “fetus” or “embryo” instead of “unborn child.” \n\nFocus your message on the pregnant person, their health, safety, and rights.\n\nBe inclusive in your language - people of all ages and religions, from every walk of life, choose to have abortions. \n\nCouples often make the choice together, and men can play an active supporting role. \n\nThird, use reliable sources and references. \n\nThere is a lot of misinformation out there. \n\nThis can harm and confuse abortion seekers. \n\nTry to counter this with accurate information from trusted sources, like doctorswithoutborders.org and howtouseabortionpill.org. \n\n Be a resource for those in need.\n\n Safe abortion care is health care. \n\nSo, let's break the silence! \n\nLearn more at https://bit.ly/48fzZny\n\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Much of the world knows nothing about Central African Republic (CAR). This country receives little media coverage apart from stories focusing on security issues.  Having worked in CAR for 25 years, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have witnessed another crisis—the dire lack of access to health care in many parts of the country. \n\nIt is estimated that less than half of the health facilities in CAR are fully functional, and the country has only 0.6 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants—less than half the average across Africa. CAR has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world, at just 54 years. The country's security and economic issues make it difficult for medical care providers and humanitarian organizations to work, but the utter lack of assistance begs the question—does anybody care?\n\nThis minidocumentary takes viewers into different parts of Mbomou prefecture, where MSF supports the regional hospital and health posts, yet so much more needs to be done.

The young nation has seen the worst floods in the region over the past four years, exacerbated by climate change. During the rainy season, usually from June to October, floodwaters have swept away entire villages, destroyed crops, drowned cattle, and severely damaged infrastructure, while forcing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Floods make travel almost impossible, and the only way to get around is by boat. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) recently donated canoes to 11 villages in Upper Nile state to help transport sick people and expectant mothers when floods cut off access to care.",

    "description": "In northwestern Nigeria, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has scaled up what was already one of our most extensive malnutrition programs in the world. Attacks by armed groups have made it extremely difficult for people in this region to reach their farms or workplaces, affecting food supplies. \n\nHadiza Sani brought her twins Husseina and Hassana to an MSF-supported hospital in Zamfara state, where they were treated for malnutrition and eventually recovered. “I am very happy with the kind of care given to them,” she said. “We were told in the hospital to take care of them by providing them with nutritious foods. Honestly, based on my situation, I won’t be able to do that.”\n\nWithout adequate nutrition, children can become caught in a downward spiral. The number of patients in MSF's therapeutic feeding centers in the region is expected to keep rising. MSF is urging all aid organizations working in Nigeria to scale up their response to this crisis and is calling on the Nigerian government to act now to prevent a catastrophic loss of life in the months ahead.

And that’s what we’re doing right now; it’s that voice that made it out.” In this video, a survivor of torture tells the story of how he used art to find new meaning for his trauma at the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Comprehensive Care Centre (CAI) in Mexico City.\n\nAt the CAI, MSF has provided comprehensive care to survivors of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman treatment since 2017. Our patients also report having been exposed to sexual violence, assault, kidnapping, and other kinds of abuse, often at the hands of organized crime. \n\nThe CAI uses a holistic approach to care that includes psychological or psychiatric treatment, social work, physical rehabilitation, and outpatient care. Occupational therapy often includes artmaking, where this patient finds the ability to give new meaning to his life experiences and look toward the future.

    "description": "Aisha is six years old and wants to be a teacher. When she was four years old, she got noma–an infection of the face that affects children, 90 percent of whom die within the first few weeks of developing symptoms. This neglected disease impacts people worldwide living in poverty without adequate access to health care. Aisha's cheek started swelling and some of her teeth fell out. She was taken to a hospital near her home in northern Nigeria, but the treatment did not work. Quickly the flesh and bones in her face were destroyed and a hole appeared. \n\nHer twin brother was protective and supportive, but the children laughed at her, so Aisha stopped going out. One day a local person visited the family and took Aisha and her mother, Hauwa, on the 12-hour drive to Sokoto Noma Hospital, which is supported by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Finally, Aisha had reconstructive surgery to repair the hole in her face. She also found the hospital to be a place where she felt safe and could find companionship. Now, Aisha is counting the days until she can go to school.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have witnessed first-hand how these conditions are harming people’s physical and mental health. Located in the southern West Bank in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Masafer Yatta was designated a closed military zone in 1981, rendering its residents “illegal” and thus eligible for eviction under Israeli law. As a result, many Palestinians have been forced from their homes in what may amount to forcible transfer, which is prohibited under international law.   \n\nToday, 1,144 Palestinians remain in Masafer Yatta, including 569 children. In addition to demolition of their homes, schools, and other structures, residents live with limited access to food, water, education, and medical care, and increasing harassment and restrictions imposed by Israeli authorities, including more checkpoint installations, vehicle confiscation, and curfews. In response, MSF is running three clinics in the area, providing basic health care and a range of services including pediatric care, treatment for chronic communicable diseases, reproductive care, mental health care for survivors of violence, and nutritional screening.   \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

We need to focus on the patients, because they need us.”\n\nAs a qualified sign language interpreter, she’s able to speak with people who are hearing impaired or have a speech disability. It’s another way she contributes to providing access to care. \nThe trauma hospital in Tabarre provides emergency, surgical, burns, and psychological care, and physiotherapy.

The humanitarian response so far has been inadequate, leaving people highly vulnerable to health risks like cholera, measles, malnutrition and sexual violence. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have been working in informal displacement sites around Goma since May 2022, providing free medical care, drinking water, and constructing latrines and showers, but this is not enough. In Bulengo, an informal settlement a few miles west of Goma, there is just one latrine for almost 500 people—less than one-tenth of what people need in a humanitarian emergency. In recent months, the health situation has become critical in Bulengo, with suspected cases of measles and cholera multiplying over the past few weeks.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "Ukraine: Reaching Areas Cut Off from Health Care",
    "description": "As the war in Ukraine escalated in February 2022, many residents of the Kharkiv region—including medical staff—fled to western Ukraine or left the country. The loss of health care workers, coupled with the massive medical needs related to the war, soon pushed the health care system to the brink. In most of the villages and towns where MSF teams worked, health care workers had left, health facilities had been destroyed or looted, and people couldn’t get the medicine they needed for new or chronic conditions. The teams would set-up clinics on the street or in bus stops or town halls—frequently with the help of the residents themselves, like Lyudmila Karatsyuba, 67, a resident of Novy Burluk in the Kharkiv region who hosted an MSF team in her home. The hospitality of the people MSF assists makes emergency humanitarian aid possible and provides the teams and patients with a safe place to work. While providing care in Lyudmila’s home, the teams also worked on fixing the damaged clinic in the village.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Our teams have been working in Greece since 2016 to treat the physical and mental wounds of people on the move. We see people who come to Europe searching for protection and instead are trapped in prison-like camps and detention centers with insufficient access to health care and other basic services.  \n\nDuring this virtual project visit, we will take you to see MSF’s mobile clinic outside of the Vathy refugee camp on Samos. You will also visit the Athens Day Care Center, which provides mental health support, care for non-communicable diseases and sexual reproductive health (SRH), and access to social and legal services. Along the way you will hear from Ioanna Pertsinidou, project coordinator; Anna Karalia, SRH midwife; Sarah Massay, health promoter; and Nicholas Papachrysostomou, MSF head of mission in Greece.

    "description": "We invite you to join us for a live online briefing with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in Ukraine on Thursday, February 23, at 12:00 pm ET.\n\nAfter the escalation of full-scale war in Ukraine one year ago, MSF expanded its medical humanitarian response to help meet the evolving needs of people caught in conflict. War has been simmering in eastern Ukraine since 2014, and many people living on the frontlines in this region have been suffering from physical and psychological wounds since then.\n\nToday we have around 800 MSF staff—the vast majority of whom are from Ukraine—working with local organizations to deliver medical aid and support to the people who need it. It is important to note that Ukrainian health staff and civil society organizations are leading the humanitarian response. MSF's interventions focus on filling the gaps: our teams are treating patients near the frontlines, running mobile clinics, evacuating patients to safer areas, offering mental health care, and providing supplies and training to health facilities. The context remains extremely volatile, and we have had to step back in some regions. MSF is currently unable to access areas controlled by Russian forces, including areas in the east where we have been present since 2014.\n\nJoin us for a conversation with our colleagues Christopher Stokes, emergency coordinator for MSF in Kyiv, and Dr. Albina Zharkova, deputy project coordinator for MSF's medical evacuation train in Ukraine. Together they will discuss how MSF teams have adapted our operations over the past year and how we are preparing for the humanitarian challenges ahead. This live briefing will be moderated by MSF-USA Executive Director Avril Benoît.\n\nRing the bell to be notified when we go live or visit http://bit.ly/3XJziMS to RSVP.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "3 Things to Know About the Syria Turkey Earthquake",
    "description": "The earthquake in Syria and Turkey (renamed Türkiye) has killed over 36,000 and left tens of thousands of people injured and in need of medical care. Teams from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) were already working in northwest Syria, so we were able to start treating patients in the first hours of the disaster.  \n \nOver the past week, we’ve been supporting medical facilities to care for the injured, providing ambulances to transport them, and getting urgent relief items to people in need. We also received the tragic news of the death of two of our colleagues who were found under the rubble. Some have lost their loved ones and their homes. We are in close touch with our colleagues inside northwestern Syria, providing them with psychological support and other services.   \n\nAvril Benoît, the executive director of MSF-USA, discusses three things to know about the crisis: \n \n1. Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless in freezing temperatures. Houses and apartment buildings have been destroyed on a massive scale. We also must not forget about the impact of this disaster on peoples’ mental health. We are providing psychological first aid to our staff and to patients in the health facilities we support and across our mobile clinics in northwestern Syria. \n\n2. The earthquake compounded an existing crisis in northwestern Syria. War, a dire economic situation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an outbreak of cholera had already plunged the region into a humanitarian crisis and pushed medical facilities to the brink. Nearly three-quarters of the entire population had already been forced from their homes by over a decade of war, with many people living in displacement camps in terrible conditions. \n\n3. This is a massive disaster that requires a massive international aid effort. More support must reach northwestern Syria as soon as possible.

Patients in rural areas undergo a long and difficult journey through mountainous areas and destroyed roads to reach Al Jamhouri hospital, making it especially challenging to arrive in time for a safe delivery.\n\nMSF began supporting the hospital in 2021, running the maternal and neonatal services and providing additional support to the ministry of health staff. Over one year, the rate of newborn deaths dropped from roughly 24 percent to 10 percent. \n\nMSF teams also supported more than 17,000 prenatal consultations and 3,000 postnatal consultations during the same period. Some of the patients were receiving their first prenatal consultations in the eighth or ninth month of pregnancy.

MSF teams have donated blankets and essential life kits to displaced people in the region. The earthquakes destroyed hundreds of houses, leaving thousands homeless.

In collaboration with the Blantyre district health authorities, MSF teams have been working to improve access to screening, early diagnosis, and treatment for cervical cancer since 2018.  \n \nA largely preventable disease, higher-income countries have made strong progress against cervical cancer by centering human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations and the early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions. The vast majority of deaths due to the disease affect women in low- and middle-income countries that lack those resources.  \n \n“Cervical cancer screening shouldn’t be a one-off thing,” says Tifera Botomani Mapasa, MSF health promotion supervisor in Blantyre. “Women should embrace cervical cancer screening just like people have embraced HIV testing.” \n \nIn 2021, MSF carried out more than 6,000 cervical cancer consultations at Queen Elisabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre district. Some 460 patients received surgery and 401 went through chemotherapy. \n\nRead more at http://bit.ly/40rldq4\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

This neglected disease impacts people worldwide living in poverty without adequate access to health care.\n\n‘Restoring Dignity’ follows the journey of noma survivors from different regions of Nigeria over the course of a year. The survivors are children, teenagers, and adults who have lived for decades with the physical and psychological consequences of this disease. \n\nSince 2014, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been supporting the Nigerian ministry of health, in the Noma Children's Hospital in Sokoto, the only hospital in the world entirely dedicated to noma patients.

Four times a year, MSF sends experienced plastic and maxillofacial surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologist to perform surgeries for noma survivors. \n\nThis is a short version of the documentary 'Restoring Dignity,’ by filmmakers Claire Jeantet and Fabrice Catérini, produced by Inediz in collaboration with MSF. \n\nFind out more at https://noma.msf.org/\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

And this is having a huge impact.”\n\nWhen this video was made in 2021, COVID-19 travel restrictions limited MSF’s ability to provide services to noma survivors. Through a collaboration with the ministry of health, MSF supported a surgical team in Sokoto to carry out 20 surgeries.\n\nMany more people need access to these life-changing services, so MSF is calling for three action points to be carried out by the international community:\n- Put noma on the World Health Organization's list of neglected tropical diseases to shine a light on this disease and stimulate more research\n- Include noma as an indicator for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—noma is linked to poverty and children’s access to health care and vaccinations, all components that the SDGs address\n- And to integrate noma into routine health services so that children in endemic countries are screened for the early signs and symptoms of the disease, and more lives can be saved.\n\nWatch the short version of MSF’s documentary on noma at https://youtu.be/2lBSROAH3K4\nLearn more at https://noma.msf.org/\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Yeah, it’s very delicious. \n\n[0:13] \nHere in northwestern Nigeria, we’re responding to a massive nutritional emergency brought on by violence and displacement, rising food prices, and climate change. We use this food to help severely malnourished children quickly gain weight and get healthy again. \n\n[0:29] \nIt is highly effective because it’s rich in protein and nutrients and it packs a lot of calories. A  child can get a lot of energy from just small amounts. This is important because their stomachs have shrunk.  \n\n[0:42] \nThe packets can be stored at room temperature and no preparation is needed—it’s ready to eat. And importantly, children love the taste, so they want to eat it. \n\n[0:53] \nNutrition emergencies like the one here in Nigeria are devastating for families and communities. And they are happening around the world right now, not only here in Nigeria.

    "title": "Ukraine: MSF Evacuates Psychiatric Patients from Kherson",
    "description": "In November 2022, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) evacuated 400 psychiatric patients from a hospital in Kherson, in eastern Ukraine. The city had been recently retaken by Ukrainian forces, but heavy artillery fire was still being exchanged, and de-mining teams were in the process of detonating unexploded ordnance. Without power, and in close proximity to the fighting, the hospital was not a safe place. MSF teams worked with local partners to organize a plan to bring patients west from Kherson to other medical facilities in Mikolaiv and Odesa. \n\nThe humanitarian needs in areas retaken by the Ukrainian military are high, especially for people with chronic diseases, the elderly, and those with conditions that affect their mobility. While reaching the most vulnerable in these areas is essential, it entails great risk for humanitarian workers.

Those returning to their villages are finding destroyed houses and land, still surrounded by stagnant water. Meanwhile, those remaining in camps and informal shelters are faced with the threat of winter. The need for clean drinking water, food and health care remains at an all-time high.\n\nTeams from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are currently responding in three provinces, Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. We have 10 mobile medical teams working in Balochistan and Sindh, where we are seeing high numbers of people with malaria, diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, and alarming numbers of people with malnutrition.

    "description": "With more than 1,600 miles of coastline, Mozambique is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has started a new planetary health project in Nampula province, an area prone to extreme weather events that are causing climate-sensitive diseases that used to appear seasonally to become prevalent year-round.\n \n“Today, malaria is basically present throughout the year, which is very different from what happened in the past when malaria was seen mostly in the rainy season,” said MSF health promotion supervisor Adamo Armando Palame. Changing weather patterns over the last decade have resulted in shorter but heavier rainy seasons, resulting in the creation of lots of small lakes in which mosquitoes breed throughout the year. The heavy rains also wash away crops and impact agricultural yields, affecting food production and people’s income.

    "description": "The West African country of Niger is currently experiencing a massive food security crisis and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is responding by treating high numbers of malnourished children in different locations. In this video, MSF Hospital Director Bengaly Aboubacar and other Nigerien staff at MSF's Madarounfa project walk us through the process of caring for severely malnourished patients. \n\nWhen they first arrive at the MSF hospital in Madarounfa, patients go directly into triage where medical staff determine what care they need. From triage, severely malnourished children will be admitted to emergency care. These children often have other severe medical conditions and are sent to the intensive care unit where they might be treated for severe pneumonia, malaria, or anemia. After they’ve been stabilized, patients are ready to be treated for malnutrition and are moved into the ward where they are fed a nutritional therapeutic milk formula. Once they are out of harm’s way, patients move into the transition ward where treatment continues and the child's caregiver receives health education. At this point, some children are introduced to ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF); one brand MSF uses is Plumpy ’Nut, a blend of fortified peanut butter, milk, and sugar that contains essential vitamins and minerals.\n\nOnce the child is healthy, they are sent home and continue to receive regular care at the health center closest to where they live. They are usually given supplies of RUTF to cover them until their next appointment.

    "description": "In 2022, at least 30 countries have seen outbreaks of cholera or similar diseases and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is now running cholera interventions in more than ten countries. The current number of outbreaks is unusual and worrying. \n\nCholera is a deadly disease that spreads rapidly, even though it should be easy to prevent and treat. The risk factors for cholera outbreaks are always linked to access to safe drinking water and proper wastewater disposal. Lack of clean water can be the result of various causes: climate-related disasters like severe floods or droughts, armed conflict, political instability, and the displacement of people fleeing crises. \n\nToday MSF is running cholera response programs in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Cameroon, Nigeria, Haiti, Lebanon, Syria, and Malawi. Our teams are involved in cholera prevention through health promotion, vaccination, and water and sanitation work. We also set up cholera units in hospitals and clinics, or open standalone cholera treatment centers in large outbreaks so we can treat hundreds of patients simultaneously.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Two decades ago, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was the first to provide free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to people living with HIV in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The high price and scarcity of ARVs in 2002 were the equivalent of a death sentence for so many people at the time, the program was quickly overwhelmed. \n\nSince then, MSF has been a key player in the fight against HIV/AIDS in DRC, and much progress has been made. But an ongoing lack of funding, training for care providers, and ARVs has caused thousands of preventable deaths due to HIV/AIDS every year. “To realize today that we still have a long way to go,” says Dr. Maria Mashako, who has worked at MSF’s clinic in the capital Kinshasa for 20 years. “It’s very frustrating to see that patients still arrive in (severely ill) condition.” \n\nMore than 500,000 people are living with HIV in DRC today, and one in five people still do not have access to treatment, according to the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Only one-third of the children who need treatment are receiving it. Last year, HIV/AIDS caused nearly 14,000 deaths, and close to 20,000 people were newly infected. In 2015, United Nations (UN) member states committed to ending AIDS by 2030 as part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. In DRC, MSF sees that unless donor countries make a much stronger effort to meet the needs, HIV/AIDS will not be a disease of the past any time soon.

More than 1,200 patients are enrolled in the program; a quarter of them are children like Mary who stopped going to school after she was bullied for having epilepsy.\n\nEpilepsy is a common brain disorder that causes recurrent seizures. Although it has no cure, treatment can bring seizures under control in most people. In Liberia’s capital Monrovia, MSF teams use a holistic approach to caring for children with epilepsy with a focus on psychological and emotional well-being. A primary aim is to support their staying in or returning to school.\n\n“Students will start bullying them and they will leave school,” says S. Wonka Reeder, Sr., a psychosocial worker with MSF in Monrovia. “If you don’t work on those things, those psychosocial problems, and they are taking medication, it doesn’t work.”\n\nToday, Mary is back in school and thinking of becoming a doctor.\n\nIn five health centers across the county, MSF teams provide clinical treatment, mental health care, and education to people living with epilepsy. They also provide awareness-raising and other support in patients’ communities to help reduce the barriers to their being accepted in society.\n\nRead more at https://bit.ly/3Xqa7QK\n\n--\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In recent weeks, Honduras has seen a spike in dengue fever cases. Although dengue epidemics are common in the country, this increase is due to a lack of vector control during the COVID-19 pandemic. The changing climate also impacts the transmission of dengue. “It’s climate-sensitive because the mosquito that spreads it breeds in pools of water, which are more common after rainfall, and the mosquito breeding speeds up when it’s hotter and more humid,” said Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) planetary health advisor Lachlan McIver. \n \nSince July, MSF teams have been working to reduce and control dengue in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. In some of the most affected neighborhoods, people are forced to store water due to rationing in the area, which increases the number of places where mosquitos can breed. MSF teams visit people in their homes to share information on how they can prevent mosquitos from breeding and fumigate their homes to reduce the presence of adult mosquitoes.

    "description": "Around 53,000 people—the majority of them women and children—live in Al-Hol camp in northeast Syria. Once a humanitarian camp for people displaced by conflicts in Syria and Iraq, Al-Hol has become more like a detention center for people with perceived affiliations with the Islamic State. People of more than 60 nationalities are held here, their home countries having failed to protect or find long-term solutions for them.\n\n \"I see it as more of an outdoor prison,” said Ayla, a medical doctor who worked with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Al-Hol camp more than a year ago. She used her visual art skills to help process some of the disturbing things she was seeing—violence, intimidation, and people living in miserable conditions behind barbed wire fences. Outsiders are rarely allowed access to the camp and video and photos are not permitted, so Ayla's drawings offer a rare inside look. “Being able to produce this illustration felt a bit like letting go of certain things,” she said.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working with Lebanon’s Ministry of Health and other humanitarian groups to respond to the country’s first outbreak in 30 years. People living in refugee camps and host communities have been impacted by the highly contagious waterborne disease, which causes profuse diarrhea and vomiting and can quickly lead to death left untreated. Lebanon’s current economic crisis has led to the breakdown of water and sanitation systems, creating the perfect conditions for a cholera outbreak, which can rapidly spread through contaminated water supplies. MSF outreach teams are raising awareness of the symptoms, treatment, and prevention of the disease in several parts of Lebanon, and our medical teams are preparing to open cholera treatment centers, training local medical staff, and adapting our hospital in the Bekaa region to treat cholera patients. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

As Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works to reduce our carbon emissions, we are also working to improve our waste management practices. One promising initiative that we recently we piloted in Iraq is the Steriplus, a machine that turns infectious medical waste into domestic waste. Through a process of steaming and shredding, waste such as syringes, dirty bandages, and scalpels is sterilized before it is disposed of. Following the success of the pilot initiative in Iraq, we plan to roll out the machine in more of our projects soon.

    "description": "The Biden administration has announced that it will expand the use of the Title 42 policy that blocks migrants at the US-Mexico border from seeking asylum to include Venezuelans. Under this policy, tens of thousands of Venezuelans who have left their homes and embarked on a long, dangerous journey to reach the US will be stranded in Mexico or Central America—many with no resources, little aid, and nowhere to go. Title 42 is a public health order that was originally invoked by the Trump administration in 2020, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to effectively close the border to asylum seekers. MSF is calling on the Biden administration to end this harmful policy. Our teams along the migration route and the US-Mexico border will immediately work to expand their operations to try to meet the growing needs.

This month marks five years of intense conflict between government forces and non-state armed groups in the region. An estimated one million people have been displaced from their homes due to the violence, often more than once, and more than 4,000 people have been killed. Five years of grief, fear, and instability has had profound consequences on people’s mental health. MSF’s mental health staff see patients suffering from acute stress, anxiety, and trauma. \"Whenever we talk with the people here in Palma [a town in Cabo Delgado],” said MSF psychologist Josuel Moreira, \"it is important to keep in mind that we may be talking with someone who has lost everything.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3SL9NZZ\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Some 600 patients were evacuated to another hospital in the region and the facility was quickly overwhelmed. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) accepted a request by Ukraine’s Ministry of Health to transfer more than 200 of these patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions to a less crowded facility in the country’s capital Kyiv. MSF has been using medicalized trains to evacuate people in need of medical care from areas in the east of the country to facilities further west with greater resources and capacity. MSF medical staff accompany patients and provide care during these long train journeys. On September 23-24, our teams transferred 210 patients from Kharkiv city to Kyiv in two trips over 36 hours.

The houses in Miaonlay have been partially or completely destroyed, and communities are now facing outbreaks of waterborne diseases. In the last week, MSF medical teams have seen 983 patients in Charsadda district with respiratory tract infections, eye infections, acute diarrhea, severe skin infections, and chronic diseases.

    "description": "A devastating conflict broke out last year in the community of Tambura, in South Sudan's Western Equatoria State. An estimated 80,000 people fled their homes and many people were killed or died from other causes related to the conflict. Many survivors living in displacement camps still haven’t found their loved ones, while others know their family members were killed but feel too unsafe to retrieve their bodies. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) identified mental health care services as a major need among traumatized survivors. MSF teams provided community-based mental health care in and around displacement camps, discussing the psychological problems many people were facing in order to normalize talking about them and to provide outlets of support for those who need it.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh: “Help us live as humans”",
    "description": "On August 25, 2017, the Rohingya people in Myanmar were the targets of a large-scale campaign of merciless violence. More than 700,000 people fled for their lives across the border into Bangladesh in a matter of weeks, joining thousands who had fled previous attacks. Today, nearly one million Rohingya still live in crowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions in what is now the largest refugee camp in the world in Cox's Bazar.\n\nTo mark five years of continued displacement with no solution in sight, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) gathered testimonies from several Rohingya refugees who share their hopes and fears. \"We were born as humans and we wish to live a dignified life,\" said 65-year-old Rohingya refugee Mohamed Hussein. \"We are requesting the world to help us live as humans.\" \n\nThe Rohingya are especially vulnerable as stateless people, long denied citizenship in Myanmar. With no official refugee status in Bangladesh, the Rohingya have little access to employment or education and remain dependent on humanitarian aid. MSF teams see the impact of these conditions on patients' health—an increase in skin infections, waterborne diseases, and chronic illnesses like diabetes and high blood pressure. As the largest provider of mental health care in the camp, MSF also sees an increase in needs for psychological and psychiatric care. MSF will continue to provide care for the Rohingya and to advocate for greater international efforts to ensure that they have a chance for a better future.

    "description": "Since June, it is estimated that violence has driven over 80,000 people out of their homes in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF) is providing emergency assistance by distributing kits with essential relief items to displaced people. Since mid-June, over 4,000 families or over 20,000 people have received kits. \n\n“Displaced people need these objects, as well as food, because in their places [of origin], where they were settled, they ended up losing almost everything,” says MSF driver and logistician Jamal Gonçalves. “They need this type of help.” In this video, Gonçalves walks us through what’s in the three different types of relief kits we distribute, the food item kit, the travel kit, and the standard kit.

    "description": "Haiti, still reeling from the power vacuum left after the assassination of its president last year, is dealing with surging violence by armed groups that has left hundreds dead and displaced tens of thousands of people in its capital, Port-au-Prince. The United Nations (UN) has documented a sharp increase in violence this year, with 934 killings, 684 injuries and 680 kidnappings in Port-au-Prince from January to the end of June. In recent months, armed clashes have again destroyed water networks and disrupted water truck deliveries in some neighborhoods. Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF) teams are adapting to the rising insecurity by operating mobile medical teams and providing water and sanitation facilities.\n\nDespite crippling violence and a humanitarian crisis in Haiti, the Biden administration continues a policy of expelling Haitians on deportation flights. Most Haitians have been expelled under Title 42, a health order invoked at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that allows for the blocking and rapid expulsion of migrants, including people seeking protection at the US border. While deportation flights to Haiti have been paused since June, without a change in US policy, Haitians who arrive at the US border could still be expelled back to what has effectively become a conflict zone.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

MSF teams have assisted more than 570 people over the last year in need of urgent medical care and psychological first aid, as well as food and water. Many of these new arrivals have told MSF staff about encountering violence while trying to cross into Europe from Türkiye [formerly Turkey], including beatings, theft, and sexual violence, and about violent interceptions on land and at sea, meant to discourage people from seeking asylum in Europe. MSF is asking the authorities to investigate each allegation of forced return and is calling for a humane and dignified reception for all people arriving on Samos.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

The community helped create a plan that includes training local health workers, establishing a fund to pay health staff once MSF leaves, and working with the authorities to build roads that make access to care more accessible for patients.

    "description": "Hebron is the second-largest city in the West Bank and is divided into two areas: H1—governed by Palestine—and H2—under Israeli control. Home to about 42,000 Palestinians and 700 Israeli settlers, the area has become an epicenter of violence against Palestinian residents. It is also one of the most restricted areas in the West Bank: There are 21 permanent checkpoints operated by Israeli forces, and authorities impose harsh movement restrictions on Palestinian residents. This severely restricts access to health care, making it difficult for people to reach care and for health care providers to enter H2 to provide it. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is the only medical organization present in H2. Staffed by an all-female team, MSF’s clinic was established in August 2021, and provides consultations, sexual and reproductive health services, and mental health care—focusing on women and children. Between August 2021 and May 2022, MSF treated 5,135 patients, approximately half of whom were children under 15.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "It's been five years since the battle to retake the city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, from the Islamic State group (ISg) was officially declared “over” on July 10, 2017. For the city’s people, life has slowly resumed, but rebuilding Mosul’s infrastructure is a slow and arduous process, and the health care system is no exception. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams provided medical humanitarian aid in and around Mosul throughout the fighting and have been supporting the recovery of the city’s shattered health system since the battle’s end.  \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "After 11 years of war, 4.1 million people remain in need of humanitarian aid in northwestern Syria. Bab Al-Hawa crossing on the Syria-Turkey border is the last remaining humanitarian crossing point into the region. Now, this lifeline is at risk of closure if the United Nations (UN) Security Council does not renew the cross-border resolution, which is set to expire on July 10.\n\nClosing the Bab Al-Hawa crossing will reduce access to basic food, water, and health care for millions of people, putting lives at risk. Most hospitals and health facilities would lack the necessary medical supplies to function, leading to preventable deaths. In 2021, 99 percent of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical supplies entered Syria through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing. MSF calls on the UN Security Council to renew the current cross-border resolution and keep Bab Al-Hawa crossing point open.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Since March 31, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has medically evacuated more than 650 patients from war-affected areas in eastern Ukraine to hospitals in safer parts of the country. The war in Ukraine is indiscriminately harming civilians who are struck by heavy weaponry in their homes, shelters, and evacuation routes, according to a report released by MSF, called “No Mercy for Civilians”, which is based on the experiences of patients that we’ve evacuated from eastern Ukraine by train.\n\nMedical data and accounts from these patients and caretakers show that the war in Ukraine is being conducted with an outrageous disregard for civilian lives. This points to a lack of respect for civilian protection, which is a serious violation of international humanitarian law.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Since April, MSF has been increasing its support to Dupti Hospital, which serves a population of more than 1.1 million people including hundreds of thousands of displaced people.

With no plan in place to re-house them, their vulnerability to disease and mental health problems is at an all-time high. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is one of very few organizations providing medical and mental health services in the shelters, and with psychosocial support spread thin, we see that shelter residents are finding comfort in each other—and music. Taking our lead from the communities and working with shelter leaders and local musicians, MSF has been putting on musical programs in some of the largest shelters. This is just one facet of a mental health strategy that ultimately aims to empower shelter leaders to facilitate ongoing support groups for their communities.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "For two years, under a policy known as Title 42, the US government has used the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to close its southern border to asylum seekers. Last week, a federal judge blocked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from terminating Title 42, which had been due to end on May 23rd. Title 42 leaves asylum seekers and migrants stranded in highly insecure conditions and often places them in situations of immediate danger. \n\nTitle 42 has nothing to do with health or with the pandemic. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical teams witness the impacts of this cruel policy, which has severe and damaging consequences on the physical and mental health of people forced to flee. There is no excuse for continuing to misuse the order to turn away asylum seekers and block their right to seek protection.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is seeing a massive spike in the number of children who have measles worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that there were 23 million more babies under one year old who missed their routine vaccinations—including against measles—in 2020 than in 2019. That number hasn’t been this high since 2009.\n\nThere are various reasons for this; in places like Afghanistan, cases are high partly due to conflict and damaged health infrastructure. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), inequitable access to preventive and basic health care services has fueled a cycle of measles outbreaks over the years. Some countries—Liberia, for example—may be feeling the direct effects of COVID-19's interruption of routine childhood vaccination campaigns.\n\nThe path forward is clear: Get vaccines into the arms of children who remain unprotected. Since 2006, MSF has vaccinated nearly 26 million children against measles. This year, MSF teams will continue their work to prevent and respond to measles outbreaks with reactive and proactive vaccinations and treatment.

People whose homes were destroyed have been left with nothing, seeking shelter with friends and relatives. The flash floods also damaged the local water supply system, burying established springs in mud, or contaminating them with floodwater. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provided 187 families with essential relief items, like cooking utensils, blankets, tarps, mosquito nets, and clothes.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "“We never used to know whether the water was clean or not, but we later found out that it was contaminated. The water gave us diarrhea,” said Roda James, a resident of Labarab, a remote area in eastern South Sudan. She and her community are not alone—across South Sudan, access to safe water remains a challenge.\n\nEarly this year, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) launched a campaign to drill ten boreholes to provide safe water for drinking and cooking in the Maruwa, Labarab, and Boma areas in the east of the country. Drilling boreholes is an important health strategy to prevent waterborne diseases. Roda used to spend nearly an hour every day searching for water from the river before a hand pump was recently installed in her village. “We had a lot of sickness and having clean water has helped us a lot,” she said. “We now have access to clean water for cooking and drinking. Our life has changed.”\n\n#shorts #earthday #environmentalhealth #environment_and_society \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams continue to observe people being left to drown at sea, intercepted and pushed back at land and sea borders, denied assistance, and criminalized for seeking safety. The positive response to Ukrainian refugees shows that the EU has always had the tools to provide safe passage and humane reception for all those seeking safety. All they lacked was political will. Everyone seeking asylum, regardless of race, sex, or nationality should receive assistance and protection.

With humanitarian needs growing, the region’s battered health system is facing dire challenges, including a lack of funding, making essential services like prenatal care and breastfeeding support increasingly difficult to access. “Every time we go to the hospital, I find that the services are unavailable,” said Fatima, a displaced person living in Idlib governorate. “They told me that the hospital where my daughter was born is now closed. It used to provide good services.” In response, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) stepped up activities to fill the gaps, assisting 50 percent more deliveries in three hospitals in Idlib governorate in 2021 and responding to a 200 percent increase in Caesarean sections.

    "description": "Mientras conmemoramos el segundo aniversario de la declaración de la pandemia de COVID-19 el 11 de marzo, nos acercamos a los trabajadores humanitarios que han experimentado los dramáticos giros y vueltas de esta enfermedad. Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) en ascociarse con The Nocturnists, se complacen a presentarles una noche especial de narración en vivo y reflexión de trabajadores de la salud en todas las Américas que comparten sus experiencias personales en respuesta a COVID-19.\n\nÚnase a nosotros para rendir homenaje a los momentos de dolor y alegría, aislamiento y conexión, ansiedad y esperanza, y todo en el medio. Cómo fue enfrentar las amenazas en constante cambio de una nueva enfermedad infecciosa? Cómo aprendimos a cuidarnos mejor unos a otros y a nos mismos? Cómo nos sentimos ahora?\n\nLo invitamos a compartir este evento con su familia, amigos y colegas, cualquiera que haya sido parte de su grupo de soporte durante este tiempo sin precedentes.\n\nLos Oradores:\n\nEl Dr. Michael Jaung es un médico de urgencias que ha trabajado con MSF desde 2019. Ha completado 7 asignaciones con MSF en 6 contextos diferentes, incluyendo Sierra Leona, Brasil, Líbano, Perú, Malawi y Palestina. Su asignación más reciente en Palestina fue como médico de la UCI en un proyecto de intervención en COVID.\n\nLa Dra. Mariana Gutiérrez ha trabajado como pediatra con MSF desde 2019 en lugares como Líbano, Irak, República Democrática del Congo y Afganistán. La Dra. Gutiérrez compartirá una historia de su tiempo de trabajo en una sala pediátrica en Irak al principio de la pandemia de COVID-19.\n\nTatiana Chiarella es enfermera de São Paulo, Brasil. Desde que se unió a MSF en 2014, ha completado numerosas asignaciones en varios roles. Antes del inicio del COVID-19, trabajó en Irak, Haití, Libia, Siria, Yemen, Malawi y Sudán del Sur. Luego respondió a la pandemia en su hogar en Brasil antes de su asignación más reciente en la Franja de Gaza.\n\nLa Moderadora:\n\nEl evento es presentado por la Dr. Emily Silverman, creadora de The Nocturnists, un aclamado programa en vivo y podcast de narración médica donde los trabajadores de la salud comparten historias personales de alegría, tristeza y autodescubrimiento.

    "description": "As we mark the two-year anniversary of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, we're reaching out to aid workers who have been through the dramatic twists and turns of this disease. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is excited to partner with The Nocturnists to bring you a special evening of live storytelling and reflection by healthcare workers from across the Americas sharing their personal experiences responding to COVID-19.\n\nJoin us in paying tribute to the moments of grief and joy, isolation and connection, anxiety and hope—and everything muddled in between. What was it like to face the morphing threat of a new infectious disease? How did we learn to take better care of each other, and ourselves? How are we feeling now?\n\nThe event is hosted by Dr. Emily Silverman, creator of The Nocturnists, an acclaimed medical storytelling live show and podcast where healthcare workers share personal stories of joy, sorrow, and self-discovery. In March of 2020, The Nocturnists launched Stories from a Pandemic, a documentary podcast series featuring audio diaries submitted by hundreds of frontline workers across North America.\n\nWe invite you to share this event with your family, friends, and colleagues—anyone who has been part of your support network during this unprecedented time. Ring the bell to be notified when we go live or visit https://bit.ly/3hJmvaT to learn more and RSVP.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "On the second anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières is releasing the “Silent Wounds” video series. We know that humanitarian aid workers experience moral dilemmas in their work; this is not new, nor is it specific to COVID-19. But the pandemic has brought to light what it means for aid workers to deliver medical assistance in sub-optimal conditions and to be presented with only poor choices.\n\nEarly on in the pandemic, our medical staff did not know how to prevent or treat this disease, which limited the care we could provide. Shortages of medical oxygen made it impossible to treat many severely ill people or provide appropriate end-of-life care so people could die with dignity. Staff had to deal with the unknown both at work and in their private lives. Their risk of contracting the disease was higher due to the lack of personal protective equipment.\n\nPersonally and professionally, having to make imperfect decisions, even knowing that those decisions led to the least harmful outcome, can generate feelings of inadequacy, meaninglessness, and frustration. Such feelings are symptoms of moral distress.\nTo shine a light on the direct and indirect impacts the pandemic has had on our staff and to offer a space for them to share their stories, MSF created “Silent Wounds,” a video project along with a research study of experiences that bring about moral distress.

When the pandemic hit in 2020, she decided to join MSF and support a COVID-19 ward in Caracas.\n\nVideo transcript:\nKoana Rojas:\nI do not think I was ever prepared to give so much bad news. It is overwhelming. Little by little, you get overwhelmed. First, it’s one loss, then another, then one more. You get home with all of this on your shoulders and it gets heavier and heavier. For seven years I had only seen pediatric patients. Now I am attending adults, which is completely outside of what I prepared for. \n\nIn the pediatric field, you do not give much bad news. I had this patient—a 40-year-old-pediatrician—who had been admitted for COVID-19. From the beginning he had a lot of difficulties breathing. The only thing that could have helped him was to be in intensive care. But we did not have the physical space. \n\nIt was impossible to transfer him to another hospital because they were all full. There was no other place where he would have received better care. Our last option was… palliative care. To put a 40-year-old patient on palliative care—it is not something I had ever seen before. \n\nThe expression “palliative care” is a very strong one. It means that there is nothing else that we can do. Knowing that there is an intensive care ward where they can put me to sleep, attach me to a machine that will help me breath, and not understanding why they are not moving me to this area, why they are not putting me on a ventilator—Why don’t they help me even if I am still suffering? \n\nNot being able to give him the care he needed, it was inevitable for me to see myself reflected in him. To look at him draw in his last breaths and not even being able to hug him, because often you have this impulse to hug [the patient], touch him. You want him to see your face too and to make yourself felt, make yourself present. To have this last contact with someone, it is not something we can guarantee. We saw how his heart rate progressively slowed down. He was not conscious anymore and he passed away. \n\nIt was really hard because… because it could have been me. I remember that his son, while crying and caught in desperation, kept repeating, “I know that you did all you could. Don’t worry doctor. I know you did all you could.” But it was hard for me to look him in the eye because deep inside I knew that there were things I could have done. There were other things we could have tried. We could have transferred him to intensive care for example. We could have put him on a ventilator. Medically speaking there were things we could have done. It was not like we did all that was humanly possible. \n\nBut there are things that go beyond us. The fact that we did not have available beds in the intensive care unit, it is something that does not depend on me. If I could turn back time, I would spend more time with him. Obviously, I know that there are other patients, but… I think I would have liked to speak more with him, maybe comfort him because he was very anxious. I knew that he was not going to make it. He was aware of it himself. \n\nThis is why I would have liked to share more with him, to try to understand him better. Maybe show him videos of his family. Try to accompany him in his last moment so that he wouldn’t have felt alone. \n\nRead the full transcript at https://bit.ly/3sQwfXa",

These are people who are critical, with comorbidities, above sixty, seventy, seventy-five [years old]. As a medical person, you already know that if you're picking one person from these three, the other two that you have not picked, you already know that by the time you go there it's either they will have died or they'll be sick, their condition will have deteriorated. Even if you go there, you already know that even if you take them to hospital, you are not going to make it, you realize that the patient needs to be evacuated. Now we start making phone calls to all these different facilities that you actually work with, and they all tell you they do not have space, they do not have oxygen, they cannot take that particular patient. You have to explain to the family, you have to explain to the husband, you have to explain to the kids that their relative is in a situation where she needs to be taken to a facility, but there is no space in any of the facilities.\n\nAnd as a result, you're just going to be sticking around just so that you are there, just so you are actually able to monitor and you'll keep on making those phone calls until a space avails itself somewhere. Then you have to take the patient, travel for eighty to one hundred kilometers to the nearest facility. I remember we did this for quite a number of times. Most of those patients did not actually survive.\n\nThe contact tracing team goes to the same homestead to find confirmed cases, new confirmed cases. They refer them to you. As a home care team, you have to go back to that particular homestead where you were there maybe three, four days ago with a critical patient and you already explained to the relatives that that patient needs a different level of care, but you are unable to provide it. And for them, they had the perception that you are unable to help them. So, we find that when we go back, now we are having issues of resistance. People are saying, \"You are coming to us. We are maybe asymptomatic or we have mild symptoms, but you're coming here and you are unable to help our grandmother, you are unable to help our grandfather. We don't really find you to be a very effective and useful team.\" I remember one of them was working with the armed forces. Actually, he told me that he thinks I'm coming at this time of the hour because I want to earn a lot of money, because he knows that we health care workers when we are actually working at night, we get a lot of money. At that point, there was no monetary benefit whatsoever that we were getting. It was just our normal remuneration. So, for me, it was actually quite painful.\n\nPeople were unable to understand that some of of these things were systematic. It was not the fault of us as a team. These were things that were beyond our control, but because we were the ones that people were seeing on the ground, we were the ones that people were actually venting out to with their anger, with their emotions and everything.\n\nFor those people we were unable to help, those people we were unable to save–even though it is painful, because there are still people that I actually look back, I do a personal review. I do personal introspection, I say, \"maybe that person, is there something that maybe I would've differently to save that person? Is there something maybe I would have done differently to save that person?\" But you find that if you look at all the different factors that were involved, you realize that at most it was not something that was within our power, it was something that was a systematic problem, systematic challenge that we had really very, very limited power to actually change or turn around.",

There were moments when some of them wanted to leave the profession. We had to work with those people for a very long time in order to restore their emotional balance and help them get back to work. Because we understood they were on “the front lines.” \n\nA woman I know could be an example: she was thinking of leaving the profession. At that moment she was experiencing a lot of hardships. The death of her patients, the loss of a loved one. A person dear to her also died of COVID-19. At that time, things needed for effective assistance were not available. Personal protective equipment [PPE] was not available. \n\n[Healthcare workers] had to wear the same PPE for a long time not changing it, and thereby endangering their lives. The state system, unfortunately, could not fully provide comfortable conditions for their work. These people worked 24 hours a day. They had special clothing. It was a suit in which it was quite difficult to work. They were wearing diapers because they couldn’t take a break. \n\nHaving visited a village that was in the red zone I could also become infected. [Instead,] I could simply drop out of the team. I could drop out, and eventually stop visiting those villages where people really needed help. I also heard from doctors that they had that very choice every day. \n\nAfter the shift, they often stayed at work so that they would not bring this virus home. They thought it would be better to stay there for a while. I think each of us has to make choices in our lives, especially during the COVID-19 period. I, personally, also had a period when I was wondering what was the best thing to do. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

And you can’t. You can’t provide it because you have only a few beds for 30 million Venezuelan people. How do you choose between 15 people with the same condition? \n\nI was attending patients in my intensive care ward when I received an emergency call: “Doctor, we need your help in the respiratory triage,” which is where COVID-19 patients arrive. I remember arriving and seeing the emergency doctor with an expression of despair. He was unable to manage the situation. When I asked what was happening, I saw a lot of people who needed oxygen. Not being able to provide the oxygen that they needed brings you to a breaking point. \n\nIt makes you think, “What if it were me on one of those stretchers and no one could help me?” It was… It is horrible. I felt I was suffocating at the sight of all those people who could not breathe. Obviously, your human side is touched when you see this disaster. You see people asking you for help but you can’t do anything about it. \n\nWhy is this happening to me? Why do I have to choose? Why were some people lucky enough to arrive a bit earlier and get help, and others weren’t? \n\nIn these moments—when you start asking yourself why—is when you collapse, if you have the human space. When I arrive home at night, all I can think about is, “I hope I made the right decisions.” It’s true that we [intensive care doctors] are used to death, but we are not used to seeing ten patients or more die in a single day.\n\nI had to start seeing a psychologist to be able to mitigate a bit the pain of telling ten families a day, “I am sorry. We did everything we could, scientifically and according to our knowledge, but there is nothing else I can do for your relative.”\n\nIntensive care doctors are not gods. We do not deserve the role of deciding who gets admitted and who doesn’t. Before, we were dealing with very sick patients who could or could not make it. But what is specific to this moment is that we have to say, “You can come in sir, and have the chance to survive. But you sir, no, unfortunately you are going to die.” \n\nIt is hard. We are not God. We are human. It is not right that one person decides for others. As a doctor, I do not regret having chosen who to admit to the intensive care unit. What I regret is not being able to give a good death to those who had to die. Because when we die, we have the right to do it with dignity. \n\nSeeing myself as a risk factor for my family allowed me to establish rules. I come from a family where we always comforted each other in difficult moments. The hardest part is the lack of physical contact. I haven’t hugged my daughter for one year. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

When you do know what is the right choice when you do know what you need to be doing, but you can't because it's out of your own control.\n\nWe saw the moral distress that COVID-19 caused in high-income and high-performance health systems, and some of our staff that is used to confront these situations in the field, they were confronting the same situations in their home societies, which is not what we are used to. In MSF, we have kind of a filter when you are going to low-resource settings, when you do know that there are some things you will not be able to do. When you are back in your home society or in high-income countries, you are not expecting that so much. That also opened the question on how our own staff in their countries of intervention feel.\n\nYou could see the parallelism when we responded to Ebola, with our nationally recruited staff having the same questions than with COVID-19. It's like, \"I'm responding to this. I'm going to be bringing it back home. Do I need to separate myself from my loved ones? I am being discriminated because I'm responding to this emergency.\" So, all these things that we have seen happen with COVID-19 in many countries are the things we are seeing in responding to epidemics. It happened with HIV-TB. It happened with Ebola. It's happening with any disease, with epidemic potential, high mortality, or high impact on the health system.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Such understanding is essential to developing the resources we need to support them. \nRead more here https://arcg.is/1GiaaX  \nSee the full video series here: https://bit.ly/3sRG7je\n\nOriginally from Mexico, Dr. Mariana Gutierrez was working in a pediatric ward in Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nVideo transcript:\nMariana Gutierrez:\nThere's always this idea that doctors should be somehow cold, or should be able to detach from their feelings, from their patients in order to give good attention.\n\nHe was a baby that was born in some other hospital. He had seizures and other signs that made us think he had meningitis. The treatment for neonatal meningitis is at least 28 days. That is the minimum of treatment that you can offer. On day 11 of treatment–so we were not even in half of the treatment–the mother started having some respiratory stress fever and cough. It was a big risk that she could indeed have COVID-19.\n\nAs we were not a COVID-19 center, we did not have the full PPE for treating patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 center would probably not be able to take care of the baby and in a not COVID-19 center, they would not allow the baby in because the mother had COVID-19. So that's what we discussed with the mother, and we said, \"the best option that we can come up with is that you bring another caretaker, your sister, your mother-in-law, your mother, whoever. We just need another caretaker to stay with your baby for a few days, until he completes the treatment.\" The mother and the father told us, “We have absolutely no one, but please let us stay in the hospital because we understand how important this is for the survival of our baby.\"\n\nWe were not able to keep a baby alone with no caretaker. That's just...you cannot do that. Mothers and babies should not be separated. Especially newborns. They should stay with their mothers. This mother was breastfeeding. So, this is definitely not an ideal choice for any patient, any sick patient. So, with no other choices, what we offered was, \"okay, bring the baby every eight hours so we can give him the medication and we can check on him.\" The father came every eight hours. He came at 2:00 PM, he came at 10:00 PM, he received all the medication. The next day, he came again at 6:00 AM, received the medication, went home, and around 10:00 AM we received a call from the emergency room saying that this baby that had been hospitalized with us arrived dead to the ER. The baby had had seizures at home, probably went into apnea–which means he didn't breathe, he stopped breathing–and that's exactly when the baby died. By the time the parents arrived to the ER, there was nothing to be done. It was definitely a very difficult situation to deal with, especially...I mean, especially knowing that this baby could have survived if he had stayed with us in the hospital and received the full treatment.\n\nIt happens often in the humanitarian setting that you are confronted with the question, \"do I save one patient, or do I save a bunch of patients?\" So, when confronted with that question, it's always okay, numbers...I mean, more patients. It's better to give good quality of care to more patients. So that's why the decision was, \"we cannot keep this mother and this baby because it represents a risk for the others.\"\n\nAlthough of course you understand the pros and cons of keeping this baby or discharging him, you cannot help but feel guilty about it and think, \"I should have done more. We should've looked for another possibility, another plan.\" It is also important to allow yourself to feel the sadness of the loss of a patient, to feel the anger. I don't fully agree with this idea of, \"you should be completely detached from, from your patients. You should not get emotionally involved.\" If you don't get emotionally involved, then you don't care enough, and if you don't care enough, then you're certainly not going to change things for the better.\n\nLearn more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org",

We're used to crises. We're used to shortages. We're used to injustice that the health system somewhat perpetrates against its patients, its communities and its workforce. Aside from the fact that this was a new disease and a new epidemic, other than that, the characteristics of crises unfortunately look like each other all over the world.\n\nThe Italian health care system bases its actions on beautiful principles about quality of care and the universal right to care. This proved particularly problematic in a crisis context. When there are not enough hospital beds and there is not enough oxygen, there are not enough ambulances, there are not enough doctors and nurses, the simple fact of saying that everyone deserves care equally doesn't really help the doctor or the nurse in charge to make a decision, and decisions have to be made.\n\nMedical staff were confronted with situations where each of them tried to use their own ethical principle–whether it was based on needs, or for instance, based on the possibility for that resource to be used more effectively, or whether it was somewhat of a sharing of resources equally among all patients–everyone had different principles that they were trying to apply, but of course there was not a coherence in those principles. That created a lot of tensions in between medical staff. So, two doctors making choices–both of them on sound medical reasons, but different ones–ended up giving contradictory information for instance, to patients or to their family members.\n\nOne aspect that was very frustrating for us and for all the doctors we worked with was the incapacity of the public health system and the ongoing political dynamics, to learn from what happened in the first wave of the epidemic. It would have been possible and necessary to adapt the system, to make it more resilient for the future waves. Unfortunately, what we have seen was a rigidity, and so just the same incapacity to respond repeated over and over again, not only in Italy, but in all the other countries around. I had an understanding and an expectation about the public health system in Italy. In these past 20 years, the region where COVID-19 had the highest level of transmission is one of the regions where public health has been somewhat dismantled more than elsewhere. And so it was very difficult to see how the privatization of care in a lot of different aspects of what a healthcare system should be, was having terrible consequences for patients and for the health system itself. Moral distress felt by workforce has been felt all over the world, by any doctor who had to make difficult decisions in a crisis.\n\nIt happens in basically all the settings where MSF works. The fact that we are talking about that now, just because it was more visible to European audiences, is a pity. It's an opportunity, and maybe it's time to talk about how difficult it is, not only in the COVID-19 epidemic, but how difficult it is every day when doctors do not have the necessary support from the health system they work in.\n\nLearn more at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org",

As an emergency medical organization, the humanitarian workers are exposed to the death of our patients, to the limitation of means and equipments that we can have, to the large scale of problems that we can face. This is part of our world. This is also part of what we choose to do. This doesn't mean that it is easy.\n\nMiriam Kasztura:\nWhen the first wave came, there was very little knowledge of the disease, of what COVID actually is, how it is transmitted. What kind of PPE do we need to protect ourselves and the healthcare workers? How can we treat it? There was a limited amount of knowledge. It was extremely difficult to move people across borders suddenly, or material. That confronted teams two situations where they've seen immense need to intervene because people had COVID-19 and were really sick and needed hospital care, sometimes intensive care, and we were not able to provide.\n\nDonatella Pairo:\nWe had to adapt to this unknown. We had to adapt to the lack of control on our lives and on the choices that we were used to to make. We realized that it is not easy. There is still a lot of stigma, mental health. And I think that COVID helped to talk about the problems that people can face in their normal life.\n\nMiriam Kasztura: \nIf these situations, these experiences of moral distress are accumulated, one after one after one, they can, in that sense, lead to very strong frustration and burnout, and that is then a condition that would need psychological support. The accumulation of model distress in individuals and in teams has an impact on the quality of care we are able to provide, and that is a very clear link. So, the more we work in supporting individuals and people to deal positively with model distress, the better our quality of care will be as well.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "To mark this year's International Women’s Day, we asked women who are leaders and changemakers in Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) at different projects around the world to share their stories. Fikile Lauretta Ngwenya, a driver with MSF’s project in Eswatini, uses the resistance she gets from people who doubt a woman’s ability to drive as motivation. “I feel like they are picking me up, they are empowering me by undermining me,” she said. She also enjoys being a part of MSF and hearing from the community that the organization is helping them.

    "description": "As the world prepares to enter a third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us have questions about what our future will look like. What does it mean to learn to live with COVID? How much does that answer depend on where we live, and what kind of access we have to vaccines, tests, and treatments?  \n \nTeams from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have had to adapt constantly to confront the evolving challenges posed by COVID-19. We remain ready to respond to potential new waves of the disease, especially as vaccination rates remain dangerously low in many of the countries where we work. We also continue to push for global equitable access to COVID vaccines and other lifesaving medical tools.  \n\nJoin us for a conversation with MSF experts to find out what we’ve learned from our COVID response over the past two years, and why we’re calling for pandemic protection for everyone everywhere.  \n\nRing the bell to be notified when we go live or visit https://bit.ly/3JsTITH to learn more and RSVP.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

As part of a community-based approach, MSF teams work with the City of Cape Town to set up vaccination pop-up sites in areas where they've collected enough registrations. \n\nSince COVID-19 vaccination rates have been low among youth and males, MSF's health promotion team spearheaded a community mural project as a means of raising awareness about the vaccines. MSF invited three artists from Khayelitsha to develop pro-vaccination designs and paint them on community walls in the lead-up to vaccination drives. “I think it made a lot of impact on the community,” said Khayelitsha-based artist Noeleen Ndamane, “because as we were painting, a lot of people were asking as well where they can get vaccinated.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3HykAAe\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) first responded to the lead poisoning crisis in northern Nigeria in 2010, when we were alerted to hundreds of children dying mysteriously in communities across Zamfara State. Acute lead poisoning can cause severe brain damage and death in children. The root cause of the lead poisoning was unsafe gold mining. In this part of Nigeria, the gold ore underground is mixed with lead. When the ore is dug up, crushed, and processed to extract gold, lead particles escape into the soil.\n\nFor the past twelve years, MSF has led a three-part approach to breaking this cycle of environmental pollution in Zamfara: medical treatment, remediation (removing lead from the environment), and introducing safer mining practices. Without remediation—removing the pollutants—children are continually re-exposed to lead toxins, rendering medical treatment useless. In turn, without safer mining practices, clean soil is quickly re-contaminated. From 2010 to 2021, MSF treated more than 3,500 children for lead poisoning, and cleaned the soil in affected villages. We also launched a pilot project promoting safer mining practices. Today, children are no longer dying of lead poisoning in Zamfara. MSF recently handed over our prevention and treatment program to state authorities.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical and logistics teams have been responding in the town of Mananjary and surrounding areas. The storm left the hospital and health centers damaged or destroyed, so MSF set up temporary facilities to treat people with medical needs. In addition to the challenges to accessing health care, MSF is also concerned that the loss of rice fields could mean food insecurity, and that access to safe drinking water could be a major problem. And as the country struggles with these challenges, a new storm—tropical cyclone Emnati—is headed towards Madagascar’s coast.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "People in Katsina State, in northwestern Nigeria, are experiencing a major nutritional crisis along with an unprecedented wave of violence. Kidnappings for ransom, killings and assaults by armed men (commonly called bandits), have now become routine. This insecurity disrupts the lives of thousands, preventing farmers from growing crops and making it difficult for people to go to markets, schools, and hospitals. All this comes amidst a severe economic crisis, poor harvests, and a lack of water and arable land.\n \nThis documentary was shot by a group of Nigerian filmmakers from JB Multimedia Studios, led by Kachi Benson (Daughters of Chibok, 2019). \"Lucky To Be Alive\" tells the stories of mothers like Hadiza and Fatima who travel for miles along dangerous roads to get treatment for their malnourished children. It also sheds light on the many families struggling to feed themselves in a region where malnutrition is a problem at the best of times, and health workers and funding are woefully lacking.  \n \n“The number of cases of malnutrition that we are seeing is increasing rather than decreasing, even though the annual peak has passed,” said Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Dr. Alibaba Nurudeen. “With the patients we have currently in the ward, I can say that it is just a tip of an iceberg.” MSF’s teams are working closely with the Nigerian Ministry of Health to improve treatment provided to children with malnutrition in therapeutic feeding centers across Katsina State but more help is urgently needed.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Yoeuth was just five years old when the Khmer Rouge seized power in Cambodia in 1975. During the turmoil that followed, she was separated from her family and alone. She joined others fleeing through the woods. “We ran away from the shells and couldn’t sleep at night,” she said. She eventually reached the refugee camps in Thailand. In 1987, when Yoeuth had just turned 17, she started studying everything she could on anatomy, basic health care, and midwifery at the hospital that Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) had set up in the Khao Dang refugee camp.\n\nAround that time, Chamroeun Ros also fled Cambodia and ended up at the same camp. He was interested in becoming a health worker and was being trained to work as a pharmacist by MSF. “I worked in the same place as Yoeuth and was interested in her. I knew that she had been separated from her parents since the time of Pol Pot. I fell in love,” he said.\n\nHowever, Yoeuth didn’t notice Chamroeun and longed to return to Cambodia. In 1991, when the war between Vietnam and Cambodia ended, she returned alone. A few years later, Chamroeun returned and started looking for her by reaching out to friends. “I eventually met her and took her out to eat. We have been together ever since,” he said. \n\nTogether, they began working for MSF again in the Banteay Meanchey province to provide medical care for people living with HIV and AIDS. “We reached out especially to sex workers in the area and helped them make appointments for health check-ups at the clinic,” said Yoeuth. Chamroeun was again hired as a pharmacist and stock keeper. They worked with MSF until the early 2000s and have worked for other health care providers since then. They have now been married for 27 years and live with their three children in Cambodia.

    "description": "Amuchin Nango struggled with epilepsy for years while growing up in Monrovia, Liberia. There was little awareness of epilepsy in the country and no treatment was available. The stigma he experienced drove him to drop out of school while he and his family searched for a cure. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a project for epilepsy treatment in Monrovia in 2017. A year later, Amuchin was finally receiving the care he needed. He was able to graduate from high school and start a career. \"Now, I'm a classroom teacher,” he said. \"Through the help of MSF, I can stand before students or before people. I'm imparting knowledge now.”\n\nAbout 80 percent of people with epilepsy live in middle- and low-income countries and three-quarters of them do not receive the treatment they need. Epilepsy is the world’s most common chronic neurological disorder, yet in many places, it remains misunderstood. People living with the disease are often stigmatized and rejected by their communities. For many young people, this can mean forgoing education and participation in society. In Liberia, MSF is helping more than 1,200 patients access epilepsy treatment and overcome social stigma. As part of this effort, MSF staff are helping children return to school after social stigma caused them to drop out.

    "description": "Gynecologist Tori Husum was working at the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) maternity hospital in Khost, Afghanistan, when a pregnant woman came in with complications. Dr. Husum determined that the fetus was no longer alive and saw that the patient had some very distressing wounds. She performed a Cesarean section and treated the woman's internal and external injuries. She could carry out her professional duties, but she was profoundly affected by the experience. The following day, she went to visit the patient. “I was fighting tears. She was so strong,” said Dr. Husum, who usually works in her home country of Norway. “I’ve never experienced something like this.”\n\nMSF is providing sexual and reproductive health care to women in Khost during a major political and economic crisis in Afghanistan; the country’s health system is on the brink of collapse, and access to medical care is challenging. MSF's hospital in Khost can be a lifeline for pregnant women. “[My experience with this patient] tells me that we are needed,” said Dr. Husum, “and that having access to free health care, no matter where you are in the world or who you are,  should be a human right.” Learn more about MSF's Khost hospital at https://bit.ly/3Ljw79P\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

More than two years later, the two reconnected in Belgium, where Yonas has claimed asylum after finally escaping Libya and crossing to Europe. “[I’m] divided—happiness [for] being here, and sadness that [I] left friends behind […] they are still there suffering. Especially at this moment, it’s very hard to cross through the Mediterranean Sea.” In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of refugees, migrants, and asylum-seekers intercepted at sea by the Libyan coastguard, funded by the European Union (E.U.). People are taken to overcrowded detention centers that do not have enough drinking water, food, latrines, or ventilation. “When they bring you back to the detention center, you know the consequences there. A lot of people have died there. I think this is inhumanity for the E.U.”\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

They raise awareness on TV and the radio; during weddings, baptisms, and funerals; and by going door-to-door. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) partners with local organizations in Mali, like Cancer Fighters, to improve women’s access to screening, diagnosis, and treatments of cervical and breast cancer. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Marib governorate is an active front line in the ongoing war in Yemen. In this harsh desert setting, around 150 informal camps serve as temporary homes for displaced Yemenis, African migrants, and others affected by the violence; some 13,000 families arrived at these sites in 2021. People taking refuge here lack water, food, adequate shelter, and access to health care. \n\n“The tents are not suitable. They cannot protect us from the rain,” said Mojahed, an internally displaced person (IDP). \"They can’t protect us from the heat or the cold.” Eayad Selah, another IDP in Marib, said, \"as the number of displaced people increases, there are not enough toilets for everyone. Toilets are very necessary.\" \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing essential medical services through eight mobile clinics and a primary health care center. Staff have seen an increasing number of patients with illnesses related to poor living conditions such as acute diarrhea and fever and a recent uptick in malnutrition. MSF is concerned that if conditions are not improved quickly in the camps, there could be outbreaks of measles, cholera, or COVID-19.

    "description": "On the anniversary of the latest repeal of the Global Gag Rule, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Reproductive Health Specialist Maura Daly answers questions from our social media followers about abortion care. \n\n0:01 - How safe is abortion, really, in the contexts where you work?\n\n0:14 - How accessible is safe abortion care?\n\n0:28 - Why is it so important to you that MSF promotes safe abortion care?\n\nThe Global Gag Rule, implemented by every Republican president since 1984 and repealed by every Democratic president, is an extremely harmful policy that former President Trump made even more harmful. It already prohibited foreign organizations receiving US family planning funds from providing or even speaking about abortion to patients—even if they used non-US funds to support that part of their work.\n\nTrump expanded the policy to apply to foreign organizations receiving any US global health assistance at all, not just family planning funds, including for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB programs. This affected a large number of organizations in more than 70 countries. \n\nAlthough the Global Gag Rule has been re-implemented time and again, it has not been shown to produce any positive health impacts. There is also no data to show it lowers the number of abortions. In fact, the data we do have shows that the GGR:\n- Decreases access to safe abortion care, contraception, and information\n- Interferes in patient-health care provider relationships\n- Reduces outreach by community health workers\n\nEven though the Biden administration rescinded the GGR on January 28, 2021, history tells us it might not be gone for good. Let's mark this important day and remember—safe abortion care is health care.

The political crisis adds to an already fragile context characterized by an ongoing conflict. For more than a decade, the central Sahel region—principally Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso—has seen conflict between armed groups, government, and international forces. The fighting has created a serious humanitarian crisis with large-scale displacement and many people struggle to find food, water, shelter, and medical care.\n \nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are providing food, clean water, maternity and child care, and malaria treatment but more help is needed. “People are living in very precarious situations,” said MSF coordinator Youssouf Dembélé. “[People are] often in camps exposed to bad weather, which increases waterborne diseases like malaria, diarrhea, and respiratory infections.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3G7GYzF\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Following assessments carried out by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Dr. Raul Salvador describes what his team saw on Dinagat Island. “Their hospital has been damaged, and they don’t have staff because all of them have been affected,\" said Salvador. \"[People] are worried and they’re fearful of their health because their houses were blown off, and they don't have anywhere to stay.” \n\nMSF emergency teams will start providing medical and humanitarian assistance to communities on the remote islands of Dinagat, Siargao, and other outlying areas, which have an estimated combined population of over 240,000 people. In cooperation with the ongoing response from the Philippine authorities, we are focused on supporting health facilities, running mobile clinics in isolated areas, facilitating referrals of critical patients, distributing relief items, and donating essential medical materials.

    "description": "Since 2017, Ituri province in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been convulsed by conflict. In November 2021, rising tensions resulted in four attacks of unprecedented violence in the area. These latest clashes destroyed parts of Drodro town, and forced some 40,000 people into Rhoe displacement camp within two months. \n\nThis new escalation of violence has pushed vulnerable people already displaced by the conflict to the brink. “The communities fighting in the area have been neglected for too long and we will not solve their problems with bandages and medicines. The Congolese state and its international partners need to take responsibility for reversing the dynamics of this vicious cycle that leads to more and more deaths, injuries, and displacement,\" said Davide Occhipinti, MSF’s project coordinator in Drodro. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is scaling up its response in the area to meet the massive and growing humanitarian needs. In the past few weeks, our teams carried out an average of more than 800 consultations per week, assisted 35 deliveries, and treated several dozen patients requiring mental health care. In addition, our health promotion teams have conducted health awareness sessions to detect cases of acute malnutrition, diseases with epidemic potential, and provide information on support services for potential victims of sexual violence.

Spread across several makeshift camp sites, they face food insecurity, loss of income, malnutrition, and a lack of safe drinking water. An estimated 835,000 people have been affected, according to the United Nations. The UN reports that this is the worst flooding emergency in decades.  \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are running mobile clinics that visit camps in and around the Mayom region, Bentiu, and Rubkona, responding to malaria, malnutrition, and acute watery diarrhea. “Many people have been displaced, and they are squeezed to one area,” said mobile clinic team leader Sworo Scopas Duku. “There are many diarrhea cases and we think that is because they have a lack of clean water to drink.” To try and reduce the spread of disease, MSF teams built a sewage treatment plant in six days.

    "description": "At the Comprehensive Care Center (CAI) in Mexico City, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides specialized care to migrants who have suffered extreme violence or torture. Most patients have survived multiple violent events, often spurred by their appearance, origin, sexual orientation, or gender. In addition to providing primary medical care, mental health care, social services, and physical rehabilitation, MSF also connects patients with occupational or educational opportunities so they can begin to move forward with their lives. \n\nPatients at the CAI come from different parts of the world but many have fled their homes in Central America to escape extreme violence and brutality. “There is a bullet on this side of my stomach and another bullet here [in my bicep],” said Lisandro, a patient at the CAI who fled to Mexico from Honduras where armed men were trying to kill him. \"The doctors diagnosed me with anxiety and prescribed other pills to keep me stable.”\n\nThe criminalization of migration has made the search for safety even more dangerous in Central and North America. Migrants must use less-traveled routes where they can be subjected to violence, torture, and rape. Migration policies in the US and Mexico can leave asylum seekers in limbo or send them back to the violent situations they were trying to escape. \n\nSince 2018, the CAI has provided much-needed comprehensive care to 276 people and their families. \"My dream is to save my life as much as possible because I do not know how far my enemies will go in Honduras,” Lisandro said. \"I do not know when it will end. I am looking for work.

    "title": "Why Is the US Sending Asylum Seekers Back to Mexico?",
    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have treated thousands of people along the migration route through Central America and Mexico. The medical evidence points to high levels of violence and ill treatment suffered by migrants and refugees in their home countries, along the migration route, and in the custody of US and Mexican authorities.\n\nWhen the Trump administration implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)—or “Remain in Mexico” policy—in 2019, we saw people who were fleeing violence in Central America and applying for asylum being turned away at the US border. Left to fend for themselves in some of the most dangerous areas of Mexico while awaiting their court dates, the MPP offered no protection at all. When President Biden took office in 2021, he made good on his promise to rescind the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which, according to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, imposed “substantial and unjustifiable human costs on the individuals who were exposed to harm while waiting in Mexico.” In August, a federal court ordered the administration to reinstate the policy.\n\nThe Biden administration could have complied with the court order while reducing the scope of this inhumane policy. Instead,  the administration made it even more harmful by expanding it to apply to people from more countries—including those fleeing the current violence in Haiti. At the same time, the administration has kept in place Title 42—a policy that uses the pandemic as an excuse to turn away asylum seekers.\n\nHere, artist Carrie Hawks paints a picture of life under threat from all sides, showing how people fleeing Central America are at risk of gang violence, detention, and deportation. Many of them also suffer from physical injuries and psychological trauma. MSF staff has seen first-hand how “Remain in Mexico” traps people in danger and how Title 42 effectively blocks them from gaining asylum. It’s time for the Biden administration to do everything in its power to end these harmful policies and build a humane asylum system—now. #EndMPP #EndTitle42\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "New data from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) shows that direct and indirect effects of the nearly seven-year-long war in Yemen are fueling an alarming rise in malnutrition cases among children younger than five years of age. \n\n“The issue of malnutrition here is more complex than a simple scarcity of food. Our concern is that, in fact, people may not be able to afford to buy food that otherwise exists,” said Nicholas Papachrysostomou, MSF head of mission in Yemen.\n\nMany Yemenis are either unpaid for their work or have lost their livelihoods due to the conflict. On top of this, the depreciation of the Yemeni currency coupled with high prices of food, fuel, and other necessities has eroded people’s buying power. Abs and surrounding areas currently host approximately 55,650 households displaced due to the conflict—most of which rely on humanitarian aid for survival. As a result, many families struggle to afford the right quantity and nutritional quality of food for their children.\n\nMSF currently has a team of community health care workers in and around Abs working in the camps for internally displaced people that conduct screenings, identify malnourished children, and refer them to centers for treatment.

    "title": "\"What is an unsafe abortion?\" Answers to Your Questions about Abortion",
    "description": "Dr. Manisha Kumar, a family medicine doctor and the coordinator of the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Task Force for Safe Abortion Care, answered questions from our Instagram followers about MSF’s provision of safe abortion. \"In MSF, we've learned that in order to provide a safe abortion with pills, you need three things: accurate information, quality pills, and mutual respect and trust,” Dr. Kumar says.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:11 - What is a safe/unsafe abortion?\n\n0:51 - Does MSF provide mental health resources for women seeking an abortion?\n\n1:02 - How can we effectively advocate for safe and accessible reproductive care?\n\n1:23 - I 100% support abortions, but how do we stop it from becoming a form of contraception?\n\n1:46 - How do you deal with the religious who are against it?\n\n1:59 - How has COVID-19 impacted abortions?\n\n2:27 - Why should we (medics) support abortion? I am a med student from Chile.\n\nFull transcript:\n\nIn MSF, we've learned that in order to provide a safe abortion with pills, you need three things: accurate information, quality pills, and mutual respect and trust. \n\nAn unsafe abortion is one that's provided by someone who hasn't been adequately trained or in an environment that doesn't meet minimal medical standards. So, examples of this that we see in MSF are people taking traditional herbs or potions, even drinking battery acid or chlorine, putting things like sticks or broken glass or pen cartridges in their body to try to induce an abortion. And the other side, a safe abortion is one that's provided or supported by someone who's been adequately trained and by a medically approved method. [0:45] So, two examples of this are an abortion with pills or abortion procedures. \n\nPeople feel a whole bunch of different emotions about their abortion and that's okay and totally normal. The most commonly reported emotion looking back is actually relief. \n\nWhen it comes to family and friends, how are you showing up for the people in your life who may have had abortions or may need abortions in the future? How are you talking about this with them? And on the larger level, right? Depending on what's going on in your political landscape, how are you showing up for and supporting organizations who are trying to make reproductive healthcare more accessible? [1:21]\n \nI think the question behind this question is actually, what if people have more than one abortion? And my answer is that's okay. It's okay if people have more than one abortion. If we 100% support abortion, that means that we 100% trust people to make the best decision for themselves with their body and with their lives. [1:44]\n \nMSF is not a religious organization. We're not trying to change anybody's religious beliefs. MSF provides impartial non-biased healthcare to the most vulnerable and safe abortion care is healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic actually pushed some really long overdue innovations in the abortion field. So people started to really think outside the box and think about how can we provide this care without requiring people to come to a health care facility? So that's when people started doing more abortion consultations over the phone or via telehealth models and doing things like mailing abortion pills to patients and all those things can help us go a long way to increasing access to this essential health care. [2:26]\n \nIt's a public health issue. When people don't have access to safe abortion care, then they turn to unsafe methods. And at MSF we've seen the consequences of those unsafe methods firsthand. People can get really sick and they die. And this happens every day around the world. So in MSF, that's why we're so committed to reducing this death and suffering from unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion by providing access to contraception and safe abortion care. Thanks so much for your questions and for wanting to learn more about how safe abortion care is essential health care.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was founded 50 years ago on the conviction that everyone has the right to medical care. Today, in more than 70 countries around the world, MSF continues to offer assistance to people based solely on need—irrespective of race, religion, gender, or political affiliation. During crises such as armed conflicts, natural disasters, and epidemics, our teams of doctors, nurses, logisticians, mental health officers, and other frontline workers are often among the first on the scene. We also respond to the needs of people who have been excluded from health care due to social stigma and other factors. Our work remains as relevant today as it was 50 years ago.

Although the devastating effects of the conflict are still visible and strongly felt in the city and region, there is also hope and a strong urge to look to the future. In this video, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in Mosul share what brings them to work every day. “We do the work for MSF because we love what we are doing and we believe in what we are doing—saving lives of people from my city,” said one Iraqi staff member. MSF continues to provide free medical services to those in need. From January and October 2021, we have provided over 1,000 surgical interventions and over 5,000 inpatient and outpatient consultations.

    "description": "Nigeria has been fighting the country’s worst cholera outbreak in a decade, with more than 90,000 people infected so far this year. The challenges were immense in cities such as Kano and Bauchi, where many people live in overcrowded conditions, with poor or nonexistent sewage systems and no access to clean drinking water. In such conditions, water sources can easily become contaminated with sewage, especially in the rainy season, causing waterborne diseases like cholera to spread quickly. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) adopted a community-based approach, taking health care, hygiene measures, and public health information directly to the affected communities. “Fortunately, thanks to our community-based activities, especially our health promotion activities, community awareness [has risen] across the state,” said MSF project medical referent Daniel Bamba. MSF health promotion teams worked with Ministry of Health staff to conduct door-to-door contact tracing to find people with symptoms and help them get medical care quickly, while outreach teams chlorinated wells and disinfected patients’ homes. Working with community leaders, MSF teams also identified neighborhoods with high concentrations of cases to set up oral rehydration points, where patients with milder symptoms could receive treatment. Read more at https://bit.ly/3rFDtgz  \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "When the conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014, many people fled from the villages and towns near the fighting. “Mostly the elderly remain. Those who were able to leave, have left,” said Valentyna, a volunteer working with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Many of these seniors are living with chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. Yet they often find it difficult to access health care. Incidents of shelling and shooting happen almost daily in some areas. Around many villages, landmines remain a serious threat. Partly as a result of these risks, transportation systems remain disrupted, and many services are simply not available. “People can’t afford to get to a hospital. If I didn’t have this ancient car, I wouldn’t be able to either!” said MSF volunteer, Tetiana.\n\nSince 2020, MSF has been supporting volunteers like Tetiana to provide free transportation to clinics or hospitals, fill and deliver prescription medications, and share accurate health information. These volunteers provide a crucial lifeline for vulnerable people in communities close to the conflict.

    "description": "The Dadaab refugee camps in Kenya, near the border with Somalia, were established 30 years ago to shelter Somalis fleeing civil war. Today, 232,901 refugees live there, many of whom were born there and have never known another home. The violence continues in Somalia, and access to basic services including health care is extremely limited. Most refugees in Dadaab say they cannot fathom returning to Somalia, yet Kenya plans to close the camps in June 2022. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been working in the camps since their inception and recently released a report documenting the refugees’ unheard concerns. The report concludes that a return to Somalia is not a solution; refugees need sustainable solutions that provide safety and dignity, as well as access to health care and other basic services.

    "description": "More than two million displaced people living in northwestern Syria are bracing themselves for an impending winter that will exacerbate their already unbearable living conditions. Every winter, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sees the season's alarming health impacts. “My son is constantly suffering from stomach aches and colds,” said Ahmad Mahmoud Merhi. “My other child’s temperature reached 40 degrees [104 degrees Fahrenheit]. A rash spread in his mouth, hands, and legs due to the fever. But we couldn’t afford to take him to the doctor.” \n\nMSF teams are currently undertaking a range of activities to mitigate the impact of winter weather on displaced people in the region, including distributing kits of clothes and blankets to approximately 3,000 families and installing tent flooring, roof isolation, and thermal insulation for 3,900 families, to prevent flooding and help protect them from freezing temperatures. While humanitarian needs are increasing in Syria, funding to address them is drastically decreasing. More funding and additional support from other organizations are urgently needed for winterization activities, before winter arrives.

    "description": "South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal Province has the highest prevalence of both HIV and tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Since 2011, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been working in the remote areas of Eshowe and Mbongolwane to help reduce HIV and TB deaths and prevent new infections. We partner with the local government and community leaders to pilot and refine innovative community-driven models of care. \n\nThe hilly topography in this region makes access to health services a challenge for many, but MSF has been able to take HIV and TB services into communities, initially going door-to-door and more recently by establishing rural health care hubs known as Luyanda sites in spaces where people congregate. They offer HIV counseling and testing, TB screening, and screening for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. \n\nIn 2019, the project became the first in South Africa to achieve the ambitious UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for HIV. Since 2020, the team has been focused on following a similar strategy to bend the curves of the TB epidemic. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, fighting between armed groups has terrorized communities, forcing some 19,000 people to flee their homes in recent months and causing pain and suffering for those caught in the crossfire. The economic and political crisis in Haiti has been worsening in recent years. The assassination of Haiti's president in July 2021 has exacerbated the instability, and a recent fuel shortage caused by tensions over the city’s port has made access to health care even more difficult. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in Port-au-Prince treat people for gunshot wounds, knife wounds, and assaults every day. Manuelle Lina arrived at MSF's Tabarre hospital after being struck by two vehicles fleeing a shootout between armed groups. She was pregnant with twins. “On Wednesday evening the medical staff performed a sonogram: my little boy and girl were moving normally,” Lina said. \"By Thursday morning 10 a.m., I had lost both of them.\" MSF psychologist Elkins Voltaire explained the impact that this violence is having on the mental health of patients: “Not only do these people have pain in their bodies, but they have it in their minds too.” Read more at https://bit.ly/30RS2Th\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

As we respond to many of the world’s most urgent crises—conflicts, disasters, disease, displacement—we are witnessing the consequences and magnified impacts that climate change can have on extremely vulnerable people. \n\nIn Niger, changing rain patterns are impacting food production and the spread of infectious diseases such as malaria. “The rains are becoming very scarce and are unevenly distributed,” said MSF health promotion supervisor Salissou Abdel Aziz. “Before, we used to grow for one year … now it is only for six months.” The deadly combination of malaria and malnutrition takes a heavy toll on children under five. MSF is adapting its response by developing preventive approaches closer to communities such as treating water points and training community workers to detect and treat malaria and malnutrition early.

Called seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), the strategy involves giving antimalarial medication to children once a month for five months during the rainy season—July to November—when malaria cases peak. MSF teams are currently working to reach 25,000 children in 19 villages. Those who live in remote areas where transportation is hard to access are particularly vulnerable. Awien Atuk Makak, a local resident, tried to get her sick daughter to a clinic for treatment last year. “Doctors tried to save her but it was too late when we got there,” she said.

Living in a context of war means continuous exposure to stress over a long period of time. “Trauma and fear—as a result of the country's situation and war—are ingrained in the minds of adults and children,” said Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) psychologist Afrah Al-Dumaini. MSF provides mental health care for children and adults at the Dhi As-Sufal hospital in Ibb governorate, where we also support emergency medical services. Our teams see people with a wide range of symptoms, from anxiety and insomnia to psychosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. Some 45 percent of our patients in the mental health clinic have severe symptoms—nearly eight times higher than expected, according to the World Health Organization. Due to a lack of mental health services in the area, all severe cases are referred to MSF.

    "description": "Watch the Self-Managed Abortion Video Series here: https://bit.ly/3H3PdhR\n\nSelf-managed abortion with pills means obtaining and taking abortion pills outside of a medical setting. It most commonly refers to taking abortion medications at home with the help of telephone hotlines or online platforms. Self-managed abortion increases access to safe abortion care for vulnerable people and those who live far away from health care facilities. It also upholds people’s autonomy and supports them to make decisions about, and take the lead in, their own care. \n\nA safe abortion with pills requires only three things: accurate information, quality medications, and mutual respect and trust. Because of this, medication abortion has expanded access to safe abortion care for millions of women and girls around the world—especially in conflict and crisis settings.\n\nA self-managed abortion can be just as safe and effective as the more traditional, facility-based approach. Therefore, in recent years, self-management of abortion with pills has gained increased acceptance by the formal health sector as safe and appropriate. Abortion pills successfully ends pregnancy more than 95 percent of the time and the risk of severe, life-threatening complication is less than 1 percent. It is inexpensive, easy to use, and so reliable that most people can take the pills at home without any problem. \n\nWatch the Self-Managed Abortion Video Series here: https://bit.ly/3H3PdhR\n\nRead A Revolution in Safe Abortion Care here: https://bit.ly/3bYXXYh\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sees the impacts of climate change on the people we treat every day. When we respond to conflicts, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and other crises, we often witness the outsized consequences that climate change and environmental degradation have on some of the most vulnerable people. In this video, two MSF staff talk about the “double injustice” of the climate crisis. \"Those who have contributed the least to causing climate change are the most vulnerable to its effects,” said Stina, from Norway. \"Those who are historically responsible for climate change have more resources to adapt,” said John Biel Liep, from Old Fangak, South Sudan, where massive flooding is forcing people to flee their homes, causing a rise in malaria, malnutrition, and snakebites, and ruining crops. Norway emits 82 times as much carbon dioxide as South Sudan, yet the less wealthy country feels the impacts of climate change much more severely. “You who live in the countries that emit the most,” said Liep, \"you have an extra responsibility.” Learn more about the health and humanitarian impacts of climate change at https://bit.ly/309eff2\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "While the general populations of wealthy countries, including the US and Norway, have had access to COVID-19 vaccines for months, health workers and vulnerable people in developing countries are still waiting to receive their doses and they have no way to produce their own versions of the vaccines. In this video, we hear directly from frontline Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) health workers in Yemen, Honduras, Iraq, and Uganda who put their lives at risk every day to treat people sick with the virus. \"Here in Yemen, we are going through the third wave of COVID-19,” said Dr. Ayman Alsabry. \"But I and my medical colleagues are not yet vaccinated and we treat patients at very high risk.” MSF is calling on wealthy countries that have excess doses of the vaccines to share them with countries that are being shut out. We are also calling on manufacturers of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines—Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—to share the technology with the World Health Organization mRNA Hub so that global production of vaccines can be scaled up. There is no time to waste. \"We have lost more than 20,000 people since the pandemic started—our family, friends, and loved ones,” said Iraqi doctor Mustafa Abdalkareem. \"Iraq has been able to vaccinate only 5% of the population so far.” Take action now and help end the pandemic for everyone.

In this video, we discuss some of the most common questions we hear from women who have recently completed the abortion process. \n\nQuestion 1: How do I know if the pills worked? 0:15\n\nIf you had bleeding and cramping like a heavy menstrual period after taking the pills, and you no longer feel pregnant, then the abortion pills have most likely worked. Most women are able to know if the abortion was successful because their pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and breast tenderness, start to go away. \n\nIf you want more reassurance that you are no longer pregnant, you can also take a urine pregnancy test 3-4 weeks after taking the pills. Taking a pregnancy test earlier than 3 weeks is not advised, as the test can stay positive during this time even after a successful abortion. \n\nQuestion 2: Do I need to see a doctor after having an abortion with pills? 0:52\n\nRoutine follow-up is not necessary. So long as you no longer feel pregnant, you feel in good health, and your bleeding isn’t heavy, everything is most likely fine. \n\nOf course, you can talk to a health care provider or a support person at any time if you have any questions or concerns. You can also reach out to trusted online resources such as Safe2choose.org, womenhelp.org, and womenonweb.org for support and information. \n\nQuestion 3: When will I stop bleeding? 1:22\n\nMost bleeding stops within a couple days. Some women continue to have light bleeding or spotting off and on for 1 month. This is normal, and you do not need to worry or do anything to make the bleeding stop. The bleeding should get lighter over time until it gradually disappears on its own. \n\nQuestion 4: Can I get pregnant again after having an abortion with pills? 1:42\n\nYes, you can get pregnant again very soon after having an abortion with pills. For some women, fertility returns as quickly as 8 days after the abortion. If you’d like to know more about your contraceptive options, talk to your healthcare provider. \n\nQuestion 5: When will my regular period return? 2:01\n\nMost women will have their next menstrual period 4-6 weeks after the abortion, but for some women, it can take longer.  \n\nQuestion 6: How soon after an abortion can I have sex? 2:12\n\nSo long as there are no signs of complication, you can have sex after an abortion whenever you’d like. Just listen to your body and decide what feels right for you. \n\nIf you have additional questions, or if you’d like to learn more about abortion with pills, visit www.howtouseabortionpill.org or safeabortioncare.msf.org.  \n\nRemember: abortion is common; abortion is safe; abortion is healthcare- and we’re here to support you. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

But it’s also important that you understand what’s not normal during the abortion process. Both the risk of complication and the need for emergency care are very rare. Only 2 or 3 women for every 100 women who have an abortion with pills will experience a complication, and only 1 in 2000 will need emergency medical care. However, to make the process as safe as possible, it’s important to recognize the signs of a complication and also to have a plan in place for how to access emergency care if needed. \n\nYou should go to a doctor or hospital immediately if you have any of the following signs: \n\n1) Bleeding that is so heavy that it soaks up 2 regular menstrual pads every hour for 2 hours in a row. \n2) Severe abdominal pain that does not go away with pain medication or continues for 2-3 days after taking the pills. \n3) A fever or other side effects that last more than 24 hours. \n4) Abnormal vaginal discharge that is yellow, green, or smells bad. \n\nIf you have very little bleeding or no bleeding at all 3 days after taking the pills, or if you continue to have moderate to heavy bleeding or cramping that doesn’t decrease 7 days after taking the pills, this may be a sign that the pills didn’t fully work. This is not an emergency, but you should seek medical care or talk to a support person within a day or so. You can also get information and support from trusted online resources like www.safe2choose.org, www.womenhelp.org or www.womenonweb.org. \n\nIf you do seek medical care, you do not need to say that you used medicines if you do not want to. You can say you are having a miscarriage and you should receive the appropriate care. The symptoms and treatment of a complication of spontaneous miscarriage and abortion with pills are exactly the same. When misoprostol is taken under the tongue or via the mouth, it cannot be detected in the blood or any other body parts. Sometimes women are advised to put misoprostol tablets in their vagina, which takes longer to dissolve, so pieces of the pills may be visible during an examination by a health care worker. \n\nIn our next video, we answer common questions after having an abortion with pills. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Being well-informed will help to reduce stress and anxiety, and can lead to a safer experience. In this video, we’ll talk about what you may experience during an abortion with pills. \n\nAfter taking mifepristone, you probably won’t feel anything, so you can go about your normal activities. Some women have light bleeding after taking mifepristone, and that’s okay too. \nMisoprostol is the medication that will start the main bleeding and cramping involved in the abortion process. The day you take the misoprostol is the day you will need more privacy, to rest, and to plan to be at home. \n\nYou can expect the bleeding and cramping to start within 1-3 hours of taking misoprostol. Both bleeding and cramping are signs that the abortion pills are working to push out the pregnancy. \nThe bleeding is usually similar to or heavier than a menstrual period, and can include blood clots, which is normal. Some women may have a little more or a little less bleeding, and that’s normal too. The heaviest bleeding and pain typically occurs 4-6 hours after taking misoprostol when the pregnancy is being pushed out. \n\nRemember that you can take painkillers like ibuprofen right after taking misoprostol to help reduce pain. Putting a hot water bottle or heating pad on your lower belly can also help with pain. \n\nAside from cramping and bleeding, you may also experience nausea, dizziness, chills, diarrhoea, headache, or a temporary rise in temperature after taking misoprostol. All of these are normal side effects of misoprostol and will mostly likely go away on their own. You can reduce these side effects by resting, drinking plenty of water, and eating light foods. \n\nMost women do not see or notice anything when the pregnancy comes out. Some women may see the gestational sac, which is white and sometimes looks like a small piece of sponge. If the pregnancy is around 9 weeks or later, women may also see a small embryo. Women can choose to not look at the menstrual pads, wrap them up, and throw them away as they would during their monthly bleeding. \n\nWithin 24 hours, the bleeding and cramping should begin to decrease, and most women start to feel better. \n\nIn order to be prepared for the abortion, it can be useful to have some things on hand. This includes large maxi pads (not tampons), painkillers, a hot water bottle or heating pad, access to a toilet, light snacks, a friend or support person, and a comfortable bed or mattress. It may also be helpful to think about what time of day you will be able to have some privacy and be free from other responsibilities like work, school, or child care. \n\nIn our next video, we answer the question, “What are signs of complication during an abortion with pills?” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Pregnancies beyond 13 weeks require a different approach.  \n\nIf mifepristone is not available in your setting, then you can use misoprostol alone to end a pregnancy. \n\nFor an abortion before 13 weeks with only misoprostol, you will need to take twelve 200mcg pills of misoprostol. You’ll also want to have a painkiller on hand, like ibuprofen, to help reduce pain. Acetaminophen and paracetamol do not work for pain during an abortion so they are not recommended. \n\nHere’s how misoprostol alone is used to end a pregnancy: \n\nStep 1: Place 4 misoprostol pills (200 mcg each) under your tongue and hold them there for 30 minutes as they dissolve. You should not speak or eat for these 30 minutes, so it is good to be someplace quiet where you will not be disturbed. After 30 minutes, drink some water and swallow everything that is left of the pills. This is also a good time to take a painkiller like ibuprofen, as the cramping will start soon. \nStep 2: Wait 3 hours. \nStep 3: Place another 4 misoprostol pills (200mcg) under your tongue and hold them there for 30 minutes until they dissolve. \nStep 4: Wait another 3 hours. \nStep 5: Place another 4 misoprostol pills (200mcg) under your tongue and hold them there for 30 minutes until they dissolve. You should begin bleeding and cramping while taking the pills. Make sure to take all 12 pills even if you start to bleed before you’ve taken all of them. \n\nIn our next video, we answer the question, “What will I experience during an abortion with pills?” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Acetaminophen and paracetamol do not work for pain during an abortion so they are not recommended. \n\nHere’s how mifepristone and misoprostol are taken together to end a pregnancy before 13 weeks:\n \nStep 1: Swallow one 200mg pill of mifepristone with water. \nStep 2: Wait 24-48 hours. \nStep 3: Place 4 misoprostol pills (200 mcg each) under your tongue and hold them there for 30 minutes as they dissolve. You should not speak or eat for these 30 minutes, so it is good to be someplace quiet where you will not be disturbed. After 30 minutes, drink some water and swallow everything that is left of the pills. This is also a good time to take a painkiller like ibuprofen, as the cramping will start soon. \nYou should begin bleeding and cramping within 3 hours of using the 4 misoprostol pills. \nStep 4: 24 hours after taking the 4 misoprostol pills, if you didn’t start to bleed, or if you are unsure that the abortion worked, place 4 more pills of misoprostol under your tongue. Hold them there for 30 minutes as they dissolve. After 30 minutes, drink some water and swallow everything that is left of the pills. \n\nIf mifepristone is available in your setting, then you can skip the next video and go directly to “What will I experience during an abortion with pills?” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Millions of women all over the world safely and successfully use pills to end pregnancies every year. Many people prefer an abortion with pills because it can be done privately within the comfort of their home, is non-invasive, can feel more natural, and is similar to a spontaneous miscarriage. \n\nThere are two types of medications used for abortion: mifepristone and misoprostol. An abortion with pills works better if both of these medications are taken together. However, if mifepristone is not available, misoprostol alone will also work to end a pregnancy and is still safe. We will review both options in this video series. \n\nMifepristone and misoprostol cause the opening of the uterus to relax and the walls of the uterus to contract. This results in bleeding and cramping, which pushes the pregnancy out of the body, just like a miscarriage. Most women experience bleeding and cramping that’s similar to a heavy menstrual period and lasts several hours. \n\nSome women go to see a medical provider, like a doctor or midwife, to get information about an abortion with pills and obtain the necessary medications. Then they go home to take the pills and manage the process themselves. Some women may decide to get information and pills in other ways. So long as the proper instructions are followed and quality medications are used, an abortion with pills will work to end a pregnancy almost every time. \n\nSevere complications are extremely rare. An abortion with pills is so safe that most women successfully manage the process at home without any problems. \n\nAlmost everyone can have an abortion with pills – including young women, older women, women with and without children, women who have had an abortion before, women who are pregnant with twins, women who have had Caesarean deliveries, and women who are breastfeeding. Regardless of your age or weight, the dose stays the same and the pills will work equally well. \n\nThere are very few contraindications and they are very rare. If you know you have an ectopic pregnancy, which is a rare condition where the pregnancy is outside the uterus, abortion pills will not work to end the pregnancy, so you need to see a health care worker. If you have been told you have a medical condition called porphyria or problems with your adrenal glands, which are both very rare conditions, you should not do an abortion with pills. If you have an IUD in place, it should be removed before using abortion pills. \n\nMany countries have laws surrounding the availability of abortion and the use of abortion pills. To learn more about the abortion laws in your setting, see HowToUseAbortionPill.Org.  \n\nIn our 2 next videos, we will explain how to take both mifepristone and misoprostol or misoprostol alone to have an abortion before 13 weeks. Abortions 13 weeks and beyond require a different approach. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières helps people worldwide where the need is greatest, delivering emergency medical aid to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from health care.

Estimating the length of a pregnancy is simple, though often misunderstood. If you have a calendar on hand, you can use it for reference. \n\nFirst, think back to the last time you got your menstrual period. What day did the bleeding start? If you’re using a calendar, circle that date. Then count the number of weeks and days from that day until today’s date. This is how many weeks and days your pregnancy is. \n\nLet’s use an example. Meet Sofia. Sofia’s last menstrual period began on September 13th, and today’s date is October 28th. How far along is her pregnancy? \n\nTo find out, Sofia marks September 13th on her calendar and begins to count the number of weeks until October 28th. She counts from September 13th to September 20th as one week, from September 20th to September 27th as two weeks, from September 27th to October 4th as three weeks, and so on. She continues like this until she reaches October 25th, which she marks as 6 weeks. Since there are no more full weeks between October 25th and 28th, Sofia counts by days. October 26th counts as one day, October 27th counts as two days, and October 28th counts as three days. This means that Sofia is 6 weeks and three days pregnant. \n\nIf you are not sure when your last menstrual period was, you can also go to a health care facility to get an ultrasound to estimate how many weeks pregnant you are. But an ultrasound is not mandatory before having an abortion with pills. \n\nKeep in mind that it is not always necessary to know the exact number of weeks or days pregnant that you are. As long as you are less than 13 weeks pregnant, you can safely and effectively have an abortion with pills as described in this video course.  \n\nIn our next video, we answer the question, “How does an abortion with pills work?” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Worldwide, more than 40% of pregnancies around the world are unplanned. If you didn't want to get pregnant, but think that you might be, you're not alone. In this video, we’ll talk about how to confirm a pregnancy.   \n\nFirst, it’s important to know that pregnancy happens after sex when semen is ejaculated from the penis into the vagina. Contraception helps to prevent pregnancy during sex, but there is a small chance you can still get pregnant.  \n\nThe earliest and most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. If you’ve had sex and notice that your monthly bleeding is late, you might be pregnant. Other common signs of pregnancy include nausea, headache, feeling tired, and enlarged, tender breasts. If you have any of these symptoms, in addition to a missed menstrual period, there is a good chance that you’re pregnant.   \n\nIf you think you might be pregnant, you can confirm this by taking a urine pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests are commonly sold at pharmacies and convenience stores, or you can go to a health care facility to get one. It is not a requirement to take a pregnancy test before having an abortion with pills.  \n\nIf you have signs and symptoms of pregnancy, or if a pregnancy test is positive, but you don’t want to be pregnant, you may decide to end the pregnancy. Abortions can be provided either with pills or via a surgical procedure. Follow along with this video series as we provide factual, evidence-based information and answer frequently asked questions about an abortion with pills before 13 weeks.   \n\nIn our next video, we answer the question, “How far along is my pregnancy?” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Here, Isabelle Mouniaman, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) operations director, describes MSF's response in the towns of Jérémie and Les Cayes and other hard-hit areas. \n\n\"The earthquake survivors treated by MSF teams needed very specific surgical care,\" said Mouniaman. \"There were many open fractures, which needed emergency surgery. This meant very rapid orthopedic care to stabilize the fractures.\"  \n\nFrom the beginning, MSF relied on surgical teams already present in Haiti before reinforcing them with staff specialized in post-operative care and other needs. While most surgical patients were treated in the south, some were transferred to MSF facilities in Port-au-Prince for emergency care and orthopedic surgery. \n\nThe deteriorating security situation in Port-au-Prince has added to the challenges, making it more difficult to reach earthquake-affected areas by road. Alternatives have included traveling by plane or helicopter and transporting supplies by sea.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "On August 25, 2017, the Rohingya people in Myanmar were the target of a violent military campaign. This was not the first campaign against the Rohingya, but it was by far the largest. More than 700,000 people fled to Bangladesh, joining more than 200,000 people who had taken refuge in camps during previous attacks. Some 154,000 refugees also sought safety in Malaysia. Four years after fleeing their homes, life in the camps—which were meant to provide temporary refuge—has become oppressive. The Rohingya people, who are officially stateless, have been subjected to discrimination, stigmatized as criminals or as disease carriers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and denied basic rights and adequate access to services, including health care. Many of the refugees say that they want to go back to Myanmar, which they consider their home, but not without a guarantee of safety from the government. “If the government there could guarantee a safe return to our homeland, we would definitely go back,” said Tuyoba, a Rohingya refugee and traditional birth attendant. “But if they cannot, how can we do it?” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff providing medical and mental health care to the refugees say that the lack of any foreseeable solution to their situation is taking a serious toll on their mental health. \n\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The greatest number of deaths and injuries from Haiti’s August 14 earthquake occurred in the country’s southernmost region, in Sud department. Hospitals and clinics were already scarce in remote areas of Sud, and the earthquake damaged or destroyed many of those facilities, as well as roadways, making it even more difficult for earthquake survivors to reach care quickly. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) organized mobile clinics to bring health care to displaced people and hard-to-reach communities. “Very quickly we explored the most affected areas, which were the mountainous areas,” says emergency medical coordinator Bram Keijzer. “There are many wounded, and people cannot access drinking water and health care.” MSF is transferring people with severe injuries to functioning hospitals and continues to perform surgeries and provide post-op care in the general hospital in Les Cayes.

    "description": "Heavy rains have caused widespread flooding in South Sudan this year. Many of the hardest hit communities are in Jonglei state, where rivers and wetlands overflowed as seasonal rains arrived earlier than usual. In the villages of Haat and Pakur, in western Ayod County, floods forced approximately 6,000 people to flee their homes since May. Everything in the affected communities was destroyed. “Here, I lost hope completely. We do not see anything good,” says Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) patient Nyadak Kulang. “Like yesterday, if it were not for the MSF boat that came to our village and brought me here, maybe I wouldn’t be alive today.” \n\nPeople are now sheltering on crowded river islands in huts they made of sticks and sometimes plastic sheeting. There are no latrines and there is no clean drinking water. MSF is running mobile clinics, providing vaccinations, and distributing basic items like plastic sheeting and blankets. However, MSF staff warn that the health of the displaced population is likely to deteriorate further without adequate assistance, as the flooding continues.

    "description": "In 2021, the number of people risking their lives to cross the Darién Gap, a treacherous, roadless, 60-mile stretch of jungle connecting Colombia with Panama, has spiked. Not only is the crossing physically grueling and risky, but people also experience being attacked, robbed, and sexually assaulted on the route. Lis, a Venezuelan migrant who recently travelled through the Darién Gap, shares her story of surviving sexual violence. “They attacked us three times,” she said. “The first two times nothing happened, but the third time something did happen. This was when they abused… everything.” \n\nBetween May and August, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treated 105 women who had been sexually assaulted. MSF is reiterating its demand that the governments of Colombia and Panama establish safe alternative routes between the two countries and deploy the necessary protection mechanisms in their territories to prevent more needless death and suffering.

    "description": "One year ago, Europe’s largest camp for displaced people—Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos—was destroyed by several fires that erupted across September 8 and 9, 2020. This tragic event, which left some 12,000 people stranded with no safe place to stay, starkly illustrated the complete failure of the European Union’s (EU) “hotspot” approach to migration. Following the fires, the EU and Greek leaders promised “a fresh new start” on migration, but have instead continued to deny basic rights and dignity for asylum seekers and migrants searching for safety in Europe.\n\nIn this video we hear from Mariam*, who is living on Lesbos with her family. “The living conditions are really difficult here,” says Mariam. “We don’t have access to water and can’t go to the toilet easily. We don’t have a comfortable life here.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) continues to call on EU leaders to completely change their approach to migration instead of doubling down on their existing containment and deterrence policies.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

MSF sent approximately 100 tons of medical and relief supplies to Haiti from MSF’s supply warehouse in Brussels last weekend. In this video, MSF freight operator Hussein Choker shows us a behind-the-scenes look at the process. “We have to prepare the flights, we have to prepare all the freights and all the material to bring it up to Liege, and then to deliver it in time to Haiti,” says Hussein. “So actually, our challenge is the timing.” \n\nThe cargo, which has landed in Haiti, includes emergency medical tents, water and sanitation supplies, and medical materials for the care of up to 30,000 patients.

    "description": "On August 24, the US Supreme Court denied the Biden administration’s request to temporarily suspend a federal judge’s ruling requiring reinstatement of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)—a Trump-era policy that forces asylum seekers hoping to find protection in the US to instead remain in Mexico to await their hearings. We first produced this video in 2019 to highlight the impact of MPP, which sent 70,000 asylum seekers who arrived at US ports of entry at the southern border back to Mexico between February 2019 and January 2021—when it was suspended by the Biden administration. Far from protecting migrants, the policy sends vulnerable men, women, and children to dangerous places in the country. When they arrive there, migrants become easy prey for the gangs that control much of these areas—they become victims of kidnapping, extortion, and more. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing medical and mental health care to migrants along Mexico's northern border and in other areas across Mexico. “What we see,”  says Sergio Martin, MSF's head of mission in Mexico, \"is that the consequence of this policy is that people, vulnerable people, that are fleeing already violence, are put in more danger and are pushed to take more risks.\" Read more at https://bit.ly/3mv4WyS\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Nearly 200 people were killed, more than 6,000 were injured, and tens of thousands lost their homes. The disaster came at a difficult time, as Lebanon was already reeling from an economic crisis that caused widespread poverty and rising inflation, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health facilities were already struggling to meet the needs of people sick with COVID-19 when they were flooded with people injured in the blast. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in Lebanon jumped into action, treating injured patients and people with chronic diseases who had difficulty accessing medical care at overwhelmed hospitals. Our teams donated medical supplies to the Lebanese Red Cross and went door-to-door to assess people’s needs. One year later, many of MSF's Lebanese staff still carry psychological wounds from the disaster. “It feels as if the explosion happened a few minutes ago,” said Ali, an MSF nurse. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Refugees and asylum seekers are trapped in camps in miserable living conditions on the Greek islands, and, despite promises of change, the European Union (EU) is instead doubling down on its inhumane containment policies.\n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) general director Stephen Cornish recently visited the new Multi-Purpose Reception and Identification Center that's being constructed for refugees on the Greek island of Samos. This new prison-like camp is intentionally more isolated than existing facilities, with increased security, surveillance, and segregation from the rest of society that will limit access to essential services and remove any agency or semblance of a “normal life.”\n \n“This is the new approach to migration in Europe, where we are seeking to criminalize, to humiliate, and to punish the refugees and asylum seekers rather than to extend their rights,” said Cornish. “It's time for citizens to see what's happening with their taxpayer money and to instead of investing in this kind of criminalization, invest in a caring, dignified approach to asylum seekers and refugees arriving in Europe.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3gsrmMv\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Tracy, a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) patient, shared the touching story of giving birth to her son Archie prematurely at the Mrima Health Center in Likoni, Kenya. Although he was born weighing only 2.8 pounds, she said, “I thank God now here he is, one year and almost 2 months [old].” Tracy is one of thousands of mothers who gave birth at the health center over the last five years. Before 2016, there were no emergency obstetric or neonatal care facilities in Likoni. Expectant mothers from the area had to cross a river to reach to Mombasa, where they could give birth in the city’s main hospital. But the ferry crossing would often cause life threatening delays for the women who needed emergency obstetric care. After six years of improving access to safe delivery in Likoni, MSF recently handed over its activities to the county health authorities. Today, Mrima Health Center is a first choice for deliveries, receiving expectant mothers from all over Mombasa county.

    "title": "10 Years of Independence in South Sudan: Stories from MSF's South Sudanese Staff",
    "description": "July 9, 2021, marked a decade since South Sudan gained its independence. In this short documentary, South Sudanese Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff members recount their personal experiences of the exuberance they felt at that moment—and the violence that followed. Over the last decade, the people of South Sudan have suffered through a civil war, intercommunal conflict, and insurgent fighting. MSF's South Sudanese staff have seen and felt this suffering first-hand while also responding to its consequences: the injuries and deaths from attacks on civilians and ethnically motivated violence, sexual violence, widespread displacement, and much more.\n\nSouth Sudan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for humanitarian workers. Since it gained independence, 176 aid workers have been killed and 334 injured. Workers of South Sudanese origin make up 94 percent of those deaths, and MSF has tragically lost 24 South Sudanese staff due to violence in the last ten years, five of whom were on duty at the time. Despite the urgent need for medical services in the country, little effort has been made to protect staff, patients, or humanitarian projects.\n\nPeace accords in 2018 brought a ceasefire between the main warring parties in South Sudan, but fighting continues in some areas and the country remains in the grips of a prolonged humanitarian crisis. A new MSF report, \"South Sudan at 10: An MSF record of the consequences of violence,\" provides an account of our experiences since July 9, 2011.

    "title": "Surviving Sexual Violence in Democratic Republic of Congo: Victims Twice Over",
    "description": "In this short documentary, survivors of sexual violence in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) share their stories about the twin impacts of rape and assault. These survivors suffer from physical and psychological wounds, as well as the social and economic impacts of being cast out of their homes and communities. Many women who have been attacked find themselves rejected by their loved ones instead of being supported after a traumatizing experience. The effects of social and familial exclusion combined with the loss of subsistence can lead some survivors into a downward spiral. \"I didn’t keep it a secret from my husband because I hadn’t committed adultery,” said one woman. \"In the end, he threw me out of the house and took the children. I was homeless. I didn’t know what to do.” \nSexual violence is a major emergency throughout DRC, in areas affected by armed clashes and in relatively stable areas. MSF both provides and advocates for victims to receive free, high-quality, emergency medical care within 72 hours to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Survivors need treatment for both physical and psychological trauma. We are also calling for greater national and international support for survivors to receive essential legal and socio-economic assistance.

    "description": "The southern region of Madagascar, a country off the southeastern coast of Africa, is facing a severe nutrition crisis, with some 74,000 children reported to be acutely malnourished. With the area’s health system overwhelmed, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been running mobile clinics to 17 different locations, and, in partnership with local authorities, teams have set up an inpatient center for children with acute malnutrition in Ambovombe hospital. More than 4,300 children have been treated since late March. The area is facing its worst drought in 30 years. Deforestation, sandstorms, and other environmental issues have resulted in failed crops and no source of income for many people. MSF is also providing food aid, but more is urgently needed. The COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the situation, making it harder to transport personnel and supplies. “We suspect the crisis is going to last and that it might get worse during the year,” said MSF Head of Mission Ricardo Fernandez. “We’ll be staying a bit longer than we thought.\" Read more at https://bit.ly/2T0enKd\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "As Brazil faces a second winter of the pandemic, the COVID-19 situation in the country remains deeply concerning, with national and international experts warning of a devastating third wave. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams across the country are finding new ways to help vulnerable communities in the most disadvantaged areas of Brazil. In Fortaleza MSF staff are working in the communities of Prefeito José Walter and Grande Bom Jardim where people struggle to get the health care they need. “There are lots of communities like ours out there. People from other neighborhoods come to the mobile clinics here because it is a wonderful service,” said Katia, a resident of Prefeito José Walter neighborhood. “Since this pandemic started, getting health care has gotten even harder.” \n\nMSF’s two mobile clinics provide health care close to people’s homes and aim to increase the number of high-quality services for the community. Each day teams conduct rapid antigen testing for COVID-19, provide at-home follow-up for COVID-19 patients with comorbidities, offer mental health services, support the COVID-19 vaccination registration program, and run health promotion activities.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in the area are witnessing an alarming rise in the incidence of sexual violence and illnesses related to a lack of food, clean water, and vaccinations.\n\nIn and around Anka, where we manage a 150-bed pediatric ward in the town’s hospital and run outpatient malnutrition clinics, MSF is seeing an overwhelming number of malnourished children. The children’s weak immune systems have made them more susceptible to malaria, measles, and other diseases. “We’re having overflows in all of the wards,” said Dr. Godwin Emudanohwo, an MSF doctor at Anka General Hospital. “This is not the peak season.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have been responding to the needs of refugees throughout our 50-year history, but we are now facing an unprecedented global crisis. According to the United Nations refugee agency, there are now 79.5 million forcibly displaced people around the world—more than at any time in modern history. Millions more go uncounted and unprotected.   \n\nThe global refugee crisis is being made worse by government policies that only add to the suffering. In recent years, MSF teams have witnessed the terrible human costs of US and European policies to turn away vulnerable people looking for protection. We have repeatedly undertaken lifesaving search and rescue operations on the Mediterranean Sea, as governments in the region abandoned their responsibilities and left people to drown. We are providing aid to families in refugee camps that were never meant to become permanent homes—from Kenya’s Dadaab camp to the Kutupalong settlement in Bangladesh.   \n\nMSF teams are constantly adapting our approach to provide medical and mental health services to people on the move. We also work with refugee communities to ensure they have a say over their future, and help amplify their stories and their demands.   \n\nJoin our conversation on Thursday, June 17, as we look ahead to World Refugee Day and the future of the global response to the growing humanitarian emergency. Our panel of experts will include Sergio Martín, head of mission for MSF in Mexico, and Aurélie Ponthieu, coordinator of MSF’s forced migration team based in Brussels.

Since the beginning of April, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been running a COVID-19 treatment center at Al Kuwait hospital in Sana’a. The center is one of very few places in Yemen where COVID-19 care is available for free, and its 64-bed ward and 15-bed intensive care unit have been full since it opened.\n \nWith little information about COVID-19 made available by the authorities in northern Yemen, people are left to decide for themselves how seriously to take the disease and what to do if they or one of their loved ones get sick. “My message to the public in Yemen is that COVID-19 exists, and they must take the precaution measures seriously,” says Mohammed Al Ghabri, MSF medical referent for the treatment center. “They should come early to the hospital, as soon as they show symptoms, before they get much worse. An early diagnosis of the disease helps us treat it.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3vx5J2Y\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

People who have survived violence and hardship are stuck in appalling conditions with a lack of information on their legal status and are subjected to harsh border and asylum procedures. \n\nMSF released a report on June 9, 2021 on the devastating impact of EU migration policies.

More than 350,000 people are currently displaced there—around a third of the region's total population.

We want help, we are very thirsty,” says Guènèba, a woman who was forced from her home by the fighting and is now living in a camp for displaced people. “Since we got here, this problem has gotten even worse.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is responding by bringing water to people in need and providing sanitation services, hygiene supplies, and basic health services, but more humanitarian assistance is urgently needed.

It's a very difficult and complicated process.” Starting in April 2021, with MSF's support, PRS has been bringing COVID-19 vaccines to communities that might have fallen through the cracks of the health system's vaccine rollout, reaching people who are homeless, elderly, or living with disabilities.

In the space of just 11 days, many Gazans saw their homes and their livelihoods destroyed and suffered long-lasting physical and psychological injuries. Many people were unable to access medical care as stocks of medications and medical supplies ran low due to the closure of the Erez entry point from Israel to Gaza.\n \n“The biggest challenge I face is knowing that I have patients who need to follow up with me,” says Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) physiotherapy activity manager Abdulhameed Karadaya. “They call me for things that I cannot offer them due to the context.” These experiences come on top of lingering physical and mental trauma from previous rounds of violence, as well as the ongoing Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.

    "description": "Gaza has been devastated by airstrikes launched by the Israeli military in response to rocket attacks fired by Palestinian armed groups based in the coastal enclave. The surge in fighting lasted for 11 days, ending with a ceasefire on May 21. A Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic for providing trauma and burn care in Gaza was hit by airstrikes on May 16. Two doctors were among the 42 people killed in the airstrikes near the clinic. No one was injured at the MSF clinic itself, however the bombing destroyed a sterilization room, damaged a waiting area, and forced the facility to shut down temporarily. MSF was able to reopen the clinic for outpatient treatment a few days later. During the aerial bombardment, teams worked 24-hour shifts supporting medical staff at Al-Awda hospital, north of Gaza City, and donated medical supplies to other facilities throughout the Strip. The acute dangers made it extremely difficult for medical teams to move around, and for people to access treatment. Following the ceasefire, MSF is responding to the mounting humanitarian needs in Gaza, with more than 1,400 people injured and tens of thousands of people displaced.

    "description": "Bonifácia de Oliveira celebrated her 109th birthday in the COVID-19 ward of Tefé Regional Hospital in Brazil's Amazonas state. The centenarian’s strong spirit and sense of humor made a deep impact on the team as they worked to respond to a devastating second wave of COVID-19 sweeping the region earlier this year. “The work of being a doctor, being a nurse, and being human in this whole process has been something that we focus on a lot,” said Dr. Carolina Kennedy, a physician with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “We already know the patients by name . . . we follow them with the family.” Tefé was among the remote towns in the Amazon region affected by the collapse of the health system in the state capital, Manaus, in January. At the height of the emergency, even critically ill patients could not be referred to better-equipped hospitals in Manaus for treatment. The MSF team in Tefé helped staff at the regional hospital establish protocols that improved the quality of patient care, giving people like Bonifácia a better chance of survival. “I’m so happy!” Dr. Kennedy said when her patient was discharged. “She overcame something impossible...and survived one of the biggest struggles of her life.” Read more about MSF's work in Brazil at https://bit.ly/3vkveoS\n\nFULL TRANSCRIPT\nTEXT: February 2021, Tefé Regional Hospital, Amazonas, Brazil\n\nCaroline Kennedy, MSF doctor: The work of being a doctor, being a nurse, and being human in this whole process has been something that we focus on a lot. We already know the patients by name, they are patients that we follow up with the family...\n\nJúlia Queiroz, MSF doctor: A patient who really left a mark on me was Bonifácia. She is a 109-year-old patient who is not from Tefé, but arrived in Tefé when she was 14 with her sister.\n\nHer sister fell in love with the only teacher in town and ran away with him, since it was a secret relationship and she couldn't stay in the city. Bonifácia didn’t go to school and soon after started to work in agriculture. She learned how to read and write at the age of 100. She is a patient with a beautiful story.\n\nAnd she had her birthday here with us, now during COVID. It was really cool because she is very lucid. She said “Oh, since I'm not well I can't eat cake. But my dear, I have already eaten 108 cakes.”\n\nShe is always joking. It’s really something.\n\nTaiane Alencar, hospital psychologist: She remains strong and is a very dear patient because she is very emotionally stable.\n\nTaiane Alencar: How old were you when you got this tattoo?\n\nBonifácia de Oliveira: A few years ago...\n\nTaiane Alencar: Were you young?\n\nBonifácia de Oliveira: I was only a girl... an irresponsible one.\n\nTaiane Alencar: Irresponsible, huh? Stay strong and everything will be fine. You are our sweetheart. We want this moment to happen, okay?\n\nCaroline Kennedy: So, the patient's hope helps a lot.\n\nThe more hopeful and the stronger the patient is, the easier it is for us to work with, manage, and heal that patient.\n\nTEXT: After a few days, Bonifácia was discharged and went home with her family.\n\nCarolina Kennedy: Dona Bonifácia went home. I’m so happy! 109-years-old, she overcame something impossible, went home, and lived through one of the biggest struggles of her life. She went home happy, laughing. It was such a happy moment,\n\nTEXT: During the second wave of COVID-19 in Brazil’s Amazonas state, between November 2020 and March 2021, MSF supported Tefé Regional Hospital and helped provide better patient care and more comfort to those fighting the disease.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Join Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) for this critical discussion as we reflect on the last decade of war in Syria. Our teams have been responding to the humanitarian crisis in Syria from the start—from donating medical supplies, to setting up hospitals and clinics, to providing remote support to medical facilities and networks of doctors in areas that MSF could not access directly—often against daunting odds and great risk. But the situation is bleak, with no end in sight to the conflict.\n\nArwa Damon, award-winning senior international correspondent at CNN, will moderate this discussion. Panelists include Dr. Chenery Lim, medical coordinator for MSF in northwest Syria;  Will Turner, head of emergency operations for MSF in northeast Syria; and Dr. Aula Abbara, consultant and honorary clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and general internal medicine at Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust in London. On May 20 at 1:00 PM EDT, this expert panel will answer your questions about MSF’s work with displaced Syrians in their home country and its neighbors.\n\nVisit https://bit.ly/3fk0CNG to learn more and watch on livestream to watch from the start of the event: https://livestream.com/doctorswithoutborders/decadeofwarinsyria\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "A Pastor in East New York, Brooklyn, Shares His COVID-19 Vaccination Story",
    "description": "The majority black and Hispanic communities in the East New York and Brownsville neighborhoods of New York City were among those hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and people here have also struggled to get access to lifesaving vaccines. These trends are emblematic of broader racial and economic disparities in access to health care in the United States. The legacy of systemic racism has also affected people's perceptions about the vaccines. In this video, Rev. David K. Brawley, lead pastor of the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in East New York, shares his journey to getting vaccinated against COVID-19. “I think I shared a lot of the concerns that many have had relative to the vaccination,\" Brawley said on the day he received his first shot of the vaccine. \"I'm not certain about the vaccine, how it would affect our people, the history that our people have had in this nation relative to vaccinations. I shared some of those same concerns, but I'm glad I did this today.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) worked with BMS Family Health & Wellness Centers in Brownsville from February-April 2021 to expand access to COVID-19 vaccinations. BMS continues to provide free vaccinations in several locations in Brownsville and East New York.

    "description": "We asked health care staff and community members at BMS Family Health & Wellness Centers in Brooklyn, New York, what they look forward to after getting vaccinated against COVID-19. “I miss a social life, and that's what I look forward to the most,” said Michelle Lindsay, dental practice manager at BMS. “Summer's coming up, we’ll all get the vaccine. [Our family needs] to get together and have fun,” said BMS nurse Oliver Rosario. “Hug each other, and love each other.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) worked with BMS from February-April 2021 to expand access to COVID-19 vaccinations in Brownsville and East New York, two neighborhoods that were particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

    "description": "As COVID-19 continues to spread and vaccines remain unavailable in most countries, it’s critical that health systems have an adequate supply of oxygen to help treat severely ill people. “Oxygen is the single most important medicine for severe and critical COVID-19 patients, yet oxygen supply is often insufficient,\" says Dr. Marc Biot, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “Unstable oxygen supplies kill.” Oxygen production infrastructure has been neglected in low- and middle-income countries for decades, leading to more deaths from pneumonia, obstetric and neonatal conditions, and a host of other illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the urgent need for oxygen into sharp focus. “This past week’s catastrophe in India has again highlighted just how critical oxygen is for COVID-19 patients,” says Dr. Biot. “Many other countries have already faced such disasters and many more may soon confront this same, deadly reality.” Learn more at https://bit.ly/3tH125U\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

After days of confrontations, Israeli forces entered an area in the Old City where Palestinians were gathered and deployed rubber bullets, stun grenades, and tear gas. Many children were among those badly injured. “We’ve seen a 12-year-old with a femur injury, we’ve seen a 14-year-old with an eye injury,” said Dr. Natalie Thurtle, MSF medical coordinator. MSF is supporting the work of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) with teams of doctors and nurses in Jerusalem.

COVID-19 has overwhelmed the city's health care system and its frontline workers. A 2,000-bed COVID treatment center where MSF is providing support has not been able to accommodate the high number of people who need care. Health staff are exhausted but continue to work in very difficult conditions. Harigovind urges people everywhere to see what's happening in India as a warning. \"Please follow social distancing and please wear a mask,\" he says.

    "description": "Brooklyn’s Brownsville and East New York neighborhoods have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19 in New York City. Now these neighborhoods, and other areas with high numbers of low-income and predominantly Black or Hispanic communities, are also seeing comparatively lower vaccination rates—an outcome that is emblematic of broader racial and economic disparities in access to health care in the United States. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) partnered with the Brownsville Family Health and Wellness Center (BMS) to help expand access to COVID-19 vaccinations in Brownsville and East New York from February until April, 2021. While BMS had access to COVID-19 vaccines from government agencies, it requested administrative and logistical support from MSF to ensure as many people as possible could be vaccinated. After initially expanding vaccination activities in its existing health facilities, BMS has now opened a vaccination hub at St. Paul Community Baptist Church in East New York with the capacity to vaccinate at least 1,000 people per week. While MSF has finished its support for this effort, ongoing efforts are needed to help people in underserved communities access COVID-19 vaccinations. According to MSF's project coordinator, Dr. Kerry Dierberg, “these vaccinations are really going to only work if we can get them to the people most in need.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3t385FH\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "Call to Close Kenya's Dadaab Camp Threatens Refugees",
    "description": "On March 23, the Kenyan government called for the closure of Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps, which together host nearly half a million refugees. Dadaab is one of the biggest and oldest refugee camps in the world. Most of the people living in the Dadaab camp complex arrived from Somalia, or their parents or grandparents came from that country, which remains insecure. To force refugees to leave the camps, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and without any meaningful alternatives to guarantee their safety is inhumane and dangerous. “Somalia today is still very much affected by violence, by conflict, by drought, by floods, which makes survival quite tough,” says Adrian Guadarrama, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) program manager for Kenya. Even before the call for this closure, MSF was concerned about the mental health of refugees in Dadaab. In 2020, there were 20 attempted suicides and three deaths by suicide. “It’s very difficult for any human being to keep running at this level of uncertainty and with others card-playing your future,” says Guadarrama, “with your having very little to do or very little to say.” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "Even During COVID-19, Routine Immunizations Must Not Be Neglected",
    "description": "Immunizations save up to 3 million lives every year by protecting people, especially children, from vaccine-preventable diseases. Data from the World Health Organization show that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination campaigns in many countries have been canceled or postponed while health resources are redirected to fighting the coronavirus. This is alarming news—not only does it mean that more children are immediately vulnerable to killer diseases like measles and polio, but it also creates opportunities for diseases that are under control in some areas to take hold once again. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is doing all we can to continue immunizations in our projects around the world while also protecting patients and staff against COVID-19. For example, in Vathy refugee camp on the Greek island of Samos, MSF vaccinated children under five against a range of childhood diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, and hepatitis B, all while observing infection prevention and control measures. “Our vaccination campaign was very challenging in COVID time, but we managed to vaccinate almost everyone inside the camp,” says MSF health promoter supervisor Ben Taleb Zied (Kira).

    "description": "Malaria is a major health problem in Burundi, where it is the leading cause of death in young children. The same is true in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Of the estimated 400,000 malaria-related deaths each year worldwide, more than 90 percent are recorded in Africa.\n \nBecause there is no vaccine for the mosquito-borne disease, prevention is the best way to fight infection. One way to keep mosquitos from spreading malaria is indoor residual spraying, or IRS, in which homes are treated with long-lasting insecticide. Effective for months at a time, it drastically reduces the number of cases of malaria when combined with the use of mosquito nets. \"Last year, spraying was a key factor in the 80 percent drop in malaria cases here,\" says Dr. Hippolyte Mboma, malaria project manager for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Burundi’s Kinyinya district.\n \n“I worked as a nurse in the intensive care unit. I’ve seen too many people die from malaria,” says Jeanine Arakaza, who supervises an MSF spraying team in Burundi. “There are so many cases. I thought to myself, I have to switch to [working on] prevention.” In this video, we follow the work of Jeanine and her team as they travel by bicycle to different communities, helping thousands of people protect themselves against malaria.

    "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic is killing Brazilians by the thousands every day and overwhelming the country's health system. Last week, Brazilians accounted for more than a quarter of global COVID-19 deaths. Intensive care units (ICU) were full in 21 out of 27 of Brazil’s capitals. These staggering figures are clear evidence of the authorities’ failure to manage the health and humanitarian crises in the country and protect Brazilians, especially the most vulnerable, from the virus. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams working across Brazil report severe shortages of oxygen, medical supplies, and personal protective equipment. “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil’s authorities have treated public health as a political game,” says Pierre Van Heddegem, emergency coordinator for MSF’s COVID-19 response in Brazil. “Masks are shunned, physical distancing is ignored, and few restrictions are put into place to protect the people.” We are calling on national authorities to act now to put in place an effective, centralized, coordinated public health response.

But a century later, insulin is still out of reach for half of the millions of people worldwide who need it. In most of the countries where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works, insulin is not available in public health facilities or private pharmacies. Three manufacturers—Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Eli Lilly—control 90 percent of the global market, keeping prices unreasonably high.\n \nThe scientists who discovered insulin sold the patent to the University of Toronto for $1, with the wish that the drug be accessible for all. To celebrate 100 years of insulin, let’s keep pushing to make affordable, effective diabetes treatment available to everyone who needs it.

With a long history of active conflict in the area, tensions here remain high and most of the sexual violence cases that Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sees happen in the community and in the home. MSF opened the Tongolo support center in 2017 because survivors couldn’t access the medical and psychosocial services they needed. The center offers free, high-quality care, including for men, children, and adolescents. \"Tongolo means ‘star’— something that shines, that gives hope,” says Sylvie Nadège, the center's supervisor. “The Tongolo center is special because we offer holistic care. We have all types of staff: health care workers, social workers, and mental health counselors, and we offer on-site health care.” Survivors of sexual violence also need services that MSF cannot provide, namely protection, emergency shelter, and economic and legal support. We are calling on donors and other organizations to make these services available in Bangui. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Over the last year, this conflict has intensified, displacing more than half a million people. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been working in Cabo Delgado since February 2019 when teams responded to the consequences of Cyclone Kenneth. MSF Director of Analysis Jonathan Whittall provides insight into the conflict, its impact on people forced to flee, and the need for more humanitarian assistance. “What’s needed in Cabo Delgado are the basic necessities to sustain life,” says Whittall. “People need water, food, health care, shelter. We’re talking about emergency needs for a population that has been uprooted and displaced and found safety in extremely difficult conditions.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3rZLadJ\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is concerned about a recent surge in measles cases in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This began just months after the country declared an end to its worst-ever measles outbreak, in which more than 460,000 children contracted the disease and some 8,000 died from 2018 to 2020. Measles is among the biggest causes of death for children worldwide, even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available. Since January 1, 2021, there have been more than 13,000 new cases in the region that includes North and South Ubangi provinces. In addition to treating sick patients, MSF teams have raced to vaccinate more than 130,000 children. They’ve also trained many local health workers in disease surveillance so they can recognize new outbreaks earlier. But more resources are urgently needed to keep this new surge from spiraling out of control.

As we mark one year of life defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global health community is focused on how to get vaccines to the people who need them most. Health workers and activists are calling for the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world, and right here in the United States.  \n\nLast year, MSF worked with local partners in projects across the US to support the COVID-19 response in underserved communities, including work with African American, Native American, and Latinx communities. This year, we are renewing our collaborations with community-based organizations in New York City and in Puerto Rico to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach some of those hardest hit by the virus.   \n\nRacial and ethnic disparities in health and health care are not new, but the pandemic has exposed these harsh realities for all to see. Who is getting access to the new COVID-19 vaccines? What are the barriers? How can we expand the reach of these lifesaving tools? Answering these questions is critical to bringing this pandemic to an end. We know that no one will be safe from this disease until we’re all safe.\n\nRing the bell to be notified when we go live or visit https://bit.ly/3s0R2V1 to learn more and RSVP.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) opened a medical project for sex workers in Malawi in 2014. The focus was on testing and treatment for HIV and tuberculosis and providing sexual and reproductive health care, including treatment for sexual violence. A key aspect of the program was using trained community health workers like Fanny—a fellow sex worker who could gain the trust of the people we wanted to reach and provide them with important health information and services. “What the girls go through, I go through the same,” says Fanny. “They look at me as their helper because we counsel and guide each other and share the problems we are facing.” Community health workers also offer direct services to beneficiaries, including contraception. “I distribute condoms, I give health talks. I distribute PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis to protect against HIV) and I am able to do pregnancy tests. I also accompany fellow sex workers to the hospital when they need to meet a doctor.”  Over seven years, the project reached more than 7,000 women and provided a successful model for reaching a neglected population and helping put the power of self-managed care into women’s hands. MSF’s project helped bring down the rates of HIV in the community and worked with local hospitals to improve their treatment of sex workers; it also addressed mistreatment of sex workers by police. “MSF changed the narrative. We are well informed,” Fanny says. “The trainings and groups have helped. We are now able to demand justice for ourselves.” In December 2020, MSF handed over the project to local community organizations and the Ministry of Health.

    "description": "The health system in Yemen has deteriorated during six years of war, leaving it unprepared to respond to the urgent needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Yemen are witnessing a dramatic second wave of severe COVID cases throughout the country, accompanied by a lack of oxygen and beds in intensive care units (ICUs). Our teams have launched an emergency COVID-19 project at Al Gamhouria hospital in the southern city of Aden to care for critically ill patients, but much more needs to be done. “Due to gravity of the situation, we call on all medical humanitarian organizations to immediately scale up their response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen,” says MSF Head of Mission Raphael Veight. “And we call on institutional donors who cut their funding for the humanitarian response in Yemen to scale up and make sure that the necessary funds are available.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3sly1wE\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In the final part of our documentary on the impact of a decade of conflict in Syria—\"No way out\"—we bring you into what is happening in Idlib and how the current situation is affecting  the lives of people currently living in the province. \n\nOver years of war and cycles of displacement, Syrians fleeing the violence have crowded into Idlib province, hemmed into the north by the Turkish border. Living conditions are disastrous. In a region where 2.8 million people already depend on humanitarian aid for their basic needs—food, water, shelter, health care, and education—every new military attack, every economic crisis affects a population left shattered by ten years of war. \n\nAmani Al Ali is a cartoonist who stayed on in Idlib city, even after it emptied out, in order to take care of her mother. \"The war affected me psychologically,\" she says. \"But it also gave me the motivation to keep drawing.\" Imad Youssef, a former construction worker, is unemployed and worries about the future in Idlib for his family and for other displaced people—especially those living in the camps and informal settlements. “They have paid heavily with their lives and livelihoods,” he says. Abu Alaa, a citizen journalist, asks how people in western countries would feel if they were forced from their homes and homelands.

    "description": "In Part 3 of our documentary on the impact of a decade of conflict in Syria—\"No way out\"—we bring you into the lives of some of the people who were trapped in Raqqa, facing violence from all sides. None of the forces involved in the conflict—whether the Syrian government and its allies, the Islamic State group (IS), or the US-led international coalition—showed any mercy, leading to the destruction of Raqqa.\n\nIn June 2017, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) backed by the US-led international coalition air force launched a major military offensive against the IS in Raqqa, making no distinction between combatants and civilians. People trapped in Raqqa endured persecution under IS control, followed by the coalition’s indiscriminate airstrikes. Khalaf Al Malla is a schoolteacher who fled after his home was raided by IS. During his last two months there, he describes living like a prisoner confined to his home. \"Going out meant getting killed, either mentally or physically,\" he says. Fatima Al Ali and her family endured many hardships in Raqqa, but were not able to leave. She talks about living in constant fear during the coalition offensive, with airstrikes raining down and IS taking over people's homes. \n\nRead more about the situation in Raqqa as a result of the Syrian war  and watch the full documentary at http://bit.ly/3rDl7d7 \n\nTimestamps:\n0:01 Khalaf recalls the IS raid of Raqqa\n2:19 Fatima recalls the attack on Raqqa\n4:27 I heard that Raqqa was 90% destroyed\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In Part 2 of our documentary on the impact of a decade of conflict in Syria—\"No way out\"—we bring you into the lives of some of the people who witnessed attacks on health facilities. These attacks have occurred throughout the conflict, depriving communities of vital services. People started avoiding hospitals for fear of being bombed, arrested, or tortured.  \n\nOn February 15, 2016, Syrian forces and their Russian allies bombed a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supported hospital in Maarat Al Numan in Idlib in “double-tap” airstrikes. Dr. Mazen Al Saud describes arriving at the hospital to find his patients, colleagues, and friends buried under the rubble. \"I was so shocked,\" he says.  \n\nA few years later, in December 2019, despite Russia's announcement of a unilateral ceasefire, the Syrian government launched another massive offensive to take opposition-held territory. Over the next three months, more than 1.5 million people in Idlib and Aleppo provinces were forced to flee--the biggest internal displacement since the war began. Mustafa Ajaj, who runs a health care facility in Deir Hassan camp in Idlib, has been displaced six times and witnessed relentless and targeted attacks on health workers. “The bombing of medical facilities caused us enormous suffering,” says Mustafa. “Every medical center, in every free area, was bombed.” \n \nRead more about the impact of the airstrikes in Idlib and watch the full documentary at http://bit.ly/3liRcEH \n\nTimestamps:\n0:01 Mustafa recalls violence amid displacement\n1:06 Medical centers supported displaced people\n1:28 Bombings caused enormous suffering\n2:02 Dr. Mazen Al Saud recalls impact of airstrikes\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In Part 1 of our documentary on the impact of a decade of conflict in Syria—\"No way out\"—we bring you into the lives of some of the people affected by the widening war. \n\nIn the first section of Part 1, we take a look at the events and aftermath of the siege of Homs. In July 2011, the Syrian army deployed tanks in Homs, the third-largest city and an opposition stronghold. In February 2012, Syrian government forces began an all-out assault on Homs. A bloody siege lasted for nearly three years, with civilians trapped in the fighting. Abu Alaa, a citizen journalist, recalls his family's experience living under fire. Journalist and humanitarian aid worker Tarek Baderkhan, who was born in Homs, describes staying in the city for as long as he could. When his hometown fell to the Syrian army in 2015, he was evacuated by bus to the countryside north of the city. His body was scarred by shrapnel wounds.  \n\nIn the second section of Part 1, we reflect on the attacks in eastern Ghouta. On August 21, 2013, the Syrian government launched airstrikes and alleged chemical attacks in Ghouta. That morning, in less than three hours, three hospitals supported by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treat 3,600 patients showing symptoms of exposure to a toxic agent. Imad Youssef is a former construction worker from Zamalka one of the areas that was hit. “It was a horrifying scene. Countless cars were evacuating thousands of victims from my hometown,” says Imad. “As I went from one medical facility to another, I found them overwhelmed with men, women, and children who were either choking, or had been killed.” \n\nRead more about what happened in Homs and Ghouta and watch the full documentary at http://bit.ly/3cvdX4a   \n\nTimestamps:\n0:02 Tarek recalls the Siege of Homs \n1:15 The attack on Homs in 2012\n2:09 Abu recalls the airstrikes on Idlib\n4:01 Imad recalls the attacks on Ghouta\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "While much of the world has turned away from the staggering scale of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria, we wanted to look deeper. After a decade of conflict, 6.6 million people have been uprooted inside Syria—the largest number of internally displaced people anywhere in the world. Many families have been forced to flee repeated cycles of violence. Another 5.6 million Syrian refugees have fled to other countries for safety.  \n\nBehind these terribly large numbers are, of course, individual human beings. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have been working in Syria throughout the long, brutal conflict. In this documentary about the war in Syria—\"No way out\"—we bring you into the lives of some of the people we’ve met along the way in Idlib, in overcrowded camps and settlements still vulnerable to airstrikes. These are the survivors. \n\nIn this introduction to the documentary, we meet Mustafa Ajaj, who runs a health care facility in Deir Hassan camp in Idlib and has been displaced six times. A father of five, he has witnessed relentless and targeted attacks on medical workers and facilities since the beginning of the war in Syria. “Every year over these past ten years has seen fighting, war, battles and displacement,” says Mustafa. “You can live in a tent for a month or two, or even a year, but not for your entire life.” \n\nRead more and watch the full documentary at http://bit.ly/3ezi9m4  \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Ongoing fighting in Nigeria’s Borno state has caused years of suffering for people in this northeastern region and pushed many to leave their homes in search of safety. Large numbers of displaced people are living in the town of Pulka, where access to clean water is a major problem. Water is particularly scarce now, during the dry, hot season that runs from November to May. “Most boreholes are not in working condition. You see a lot of people, sometimes over 1,000, [lining up] to get water, sometimes to get one bucketful of water,” says Mohammed U., who lives in Pulka. Many displaced people are forced to trade scarce food supplies for water with local residents. Some resort to drinking untreated water. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical teams running a hospital in Pulka say the most common disease they see, especially among children, is acute, non-bloody diarrhea—a direct result of the lack of access to clean water. MSF is calling on the organizations providing water and sanitation services here to act urgently to improve the supply of safe drinking water.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "As depicted in this timeline of the Syrian crisis, Syria has been convulsed by war for 10 years. Back in 2011, what began as political protests quickly escalated to deadly conflict. A decade later, the humanitarian toll is devastating. Over this period, 12 million Syrian people—half the country’s population before the war—have been forced to flee and leave their homes behind, often multiple times. This is the biggest displacement crisis of the century. Many of those who have been uprooted are still displaced today. Years of conflict have also destroyed Syria’s infrastructure, especially its health system. Hundreds of medical facilities have been bombed, large numbers of medical staff have been killed or have fled, and there are still desperate shortages of medical supplies in many parts of the country. Today, the medical needs of the Syrian people are immense. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been responding to the crisis in Syria from the start, providing medical care and support to people in need across the country. We’ve donated medical supplies, set up hospitals and clinics, and provided remote support to medical facilities and networks of doctors in areas we couldn’t access directly. Today, MSF supports Syrians both within the country and in several neighboring nations that host Syrian refugees.

    "description": "Fighting in Ethiopia’s Tigray region has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Most are staying with host families in the region, while tens of thousands of others have taken shelter at informal sites or are still hiding in the bush or the mountains. Most have been deprived of medical care for months and have received little humanitarian assistance. In the town of Shire, about 20,000 people live in precarious conditions in several schools and on the campus of Shire University. There is not enough food, and people with chronic diseases have not received medication for months. Children have not been vaccinated, and pregnant mothers are worried that they will give birth in the camps as the nightly curfew makes it impossible to reach the hospital. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams run primary health clinics in the displacement site and are supporting Shire hospital.

    "description": "As we approach the one-year anniversary of the pandemic, governments are meeting to discuss a landmark proposal at the World Trade Organization for a waiver on intellectual property (IP) on COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, tests, and other medical tools. The temporary waiver would apply to IP on certain COVID-19 medical tools and technologies until herd immunity is reached. Yet the United States and 16 other countries are blocking the proposal by refusing to allow formal negotiations to begin. “The waiver proposal offers all governments opportunities to take action for better collaboration in the development, production, and supply of COVID medical tools without being restricted by private industry’s interests and actions,\" said Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International President Dr. Christos Christou. \"Crucially, it would give governments all available tools to ensure global access.\" Obstruction by wealthier countries continues despite the global challenges posed by highly infectious new variants of the disease spreading in some low- and middle-income countries. The US and others \"must stop stonewalling and show the leadership required to deliver on the ‘global solidarity’ they have so often declared during this pandemic,\" said Dr. Christou. \"It’s time to champion access to medical tools for everyone, wherever they live.” Read more at https://bit.ly/2OzOyOL\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

MSF teams responded to the spread of the novel coronavirus in the more than 70 countries where we have existing medical projects, and launched emergency responses in many others—including unprecedented operations in Europe and the United States. \n\nToday, most COVID-19 activities have been integrated in our regular programs. However, we are maintaining some focused projects depending on the local needs. Teams have been caring for COVID-19 patients in treatment centers and hospitals, offering health education and mental health support, providing training for vital infection prevention and control measures in health facilities, and supporting response efforts by local authorities. A key priority is to keep our other lifesaving medical programs running amid this emergency.

    "description": "Eswatini has the highest prevalence of HIV of any country in the world. The fear and stigma around the disease is high, so Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) implemented home self-testing for HIV. \"What I like about self-testing is that it gives you the freedom to know your HIV status without anyone else knowing and without going to the hospital,\" says Thoko, an MSF patient. People come for initial testing at our clinic and, if they test negative, they are given self-testing kits to use at home. \"We really encourage women to continue testing for HIV so that they always know their status,\" says MSF counselor Nombulelo Ndlovu. \"This will ensure that even if they are still HIV negative, they are able to continue to protect themselves and remain negative. If they happen to receive a positive result, we assure them that life goes on. All that they need to do is to go to the nearest clinic where they will get all the necessary assistance and be able to start ARV (antiretroviral) treatment.\" Read more about MSF's integration of self-care into our sexual and reproductive health projects at https://bit.ly/2MQy9Vq\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

When she learned that her husband was HIV positive, she went to a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic and began pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which prevents infection in people at risk of HIV. \"I did not waste any time, I just rushed to MSF and I was given PrEP. I started taking it then,\" she says. \"My entire family knows as well.

    "description": "The people of northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province have been caught in the middle of a violent conflict since 2017. Over the last year fighting has become even more intense, forcing some 668,000 people to flee their homes. Many of these displaced people take shelter with host families, leading to overcrowded homes and increasing the risk of the spread of diseases like cholera. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are seeing cases of malaria and COVID-19 and many people have lost access to their treatment for HIV. The conflict has also taken a heavy psychological toll, and MSF is providing much-needed mental health care. People fleeing their homes “find people who have been tortured or horribly injured or who died of hunger and thirst in the jungle,” said MSF medical coordinator Patricia Postigo. “They tell us they cannot get these images out of their minds.” \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Many years of war, beginning with the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, have prepared Baghdad’s hospitals for large influxes of wounded patients. But as COVID-19 began to spread through the city last summer, weaknesses in the overstretched health care system quickly became apparent. Even people with COVID-19 delayed coming in for treatment. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams supported the respiratory care unit of al-Kindi hospital throughout summer 2020. They saw first-hand the increasing needs and how the hospital was unable to cope with the flood of COVID-19 patients in need of close and consistent follow-up. MSF worked with health authorities to add its own COVID-19 treatment ward inside al-Kindi hospital, which opened in September with 24 beds. It has since grown to a 36-bed purpose-built facility. In this video, MSF nurse Amjad Ibrahim shows us a look inside the ward.

    "description": "In December 2020, in the wake of a presidential election, fighting broke out in Central African Republic (CAR) between the government, supported by UN military personnel and foreign troops, and a newly formed coalition of armed groups. Months later tensions continue to run high, and violence has spread to the outskirts of Bangui, the capital. Since mid-December 2020, more than 250 war-wounded people been treated by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Bangui and the provinces. On January 13, 2021, 31 year-old France Beldo became one of them after she was hit by a stray bullet in Bangui. In this video France tells her story of healing at MSF’s SICA hospital and describes how the violence has impacted her community. “If the fighting continues like this, we’ll keep on living in fear,” she says. “It has to stop so that the country can be peaceful again.” Read more at https://bit.ly/3jHhIXw\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In recent months, the number of migrants and refugees at Italy's northern borders has sharply increased. Even through the winter, people head west across the snow-capped mountains towards France. Many tell stories of humiliation, violence, and harassment. People arrive on foot through the woods and along trails, where some report being beaten and turned back by police. The only thing that keeps them going, despite all they have suffered, is hope for what lies ahead. In mid-December, two teams from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams traveled to the main transit points along the border to speak with migrants and refugees on the move.\n\nIssifi, originally from Niger, spent some time in Germany and Switzerland, but returned to Italy. He lived on the streets in Bolzano for more than a year until he met Reiner, a farmer who grows organic apples. Reiner invited him to stay on his farm, and Issifi remained there even after apple-picking season was over. “Getting to know his story was important,” says Reiner “It enriched me, and I was struck by his experiences during his journey. None of us can really imagine their suffering and the terrible things they have experienced in the course of their journeys. Yet despite having lived such a hard life, they always have smiles on their faces.”\n\nFind out more at http://bit.ly/3cYVcrV\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "More than 15,000 women, men, and children are still trapped in unsafe and humiliating conditions on the Greek islands. As this crisis continues, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) mental health teams on Lesbos and Samos are seeing alarming levels of mental health distress among our patients. “Last year, MSF treated 50 children with severe suicidal ideation, or even suicide attempts” says MSF mental health activity manager Katrin Glatz-Brubakk. “It’s really really painful to see these children when they live in conditions where there is absolutely no hope for them.” We have warned repeatedly of the mental health emergency facing refugees and migrants trapped indefinitely in Greece. This emergency continues five months after the fires that destroyed Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos, and despite promises from the European Union (EU) that there will never be another Moria. Nevertheless, European states have maintained their harmful policy to contain people on these islands. MSF calls on the EU and Greek authorities to immediately move all asylum seekers, especially the most vulnerable, to safe accommodation.

Many have found refuge on the other side of the border between North and South Kivu. “We heard that there was peace in Katasomwa, so we decided to come here,” says Justin, a displaced person now living in this remote area of Kalehe Territory, South Kivu. “Since we got here in July, we have not been eating well … And this rain will end up killing us, we are homeless.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sent an emergency team to respond to the most urgent needs. The team focused first on groups with the highest mortality rates, mostly children under 15 and pregnant women. Maternal mortality in the area is very high. MSF teams are also rehabilitating health centers in the area and organizing a vaccination campaign in collaboration with health authorities.

    "title": "'Game Changer' Study Shows Insulin Can Remain Stable at Higher Temperatures",
    "description": "A study carried out by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the University of Geneva Pharmaceutical Department could have a huge impact on the lives of people with diabetes in low-resource settings. Product information for insulin requires that the drug be refrigerated up until the point of use, making access difficult for people living in  warmer parts of the world where having a refrigerator or electricity is not common. At MSF’s project in Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, people with diabetes, who need at least two injections of insulin per day, need to go to a clinic to receive their shots. Since a curfew was implemented in the camp, people have not been able to receive a second shot in the evening—and hospital admissions have been rising. MSF used temperature data gathered in Dadaab camp for the study, which found that the drug remains stable up to 99 degrees  rather than required 77 degrees. This means that patients in Dadaab and elsewhere can now take their insulin home in cooling containers to self-inject and keep themselves healthy. “This is just giving [patients] back their entitlement in terms of the right to inject their own insulin and lead a more normal life with diabetes,” says Philippa Boule, MSF noncommunicable disease advisor. MSF is calling on the World Health Organization and pharmaceutical companies to adapt their recommendations for the use of insulin.

    "description": "Several southern African countries are seeing spikes in new COVID-19 cases and deaths, but their health systems have yet to receive any vaccines for the novel coronavirus. Health workers in this region are struggling to treat a surge of patients while a deadly new variant of COVID-19 continues to spread. Countries including Mozambique, Malawi, and Eswatini are completely overwhelmed--unable to immunize frontline health workers and those most vulnerable to the disease. “When vaccines are lacking, priority should be given to vaccinating health professionals and vulnerable people. That was the global agreement,” says Christine Jamet, MSF director of operations. “However, in practice, we see a small number of rich countries monopolizing vaccines, with no regard for lower-income countries that can’t even vaccinate their health care staff.” Hospitals are at capacity and oxygen supplies are low. MSF is calling for COVID-19 vaccines to be distributed equitably worldwide, and for frontline health workers and people at the highest risk of severe illness and death from the disease to be prioritized for immunization.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) began working in key hospitals in eastern and central Tigray in mid-December, providing critical support to a health system shattered by violence since November. While fighting in this region of Ethiopia has driven some 60,000 people across the border into Sudan, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced within Tigray. Most of them have moved into friends’ and relatives’ homes, creating households of 20-25 people. The impact on the health system has been acute. Before MSF arrived, many of the facilities our teams are now supporting were not functioning, lacking in medicines and staff. These Tigray hospitals are important for treating people in the cities where they are located, but also as referral hospitals for people in remote areas. Access to many remote places is still difficult, but MSF has been able to bring mobile clinics to the outskirts of some cities and even reopen health centers in some rural areas. During these visits, says Albert Viñas, MSF’s emergency coordinator, “it was striking to see a pregnant woman who had been in labor for seven days—we were able to refer her [for care]. People who arrived at the hospital on bicycles from 30 or 35 kilometers away, someone pushing the bicycle with the patient sitting on it.” When the health system stops working, says Viñas, “activities are stopped, such as disease detection or vaccinations. We fear that epidemics will appear.” Read more about MSF's efforts to support Tigray hospitals affected by the violence at https://bit.ly/3t9277u\n\nTimestamps:\n0:20 Violence has forced people to seek refuge\n0:46 Hospitals and health centers are found in poor condition\n1:05 MSF's quick emergency response\n1:21 Setting up mobile clinics to provide care\n1:55 Reaching more remote areas is our main concern\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "MSF Medical Staff Speak Out on the End of the Global Gag Rule",
    "description": "On January 28, 2021, US President Joe Biden rescinded the Mexico City policy, better known as the Global Gag Rule. This brings to an end four years of this harmful policy that prevented US government funds from reaching any foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that even speak about abortion to their patients. Since the US is by far the biggest funder of global public health programs, many countries rely on US aid to support health care services. So US policies like the gag rule can have a devastating impact around the world. In fact, the gag rule, which has been implemented by every Republican president—then rescinded by every Democrat—since Ronald Reagan, has never been shown to reduce the number of abortions. By withholding health information and limiting access to essential care, the policy only pushed people with unwanted pregnancies to resort to unsafe abortion methods. The reversal of the Global Gag Rule is great news, but much more will need to be done to mitigate the damage it has caused and to expand access to safe abortion care.\n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) does not accept US government funding, so our programs are not directly affected by the Global Gag Rule. However, we see the harmful impacts these types of policies have on limiting access to sexual and reproductive health care. In 2019, MSF treated more than 25,800 women and girls with abortion-related complications, many of which resulted from unsafe attempts to end a pregnancy.

    "description": "El impacto devastador de la COVID-19 en los hogares para personas mayores y otros centros de atención colectiva ha evidenciado la necesidad de un mayor apoyo in situ y mejorar la adaptación de medidas de prevención y control de infecciones (PCI). \n\nMédicos sin Fronteras (MSF) ha respondido a la emergencia actual ofreciendo capacitación práctica en PCI y apoyo en salud mental al personal de los centros de cuidados prolongados en Michigan, Texas,la Nación Navajo y Pueblos. Para incrementar el alcance de estos proyectos, MSF ha creado un kit de material educativo de PCI, diseñado para integrarse fácilmente a los planes de estudio existentes en las escuelas de enfermería, salud pública y trabajo social. Este kit, que está disponible de forma pública, permite así a los estudiantes transmitir sus conocimientos sobre PCI a sus propias comunidades y ayudar al personal clínico y no clínico en los centros de cuidados prolongados a mantenerse seguro y protegido.\n\nEl kit de PCI contiene tanto archivos de texto como audiovisuales que enseñan cómo ingresar correctamente a las instalaciones; cómo llevar a cabo evaluaciones siguiendo el sistema de Evaluación de Control de Infecciones y Respuesta (ICAR, por sus siglas en inglés) del CDC; cómo realizar sesiones de capacitación o integrarse en el equipo de enfermería para introducir mejoras. Asimismo, contiene información relevante para mejorar la salud mental y el bienestar del personal que trabaja en primera línea. Una versión abreviada del programa de capacitación puede también utilizarse en hogares para personas mayores u otros espacios de convivencia.\n\nAprende más sobre el kit de herramientas para el bienestar y la prevención y control de infecciones de MSF en: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/IPCtoolkit-es\n\nSi tiene preguntas o sugerencias, comuníquese con Marina Novack, coordinadora del proyecto de cuidados a largo plazo de MSF-USA: marina.novack@newyork.msf.org\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Since December, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have been able to reach some of these displaced people with medical care, but we are very concerned for the fate of those we have not reached. “For a big part of the population in Tigray, they are still in areas where there has been hardly any humanitarian assistance provided,” says the head of MSF’s emergency department Karline Kleijer. Before the violence began in Tigray, she says, “there were at least 500,000 people already dependent on assistance in this region.” This is also an area that was hosting a number of refugees from neighboring Eritrea—the fate of those refugees is still unknown. “Our biggest worry for the population, the longer this situation lasts,” says Kleijer, “is how they can access food and what that means for their well-being.” Read more about MSF's efforts to help provide healthcare to thousands of Tigray refugees at https://bit.ly/3nLVjJ7\n\nTimestamps:\n0:12 The start of fighting in Tigray\n0:21 Lack of humanitarian assistance provided to displaced people\n0:41 Food scarcity is an issue in Tigray\n1:11 Eritrean refugee camps also require aid\n1:43 MSF has a project in Abdurafi\n1:59 At least hundreds of thousands of displaced people require assistance\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Now, more than 55,000 people have fled the fighting in Tigray and arrived in Sudan. Most of the refugees are living in official camps that lack adequate shelter, food, water, and other essentials. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing medical care in the camps in Kassala and Gedaref states and at one of the main crossing points into Sudan. Over time, people’s health conditions have deteriorated and MSF medical staff are currently seeing a lot of respiratory tract infections and acute watery diarrhea. We are also concerned about refugees from Tigray with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, who have little access to the medicines they need. On top of the medical concerns, the head of MSF’s emergency department Karline Kleijer says that many refugees are dealing with the psychological repercussions of the violence. “We heard a lot of stories of people being directly exposed to violence, or who witnessed violence of other people,” she says. In addition to having left their entire lives behind, they are also mourning family members and friends who were killed. “We consider mental health as one of the biggest needs in Sudan.” Read more about the assistance needed to address the needs of refugees from the Tigray region at https://bit.ly/3bydUGc\n\nTimestamps:\n0:14 50,000 people fled from Tigray and are now in Sudan as refugees\n0:30 Refugees from Tigray started to arrive in Sudan\n0:46 MSF is working in the border crossings\n2:00 New arrival of refugees from Tigray require greater medical assistance\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Implementing an infection prevention and control training (IPC) initiative in a long-term care facility requires careful consideration of that facility’s unique needs. A comprehensive IPC training and support initiative targets the gaps in knowledge for both clinical and non-clinical staff. In this video, Dr. Buffy Lloyd-Krejci explains how to customize these sessions to train all staff effectively. \n\nThis series was designed to help students navigate the resources in the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) infection prevention and control tool kit.

    "description": "No matter where you come from, seeking safety for yourself and your children is not a crime. However, after failing to protect people who are legally seeking asylum on our southern border for the last year, the US government is now using the COVID-19 pandemic to deny them any access to the asylum process at all. Some 2,200 asylum seekers were living in a makeshift camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros near the US border in March. These are people who have suffered from violence, extortion, or kidnapping and are seeking safety. Many of them had already been waiting for months in danger, living in tents outside with their children, to be called to their asylum hearings. This is due to the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a US immigration program announced in January 2019 that requires many asylum seekers to remain in Mexico to await their hearings, rather than allowing them to wait in safety in the US. Soon after the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the US, the border was closed and now some 60,000 people waiting in Matamoros and other cities along the border have no information about the status of their asylum requests and when or if they might be able to be heard. This video tells the story of Marcela and her children, asylum seekers running from armed men who have threatened to kidnap or kill them. They are now stranded at the border with no information and no hope. \"If we’d stayed, they would have killed us a long time ago,\" she says. \"I don’t want wealth—I want my daughters to be able to study, nothing more, and for us to be in a safe place, where we’re no longer afraid that they’re chasing us.\" Read more at https://bit.ly/38xnbv5\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

In recent years, the region has seen multiple waves of mass displacement—between December 2019 and March 2020, fighting in the Idlib region forced one million people to flee, many of whom were already displaced. “As you can see, the situation’s bad,” says Nasr Al-Jaddouh. “You may well ask how I even live in this tent, but I don’t have another option. I fled Hama countryside because of heavy shelling and airstrikes.” To help improve living conditions during winter, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have started distributing winter kits containing warm clothes, tarps, mattresses, and blankets, to more than 14,500 families.

MSF has seen first-hand the impact of scarce supplies and high prices of essential medical tools in our work caring for people with HIV, treating patients with tuberculosis, vaccinating children against pneumonia, and much more. Any patents on the medical tools needed to prevent and treat this new life-threatening disease will mean that only the wealthiest will have access to them. That means the coronavirus pandemic will take much longer to end, and many more people will get sick and die. Pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies must commit to not seek nor enforce patents. If they won’t do the right thing, then governments can take action. Please support the proposal to the World Trade Organization to say #NoCovidMonopolies.

In Fangak county, located in the middle of the vast Sudd wetland, floodwaters began engulfing people's homes and farms in July and in some places the waters continue to rise. In late September, more than 3,000 people there were displaced from their homes by the flooding. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams distributed blankets, plastic sheeting and other essential items and are continuing to provide medical care to displaced people and residents of the community. “This year, water reached places that weren’t flooded last year,” says Nyabuok Lony Ruot, the relative of a patient at the MSF hospital in Old Fangak town. “All the crops are in the water. We came to the hospital by canoe.” A lack of roads in Fangak county means that most people travel by foot or by boat. In some places, the high waters make walking for medical care impossible and most people cannot afford to pay for a canoe, so MSF is using its boat as an ambulance.

The HIV crisis in Central African Republic (CAR) is particularly acute—fueled by extreme poverty, pervasive violence, a shortage of health facilities and staff, and major barriers to early testing and treatment. HIV remains a leading cause of death in the country. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams offer free medical care and psychological support for people living with HIV, including through community-based groups that make treatment more accessible even in remote areas. Few of the limited number of health facilities here offer HIV testing and care, and many people living with HIV have to make long and often dangerous journeys to find a clinic where services are available. Poor access to information about HIV/AIDS and stigma surrounding the disease add to the deadly obstacles to care. We’re calling for more action to bring free HIV testing and care within reach for everyone who needs it.

    "description": "The essential workers who clean, cook, and do laundry for the residents of nursing homes in the United States play a critical role in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Yet these environmental services (EVS) staff rarely get the infection prevention and control (IPC) training they need to protect themselves and the vulnerable people they assist day in and day out. This a serious problem, especially during a pandemic that has devastated nursing homes across the country. In response, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) brought in-person IPC training as well as mental health and wellness support to more than 80 long-term care facilities in the US during COVID-19. “(We) do a one-on-one training with EVS staff,” says Kira Smith, MSF nurse manager for IPC who conducted site visits in Houston, Texas. “And that looks like going in and saying, ‘Okay, show me your cleaning practices. Why don't you show me how you clean a room?’ Then based on that, I'll clean the next room and show maybe some different techniques for a higher standard of IPC in cleaning. Then we'll go on to the following room, and she can show me what she learned. We can continue that way, practicing new skills.

    "title": "Nursing Home Staff Need Wellness Support During COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "description": "\"COVID has had a really huge effect on the personal life and work life of those individuals who work in nursing facilities,” says Perry McAfee, a health and wellness officer for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Houston, Texas. “Many of them have to work long hours—12-, 16-hour shifts, multiple days in a row. That has a huge effect on their wellbeing, their family life, and their work life.” The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a devastating toll on nursing homes in the United States. Elderly residents have been among those most vulnerable to the disease, as have the staff working closely with them. In addition to putting in long hours, staff in these facilities see residents and colleagues fall sick. The nursing staff face burnout and worry about bringing COVID home to their families, or bringing the disease to the residents. In order to support the mental health and wellness of these essential workers, MSF has brought mental health and wellness support to 59 long-term care facilities in the US during the pandemic. “I think mental health support is very much needed in this field altogether,” says Adelia Patterson, the wellness and life enrichment director at Focused Care at Beechnut, a nursing home in Houston. “Especially at times like that, because we're just caregivers at heart. We don't take the time to care for ourselves.” Learn more about MSF's efforts to support nursing home staff during the pandemic at https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/us-nursing-home-staff-need-wellness-support-during-covid-19-pandemic\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "For nearly a year we've been living with the new realities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even as scientists and medical professionals are uncovering new facts about the virus, we're still faced with many questions. Once we have an approved effective vaccine, who will have access to it? How much will it cost? How will we adapt to ensure the vaccine makes it to those most in need?  \n\nFor more than 20 years, the Access Campaign has worked to change government policies and  pharmaceutical industry practices to ensure that effective drugs, tests, and vaccines are available, affordable, and suitable for the people who need them most. In the time of COVID-19, the whole world is experiencing the consequences of a vaccine and medicines development system that places profits before people. The time for systemic reforms has never been more vital.  \n\nJoin Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) for this critical final discussion in our fall Let's Talk webinar series on November 12. We’ll be in conversation with Dana Gill, U.S. policy advisor on access to medicines for MSF-USA and the Access Campaign, and Manuel Martin, medical innovation & access policy advisor for the Access Campaign based in Geneva. Together with our host, MSF-USA executive director Avril Benoît, this expert panel will answer your questions about a COVID-19 vaccine and the road to ensuring access to essential medicines to all in need. \n\nRead more about MSF's Access Campaign at https://msfaccess.org\n\n Make sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

In September, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), alongside the Ministry of Health, decided to launch a vaccination campaign. The campaign reached over 50,000 children between six months and 14 years. “We say that prevention is better than a cure,” says Mariam Hammadoun Maïga, mother of 16-month-old Amadou, “so it’s better to vaccinate children than to treat them.\" Read more about MSF’s work in vaccinating against measles in Mali at https://bit.ly/3ouYZ3r\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In response to the challenges presented by COVID-19, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is reaching out to nursing homes and nursing schools in the United States to share our experience in epidemic response and infection prevention and control (IPC). From the start of the pandemic, MSF teams have worked with hundreds of long-term care facilities across Europe, as well as in Michigan and Texas. In this video, we introduce an adaptable training module available for nursing schools to integrate into their curricula. “Nursing schools are uniquely positioned to provide IPC expertise that can make a tremendous difference in their communities,” says Buffy Lloyd-Krejci, DrPH, who has worked with MSF as an infection prevention and control manager. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on people living in nursing homes and long-term care centers, and on essential workers in these facilities. In the US, nearly 40 percent of coronavirus deaths have been linked to long-term care facilities—even though they accounted for only 7 percent of the total cases, according to an analysis by The New York Times. While the elderly and immunocompromised are particularly vulnerable to the virus, many long-term care facilities lack adequate training and support for staff on IPC.\n \nThe IPC Tool Kit is available for download here: https://bit.ly/3otaiJp\n \nIf you have questions or suggestions, contact Marina Novack, long-term care project coordinator for MSF-USA: marina.novack@newyork.msf.org.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In Puerto Rico, as in much of the world, COVID-19 is compounding the risks facing vulnerable groups. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams here worked with community-based organizations and local health providers to offer medical aid to those who need help the most. Our services included home-based primary care as well as monitoring for COVID-positive patients. At the end of September, MSF handed over medical activities to Puerto Rico Salud (PRS), a local organization formed by four members of our team seeking to carry on this vital work. Rolando Betancourt, who worked with MSF as a nurse and is a cofounder of the new organization, says working with MSF made him more aware of the medical needs among poor and marginalized communities. “We set out to find a way to continue the same work as Doctors Without Borders,” says Betancourt. “Who better than the same staff … who are already trained, and who know the quality of service required?” To find out more about our work in response to the impact of COVID-19 in Puerto Rico, click here https://bit.ly/37OjvX5.

    "description": "The world’s fastest-growing humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Burkina Faso. Over the past two years, escalating violence by armed groups in the north and east of the country has forced more than one million people to flee their homes. In addition to their physical injuries and ailments, many people also suffer from invisible wounds. Many have been victims of violence, have lost loved ones, or witnessed atrocities. “They may have fear or anxiety or are in permanent stress,” says Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) psychologist Issaka Dahila. To ease the psychological suffering of people affected by the conflict, MSF teams started mental health activities in Burkina Faso’s Eastern region at the end of 2019. This year, between July and September alone, 128 people attended individual consultations and 4,391 people participated in group mental health sessions with MSF.

Tiffany Bell, who works at a long-term care facility in Roseville, Michigan, says, “Even after COVID, we're going to need some type of therapy or counseling because it just has done so much damage to us emotionally.” MSF has provided mental health and wellness training to more than 59 long-term care facilities in the US this year in response to the pandemic.

    "title": "Welcome Back: A Documentary about Living in Liberia with Mental Illness and Epilepsy",
    "description": "In Liberia, people living with mental illness or epilepsy face a dire lack of knowledge about the diseases, as well as resources for care. Many are stigmatized, and when spiritual interventions or traditional medicine don’t work, people can be rejected from family and society. “Imagine someone is coming down with mental condition in a family that has not heard about mental conditions before,” says Abraham Kollie, a psychosocial community worker for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “Can you imagine that? They will go straight to seek solutions elsewhere, and not even think about coming to the clinic.“ \n\nAlthough epilepsy is classified as a neurological, rather than a mental health disorder, the two are treated within the same program in Liberia. “In our community and in Liberia, a lot of our people, even educated people, back the belief that epilepsy is contagious and that it can be transferred from one person to another,” says Kollie. “So we have a lot of work to do.”   \n\nIn the last 30 years, Liberians have endured two civil wars and an Ebola epidemic that claimed thousands of lives in the region, including a disproportionate number of health workers. Like many low-resource countries, Liberia has limited services for people with mental health disorders, with one psychiatric hospital and only two psychiatrists. However, the Ministry of Health has worked with MSF and other organizations to improve its strategy for delivering mental health care at the community level. Since this documentary was made, COVID-19 has caused some setbacks to this progress, socially isolating patients and disrupting treatment in some cases. MSF staff have had to start working differently to reach the most vulnerable patients and get them back on track.\n\nThis film introduces viewers to patients dealing with epilepsy and mental health conditions who are fighting to get their normal lives back.

    "description": "When Juan José was admitted to the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) COVID-19 treatment center in Matamoros, in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state, he was in severe condition. “I was nervous, scared, and worried when I arrived,” he says. “One day here, two, three—being in a situation like this makes me think about my life.” As Juan José received medical treatment and started to recover, both he and his family also received psychosocial care from MSF psychologists to help them deal with fear and stress caused by the disease. “I want to tell you from the bottom of my heart that [MSF's] humanitarian work is very important,” says Juan José. “Thanks to that, I will change my life, my habits. I will improve as a person and as a human being.” MSF is now closing its activities in Matamoros and in Reynosa, also in Tamaulipas state, because the numbers of new cases are decreasing. In three-and-a-half months, our teams provided medical and mental health care to 194 COVID-19 patients and their families.

    "description": "El 30 de septiembre, Médicos Sin Fronteras/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) completó sus actividades de respuesta ante la emergencia de COVID-19 en Puerto Rico, después de cuatro meses brindando asistencia medica humanitaria a algunas de las comunidades más vulnerables de la isla. “MSF logró impactar a comunidades que han sido marginadas en Puerto Rico por mucho tiempo, dijo la enfermera Carla, que dirigió el programa de monitoreo de MSF para pacientes positivos con COVID. Carla  es una de los cuatros miembros de el equipo de MSF en Puerto Rico que han comenzado su propia organización de ayuda médica, Puerto Rico Salud (PRS), para continuar brindando atención médica a personas que no tienen acceso a servicios medicos. En cuatros meses, el equipo médico de MSF atendió a más de 1.200 pacientes, principalmente adultos mayores padeciendo de condiciones crónicas como diabetes e hipertensión. Nosotros también ayudamos a distribuir casi 30.000 equipos de protección personal (EPP), proporcionamos  5.000 kits de higiene a personas sin hogar y otros personas que viven  en comunidades pobres o aisladas, y facilitamos formaciones acerca del control de prevencion de infecciones (CPI) para los trabajadores de la salud primera linea  en 22 instalaciones.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) completed its COVID-19 emergency response activities in Puerto Rico on September 30 after four months providing medical and humanitarian assistance to some of the most vulnerable communities on the island. “[MSF] managed to impact communities that have been marginalized in Puerto Rico for a long time,” says nurse Carla, who managed MSF’s monitoring program for patients who tested positive for the disease. Carla is one of four MSF staff who have started their own medical aid organization, Puerto Rico Salud (PRS), to continue providing health care to people who lack access to services. In the span of four months, the MSF medical team saw more than 1,200 patients, mostly older adults suffering from chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. We also helped distribute nearly 30,000 items of personal protective equipment, provided 5,000 hygiene kits to homeless people and others living in poor or isolated communities, and conducted infection prevention training to staff at 22 facilities. All of this work was done in close collaboration with community-based organizations and local health providers.

    "description": "When Jacir de Souza, an indigenous Macuxi leader in Brazil's Roraima state, was treated for COVID-19, it was not his first encounter with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). In the early 1990s, MSF came to de Souza’s community in the Amazon region as part of the response to a malaria epidemic. “They said, ‘We're going to help. We invited indigenous people from all over Roraima to be trained as lab technicians and microscopists,’” de Souza remembers. Many of the people MSF trained some 30 years ago continue to work in their communities to this day. “There was malaria throughout the state, and then [with the work] it was gone. It was really over!” During the COVID-19 pandemic, MSF has focused on the most vulnerable people in Brazil, including those in indigenous communities which often lack access to medical care. Our teams worked in Roraima state's Boa Vista field hospital, where de Souza received treatment and recovered, from June to September this year. Unfortunately, others close to him did not survive. “I did not expect it would be such a tough disease,” he says. “I lost my younger brother, I lost my mother-in-law, I lost my aunt. I don't know when this disease will go away.“ Read more: https://bit.ly/2G4Lgza\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Right now, all over the world, our teams are seeing women and girls cut off from the essential health services they need due to the devastating secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic—including closures of health facilities, cuts in services, and supply shortages. Contraception and safe abortion care are rarely recognized as essential, even though they help prevent one of the biggest causes of maternal mortality: unsafe abortion. Every day, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams treat women and girls who've had to resort to unsafe methods to terminate pregnancy because they had no access to proper care. \"During these extraordinary times, it's even more critical that women and girls have access to the health services that they need,\" says Dr. Manisha Kumar, head of MSF's task force for safe abortion care. Our teams around the world are working hard to keep essential programs for women and girls running. \"In some places, this means giving women longer refills of their birth control pills to avoid unnecessary visits to the clinic. And in other places, this means working with community health workers and local women's groups to provide abortion medications in the community,\" says Dr. Kumar. Governments, health systems, and providers must ensure that these services remain open and accessible to women and girls. Contraception and safe abortion care are essential health care, during COVID-19 and always.

More than two million people in this area, which includes Idlib and Aleppo governates, have been displaced by the war in Syria. Most of them are living in overcrowded camps with limited access to water and poor sanitation. Their living conditions make infection prevention and control measures like physical distancing and handwashing extremely difficult. “Since the camps are considered to be high-risk areas, MSF launched an emergency intervention,” says Osama, a logistician with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Our teams have helped distribute more than 63,000 hygiene kits to families staying in these camps since April while also helping health facilities to screen patients for suspected COVID-19.

    "description": "Today, the European Commission announced a new Migration Pact promising a “fresh start” to live up to European values while addressing the challenges facing migrants and refugees. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is saying loud and clear to European leaders that a fresh start on migration can only begin with radical change. No more containment camps at Europe’s borders. No more violence by security forces. No more abandoning people at sea. No more deals to send people fleeing violence back to unsafe countries. The announcement of the new migration pact comes soon after fires destroyed Greece’s Moria refugee camp, the largest refugee camp in Europe. The fires displaced thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers from an overcrowded and dangerous camp, making them homeless once again. MSF has repeatedly warned of the dangers in Moria camp, as almost five years of trapping people in these conditions can only lead to despair and tensions. We have been calling for these people to be evacuated to a safe place on the mainland or to other European countries. Instead, a new camp is under construction.

Now what?” Indigenous communities are among the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. They have historically been left out of the health care system and often must travel long distances to access basic services. They also suffer from a high prevalence of chronic diseases. MSF teams work in 11 indigenous villages in the Aquidauana region, provide support for the local hospital, and conduct mobile home visits focusing on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for COVID-19.

The World Health Organization recognizes this day as an opportunity to highlight the need to provide safe, high-quality medical care as a global health priority. Providing care safely means taking steps to protect patients, as well as the staff who look after them. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. If we can’t keep health workers safe, then they and their patients will be at risk. Every day, MSF works hard to keep our staff protected. We ensure health workers have the personal protective equipment they need, such as gloves, masks, goggles and gowns. Rigorous infection prevention and control (IPC) measures also dramatically reduce risks.

    "description": "After a series of fires destroyed Moria refugee camp earlier this month, thousands of people have been forced to sleep in the streets with almost no humanitarian assistance. Greece and the European Union (EU) are trying to reinforce their dangerous containment policy, which would keep people trapped on Lesbos island in a new camp currently under construction. “What people need and [what] people demand is not to be put in another camp,” said Francisca Bohle Carbonell, a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) nursing activity manager. “What people need and demand, and what we believe in too, is that people must be evacuated. People need to be put in a safe accommodation in Greece or in other European states.” MSF is calling on authorities in Greece and the EU to stop efforts to rebuild a new system of containment on Lesbos and to end the cycle of suffering on the Greek islands. MSF teams on the Greek islands have been treating people harmed by these inhumane policies for the past five years. Thousands of men, women, and children who fled extreme violence and poverty in search of safety have been pushed beyond their limits, with severe consequences for their physical and mental health.

    "description": "Fires broke out and spread throughout Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos on September 8. There were no reports of fatalities, but the camp, which was already overcrowded and dangerous, was almost completely burned down. The following day, more fires were ignited inside the camp, as we see in this video. The blazes again sent people running for safety in all directions, including many children. “People need to be evacuated right now,” said Faris Al-Jawad, a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) communications manager, as he stood by the MSF clinic with the camp burning behind him. “This can’t go on any longer—evacuation of all people to safe accommodation on the mainland or other EU states.”  Some 12,000 people, most of them fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries and seeking safety in the EU, have been forced to remain for years in the camp, where hygiene conditions are abominable and, with COVID-19 cases now confirmed inside the camp, social distancing is impossible.

    "description": "Six months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, the crisis still rages on. There have been more than 24 million confirmed cases and over 821,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, and many more losses as health systems struggle to cope with the demands. In this final episode of our Let’s Talk COVID-19 summer event series, we’ll discuss where we go from here—what challenges and opportunities lie ahead.  \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are responding to COVID-19 in more than 70 countries, while maintaining other essential health services. We’re learning how to adapt to the evolving needs—from dealing with supply shortages to supporting essential workers to strengthening public health promotion. MSF teams have been working with local health authorities and community groups in the US and around the world to help slow the spread of the disease. We’re also taking action to ensure that any tests, treatments, and future vaccines for COVID-19 are safe, affordable, and available for all. \n\nJoin us on Thursday, September 3, for the conclusion of our eight-part summer series. In this episode, we welcome back Kate White, medical technical lead for MSF’s COVID-19 response based in Amsterdam, and Dr. Matt Coldiron, MSF physician and epidemiologist. Together with our host, MSF-USA executive director Avril Benoît, this expert panel will answer your questions about the future of the pandemic. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "After the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Moria refugee camp on September 2, Greek officials have imposed a quarantine that prevents anyone from entering or leaving the camp. This effectively traps people in dangerous conditions. The site is extremely overcrowded, holding 13,000 people in a space designed for 3,000. For months, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and others have been calling for the evacuation of all residents of the camp, located on the island of Lesbos. “Absolutely no one can keep social distance,” says Caroline Willemen, MSF project coordinator. “There are not enough water and sanitation facilities for people to wash their hands on a regular basis.” Most of the people living in the camp are migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers trying to find safety in Europe. More than 200 of them have been identified as particularly at risk for COVID-19 due to their age or underlying medical conditions.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has relaunched lifesaving search and rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean Sea, in partnership with the nongovernmental organization Sea-Watch. During the first week of operations, our teams onboard the vessel Sea-Watch 4 rescued more than 200 people in a 48-hour period from August 22-24. As European Union governments have turned a blind eye to the tragedy that continues to unfold off the coast of Libya, organizations like MSF and Sea-Watch have become the only hope for survival for many migrants and refugees. Men, women, and children fleeing extreme violence, persecution, and poverty in their home countries are routinely caught and held in inhumane detention centers in Libya. If they can escape, many board dangerous, non-seaworthy vessels in an attempt to reach safety in Europe. For many, the likelihood of death at sea is preferable to the horrific conditions in Libya. \"All of us, we are deciding to die in the Mediterranean rather than to live in Libya or to be in prison in Libya,\" says Kemo Kebbeh, a man who was rescued in a previous MSF search and rescue operation in 2019. EU governments are supporting the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept people fleeing for their lives and return them to Libya. More than 6,000 people have been returned so far this year—forced back to face an endless cycle of torture, detention, and abuse.

    "title": "Three Years after the Exodus, the Rohingya Face Even More Uncertainty",
    "description": "Three years ago, starting on August 25, 2017, Myanmar security forces launched a campaign of targeted violence that ultimately drove more than 700,000 Rohingya people out of their homes in Rakhine state and across the border into neighboring Bangladesh. Many of these refugees lost family members and friends during the attacks, saw their homes burned, and witnessed unthinkable atrocities. When they arrived at the camps in Cox’s Bazar, the refugees joined some 200,000 others who had fled previous attacks and were still living in precarious conditions. After three years, conditions in the world’s largest refugee settlement have barely improved, and people are forced to live in overcrowded shelters. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) pediatrician Ferdyoli Porcel says poor living conditions in the camps makes this community more vulnerable to the spread of disease, including skin infections, parasite infections, respiratory infections, and severe pneumonia. Since COVID-19 arrived in the camps in May, the Rohingya have faced even more challenges: fewer medical personnel and services, restricted movements, and stigma in the community around the new disease, which makes people afraid to come for care. With no sense of when they will be able to safely return to their country, many Rohingya people feel like their lives are on hold.

    "title": "\"Housing is health care,\" How COVID-19 is Hurting Homeless New Yorkers",
    "description": "When COVID-19 hit New York City, people were told to stay at home and practice social distancing, but homeless New Yorkers had few safe options. The COVID-19 mortality rate for people staying in homeless shelters is 67% higher than for New Yorkers citywide, according to Coalition for the Homeless, a direct action and advocacy organization. Many people living on the streets were afraid to go to a shelter, and there were suddenly more people who were homeless or housing insecure due to the economic impact of the pandemic. “There was a big surge in need on the streets,” says Dave Giffen, executive director of Coalition for the Homeless. “We just had to ramp up those operations very quickly. We really would not have been able to do so without the help of Doctors Without Borders because there were so many needs that we weren't prepared on our own to meet, like the need for showers and toilets and PPE [personal protective equipment].” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF) helped provide showers, portable toilets, handwashing stations, hygiene kits, clothing, and other essentials for people in Midtown Manhattan and Harlem. Giffen says that COVID-19 has exposed deep systemic problems in the way the city responds to homelessness. “We don't want to go back to normal. Normal was terrible,” he says. “Our only hope now is that seeing how this has played out adds more fuel to the fire to solve these problems on a systemic level.” To find out more about MSF's work supporting people who are homeless or housing insecure during COVID-19, visit https://bit.ly/320JCFJ.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In August 2020, Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, was rocked by a massive explosion that killed more than 150 people and left more than 5,000 injured. Krystel Moussalli, an epidemiologist with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF), was inside the MSF building in Beirut when it happened. The walls were shaking, she said, “and the roof collapsing, and the voices of the people shouting in the streets, and the noise of broken glass. There were feelings of total shock, pain, loss, confusion.” Within days of the explosion, MSF teams were donating medical supplies to organizations including the Lebanese Red Cross and going to door to door to assess people's medical needs. We are currently investigating how best to provide support to the medical system during this extremely tumultuous time. “You hear of collapsed hospitals,” says Moussalli, “hospitals that were totally destroyed, that had to stop their activities, that had to evacuate their patients. And also, people's houses, partly or totally destroyed. People have their lives that have changed as of today, as of this minute.” Read more about the Beirut explosion aftermath: https://bit.ly/2PGqN4K​\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Dedicated staff like Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) infection prevention and control supervisor Souleymane Diarra are working to help people understand the importance of mask-wearing, social-distancing, and hand washing. “Sometimes we have patients who refuse to be hospitalized,” he says. “And there are patients who refuse to wear a mask when they’re in hospital. …But after explaining the illness, we have managed to raise awareness among most of the people.” Read more: https://bit.ly/33E9Ekb\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a disproportionately heavy toll on elderly people living in long-term care facilities, with more than 40 percent of all coronavirus deaths in the US occurring in nursing homes. In Michigan, where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have worked for the past two months, nursing homes have experienced a significant impact from the effects of coronavirus. Essential staff in these facilities play a critical role in preventing the spread of COVID-19, but they’re at risk themselves—and the coronavirus is not the only threat. Nursing home residents and frontline workers alike face extremely high levels of stress and grief as they struggle to respond to the pandemic. “We were terrified, but we had 100 souls counting on us and we couldn't just walk away and lock ourselves in our home like everybody else was told to do,” said Connie Flanigan, director of nursing at Advantage Wayne in Michigan. “We had to figure out a way to get out here and take care of these souls.” MSF worked in Detroit to support and empower staff and residents at nursing homes and adult foster care facilities with on-site training, tailored guidance on improving infection prevention and control practices, and wellness workshops.

    "description": "Elderly and homeless people are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 in New York City and around the world. During the pandemic, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has worked with Project FIND, an elder services agency in New York that provides housing and social services to older adults. MSF supported Project FIND’s efforts to keep their facilities safe from the coronavirus in New York. The organization runs three residential buildings and four senior centers in the city, manages a homeless in-reach program with shower services, and provides case management services, including psychiatric and medical care. These services have continued throughout the pandemic—and are now more important than ever. \"We don't always know who is homeless. And part of that is because they have access to services like this,\" says Mark Jennings, associate executive director of Project FIND. \"For them to have dignity and to have work. Being able to take a shower in the morning—so that when I do sit on the train, people don't run away from me. And people treat me as if I exist, that I'm not invisible.

    "description": "More than 2,000 asylum seekers sheltering in a camp in Matamoros, at the Mexican border with Texas, are now dealing with even more fear and uncertainty as the number of COVID-19 cases rises in Mexico and the government fails to take decisive action. These people are living in tents packed closely together, unable to practice social distancing and with little access to water and sanitation or routine medical care, let alone COVID-19 services. Meanwhile, the US closed its border with Mexico and cut off access to the asylum process in March. In response, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has increased activities in the Matamoros camp, providing mental health and medical services and health information about COVID-19. “People are responding positively to the advice and the infection prevention measures we bring,” says health promoter Ismael López. MSF is calling on the Mexican government to find safe solutions for vulnerable people at its border and the US to end its harmful practice of denying protection to people fleeing extreme violence in their countries.

    "description": "Brownsville, Brooklyn is among the New York City neighborhoods hardest hit by the coronavirus. This comes as no surprise to local activists, who have long witnessed the disproportionately heavy toll of death and disease on communities of color. Black and Latino people make up about 95 percent of the population here. Nationwide, these communities have been three times as likely to get COVID-19 as white people and twice as likely to die from it, according to recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) partnered with the Brownsville Multi-Service Family Health Center (BMS) to run a Brownsville, Brookyln, COVID-19 testing facility during the first wave of the pandemic. Providing access to testing has been crucial but came with serious obstacles. \"Some of the challenges we face are perceptions that are historical,\" says Renee Muir, director of development and community relations at BMS, \"that there's a deliberate infection plan that's happening, and it's population control, so don't go get tested.\" Infamous cases of abuse like the Tuskegee experiment, in which some 400 black men with syphilis were denied treatment for decades as part of a federally funded study, have eroded community trust in the medical system. BMS works at the grassroots level to address the questions people have about the coronavirus in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and eliminate barriers to care. They also respond to an array of related needs—from education to nutrition. Muir says that the pandemic is a wake-up call for health providers to address the underlying conditions that contribute to racial disparities in health care.

But despite indicators of a large number of cases in the area, relatively few people are coming to the hospital for care. Many Yemenis are not seeking treatment for COVID-19 symptoms because they fear contracting the virus in hospitals. Rumors about patient mistreatment at health facilities have also fostered fear and stigma.

    "title": "10th Ebola Outbreak in DRC Declared Over (June 2020 Update)",
    "description": "On June 25, 2020, the government of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) declared the country's tenth outbreak of Ebola over. With 3,470 cases and 2,287 deaths it was the country's largest ever and the second-largest on record anywhere, after the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016. The last recovered Ebola patient was discharged from the Beni Ebola treatment center in North Kivu province on May 14, and, after no new reported cases for 42 consecutive days (which is twice the length of the disease's incubation period), the outbreak was officially declared over. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams had been working alongside the Ministry of Health to respond to the Ebola outbreak in the northeast of the country since 2018, and in this video our staff at projects across DRC celebrate the news. While we are hugely relieved, our teams remain vigilant—the virus is still present in western DRC’s Equateur province, and just one new case could trigger a new outbreak.

    "description": "Patients who are seriously ill with COVID-19 cannot be treated without oxygen, but providing enough oxygen to meet the needs has been a major challenge from the beginning. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is responding to the coronavirus pandemic in more than 70 countries around the world and working to provide oxygen for our patients with COVID-19. At our COVID-19 project in Aden, Yemen, our teams use 250 bottles of oxygen a day, a huge but necessary expense for treating our patients. A more cost-effective and efficient alternative—oxygen plants—are in use or on the way to a number of MSF projects, including in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Haiti. Our team in Aden is also awaiting delivery of an oxygen plant that can provide enough oxygen for 30 patients at a time. But COVID-19 has caused additional challenges: the machines are in high demand not readily available, and when they are sent from China, they must be quarantined at every stage of the shipping process. Providing oxygen will continue to be a major challenge for our COVID-19 projects around the world.

    "description": "Right now, all over the world, our teams are seeing women and girls cut off from the essential health services they need due to the devastating secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic—including closures of health facilities, cuts in services, and supply shortages. Contraception and safe abortion care are rarely recognized as essential, even though they help prevent one of the biggest causes of maternal mortality: unsafe abortion. Every day, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams treat women and girls who've had to resort to unsafe methods to terminate pregnancy because they had no access to proper care. \"During these extraordinary times, it's even more critical that women and girls have access to the health services that they need,\" says Dr. Manisha Kumar, head of MSF's task force for safe abortion care. Our teams around the world are working hard to keep essential programs for women and girls running. \"In some places, this means giving women longer refills of their birth control pills to avoid unnecessary visits to the clinic. And in other places, this means working with community health workers and local women's groups to provide abortion medications in the community,\" says Dr. Kumar. Governments, health systems, and providers must ensure that these services remain open and accessible to women and girls. Contraception and safe abortion care are essential health care, during COVID-19 and always.

    "description": "In the southwestern Florida community of Immokalee, tens of thousands of migrant farmworkers and other essential workers have had no choice but to stay on the job amid the coronavirus pandemic. Across the United States, farmworkers are at particularly high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to crowded living and transportation conditions, and limited ability to prevent infection at the workplace. Long workdays and language barriers often keep them from reaching the health services they need. To respond to these needs, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) launched a public health education campaign in collaboration with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and ran free, mobile COVID-19 testing clinics with the Collier County Department of Health and the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida. At-risk people like the community in Immokalee urgently need free COVID-19 testing at convenient times and locations, dedicated isolation facilities, and affordable and accessible health services.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs two clinics to treat non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like high blood pressure and diabetes in Irbid, Jordan. Since the coronavirus pandemic reached the country in March, our teams have had to adapt operations quickly in order to ensure continuity of care. NCDs are a major cause of death in Jordan and it is essential that patients continue to receive their medications during the pandemic. MSF adapted quickly to the strict and effective lockdown put in place by the Jordanian government by delivering medications to patients. “This required quite a big switch, we had to have a lot more drivers available, a lot more staff available to go out on delivery and pharmacy had to work very hard to prepare large numbers of medications all at once,” said MSF medical activity manager Rowena Neville. Once MSF implemented infection prevention measures, teams were able to deliver medications to 3,400 patients during the lockdown.

    "description": "On April 15, a boat carrying Rohingya refugees was denied disembarkation in Malaysia, leaving 500 people who had fled squalid, overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh stranded at sea for two months with little access to food or water. Citing concerns about the spread of COVID-19, Malaysian officials have tightened border controls and barred a number of boats from disembarking in recent months. After the boat was rescued by the Bangladeshi coastguard, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sent medical teams to assess peoples’ needs and provide emergency medical care and mental health support. “They told us how their relatives had died before their eyes after drinking sea water, and how they had been mistreated,” said Muriel Boursier, MSF head of mission in Bangladesh. Other boats could still be stranded at sea, denied safe disembarkation by Malaysia and other countries in the region. On May 6, MSF wrote an open letter to Malaysian authorities expressing our support for safe disembarkation and urging them not to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to push vulnerable people back to sea.

Doctors Without Border/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have begun providing medical and psychological care in shelters, hostels, hotels, and community kitchens around the city, as well as along the migration route through Mexico. MSF’s direct contact with people allows the team to respond to questions and address some of the myths and misinformation surrounding COVID-19. In this video we hear from MSF doctor Fabiola Hernández: “Sometimes the [health] information tends to be inaccessible … or it has become very distorted.” MSF teams also offer practical advice to staff, volunteers, visitors, and residents in these facilities on ways to prevent transmission of the virus. MSF logistics supervisor Yolanda Rábago says it’s vital to reach out to people on the move. “Independent of COVID, they are people who are looking to have a better life, a decent life. And regardless of whether there is a pandemic, people are going to keep moving, people are going to keep looking for help. We must not forget that.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are working with families living in Burj Al-Barajneh refugee camp in Beirut to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The camp was originally established in 1949 to shelter displaced Palestinians and has grown into a densely crowded settlement to accommodate new waves of refugees, including people uprooted by the war in Syria. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are reaching out to people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19—such as the elderly and those with chronic diseases. These teams are training families how to practice “shielding,” which involves designating and maintaining safe zones in their home or neighborhood to provide extra protection to vulnerable individuals. Maryam, a 90-year-old Syrian woman who lives with her family in Burj Al-Barajneh camp, chose a corner of their home to be her safe area. “They clean it well to get rid of all the viruses, and they clean the floor next to it very well too. Shielding protects me and it protects my family,” she says. As of June 9, 2020, Lebanon has had 1,350 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 30 deaths.

    "description": "A resurgence of violence in Ituri province, in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has forced more than 200,000 people out of their homes in the last two months. They join more than a million others living in inadequate conditions where they are particularly vulnerable to communicable diseases. MSF has been providing medical care and running water and sanitation activities in 34 places where displaced people are living, and now teams are also working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in these areas. “If COVID-19 reaches the camps, the situation could be catastrophic,” says Abdourahmane Bodian, MSF health promotion supervisor. “We are asking people to use preventive measures but it's difficult for them because no one here has caught COVID-19 yet, so they don't believe the disease exists. That's why our health promotion activities are helpful.” MSF is calling on the international community to respond to the increasingly dire situation in Ituri.  \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "In Aden, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff are working around the clock at the only dedicated COVID-19 treatment center in southern Yemen. But people are still dying—many are arriving too late to be saved, and we know that many more are simply not coming at all. The city’s health system has been decimated by five years of war and lacks the means to respond to the outbreak. There is no money to pay health staff, little personal protective equipment, and few tests for the virus. MSF is doing everything we can, but the team is facing significant challenges. “We do not have a lot of means to treat the people apart from giving them oxygen,” says Thierry Durand, MSF project coordinator in Aden. We are asking the United Nations and donor states to do more to help the response.

We’re working to reduce the burden on the city’s health centers by treating non-critical patients transferred to our facility from Tijuana General Hospital. Tijuana’s population includes many asylum seekers, migrants, and people deported from the US—many of whom are homeless and don’t have access to adequate health care. Mental health officers provide counseling sessions by phone to recovering patients, helping them to process their experiences. “The fear that they’d never see their family again, the anxiety of not being able to breathe—some patients cry during the phone call,” said MSF counselor Lucia Samayoa.

    "description": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, shortages of medical supplies—especially personal protective equipment, or PPE—have led to spikes in prices and made it challenging for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to respond quickly to the spread of the virus while continuing our regular medical activities. “Everyone in the world wants the same products right now,” says Steffie Konijn, MSF operational procurement officer. “We will have to decide, with the limited stocks we have, which countries have the most need for these supplies.” We’re doing all we can to meet the needs in the more than 70 countries where we work. But a global crisis on this scale requires global solidarity—we all need to ensure that health workers have the supplies they need to treat patients safely.  Read more at https://bit.ly/2X4hkZB\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n[Lower thirds] Steffie Konijn\nOperational Procurement Officer\nSTEFFIE:\nThe chain starts in the field where they have their needs.\nSTEFFIE:\nWe receive all the orders from the field for medical supplies, but also logistical supplies. And it all kind of starts with the supplier. If their factories are closed they cannot make anymore, for example surgical masks.\n[Lower thirds] Filipe Garcia\nField Logistic Coordinator\nFILIPE:\nWe are an emergency organization and we are used to emergencies.\nFILIPE:\nThis corona crisis came out of nowhere. From one day to another we had to basically transform and adapt our supply chain. In terms of a COVID response, this is being at the moment being prioritized, due to the needs. If you face restrictions in supplies, that will eventually affect all kinds of surgical interventions and other kinds of interventions. \n[TEXT] MSF operates worldwide in more than 70 countries\n[Lower thirds] Alice Jurjens\nTransport Officer\nALICE: There's a restriction in cargo space availability.\nALICE: Everyone wants to book their cargo on the plane. To organize a charter is a way more expensive than to send regular cargo.\n[TEXT] Maastricht Aachen airport\nThe Netherlands\nSTEFFIE: The challenge there is that everyone in the world wants the same products right now. We receive the orders from all of our countries. And we will have to decide with the limited stocks we have which countries have the most need for these supplies.\nFILIPE: Another challenge that we forget is the local transport. Moving things from the capital where the things arrive, to our actual project activities is challenging. \nALICE: COVID-19 is putting us on the spot, basically, because everyone's facing these types of restrictions in the end. If the regular option is no option, we try to be creative. You just hope you can get everything on time and that you can make it happen. \n[TEXT] Since the start of the pandemic, competition for medical supplies has led to huge price rises and widespread shortages.\nA global crisis requires global solidarity. MSF needs to ensure health workers and patients are protected and treated.\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Brazil is now the country with the third highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide, and there are fears that it will become the new epicenter of the pandemic. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are responding in Vaz Logo, Rio de Janeiro, where many people lack access to public health services. MSF activities include carrying out health promotion in communities, triage and basic medical consultations, as well as distributing hygiene kits. The teams are focused on reaching homeless people, who are among the most vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19. In this video, we hear from health promotion coordinator Lia Gomes and physician Ana Maria Amorim as they describe the challenges facing homeless people. Many people don’t have a safe place for self isolation, and there is also widespread fear and denial in this particularly vulnerable community. “That is very hard. They deny it. Fear. A lot of fear. They have difficulties at all levels, starting with not being able to isolate,” says Ana. MSF is urging those who are able to remain physically distant to stay home to slow the spread of the new coronavirus and to protect the most vulnerable people.

Many patients were killed—the exact number is still being investigated—and more were injured. A Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) midwife was killed, as were two young boys. The maternity was a referral center, providing care for complicated deliveries and sick newborns since 2014.  “It’s shocking,” said Frederic Bonnot, MSF’s head of programs in Afghanistan. “We know this area has suffered attacks in the past, but no one could believe they would attack a maternity. They came to kill the mothers.” MSF condemns this senseless act of cowardly violence and stands in solidarity with the Afghan people.

MSF has seen first-hand the impact of scarce supplies and high prices of essential medical tools in our work caring for people with HIV, treating patients with tuberculosis, vaccinating children against pneumonia, and much more. Any patents on the medical tools needed to prevent and treat this new life-threatening disease will mean that only the wealthiest will have access to them. That means the coronavirus pandemic will take much longer to end, and many more people will get sick and die. Pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies must commit to not seek nor enforce patents. If they won’t do the right thing, then governments can take action. Let’s make sure that everyone, everywhere will have access to testing, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19.

    "description": "Bangladesh is home to the world’s largest refugee settlement, with nearly one million Rohingya people living in crowded conditions with little protection from heavy storms and waves of infectious disease. They are now facing new threats from the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams at Kutupalong hospital, in Cox’s Bazar, are adapting to meet the challenges of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. In this video, head nurse Liyana Winchell walks us through the hospital and describes some of the quick and creative preparations for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. MSF teams are training staff on how to use personal protective equipment, adding hand washing points, and building an isolation ward, among other urgent activities. We’re also trying to maintain existing medical programs for Rohingya refugees and local communities, an enormous challenge amid a global public health crisis.

They are often a patient’s first point of care, and in many communities they are the only care provider. Nurses play a critical role in every aspect of health care, including health promotion, disease prevention, primary and community care, as well as emergency services. Right now, they're at the forefront of efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. To mark International Nurses’ Day on May 12, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is saying “thank you” to our nurses around the world for their tireless work and fierce dedication. “I prioritize the interests of the patients over my own safety,” says one MSF nurse working in Yemen. “So, I like to help them as much as I can.

    "description": "As COVID-19 starts to spread in Liberia—as of May 8, there were 189 confirmed cases and 20 deaths, and a state of emergency has been called—it brings up memories of the West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015. Ebola devastated Liberia, infecting an estimated 10,678 people and killing 4,810. In this video we hear from MSF Nurse Anesthetist, Sandra Gordon-Mai Smith, “I’m afraid that if COVID-19 spreads like Ebola in 2014, it’s going to be even worse.” Sandra responded to the Ebola outbreak with MSF before joining our Bardnesville Junction pediatric hospital. Sandra states, “I’m always willing to get on the frontline to fight any deadly disease. I have my experience from the Ebola [outbreak], and I can go with the same experience with COVID-19.” MSF is responding to the coronavirus disease in Liberia by doing health promotion and hygiene awareness in communities to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and distributing soap to roughly 77,000 households in the poorest areas of Monrovia, Liberia.

    "description": "While the world is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is warning that efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus should not interfere with the prevention of measles and other killer diseases. In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), more than 6,600 children have already died from a measles outbreak that began in 2019 and is now the world’s largest. As of January 2020, there were more than 50,000 cases in the country. MSF is running a mass vaccination campaign in Mongala province, in the north. “We hope that with this vaccination that we have launched, we will cut the chain of transmission,” says Dr. Philippe Mpabenda, MSF’s intervention manager, “so that measles cases stop and can no longer plunge communities into mourning.” MSF has seen firsthand that other health crises do not stop during emergencies like COVID-19. Governments and donors must not reduce support for vaccinations, malnutrition prevention and treatment, and other urgent medical needs. We cannot allow the response to the COVID-19 pandemic to fuel other health crises.  \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

In early April, the MSF team in Timergara district headquarters (DHQ) set up a triage area where more than 1,000 visitors to the hospital are screened every day for COVID-19. People with suspected or confirmed cases of the disease wait in an MSF-built isolation unit to receive treatment, or are referred for intensive care or sent home according to their needs. “It will help us to actively identify cases, it will help us to reduce transmission at community level, and, most importantly, it will help us to reduce the impact on the patients and health care workers who are most vulnerable to this infection,” explains MSF project medical referent Said Raziq. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pakistan reached 13,915 as of April 28, with 292 reported deaths.

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) operates projects throughout these countries and we are extremely concerned about how the outbreak will affect health systems, most of which are not well equipped to treat severe cases of the disease. Supply chain interruptions, global shortages of personal protective equipment, and limited access to health services could hinder both the response to the pandemic and regular, essential medical activities. “During this outbreak, women will keep delivering, children will keep falling sick, people will still require their medications for their chronic diseases,” says Abubakr Bakri, MSF health advisor in East Africa. People living in displacement camps and migrants who were on the move or are in detention are particularly vulnerable. “We in MSF are doing our best,” says Bakri, to prepare our medical staff and to support countries’ national health staff and facilities. “The only way to combat [COVID-19] is to work hand in hand.” Read more at https://bit.ly/2SrFEBJ\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Even under normal circumstances, parents in many parts of the world struggle to get their children the vaccinations they need to protect against deadly infections such as measles, whooping cough, and diarrheal diseases. But as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the world, national governments and nongovernmental organizations alike are struggling to contain its spread while preserving essential health care services like routine immunization. Unlike COVID-19, measles can be prevented with a vaccine—but only if children receive it. The Measles and Rubella Initiative estimates that more than 117 million children in 37 countries will miss out on measles vaccines because mass-vaccination campaigns and other immunization services will be suspended due to the pandemic. How do you make sure kids get the vaccines they need while also protecting them from COVID-19? In this video, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) vaccines policy advisor Kate Elder reflects on the dilemma that’s keeping her up at night.

Those that need to stay refrigerated add another level of complexity, but they are well worth the trouble. Vaccines are an essential part of lifesaving medical care for everyone, everywhere. During World Immunization Week, MSF is reminding people that vaccines can save lives—but only if they are made available and affordable.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams witness every day why vaccinations are so important. Right now, for example, in Democratic Republic of Congo, MSF is supporting a mass vaccination campaign to fight a measles outbreak that has infected more than 300,000 people—and killed more than 6,200. Once an outbreak has started, people come eagerly—sometime walking for days—to get themselves or their children vaccinated. The growth of the anti-vaccine movement in many wealthy countries is striking compared with the obvious needs in many of the places we work. “When you see the disease, you will never forget to be vaccinated,” says Myriam Henkens, international medical coordinator for MSF. “When people don’t see the disease, they forget about the risk.” Today, the coronavirus pandemic has triggered global anxiety as well as hope for a vaccine that could protect us. In the meantime we have effective vaccines against many other killer diseases, from measles to pneumonia to diphtheria. During World Immunization Week, MSF is reminding people that vaccines can save lives—but only if they are made available and affordable.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides vital medical and mental care for refugees trapped on the Greek island of Lesbos. MSF midwife Eleonora Selmi is part of the team responding to the threats presented by the new coronavirus. Originally from Italy—among the countries hardest hit by the pandemic—she describes what it’s like to be providing care far from home. “I feel part of this huge effort in every part of the world. And this is the most important thing because the virus doesn't have limits and crosses all the borders. So does solidarity,” she says. MSF teams have been working in Lesbos since 2016 to care for refugees living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. They are now extremely vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. We are calling for the immediate evacuation of those most at risk.

Here, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is focused on assisting those most vulnerable to the spread of the disease–including people who are homeless, migrants, refugees, drug users, and the elderly. Teams are running mobile clinics, doing community outreach, and partnering with local authorities and organizations to help people at risk. “A patient in critical condition here dies on the street if we don't identify him early on, since he will not be able to call an ambulance to be transported to the hospital,” said Ana Letícia Nery, MSF’s project coordinator. MSF teams are also in Boa Vista, in the north of the country near Venezuela, where they are providing COVID-19 services to Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers who live in overcrowded spaces with little access to food, water, and health care.

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are extremely concerned about the conditions facing people displaced by a surge of violence in South Sudan, and the disruption of vital humanitarian aid caused by the new coronavirus pandemic. In this video, MSF field coordinator Håvard Høe warns that “more conflict might be coming” in this eastern region around Pibor town. MSF is trying to prepare for the threat of more violence, as well as for the potential spread of the coronavirus. South Sudan had reported four confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of April 14, however the wider impacts of the pandemic are already hampering operations. \"It is hitting supply lines, it is hitting the movement of our staff,\" says Høe. \"We fear that the needs we see here and now are becoming secondary in the eyes of the world.\" A recent outbreak of inter-communal violence in the east has pushed thousands of men, women, and children from their homes, and people have fled en masse to an area near the United Nations peacekeeping site in Pibor. MSF has set up an emergency project there to ensure medical care, and existing MSF facilities in Pibor and nearby Lankien and Pieri are also seeing high numbers of wounded patients. The violence has been brutal, says MSF nurse Regina Marko. \"They attack women and kids, and also old men and old ladies, even if they cannot go to war. They come and they shoot them where they are.\" Read more at https://bit.ly/2VB8qAG\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Intense bombing and shelling in the northwestern region of the country have uprooted almost one million people in the last four months, many of them now crowded along the Turkish border. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have adapted regular medical activities in Idlib province so that we can continue to help displaced people while also guarding against the threat of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. In this video, Cristian Reynders, MSF project coordinator for northwestern Syria, warns that medical humanitarian aid can only be part of the solution: “Everything that is recommended today … to slow down the spread of the virus cannot be implemented in Idlib. How do you ask people to stay at home? Where is their home?” MSF is calling on Turkish authorities to facilitate the urgent transit of essential supplies and access for staff into northwestern Syria to scale up in the face of this new emergency.

    "description": "More than one million Rohingya people live in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh—the largest refugee settlement on earth. They have survived horrific violence and abuse in their home country of Myanmar, only to find themselves trapped in miserable conditions with little hope for the future. They are exposed to the spread of infectious diseases, now including the threat of COVID-19. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which provides medical and mental health care to Rohingya refugees, collaborated with British artist Richard Swarbrick to create this rotoscope animation, accompanied by a special version of the song “Give Me Hope” by the band Three Laws. This stunning video shows the human face of a mass exodus, illuminating the experiences of Rohingya men, women, and children who have endured so much suffering and yet persevere.\n \nImmediately following the explosion of targeted violence by Myanmar security forces in August 2017, there was widespread international media attention to the plight of the Rohingya forced to flee. More than two-and-a-half years later, many of these people still live in the same flimsy bamboo structures as when they first arrived in Bangladesh, and conditions in the camps have not improved. People often get sick from living in close quarters with poor water and sanitation services, in an area prone to flooding and cyclones. Facing work and travel restrictions, Rohingya refugees rely on humanitarian aid to survive. These stateless people are among the most persecuted minority groups in the world. We must not forget them.

Cases of COVID-19 in Burkina Faso are now complicating efforts to respond to a massive humanitarian emergency there. Some 780,000 people have been uprooted by violence and are living in extremely poor conditions. Here, a displaced man in Burkina Faso recounts what happened to him during an attack by an armed group on his village: “They came to our district and looted, burned down shops, and stole our cattle. We saw them commit all kinds of violence. Then we decided to flee to Titao to save our lives. It’s thanks to the aid we’ve received that we’re still alive.” Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have scaled up our response to this crisis, but the COVID-19 pandemic is making it more challenging for us and other aid organizations to reach displaced people. In addition to basic needs, improving hygiene and infection prevention measures are critical to avoid the spread of coronavirus.

    "description": "Nearly a million people have been uprooted in northwestern Syria in just the last few months, after fleeing the intense bombardment of the region by the Syrian government and its Russian allies. Many of these people have been displaced multiple times over the course of the war, now entering its tenth year. They have been forced to take refuge under plastic sheeting in the winter cold, with limited access to food, water, and medical care. These conditions make them especially vulnerable to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has adapted its regular medical activities in Idlib province so that we can continue to help displaced people while also guarding against the risks of infection from the new coronavirus. “People tended to gather in crowds around the [mobile clinic] trucks, but we told them it was important to keep their distance,” says Abdel Karim Mustafa, an MSF health promoter in Syria. Abdel’s team tries to encourage social distancing and sticks to the rule that people must stand six feet apart while in line. MSF is also helping vital medical facilities still operating in this war-torn area to strengthen infection prevention and control measures and prepare for COVID-19.

    "description": "Migrants in Belgium and across the world have neither homes to shelter in, nor access to health care systems during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This leaves them unable to comply with government directives and extremely vulnerable to the disease. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing coronavirus care for vulnerable people in Brussels, elsewhere in Europe, and around the world. “It is frightening because we don’t understand it,” says Leah Feldman, the medical focal point for the COVID-19 response in Brussels. Feldman has previously worked in Ebola and other emergency projects. What we can do now, she says, “is wash our hands and try to protect those who are most vulnerable.” Find out more about MSF’s response at https://bit.ly/2Uuthq7\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "How can you wash your hands properly when you don't even have clean water or soap? How can you maintain social distancing in a cramped refugee camp? Governments all over the world are urging people to take immediate steps to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Yet in Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, most refugees and asylum seekers are not able to take basic safety precautions. Access to water and soap are limited, and families of five or six have to sleep in small tents. The camp is dangerously overcrowded. Marco Sandrone, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) field coordinator in Moria camp, describes how MSF is adapting its clinic to care for people with suspected cases of COVID-19 while continuing to safely provide primary health services to our patients. MSF is calling for people trapped in these squalid camps to be evacuated immediately--and this is especially urgent now that they are at high risk for COVID-19 transmission.

    "title": "\"Now I've recovered\": A TB Survivor Shares His Story",
    "description": "On World Tuberculosis (TB) Day we bring you a hopeful story from John Jimis, a 28-year-old South Sudanese refugee who’s recovering from TB—an infectious disease that's deadly when left untreated. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing TB diagnosis and treatment for refugees, internally displaced people, and local residents in Sudan, where Jimis is living, for the last few years. New, innovative tools are now making it easier to diagnose TB better and faster. But lack of access to a correct diagnosis is a big obstacle. When Jimis first began feeling ill and went to the hospital, he was misdiagnosed and given the wrong medication. After making no progress, he said, “My relatives took me to MSF’s hospital in Al Kashafa.”  There, he was diagnosed with TB and put on the proper medication. He began to gain weight and started feeling better. “Now I’ve recovered,” he said. “I can walk easily, and I’m fit and healthy.” \n\nTB is especially dangerous for displaced people in conflict areas like South Sudan, where violence often pushes people to flee multiple times. When TB treatment is disrupted, people can develop drug resistance, which makes the disease much more difficult to treat. The new coronavirus pandemic poses additional threats.\n\nWith the first coronavirus cases being confirmed in East Africa, MSF is concerned that the response to the outbreak could overwhelm health systems in countries like Sudan and South Sudan, and jeopardize access to TB diagnosis and treatment. We are also concerned about how coronavirus could affect patients with chronic diseases like TB and HIV.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The latest news on the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is that the world's second-largest outbreak of the disease ever recorded may finally be coming to an end. On March 3, 2020, the last patient with a confirmed case of Ebola was discharged from a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Ebola treatment center in Beni, in North Kivu province. If there are no new cases, the epidemic could be declared over by mid-April. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends waiting two full incubation periods—42 days—after the last person tests negative a second time before declaring the end of the outbreak.\n\nWhile this news update marks a milestone moment in the outbreak, it is too soon to celebrate. And even when the outbreak is officially declared over, should we celebrate then? Ever since the outbreak was first declared on August 1, 2018, there has been a massive international response—known as the Riposte—aimed at bringing it under control. Here, Trish Newport, emergency coordinator for MSF’s Ebola response in DRC, looks at some of the problems associated with the response and warns that we must learn from our mistakes to better manage future outbreaks.\n\nFor the latest updates on MSF's response to Ebola in DRC visit: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/countries/democratic-republic-congo\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

He also points out that while our survival instinct might push us to be more selfish, we can only get through this crisis by looking out for each other: “It’s not only about protecting yourself….

    "description": "Sister Mercy Mandizvo is a nurse mentor working with a cervical cancer prevention and treatment project run by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Gutu, Zimbabwe. The country has among the highest rates of cervical cancer in the world, and many women die because they seek care too late. Sister Mercy is passionate about helping women get access to the care they need. MSF supports six rural health centers in Gutu, offering cervical cancer screening and treatment. If staff identify pre-cancerous lesions on a patient's cervix, they can use cryotherapy—a freezing technique—to remove them. Women who need surgical procedures—including, in some cases, a hysterectomy—are referred to one of two district hospitals. \"Patients are always afraid because of fear of the unknown,\" Mandizvo says. \"With time, those who have undergone the procedure, when they go to talk to other clients out there, they will be more eager to come in, now with less anxiety.\" Read more about cervical cancer and MSF's work to help more women survive at: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/no-woman-should-die-cervical-cancer\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "A Cervical Cancer Survivor Tells Her Story",
    "description": "Rumbidzai Mushayi had never received a cervical cancer screening until she'd already developed the disease. In Zimbabwe, where she lives, cervical cancer care is not readily available. Of the approximately 311,000 women who died from cervical cancer in 2018, more than 85 percent of them lived in low- and middle-income countries. These are unnecessary deaths, because cervical cancer is both preventable and treatable. Mushayi was eventually able to get the medical care she needed to survive, with assistance from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). But, she warns, “one must not delay to seek treatment. Do not wait to be ferried by a wheel barrow or an ox-drawn cart to the hospital.\" She worried about having a surgical procedure, but is glad she did it. “The pain has eased, and I can now sleep peacefully,” she says.

    "description": "Cervical cancer is preventable and treatable—so why did 300,000 women die of this disease in 2018? Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus—HPV—a common sexually transmitted infection. Cervical cancer can be prevented with a vaccine, but many low- and middle-income countries can't afford to provide it. Pre-cancerous lesions or tumors can be removed if they are found early enough. But regular screenings and prompt treatment remain out of reach for many. A woman's chances of survival should not depend on where she lives.

Millions of people depend on humanitarian assistance for survival, including more than three and a half million people who have been displaced by the fighting. MSF medical projects in Yemen are among our biggest worldwide. MSF worked in 13 hospitals and health centers and provided support to more than 20 health facilities across 12 governorates in 2018. MSF facilities have been targeted and bombed multiple times over the course of the war and MSF teams have rebuilt and repaired hospitals, ERs and many other medical facilities. Despite the challenges, MSF continues to work and provide lifesaving medical care in Yemen where others can’t or won’t. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "It’s been quite an adventure to bring advanced solar technology to power two hospitals in remote parts of South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. But it’s well worth it. This will \"change health care for many of our patients,” says Dr. Pacifique Kapimbu, director of Kigulube general hospital, supported by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “Before, we even used to operate in the dark.” Having a reliable source of energy in the middle of the jungle means tens of thousands of people can now get the lifesaving care they need.\n\nIn an emergency room, saving lives often depends on having a steady power supply. Although solar energy has been around for decades, earlier systems were impractical for powering remote facilities in rough terrain. The new installations at the hospitals each consists of 100 solar panels and seven batteries capable of storing enough energy to run the facilities for two full days. The panels traveled by boat, truck, and helicopter across several countries before being hand carried by porters up into the kills of South Kivu.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Under the so-called U.S. Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), they get no protection at all. The U.S. is sending these vulnerable people back to extremely dangerous places in Mexico and Central America. Artist Carrie Hawks paints a picture of life under threat from all sides, as individuals are at risk of gang violence, detention, and deportation. Many of them also suffer from physical injuries and psychological trauma. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have treated thousands of people along the migration route through Central America and Mexico. The medical evidence points to high levels of violence and ill treatment suffered by migrants and refugees in their home countries, along the migration route, and in the custody of U.S. and Mexican authorities. We've seen first-hand how the MPP traps people in danger.

    "description": "Venezuelans continue to migrate to Colombia, where they hope to find the essentials they can no longer find in their own country—including medical care, adequate food, and jobs. But once they arrive, their struggles continue. Most Venezuelans cannot find legal work and end up sleeping in the streets or in makeshift shelters. And medical care provided by the Colombian national health system is limited, which is why Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working in different locations along the Colombian-Venezuela border to offer medical and mental health services. \"For us, it’s very important to mention the saturation of the Colombian health system,\" said MSF coordinator in Arauca department, Sebastián García, \"and the need of support from the international community to cover this gap, both for the migrants and also, of course, for its own citizens.\"\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The biggest measles outbreak in a decade is raging in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The disease is responsible for more than 6,000 deaths in the past year alone, most of them children. Patients, especially in rural areas, face both geographic and financial barriers to care. \n \nIn response, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams provide drugs, transportation, and treatment. For example, in Kongo Central, one of the outbreak’s current hotspots, MSF teams offer patient care, support the local health care system, and participate in disease surveillance activities. In 2019, MSF treated more than 50,000 people for measles in DRC and vaccinated 816,000 children.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "\"The Care My Patients Need\": Local Health Workers Driving Change in South Sudan",
    "description": "In South Sudan, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) serves some 1.5 million people who would otherwise have very little access to quality health care. But a lack of trained medical professionals and basic diagnostic tools complicates matters. Medical personnel generally rely on observed and reported symptoms—and a certain amount of educated guesswork—to make a diagnosis. If an X-ray is needed, it could be a long and bumpy drive along an unpaved road, or even a flight, to the nearest working machine.\n\nTo address this problem, MSF is implementing point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). This innovation compacts a traditionally bulky technology and makes it accessible in the most remote locations, where non-specialist clinicians can use it directly at the patient’s bedside. In this video report, we follow Ezibon, clinical officer at MSF’s Agok Hospital in South Sudan, as he learns to use this technology and reflects on the transformational impact it has on the quality of care he provides to his patients. “One of the strengths of MSF is our locally hired staff, [who] are the vast majority of our clinicians,” says Dr. Adi Nadimpalli, the MSF medic training Ezibon and other colleagues across South Sudan to use POCUS. “They’re incredibly talented, incredibly brilliant, […and] they can now have greater independence and are empowered to make more clinical decisions on their own.”\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "Everyone Should Know the Facts About Abortion",
    "description": "One in four pregnancies ends in induced abortion. That means that, chances are, someone you know has had an abortion. But because there is so much stigma and shame around abortion, it can be difficult for people to talk about freely, let alone share their experiences and learn from each other. \n\nDespite the stigma, abortion is a part of people’s lives and a key component of reproductive health care. It’s essential that health care workers, humanitarian workers—and everyone for that matter—know the basics about abortion. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has teamed up with HowToUseAbortionPill.org to create a free, open-source, evidence-based online course on medication abortion, or abortion with pills. Our goal is to ensure that everyone has access to factual, scientifically accurate information about abortion. \n\nWe are launching this course on the third anniversary of reinstatement and expansion of the Global Gag Rule, a U.S. policy that prohibits health care providers who receive U.S. funding overseas from even speaking about abortion. If they do, they could lose their U.S. funding. Health workers are relied upon to provide thorough, evidence-based medical information, and now they’ve been silenced in the places where that information is needed the most. \n\nBoth MSF and HowToUseAbortionPill.org do not take funding from the U.S. government and are not directly affected by the Global Gag Rule. This means we have an even greater obligation to speak out about safe abortion care and stand in solidarity with people by providing accurate sexual and reproductive health information around the world.

MSF initially opened the BMRC in 2017 to care for people wounded in the war to retake Iraqi cities from the Islamic State. When the protests began and the need for trauma care spiked again, MSF expanded the capacity to meet the needs. At the BMRC, patients receive early physiotherapy and medical rehabilitation, in addition to psychological support to help them adjust to their new realities.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Both public and private hospitals and clinics don't have the funding to provide free care.

    "description": "“They just picked me up in the street; I had only the clothes on my back. I spent five days in prison. They do not care; they do not want to know your condition...and then they throw you out into the desert. You walk and walk.\" That is how this 32-year-old woman from Cameroon described her expulsion from Algeria to Niger last July.\n\nHer story is not unique. At least five hundred migrants and asylum seekers are expelled from Algeria to Niger every week. They are usually picked up off the streets in Algeria, and sent to detention centers before being dropped off in the Ténéré desert, in Niger.\n\nMany become lost or stranded and die from dehydration. First-hand accounts gathered by MSF teams in the Agadez region confirm that refugees, asylum seekers and migrants continue to undergo terrible ordeals during their journeys, either those traveling north, or those expelled from Algeria, or people returned from Libya. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been running a project across key migration routes in the Agadez region since August 2018, providing medical and humanitarian assistance to women, men and children in need. This support includes providing basic relief items, general healthcare, psychosocial support, lifesaving evacuations, and search and rescue of migrants lost/abandoned in the desert.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Around 2,000 men, women, and children are living in tents or under plastic sheeting in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. They’re waiting for asylum hearings set many months in the future. Their makeshift shelters flood when it rains, their children get sick when it's cold; they receive few services, and are largely reliant on volunteers that bring food, clean water, and clothing.\n \nThey are in this situation as a result of the US government's Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” a policy implemented in 2019 that requires asylum seekers coming from Mexico and Central America to wait in violent, unfamiliar towns along the Mexico-US border until their asylum hearing dates in the US. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works in Matamoros and other cities along the border, providing medical and mental health care and social services.\n\nLearn more about the efforts of Doctors Without Borders to provide health care to refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants in Mexico: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/countries/mexico\n \n\"We see now that with the new migration policy things have changed,\" says Nora Valdivia, MSF mental health supervisor. \"Waiting times [for asylum hearings] are much longer. So we see changes in [peoples’] emotional and mental health. There is more despair and anguish. They start out with a lot of hope, but as the months go by they lose that. [Getting asylum] is their reason to keep going, and realizing that it takes up to 10 months or a year, it makes them feel devastated and increases their suffering.\"\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

At the awards ceremony, Dr. James Orbinski, then president of MSF’s International Council, used the platform to speak out against Russia’s bombing of civilians in Chechnya—and call for the protection of humanitarian action. Twenty years later, we reaffirm our commitment to providing independent, impartial medical care to the people who need it most. \"Humanitarian responsibility has no frontiers,\" Orbinski said in his speech.

    "description": "As part of our goal to reduce maternal mortality and suffering, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) offers a range of contraception options to women at our projects all over the world. \"Women need to be able to choose a method that suits them, that fits their particular circumstances,\" explains MSF midwife Liza Ramlow, \"what kind of access to care they have, whether or not they want something that others will be able to detect they're using.\" Here, Ramlow describes her experience working at MSF's project in Central African Republic, where she says she saw a huge demand for contraception. Providing contraception helps prevent death and injury because it reduces the overall number of pregnancies, which can be dangerous for women with little access to health care, and it prevents unsafe abortions, another main cause of maternal mortality.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

In the video, MSF nurse Nathalie Kornfein says, “Some patients who arrive are in almost unbearable pain.” And MSF Doctor, Djénabou Diallo, describes the importance of pain management—one of her patients was in so much pain she could not talk, but after a month of treatment her pain subsided.  \n \nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The Ebola epidemic in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is still not under control—14 months after the outbreak was declared in August 2018. In this video, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) deputy medical director Northan Hurtado reports that the number of new cases of Ebola has decreased in recent weeks. While this is good news, he warns that “we have to remain vigilant” to finish the job of responding to Ebola in DRC. Hurtado identifies three main actions helping to contain the outbreak: vaccination, the use of new therapeutic drugs, and comprehensive care for people affected by Ebola as well as other diseases.\n\nTo learn more about MSF's response to Ebola in DRC visit: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/countries/democratic-republic-congo\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "The Human Cost of 'Remain in Mexico'",
    "description": "First implemented by the Trump administration in January 2019, the Migrant Protection Protocols, a US policy more commonly called \"Remain in Mexico,\" means that asylum seekers that arrive at US ports of entry at the southern border are sent back to Mexico to await their asylum hearings. Far from protecting migrants, however, the policy sends vulnerable men, women and children to some of the most dangerous places in the country—Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, and Reynosa, for example, all located in Tamaulipas state, which the US State Department gives a Level 4 security rating, the same rating it gives Syria and Afghanistan. When they arrive there, migrants become easy prey for the gangs that control much of these areas—they become victims of kidnapping, extortion, and more. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is present in these and other areas to provide medical and mental health care to migrants. \"We see a lot of mental health problems. That is clear,\" says Sergio Martin, MSF's head of mission in Mexico. \"Violence is provoking a lot of mental health problems in people.\" When they set out to seek safety in the US, most migrants don't know what kinds of violence awaits them on the route north, he says, nor do they know they'll be sent to wait in extremely dangerous places in Mexico, where they are likely to be targeted again. Most people, says Martin, \"probably don't expect to be treated like that in the US.\"\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "When the Ebola outbreak hit Sierra Leone in 2014, the country was still struggling to recover from the impact of civil war. Rates of maternal, infant, and child mortality were already among the highest in the world. The largest ever Ebola epidemic wreaked havoc across West Africa and crushed Sierra Leone’s already weak health system. An estimated 3,956 people died of Ebola in Sierra Leone, including some 79 health workers at the forefront of the response. Many others died because they could not get access to medical care.\n\nToday, an Ebola outbreak grinds on in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Its trajectory and duration remain uncertain, let alone all the lessons to be gleaned. But the Sierra Leone experience provides unique insights.\n\nJoin a panel of medical experts from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and Columbia University for a discussion about the impact of a major public health crisis on fragile health care systems, with a focus on women’s health. We’ll discuss lessons learned by MSF during the outbreak in Sierra Leone and what the country’s health system looks like now.\n\nPanelists include Dr. Susan Michaels-Strasser, senior implementation director/associate director for nursing programs for ICAP, and assistant professor for Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health; Dr. Séverine Caluwaerts, MSF obstetrician-gynecologist and author; Dr. Gillian Burkhardt, MSF obstetrician-gynecologist and author; and Ella Watson-Stryker, MSF health promotion activities manager, and humanitarian representative for MSF-USA. Dr. Craig Spencer, MSF-USA board of directors member, and director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine/assistant professor of medicine and population and family health at Columbia University will moderate the panel.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Having fled the economic and political turmoil in their own country, most of them have left everything behind for stability and safety in a new country where they must live in shelters or on the street with their families. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing mental health services to adults and children in Roraima for the last year. Our strategy of helping young people cope with the challenges of their new situation has three pillars, says Anderson Beltrame, an MSF psychologist: identity, family and self esteem; inclusion and belonging in a new culture; and protection and prevention against abuse. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "An estimated 4 million Venezuelans have left their country since the collapse of its political and economic systems, and at least 1.4 million have come to neighboring Colombia. They are coming from a country where, over the last few years, most people had no access to medicines and essential health services were entirely out of reach. Now in Colombia, they often face the same problem. Legally entitled to receive emergency medical care from the Colombian health system, those services are limited to vaccinations, immediate lifesaving treatment, and deliveries—and many migrants report being turned away from receiving these. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working to help cover the huge gaps in health services for Venezuelan migrants. \"Because of their living conditions (migrants) suffer pathologies like diarrhea, skin diseases, respiratory infections and have no access to a doctor,\" said MSF project coordinator Elsa Soto. \"So, providing them with access to basic health care is a first step to prevent them from getting worse and ending up in emergency rooms.\" Soto's teams work in La Guajira department, in Colombia's northernmost tip, and are focussed on primary health and mental health care, as well as sexual and reproductive health care, trying to prevent maternal death and suffering. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "As Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) marks International Safe Abortion Day on September 28, we're looking at the far-reaching impacts of the US Global Gag Rule (officially known as the Mexico City Policy). At our medical projects in Colombia, we're seeing large numbers of Venezuelan women forced to flee economic and political upheaval in their home country and now left with limited access to essential health services. The Global Gag Rule targets overseas health organizations that rely on US global health funding. The latest version of the policy enacted by President Donald Trump prohibits organizations that receive US government funding for any of their activities from offering abortion-related services, including counseling women on their reproductive options or referring them to an agency that can provide these services. This effectively puts a \"gag\" on health providers. If organizations do not agree to this policy, they lose US funding, for which there are few adequate alternatives. The US provides far more global health funding than any other donor in the world. Many of the organizations that are affected provide other critical services, including contraception, HIV/AIDS testing and treatment, and malnutrition care.\n\nThe people affected by this policy are those dealing with war, persecution, and collapsed health systems, like those fleeing Venezuela. The Global Gag Rule means that people in crisis who need essential health services are less likely to receive them.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

It is contrary to international law to return survivors to an unsafe destination. The Ocean Viking is patrolling north of Tripoli, Libya, looking out for boats in distress.

This measles epidemic has claimed more lives than the ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC, yet receives little international attention or funding. The outbreak is also affecting remote areas in the west of the country, posing major logistical challenges to medical teams trying to vaccinate communities at risk. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has sent an emergency response team to help contain the spread of the disease. The emergency team is mobile and agile, able to travel to hard-to-reach areas and change course quickly as the epidemic evolves. In this video, Pierre Heddegem, emergency team coordinator, explains how MSF is responding to the measles outbreak.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

More than 912,000 Rohingya sheltering in Bangladesh live in the same bamboo and plastic structures they built when they first arrived. They often become sick due to their living conditions, including poor water and sanitation.

    "description": "The governments of Mexico and the United States have agreed to expand the “Remain in Mexico” policy (also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols), forcing people seeking asylum in the US to wait out legal proceedings in violent areas of Mexico. This week, the policy was expanded to Nuevo Laredo, a border city in Tamaulipas state that is controlled by criminal groups. According to testimonies collected by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the moment migrants and asylum seekers arrive in Nuevo Laredo, they become targets for criminals, facing robbery, assault, extortion, kidnapping, and murder. Even the US State Department has placed a level four travel advisory on Tamaulipas State—their highest advisory level, often used for war zones. In this interview, María Hernández of MSF’s coordination team in Mexico talks about the dangerous humanitarian consequences of this policy.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Since 2003, when Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) first began providing HIV care in Yangon, Myanmar, our teams have treated more than 17,000 patients and helped build a community where people can receive high-quality treatment in an environment free of judgment. In June 2019, we closed Insein clinic, one of our two HIV centers in Yangon, transferring patients to the care of Myanmar’s National AIDS Program. The clinic’s closure is a milestone that signals Myanmar’s growing capacity to provide patient-centered care and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for people living with HIV. MSF was the first provider of ARV treatment in Myanmar and for some time ran the largest HIV treatment program in the country.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "title": "LIVE Turned Away: No Refuge for People Forced From Home",
    "description": "In the United States, across Europe, and around the world, refugee protections are increasingly ignored. This is the alarming new normal: millions of vulnerable people are stranded with no place to turn. Safe and legal routes are closed off. Refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants are turned away by governments, and even sent back into danger. People seeking safety are being treated like criminals—and so are individuals and organizations providing lifesaving humanitarian aid. From Mexico to the Mediterranean and beyond, MSF teams witness the impact of harsh deterrence policies on people’s medical and mental health.\n\nThe discussion is moderated by Sarah Stillman, staff writer for The New Yorker and director of the Global Migration Project at Columbia Journalism School, and will feature Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Immigrants’ Rights Project; Dr. Craig Spencer, member of MSF-USA’s board of directors and director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Center; and María Hernández Matas, project coordinator for MSF's migrants project in Mexico; and Bianca Benvenuti, MSF-Italy advocacy officer and migration policy specialist, and a research fellow for the Istanbul Policy Centre. This timely conversation, on the eve of World Refugee Day, examines what it means to deny security to those who most need it, and how we can develop a more humanitarian response to this humanitarian crisis.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Eleven months into the second-worst Ebola outbreak on record, more than 1,500 people have died and more than 2,200 have been infected with the disease in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In recent months, the situation has only gotten worse. Because of fear and misconceptions about the disease, many people are not seeking treatment and are dying before they can receive care. In past Ebola interventions, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has seen that community support is essential to stopping the disease, but missteps in this response have prevented MSF from gaining that support. As MSF Emergency Coordinator John Johnson explains, we are adapting our approach to better serve the affected communities and gain both their buy-in and trust.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Nearly 30,000 people live in the United Nations Protection of Civilians (PoC) site in Malakal, South Sudan. A similar site in Bentui holds more than 150,000 people. Unique to South Sudan, the PoCs were created when thousands of people sought protection on UN bases following the start of the civil war in December 2013. The sites were meant to serve as temporary refuge, but more than five years later, they’ve only grown, as people prefer to live in relative safety rather than return to uncertainty. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs hospitals inside both Malakal and Bentiu camps, and continues to see high levels of medical and mental health needs. Life is bleak and extremely difficult in the PoCs, where people live in miserable conditions while also dealing with the trauma of war and displacement. “People are not happy after they’ve lost everything,” says Achol, a displaced woman in Malakal PoC. “There have been many deaths. Some even say it would be better to kill themselves.”\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Without prompt treatment, cholera is deadly. Since the collapse of Yemen's health system, the disease, which is endemic in the country, has resurfaced. After outbreaks in 2016–2017, there was another spike in cholera cases between January and May this year. Over five months, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treated more than 10,000 patients with symptoms of the disease at its health facilities in Amran, Hajjah, Sanaa, Ibb, and Taiz governorates. \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "The route from the Northern Triangle of Central America (comprising Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador) through Mexico is considered the world's second most dangerous migration route after the treacherous Mediterranean Sea crossing. En route, people who are often fleeing violence in their home countries face abduction, extortion, sexual violence, torture, and execution in their search for safety. The need to flee their countries is so dire, however, that large numbers of people continue to risk the journey.\n\nHere, María Hernández, a field coordinator in Mexico with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), says that more than half of the people MSF treats have experienced violence since arriving in Mexico. Our teams have provided basic medical and mental health care to tens of thousands of people along Mexico’s migration routes since 2012.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "After Cyclone Idai swept through Mozambique’s coastal city of Beira and surrounding districts, widespread flooding increased the risk of waterborne diseases. Within a week of the disaster, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) began working with the Ministry of Health to rapidly contain an outbreak of cholera in the area. Teams are also looking ahead to anticipate future threats. In this interview, Dr. Tomas Jensen, tropical medicine advisor for MSF, talks about what's likely to come next—many more mosquitoes that carry diseases like malaria and dengue fever. This knowledge gives us time to prepare and help protect people in the affected areas.\n\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Women in low-resource settings need greater access to modern contraception, and they need access to safe abortion care. They also need health information and support that reach them where they are.\n\nThe international medical community knows what causes maternal mortality and how to prevent it. In fact, there’s been a significant decline in maternal deaths over the last two decades. Yet for far too many women in the places where MSF works, pregnancy-related deaths are an ongoing, everyday emergency. So, what are we doing about it?

    "description": "Tanya Haj-Hassan is an MSF pediatrician from Philadelphia who worked at Bardnesville Junction Hospital (BJH) in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, from April to October 2018. MSF set up the hospital in 2015 to provide urgently needed care for children during the Ebola epidemic, which claimed the lives of more than 200 Liberian medical workers and put a heavy strain on the country's medical system.\n \nBJH, run by MSF, now admits about 100 children per week for conditions including malaria, severe acute malnutrition, non-bloody diarrhea and respiratory tract infections. It includes an emergency room, intensive care unit, pediatric ward and nutrition ward, as well as Liberia's only pediatric surgery program. The hospital is also a certified clinical teaching site for Liberian nursing students.\n \nBJH regularly receives some of the most critical pediatric cases from a large urban area with approximately 1 million people. All too often, children in Liberia die from conditions that would be successfully treated in a wealthier country. These conditions can be exacerbated by toxic home remedies or malnutrition, or because children are brought for treatment very late.\n \nDespite difficulties beyond the hospital's control, Dr. Haj-Hassan explains how practical improvements in patient care, staff training and team management helped save children's lives.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Of more than 240 confirmed cases of Ebola in this region, 140 people have died since August 2018.\n\nFor more information on MSF's response to Ebola outbreaks in impacted areas visit: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/ebola\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

The epicenter of the outbreak is in an area of active conflict, which makes it difficult to provide care for those affected, as well as track contacts and chains of transmission. The outbreak is occurring in densely populated areas, and very close to the Uganda border. In this interview, Dr. Tomas Jensen, tropical medicine advisor for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), explains how teams are working with DRC’s Ministry of Health to do everything we can to treat people with Ebola and prevent others from contracting this life-threatening disease.\n\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Refugees and asylum-seekers held with no date for release on the island of Nauru by the Australian government are stuck in a vicious cycle of despair, with many having lost the will to live. MSF has been providing mental health care since November 2017 to these men, women and children, many of whom say they would have been killed if they'd stayed in their home countries. Among MSF's patients, 78 have either attempted or thought about suicide or engaged in other forms of self-harm, and an alarming number of children are deeply traumatized, according to MSF's medical analysis. Despite this, the Australian government informed MSF on October 5 that their services are \"no longer required\" and must end within 24 hours. Almost all 900 refugees on Nauru, including 115 children, have been on the island for more than five years, with no clear process or prospect of permanent resettlement.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Thousands of people who've risked their lives to escape war and persecution find themselves trapped in Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. They are living in miserable, overcrowded conditions—often for years—waiting for their asylum claims to be processed. Asylum-seekers receive no regular information about the status of their requests, and they could be deported or sent to a detention center at any time. The combination of the trauma experienced in the places that they've fled and the appalling conditions in the camp is affecting people's mental health. MSF teams providing the only specialized mental health care in Moria see patients with a range of conditions—from the inability to sleep, to psychotic episodes, to suicide attempts.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

Large swaths of Mosul, particularly in the west, remain decimated. Some people with no other option have returned to Mosul and live in their damaged homes in poor hygiene conditions, often without water or electricity. Unexploded mines, booby traps, and other remnants of war are a constant threat. Access to healthcare is a daily struggle because the majority of hospitals were damaged in the conflict. In 2017, MSF worked in and around Mosul to provide lifesaving services for people caught in the violence. Currently, we run a hospital in west Mosul, specializing in maternity, pediatrics and emergency room services, and a surgery and post-operative care facility for war-wounded patients in east Mosul. In July, MSF will start providing mental health services in primary healthcare clinics in the east and west side of the city.\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Wherever Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) meets displaced women and girls, some will be carrying pregnancies due to rape. Testimonies of rape and other forms of sexual violence are common in the dedicated “women’s shelter” on the MV Aquarius, a search and rescue ship operated by SOS Mediteranée with medical support from MSF. \n\nA midwife on the Aquarius, Jonquil has worked with women facing a range of health challenges. Many have been raped, before or during their attempt to flee their homes and cross the Mediterranean. There are both wanted and unwanted pregnancies that women must contend with during this difficult journey.\n\nNot everyone survives the crossing. For those that do, their time onboard may be the first time they receive health care. In 2017, close to two out of three of the women and girls on board were single travelers—a highly vulnerable group in the displacement context.\n\nTwo in five of those were from Nigeria, and reports assert many are being trafficked for the sex trade in Europe. Nigerians rescued on this dangerous crossing are now more often female than male. MSF’s two or three-day encounter on the ship with these young women is a brief but valuable opportunity to alert them to the risks they might face and provide them advice about assistance such as protection onshore.

    "description": "Gloria was pregnant, expecting her third child, when she and her family were forced to flee from Burundi. They spent four months stranded at the Tanzanian border before making it to Nduta refugee camp. \"On the way here, the road was very rough, and that affected me,\" says Gloria. \"I was rushed to the hospital when they discovered I was pregnant.\" She received access to emergency obstetric care in Nduta, where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is the main health care provider.\n\nWomen and adolescent girls are among those forced to flee violence and persecution, and many of them are pregnant, or may become pregnant, along the journey. \n\nLack of access to routine care puts pregnant women and their babies at risk, and lack of emergency care can be life-threatening. Fleeing when pregnant can increase the risk of miscarriage or pre-term delivery. Problems that could be managed—for example, by controlling anemia or vaccinating for tetanus—can escalate to grave proportions. Evidence shows that a mother’s death also affects the survival of her children.\n\nIn Nduta, Tanzania, as in other places, the health network is as important as the individual sites of care: mobile clinics, health posts, MSF’s maternity hospital, and the external Kibondo hospital are all linked to ensure that care is available as widely as possible for pregnant women and girls.

It can be a reason to flee, but also can be experienced along the journey at any stage of displacement.\n\nRuksana, a midwife, has been working in Kutupalong, Bangladesh, for six years. In August 2017 her clinic started to see a sharp increase in patients who had suffered sexual violence among the new influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.\n\nSexual violence is a medical emergency, requiring treatment within an urgent window of time to prevent an unwanted pregnancy or possible infections such as HIV. Too often, the window for prevention is closed by the time care is sought.\n\nPsychological support is also essential to aid resilience and recovery. But due to stigma, shame, or simply being overwhelmed by other demands, survivors of violence may not seek care.\n\nLearn more at http://becauseimawoman.msf.org/en/\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

    "description": "Approximately 40 percent of pregnancies worldwide are unintended, and for displaced women the risks are even greater.\n\nFouzia Bara is a medical coordinator working with Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières in Athens, where the team runs a health care center for displaced people. \"Most of [the women], they prefer on their way to avoid pregnancies, because they don't know what will happen,\" says Bara. \"They have no capacity to visualize their future.\" Women on the move are also more vulnerable to sexual violence and abuse.    \n\nFor those already on contraception, a rushed escape followed by a protracted journey makes it easy to lose or run out of birth control pills, or see a longer-acting injection expire. \n\nFor others, denied contraception by community norms or the health system they’ve come from, gaining access is a chance to protect their health in the face of great uncertainty. They need services that can reach them confidentially. Without contraception, women and girls risk becoming pregnant too young, too soon, or in circumstances they would not wish for.\n\nWorldwide, one in four pregnancies ends in induced abortion, almost half of them unsafe; unsafe abortions cause an estimated 13 percent of all maternal deaths. With safe abortion care, these deaths can be prevented.\n\nIn Greece, for example, the health system provides termination of pregnancy on request, but is too under-resourced to always respond in time to this and other urgent health needs facing migrants and refugees. The MSF Athens Day Care Center helps fill some of these gaps, and makes cultural mediators and translators available to those who need them.

    "description": "More than half of the Syrian population have been forcibly displaced. Salma fled with her children and brother-in-law from outside Damascus in Syria, south to Daraa, then crossed the border into Jordan. After a brief stay in Zaatari refugee camp, she moved to Irbid. \"I was displaying strength in front of my children, but on the inside, I was really tired,\" she says. \n\nFor some women and girls forced from their homes, it's possible to find at least relative safety compared to what they've left. However they often face ongoing stresses due to the legacy of violence and the pressures of adjusting to a new environment. Women will often prioritize the needs of their family before their own.\n\nIn Jordan, for example, many Syrian women need to draw on all their inner resources to shoulder complex responsibilities. Some have lost their husbands and may be struggling to support their family financially or to raise their children as the sole parent. Typically, as in Salma's case, it is their children’s suffering that brings them to seek care. \n\nIn Jordan, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provides mental health care to children and their mothers in Irbid and Mafraq. An all-female counseling team shares tools to help women understand what’s going on and how to respond in an effective way. Equipped with a new sense of strength, displaced women and their families can start seeking to thrive instead of just survive.\n\nLearn more about the specific health risks and dangers that women and girls face when they are forced from their homes: http://becauseimawoman.msf.org/en/ \n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

We carry out our work with respect for the rules of medical ethics, in particular the duty to provide care without causing harm to individuals or groups. We respect patients’ autonomy, patient confidentiality, and their right to informed consent. We treat our patients with dignity, and with respect for their cultural and religious beliefs. In accordance with these principles, MSF endeavors to provide high-quality medical care to all patients. \n\nIndependence\n\nOur decision to offer assistance in any country or crisis is based on an independent assessment of people’s needs. We strive to ensure that we have the power to freely evaluate medical needs, to access populations without restriction, and to directly control the aid we provide. Our independence is facilitated by our policy to allow only a marginal portion of our funds to come from governments and intergovernmental organizations.\n\nImpartiality and Neutrality\n\nMSF offers assistance to people based on need and irrespective of race, religion, gender, or political affiliation. We give priority to those in the most serious and immediate danger. Our decisions are not based on political, economic, or religious interests. MSF does not take sides or intervene according to the demands of governments or warring parties.\n\nBearing Witness\n\nThe principles of impartiality and neutrality are not synonymous with silence. When MSF witnesses extreme acts of violence against individuals or groups, the organization may speak out publicly. We may seek to bring attention to extreme need and unacceptable suffering when access to lifesaving medical care is hindered, when medical facilities come under threat, when crises are neglected, or when the provision of aid is inadequate or abused.\n\nAccountability\n\nMSF is committed to regularly evaluating the effects of its activities. We assume the responsibility of accounting for our actions to our patients and donors.",

Yet these flying cameras also offer huge potential to improve assistance during emergency responses, especially in hard-to-reach areas. In southern Malawi, an MSF team recently used a small drone to conduct an aerial mapping exercise of remote Makhanga island in order to prepare for anticipated seasonal floods that cut off the area from humanitarian aid.\n\nWatch \"Telemedicine on the Front Lines\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySjzbT7rOGw&t=2s\n\nMake sure you don’t miss weekly video updates and ongoing series about our work in crisis zones across the world.

As a result, thousands of people have died on land or at sea. \nWhile we may not know of the truth behind who wrote the letter, we do know that what it depicts is real.

Ellos huyeron al campamento Domiz en el país vecino, Irak, anticipando volver a su hogar en un par de meses. Años después, mientras la guerra civil continua, el futuro de la familia queda incierto. Trabajando para adaptarse a sus vidas nuevas como refugiados les da una distracción de las memorias pésimas de que ellos presenciaron y todo que ellos dejaron. \n\nCasi cinco millones de Sirios huyeron a países vecinos desde 2011, con la mayoría de gente encontrando refugio en campamentos de refugiados o asentamientos irregulares sin recursos suficientes como agua, alimentos, y electricidad. La historia de Mashallah y su familia es similar a muchos refugiados Sirios en el campamento Domiz y en otros lugares: viviendo en un limbo, incierto si ellos podrán nunca más volver a sus hogares. Otros se cuestan todos los días para satisfacer sus necesidades básicas y están acosados por problemas de salud y una falta de trabajos. \n\nMédicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) ha proporcionado atención médicos en campamento Domiz desde que se abrió en 2012.

Como Aline dice, “tienes que hacer un decisión o morir o sobrevivir.” Cientos de miles de personas han huido Burundi por sus vidas, muchos hayan visto sus parientes o amigos matados.\n\nBurundianos están refugiándose en países vecinos, muchos de ellos en Tanzania. El campamento Nduta es una de tres campamentos oficiales de refugiados alojando alrededor de 200,000 Burundianos. La gente están mas seguros aquí, pero viviendo en el campamento viven con problemas exclusivas, especialmente para las mujeres y sus niños; la violencia sexual es un problema significativo que no se ha abordado suficientemente en los campamentos. Además, la mayoría de gente no tienen acceso a empleo y por eso, no pueden mejorar sus condiciones de vivienda. Todos quieren saber cuando ellos podrán volver a sus hogares pero hay poca esperanza ahora en una resolución del conflicto en Burundi.  \n\nMédicos Sin Fronteras es el proveedor principal de servicios médicos en el campamento Nduta.

The results were that MSF was no longer limited to chasing the disease; teams could now start trying to prevent it from spreading.

And those patients are not be able to make the best, most informed decisions about their lives and their bodies. Even if abortion is legal in that country. That is a violation of medical ethics.\n\nThere is no evidence that shows that the Global Gag Rule has ever brought the number of abortions down. In fact studies show that the number of pregnancies and abortion attempts actually go up while access to contraception decreases. And it’s about to happen again.\n\nOn International Women’s Day, let’s recognize that women and girls everywhere deserve the best healthcare possible.

The MSF staff’s priority is to provide a caring, safe and confidential environment for people who have been subjected to this kind of trauma, however long ago it happened. However, victims need to get medical care within 72 hours to effectively combat the risk of HIV. So, MSF teams have reached out to communities living near the clinic, to combat the stigma associated with sexual violence, and to let them know that care is available. \n\nThey also work closely with other local groups—starting with the police—to ensure that victims of sexual violence are referred to the clinic as quickly as possible. A helpline and an ambulance service facilitate access to the clinic for people without any means of transport, especially at night. \nRead more about the challenges survivors of sexual violence face in Because Tomorrow Needs Her: http://womenshealth.msf.org/chapters/chapter-5/\n#TomorrowNeedsHer",

    "description": "Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya has sheltered refugees fleeing Somalia for over 25 years. Now the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab is currently home to some 277,000 displaced people, many of whom were born and raised inside the camp. While living conditions are poor for residents, at least humanitarian assistance is guaranteed for essentials such as food and medical care. \n \nOn May 6, 2016, the Kenyan government announced the impending closure of the camp, which would force residents of Dadaab to return to Somalia against their will. \n \nHere, Ella Watson-Stryker talks about the findings of a recent MSF study she led in the camp, asking residents how they feel about being sent back to Somalia. The survey revealed that the majority of respondents are afraid to go back; their top fears include the lack of health care services and high risk of sexual violence in Somalia. \n \nRead more: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/dadaab-kenya-return-refugees-somalia-%E2%80%98inhumane-and-irresponsible%E2%80%99",

After being treated in a clinic from self-inflicted razor cuts, the patient asked MSF staff to share his message, his story, and his despair.\n\nAfter the signing of the EU-Turkey agreement, MSF suspended its activities inside Moria camp, in protest of an inhumane agreement that has real human consequences on refugees. MSF still provides mobile health promotion and outreach at the camp, and refers patients to the MSF clinic in Mytilene. In October, MSF opened a new clinic in Mytilene providing secondary medical care for all refugees and migrants residing in any location on the island of Lesbos.

MSF is deeply concerned for the hundreds of thousands of people who could be living in areas of the state where aid agencies have not been granted access and who may not have food, water or medical care. \nMSF's pediatric and nutrition advisor, Dr. Kerstin Hanson, said: \"When I go to the field, I'm used to being surrounded  by a lot of kids. Bubbly, jumping, laughing. In Borno this is not the case, especially in the displacement camps where the kids, especially the children under five, were missing. Most of them had, unfortunately, already died. On the other hand, however, in our hospital for severely, acutely malnourished children with really severe medical complications, here the number of malnourished kids was alarming.

All donations will be matched dollar to dollar, up to $100,000! \n\nFind out more at http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/about-us\nWant to work with us? Visit: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-field\n\nMSF is a private, international association. The association is made up mainly of doctors and health sector workers and is also open to all other professions which might help in achieving its aims. All of its members agree to honor the following principles:\n\nMSF provides assistance to populations in distress, to victims of natural or man-made disasters, and to victims of armed conflict. They do so irrespective of race, religion, creed, or political convictions.\n\nMSF observes neutrality and impartiality in the name of universal medical ethics and the right to humanitarian assistance and claims full and unhindered freedom in the exercise of its functions.\n\nMembers undertake to respect their professional code of ethics and maintain complete independence from all political, economic, or religious powers.\n\nAs volunteers, members understand the risks and dangers of the missions they carry out and make no claim for themselves or their assigns for any form of compensation other than that which the association might be able to afford them.\n\nOur Principles\n\nMSF’s actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of independence and impartiality.\n\nMedical Ethics\n\nMSF’s actions are first and foremost medical. We carry out our work with respect for the rules of medical ethics, in particular the duty to provide care without causing harm to individuals or groups. We respect patients’ autonomy, patient confidentiality, and their right to informed consent. We treat our patients with dignity, and with respect for their cultural and religious beliefs. In accordance with these principles, MSF endeavors to provide high-quality medical care to all patients. \n\nIndependence\n\nOur decision to offer assistance in any country or crisis is based on an independent assessment of people’s needs. We strive to ensure that we have the power to freely evaluate medical needs, to access populations without restriction, and to directly control the aid we provide. Our independence is facilitated by our policy to allow only a marginal portion of our funds to come from governments and intergovernmental organizations.\n\nImpartiality and Neutrality\n\nMSF offers assistance to people based on need and irrespective of race, religion, gender, or political affiliation. We give priority to those in the most serious and immediate danger. Our decisions are not based on political, economic, or religious interests. MSF does not take sides or intervene according to the demands of governments or warring parties.\n\nBearing Witness\n\nThe principles of impartiality and neutrality are not synonymous with silence. When MSF witnesses extreme acts of violence against individuals or groups, the organization may speak out publicly. We may seek to bring attention to extreme need and unacceptable suffering when access to lifesaving medical care is hindered, when medical facilities come under threat, when crises are neglected, or when the provision of aid is inadequate or abused.\n\nAccountability\n\nMSF is committed to regularly evaluating the effects of its activities. We assume the responsibility of accounting for our actions to our patients and donors.",

Every day, the teams needed 4,000 ice packs and coolers in different locations.Read more about the campaign here: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-supporting-massive-yellow-fever-vaccination-effort-drc\nLearn more about MSF in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uoq2EG3BpS4",

    "description": "For children in east Aleppo, Syria, healthy or sick, the situation is becoming more critical each day. Food, drinking water and medical care are becoming increasingly scarce, while medical staff are struggling to cope with large numbers of wounded.  \nAt least 136 children have been killed and at least 468 have been wounded by airstrikes since September 22. The hospitals where they are being treated are desperately overcrowded and short on staff, medical supplies and intensive care beds.\n“Our outpatient departments are overwhelmed,” says emergency room nurse Abu Almoutassen. “We are getting between 120 and 150 children every day. We received one child who needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit, but we were forced to keep him in the ward for some time. He wasn’t able to make it and he passed away.”\nOf the seven hospitals currently functioning in east Aleppo, just one specializes in treating children. There are four pediatricians, two qualified doctors and two final-year medical students, in the besieged area, but no pediatric surgeon.\nThe shortage of medical staff has already had fatal consequences, according to Almoutassen.  “We had a child who required surgery for an oesophageal diverticulum, but we couldn’t find a doctor available in the whole of east Aleppo. Any pediatric surgeon could have done it, as it’s an easy operation. But there was no such surgeon, and the child died.”\nSome 1,500 child patients currently need specialized medical care that is not available in the besieged area of the city, but with all roads out of the city impassable, no referrals are possible. These include children with cancer, congenital abnormalities and brain damage, as well as those needing certain types of emergency care.

    "description": "The transmission of Ebola from the big outbreak which affected more than 28,000 people in West Africa is over. However there is plenty of long-term impact felt in each of the three countries, from economic impact, to schools closing, to medical schools closing for an extended period of time. In Liberia, for example, before the outbreak they only had 50 doctors. And then for one or two years there’s been no doctors who’ve graduated and some doctors died during the outbreak. Clinics have shut down. Routine health care had shut down.\nSo HIV testing, TB program, routine immunization for children, all of this was compromised. \n\nNow in Monrovia, Liberia, we’re seeing measles cases, just because there wasn’t routine vaccination during the outbreak. We’re also seeing the psychological impact on the population and on communities. We’re seeing PTSD and depression. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was one of the biggest actors in the response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in all three countries. We treated more than 5,000 patients, half of which survived. It was quite a difficult time, and something we had never seen before, so at MSF we also learned quite a lot. Now what we’re doing is we’re trying to create a new guideline for hemorrhagic fever for both us, as MSF in the future, and also for other actors. They can use and we can learn from these lessons. We’re also working to help find a vaccine. We've been running survivor clinics, one in every country, because we were seeing that Ebola survivors have symptoms that continue after they’re cured. Namely, eye problems, generalized body pain, joint pain, aches s and pains, as well as psychological problems.  These clinics will end by the end of 2016 and the survivors will be re-integrated into the normal healthcare system. \n\nFind out more about MSF's work in This is MSF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uoq2EG3BpS4",

    "description": "UPDATE January 25, 2017 following the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy on Abortion: \n\n\"Governments should not play politics with the lives of women and girls. No matter what the risk or barrier, women will continue to seek ways to end pregnancies and they will continue to needlessly die if safe abortion care is not accessible. The Trump Administration needs to face these facts and end policies that endanger the lives of women and girls.\"\n\nRead about the impact of the Global Gag Rule on women's health: \nhttp://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/doctors-without-borders-statement-reinstatement-mexico-city-policy-abortion\n\nIn developing countries, where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works, unsafe abortions are a major problem. Not only is there usually a problem for many people to access health care in general, but there are also legal restrictions around termination of pregnancy. So often, women and girls who don't have the money to access a safe abortion will risk their health and their life having an unsafe one. Every day at MSF hospitals and clinics around the world, women and girls come in with abortion-related complications. Some patients have severe wounds. Others have bought pills to end their pregnancy but were not instructed how to use them or what to expect so they are often experiencing bleeding and are frightened. The patients MSF sees and are able to help are the lucky ones. Many more women and girls will not seek medical care out of fear and will die at home alone. Unsafe abortion causes a significant amount of maternal deaths every year, the vast majority in developing countries.

These kinds of places are being hit a lot.\n\nAs a result, we are receiving large numbers of wounded people. At times all the hospitals in eastern Aleppo are full. Intensive care units and inpatient wards are all crowded. Once or twice a day, you have to empty the wards so as to make space for new patients.\n\nWe do whatever we can. At times we have had to carry out as many as 20 to 30 surgeries in one day in one hospital. Hospitals are working at full power. We were supposed to limit our use of fuel, consumables and drugs during the siege, but due to the intensified bombing – for many days it has been very heavy – we haven’t been able to limit our use of fuel or anything else. \n\nI think that with less work and less use of the supplies we have, we can hold out for three months.

    "description": "This 360-degree video documentary shares the story of Aline, a young Burundian woman and refugee who had to flee her country due to the severe political violence that erupted around the presidential election in 2015. As Aline says, \"you have to make a decision either to die or to live.\" Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Burundi for their lives, many of them having seen their relatives or friends killed.\n\nBurundians are taking shelter in neighboring countries, many of them in Tanzania. Nduta camp is one of three official refugee camps hosting around 200,000 Burundians. People are safer here, but living in the camp comes with its own issues, especially for women and children; sexual violence is a big problem that has not been adequately addressed in the camps. In addition, most people have no access to jobs and therefore cannot improve their very basic living situation. Everyone wants to know when they will be able to go home but there is little hope right now of a resolution to the conflict in Burundi.\n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is the principal medical provider in Nduta camp. The medical teams offer treatment for malaria, screening for malnutrition, obstetric care, treatment for sexual violence, and pediatric care. MSF also offers mental health counseling to people who are trying to deal with the trauma of their experiences.\n\nFind out about MSF’s touring exhibition, Forced From Home, which will feature 360-degree video and virtual reality documentaries that show the realities of displacement around the world at: http://www.forcedfromhome.com/ \n#ForcedFromHome #360Video\n\nPlease watch all of our 360-degree videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEnchLktCLQ&list=PLa-oDa0bl_LP8qjBGRt5r4yEZ7CleWt8c\n \nIf you're having trouble viewing in full 360 using Chrome browser, go to: Chrome Preferences -- Advanced Settings -- System -- turn ON Use Hardware Acceleration When Available",

In the contexts where MSF traditionally works, infrastructures are often weak, especially in terms of mass communication. In these instances, how to make sure that people know that the service exists, that they should seek care, and that they know where they can find it?\n\nIn August 2016, MSF participated to one of the largest ever yellow fever vaccination campaign to take place in Africa: over 10 million people were vaccinated in the Democratic Republic of Congo within a short 10 days. MSF managed the campaign in three neighborhoods of the sprawling megalopolis of Kinshasa, reaching 710.000 people vaccinated against yellow fever – an excellent vaccination cover of 95% of the population in those areas. This required the dedication of the health promotion team, mostly national Congolese staff, who tirelessly crisscrossed the dense city to convince people to get their shots.",

    "description": "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is a medical humanitarian organization working in more than 60 countries around the world. Find out more about the principles and history of Doctors Without Borders at doctorswithoutborders.org. MSF is a private, international association. \n\nWant to work with us? Visit: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-field\n\nLearn more about the principles, efforts, and history of Doctors Without Borders: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/who-we-are\n\nThe association is made up mainly of doctors and health sector workers and is also open to all other professions which might help in achieving its aims. All of its members agree to honor the following principles:\n\nMSF provides assistance to populations in distress, to victims of natural or man-made disasters, and to victims of armed conflict. They do so irrespective of race, religion, creed, or political convictions.\n\nMSF observes neutrality and impartiality in the name of universal medical ethics and the right to humanitarian assistance and claims full and unhindered freedom in the exercise of its functions.\n\nMembers undertake to respect their professional code of ethics and maintain complete independence from all political, economic, or religious powers.\n\nAs volunteers, members understand the risks and dangers of the missions they carry out and make no claim for themselves or their assigns for any form of compensation other than that which the association might be able to afford them.\n\nOur Principles\n\nMSF’s actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of independence and impartiality. Learn more here: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/who-we-are/principles\n\nMedical Ethics\n\nMSF’s actions are first and foremost medical. We carry out our work with respect for the rules of medical ethics, in particular the duty to provide care without causing harm to individuals or groups. We respect patients’ autonomy, patient confidentiality, and their right to informed consent. We treat our patients with dignity, and with respect for their cultural and religious beliefs. In accordance with these principles, MSF endeavors to provide high-quality medical care to all patients. \n\nIndependence\n\nOur decision to offer assistance in any country or crisis is based on an independent assessment of people’s needs. We strive to ensure that we have the power to freely evaluate medical needs, to access populations without restriction, and to directly control the aid we provide. Our independence is facilitated by our policy to allow only a marginal portion of our funds to come from governments and intergovernmental organizations.\n\nImpartiality and Neutrality\n\nMSF offers assistance to people based on need and irrespective of race, religion, gender, or political affiliation. We give priority to those in the most serious and immediate danger. Our decisions are not based on political, economic, or religious interests. MSF does not take sides or intervene according to the demands of governments or warring parties.\n\nBearing Witness\n\nThe principles of impartiality and neutrality are not synonymous with silence. When MSF witnesses extreme acts of violence against individuals or groups, the organization may speak out publicly. We may seek to bring attention to extreme need and unacceptable suffering when access to lifesaving medical care is hindered, when medical facilities come under threat, when crises are neglected, or when the provision of aid is inadequate or abused.\n\nAccountability\n\nMSF is committed to regularly evaluating the effects of its activities. We assume the responsibility of accounting for our actions to our patients and donors. Learn more here: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/who-we-are/accountability-reporting",

    "description": "Pedro and Diana and their young children fled Honduras with nothing, running for their lives from organized crime. Hoping for a new life, but still dealing with the trauma of their experience, they are one family among hundreds of thousands of people from Central America who flee their homes and cross the border into Mexico every year. \n\nHonduras and neighboring country El Salvador have some of the highest homicide rates in the world; the reach and power of organized crime in these countries, aided by government corruption, forces people to flee their homes, their livelihoods and communities for the unknown, just to stay alive. Others must flee for economic reasons: a lack of available jobs and the inability to support their families. \n\nAlong the migratory route there are “albergues” or hostels run by charitable groups. Pedro and Diana and their children are staying in a hostel in Ixtepec run by Franciscans and staffed with volunteers. They’ve applied for a visa that would allow them to work legally in Mexico and start to rebuild their lives.\n\nIn albergues throughout Mexico Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are providing primary medical care and referrals for secondary care, psychological counseling, and social services. \n\nFind out about MSF’s touring exhibition, Forced From Home, which will feature 360-degree video and virtual reality documentaries that show the realities of displacement around the world at: http://www.forcedfromhome.com/ \n#ForcedFromHome #360Video\n\nPlease watch all of our 360-degree videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEnchLktCLQ&list=PLa-oDa0bl_LP8qjBGRt5r4yEZ7CleWt8c\n \nIf you're having trouble viewing in full 360 using Chrome browser, go to: Chrome Preferences -- Advanced Settings -- System -- turn ON Use Hardware Acceleration When Available",

    "description": "As the bombing and shelling crept closer to their home in Damascus, Syria, Mashallah decided to flee her country along with her husband and four young children. They fled to Domiz camp in neighboring Iraq, expecting to return home within a couple of months. Years later, as the civil war in Syria continues, the family’s future remains uncertain. Working to adapt to their new lives as refugees provides a distraction from the painful memories of what they witnessed and everything they left behind. \n\nNearly five million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries since 2011, with most finding shelter in refugee camps or informal settlements with inadequate resources like water, food and electricity. The story of Mashallah’s family is similar to those of many Syrian refugees in Domiz camp and elsewhere: living in limbo, uncertain if they will ever be able to return home. Others struggle daily to meet their basic needs and are plagued by health problems and the scarcity of work.\n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing medical care in Domiz camp since it opened in 2012. Medical teams treat patients for chronic diseases, offer mental health counseling, and provide reproductive and maternity care. \n\nFind out about MSF’s touring exhibition, Forced From Home, which will feature 360-degree video and virtual reality documentaries that show the realities of displacement around the world at: http://www.forcedfromhome.com/ \n#ForcedFromHome #360Video\n\nPlease watch all of our 360-degree videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEnchLktCLQ&list=PLa-oDa0bl_LP8qjBGRt5r4yEZ7CleWt8c\n \nIf you're having trouble viewing in full 360 using Chrome browser, go to: Chrome Preferences -- Advanced Settings -- System -- turn ON Use Hardware Acceleration When Available",

The closure of the border has exacerbated an already dire humanitarian situation for stranded Syrians, who are short of water and food and are living in unsanitary conditions. Although they have received some limited water distributions and one-off food assistance, they have received no medical care whatsoever since June.",

    "description": "It's the first time our team went to Dikwa, a town 90km from Maiduguri in Borno State, northeast Nigeria, to carry out a nutrition assessment on children under the age of 5 years. What we found was devastating. Due to limited medical and transport capacity, we could only evacuate 28 urgent cases of malnutrition yesterday.\n\nHead Nurse Bright Mukhana at the Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Center in Gwange explains what's happening: \"Malnutrition is so rampant in Maiduguri because of the crisis of the insurgents, Boko Haram. This has stopped people from cultivating crops, they haven’t been going to their farms for quite some time, this resulted in shortage of food and malnutrition kicked in as a result of food scarcity. \nThese patients that we are managing here are mainly coming from camps around Maiduguri. We have several IDP camps (internally displaced persons camps) that are in and around Maiduguri and these malutrition cases are coming from these camps. In the meantime, we also have roads that have opened in other towns that are outside Maiduguri like Dikwa, Bama, Monguno and we’ve started receiving patients from these areas because they can now be accessed and they can now be referred inside Maiduguri for care.\"\n\nThe crisis in Nigeria: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/nigeria-massive-aid-effort-needed-borno-state",

    "description": "Patients are deemed stable after a minimum of six months on ART without side effects or Opportunistic Infections and with a CD4 count above 200 cells/µl.\nIn the last five years, the number of people in South African health facilities receiving life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the last five years has grown from 382,000 to more than 1.79 million. \n\nHowever, South Africa’s National Strategic Plan aims to put more than 3 million people on ART by 2016. As numbers nearly double, the health service will struggle to retain and manage such a high number of patients in care. Adherence club models offer a long term solution to manage stable patients.\nART clubs were piloted by MSF with support from the Western Cape Department of Health (WCDOH) and the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) in a large community health centre in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. The pilot showed that club participation was associated with sustained virological suppression and immunologic recovery. \n\nhttp://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\nhttps://twitter.com/MSF_USA",

    "description": "On May 3, 2016, the United Nations Security Council will vote on a resolution designed to stop future attacks against hospitals, patients and civilians in war zones. We have closely followed the drafting of this resolution, and now we need your help to make sure it will be as strong as possible. \n\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched a social media act of solidarity to stand up for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, patients, medical staff and hospitals in conflicts.\n\nA few months ago, after our hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, was attacked and destroyed by the United States military, you helped Doctors Without Borders stand up for the protection of medical facilities by signing our petition calling for an independent investigation into the bombing. We are hoping you'll join us in the next step in that campaign. Specifically, Doctors Without Borders wants to make sure that this resolution will:\n1. Reaffirm all countries' existing obligations under international humanitarian law (IHL); \n2. Reaffirm the protection of the impartial provision of medical care, health workers and of all patients, regardless of their background (as per IHL)\n3. Establish effective independent investigations to report attacks on medical facilities and hold accountable those who attack. \n\nLearn how you can show your solidarity at http://www.msf.ca/notatarget",

    "description": "Four months since the Dignity I searchand rescue ship sailed from Barcelona to Sicily and then into a search and rescue zone 30 miles of the Libyan coast,  the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) team onboard have saved  more than 5,000 people from dying in the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nEvery week, more people set off on this dangerous sea journey from Africa to Europe. All together the three MSF vessels—the Dignity I, the Bourbon Argos and MY Phoenix—which have been operating since as early as May, have assisted more than 17,000 people. \n\nYet these numbers don’t explain what can push a person to make such a journey. The MSF team on board of Dignity I has been collecting stories and testimonies of those rescued in an attempt to see what lies beyond the numbers. \n\nThis is what Laura Pasquero, an MSF humanitarian officer who has interviewed more than 100 people so far, says: \n\n“Through the people we talk to, we rescue the stories of their friends and family members who often don’t make it, for they die in the desert, or at sea, or in one of Libya’s prisons. When we talk to people about the boat trip on the sea to Europe, two things come out constantly from all the stories: that the boat trip was their only option to save their life, and that on the boat they were almost sure they were going to die. It looks like a contradiction. But it’s their reality.”\n\nRead more about MSF's work with refugees in the Mediterranean: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/humanitarian-issues/refugees-and-idps",

MSF expresses its sincere condolences to the families and friends of its staff members and patients who have tragically lost their lives in this attack.\n\nMSF calls for State activation of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission to investigate Afghanistan bombing.

No matter the obstacles, people will continue to come as they have no other choice. Decisions adopted in EU summits have so far largely failed to improve the situation, and some measures have made the situation worse. Current policies are untenable in the face of this situation. The only way Europe can prevent a worsening crisis on its territory is to replace the smugglers by providing a safe, legal and free alternative to reach Europe. All forms of legal avenues allowing refugees to reach Europe must be put in place urgently. Efficient solutions to relocate asylum seekers from one EU member state to another must be found. Effective access to coherent asylum procedures and assistance should be provided at entry points, throughout Europe and along migratory routes. Swift registration and access to temporary protection should be provided upon arrival. Legal migration pathways must be created. Dignified reception conditions must be offered to all.

After the rescues, the Bourbon Argos began its journey with around 800 people, most of them from Syria, along with people from  Ivory Coast, Mali, Cameroon, Nigeria, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, towards the port of Vibo Valentia in Italy.

    "description": "As the civil war in Syria continues to grind on, living conditions for civilians remain precarious. Many unable to leave the country flee to makeshift camps near the border, where a lack of medical care threatens the lives of inhabitants. Underground medical networks attempt to provide care to civilians, but their resources are limited.\n\n\nAbou Hassan, displaced Syrian:\n\"There are 300 families here. We were given 60 tents during a first distribution, then a further 30, so 90 in all! People sold their furniture and whatever belongings they'd brought with them to buy a tent or build some form of shelter.\"\n\nSince the beginning of the conflict, half of the Syrian population have had to flee from their homes.\n\n\"There are no medical facilities, no toilets, no drainage system. Each family gets 15 litres of water – that’s not even enough to drink. How can we wash or wash our clothes?\"\n\nWinter makes the lives of these families even harder.\n\nNathalie Roberts, medical coordinator, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF):\n\"When it snows there's a huge problem, when the snow melts it’s an even worse problem because everything’s muddy, everything gets wet, the blankets get wet and (...) you have to heat your tent or your home and the availability of fuel is difficult but the quality of fuel is even worse. So it’s kind of the risk balance – you can’t not heat the tent because everyone will get hypothermia but they’re using this fuel and there’s an explosion and the tent might catch fire.\"\n\nExplosions caused by poor quality fuel have become so common that MSF’s hospital in Idlib Governorate now specialises in treating patients suffering from burns.\n\nAbu Mohamad, supervisor:\n\"In one camp, there was a fire that then set fire to a whole group of tents. It happened early in the morning and there were children sleeping in those tents.\nIt’s not their fault, people are getting burned because they’re trying to keep warm or because barrel bombs explosions.\"\n\nSince the beginning of the hostilities, medical facilities have been targeted, their personnel killed, abducted or forced to flee from the violence... and several months ago, some MSF centers were forced to close because of the risk of abduction. \n\nDoctors have set up networks in areas not controlled by the government, but they need help, help that MSF tries to provide.\nThe teams are only too aware from their contacts with Syrian doctors that thousands of people are in need of humanitarian aid... but their scope for action is woefully inadequate.",

Health promotion teams work on spreading awareness throughout communities on infection prevention.\n\nTiming is critical. Just one case of Ebola not detected in time can be enough to wipe out all the work put into containing the epidemic.\nSo, to ensure that people understand and integrate infection-prevention advice, health promotion teams like this one in Monrovia repeat the same messages time and time again. \n\nElsie Siboe, health promotion supervisor, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF):  \n\"We have to ensure that people are aware that once there’s an outbreak, in future it's possible that we'll most likely to have another outbreak, and community burials or touching our dead bodies is one of the things that we have to think about and consider to do some behaviour change.\"\n\nOnce the epidemic is over, countries affected by the outbreak face the challenge of restoring their already fragile healthcare systems that have been reduced to a state of collapse.",

So they're vulnerable to attack, they're vulnerable to rape, they're vulnerable to theft. We haven't seen very much rape yet, I think it's because it's under-reported, people don't seek medical help after a rape, but we're very sure that it happens.\" \n\nMSF’s teams run a maternity unit in Lietchuor camp’s hospital. A few days ago, this woman was giving birth when she found out she was having twins. Both babies are doing well but their mother has difficulty imagining what the future holds for them.",

    "description": "MSF is working in a hospital in Kabul, providing assistance to the nearby population. Roshan Kumarasamy, who just completed a term as head of mission in Afghanistan, reflects on his experience there:\n\"Every year, some idiot comes up with a list of the most corrupt nations, and Afghanistan is always on top. Here is a country that by all conservative estimates, has had some, say, 2.7 trillion dollars pumped into that country. On the issue of the benefits not really trickling down to the population, after 15 years of continuous pumping of enormous quantities of money, yes, I've seen that. And there's a lot of reasons. \n\nThe first in my mind, the first persons I would hold responsible for this are the donors themselves. This was a highly politicized intervention. The donors were under enormous pressure to dispose of a lot of funding. They did that through mostly local NGOs, who are basically proxys of a handful of warlords and very powerful Afghanis, who have historically, for the last 30 years, held the population for ransom. So disposing that amount of money, without any mechanisms to follow through, having no mechanisms to see if what the funds were allocated have actually materialized... This is the responsibility of those who give the money as well.\n\nAt least two U.S. construction companies have been taken to court in the U.S. for building substandard schools that are falling on children. So there are all these great buildings and the kids are outside the buildings, under the mango tree, because they are afraid to go work inside.\n \nSo yes, a lot has been wasted, and of course, as usual, it's the person on the street who has suffered the loss, who are still freezing in the winter, and who still would possibly deliver a child at home because there's no maternal and child health care coverage.\"",

The drug is developed with pre-clinical trials to evaluate, select and transform the most promising molecule. During the clinical trials the drug is administered to healthy volunteers to gauge possible side effects. Then during the next phase it's given to patients to assess its efficacy and determine the appropriate dose. The third phase compares the tested drug with an existing treatment or placebo, and once all these trials are successfully completed, the drug is ready to market. \nUnder normal circumstances, the process takes up to ten years. In November, MSF announced that three clinical trials would be conducted in its treatment centers in West Africa. Tests began in Guinea and Liberia on favipavir and brincidofovir—two orally administered drugs. The brincidofovir trial had to be cancelled almost as soon as it began due to a lack of patients. The third trial, also in Guinea, is assessing the efficacy of transfusing blood products from Ebola survivors to infected patients.  \nInitial results should be available in February.",

An idea as simple as: bringing treatment close to people’s homes. In Lesotho, ONE in FIVE adults is HIV positive.\nSome pregnant women walk up to five hours just to get the drugs that protect their baby from HIV. In South Africa, an HIV positive worker risks his job if he takes one day off every month to queue for hours just to get his pills. In Malawi, TWO out of THREE jobs in the health sector are vacant for lack of doctors and nurses. They struggle to provide daily treatment for one in ten HIV positive adults. Over 90% of people with HIV live in low and middle income countries. They need change.\nWhat if in Lesotho the neighbor of a pregnant woman could deliver her drugs to her? What if in South Africa the HIV positive worker could pick up his pills at a friend’s home? What if in Malawi doctors and nurses could delegate the drug distribution to groups of patients?\nPatient centered care is a simple idea. It’s about adapting health systems to the lives of the people, instead of adapting people’s lives to the system. A first step is to let people come together to solve their shared problem. You can help this idea grow. You can urge governments to support and fund this empowerment.\nTweet. Talk. Share.",

The patients receiving treatment gather on wooden benches and plastic chairs if they have the strength. Other patients can only lie in bed while their immune systems try to fight the deadly virus in their bodies.\n\nMamadee, 11 years old, is different. As the other patients watch, he performs a dance to Azonto, a type of music that originated in Ghana, on the radio. He jumps, he ducks, he steps to the side, first left, then right, then left, then right, jumps again, turns, swings his hips and shakes his arms. He doesn’t stop, and he doesn’t get tired. It is difficult to believe, but Mamadee is an Ebola-confirmed patient.\n\nTo learn more about MSF's response to Ebola outbreaks in impacted areas visit: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/ebola\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/BtzdsR​\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/doctorswithoutborders\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/doctorswithoutborders/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MSF_USA\nConnect with us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/medecins-sans-frontieres-msf/\nSign up for our newsletter: https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/quick-signup-confirm",

In northern Iraq, a doctor—a refugee himself—walks briskly towards the cries and clamors of new patients who have likewise found themselves far from home, with no sense of when they might return. And inside Syria, where the war that has altered the lives of all these people continues without pause and without mercy, medical teams renew their efforts to do what they can to address even a fraction of the needs they see day after day…\n\nWatch the full documentary series—\"The Reach of War\"—at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa-oDa0bl_LOWFJi1nooQkIcKMxvg9iAn",

This documentary explores many of the questions raised by this situation: Did the teams know what was to come? What did they make of the increasing violence and the events taking place? What operational response was called for? Should MSF call for armed intervention? And what should the international community be doing?

She received treatment, but the drug regimine for XDR is extremely arduous.\n\"When I first started taking these pills I vomited and felt nauseous. But now I'm used to them,\" said Funiwe. \"They told me about the side effects -- that my heart would beat a bit faster, and all the other side effects. But they didn't know that it would make me a bit... depressed. I was doing crazy things. They had to tie me to the bed because I was running around the whole hospital. It was hard to go to sleep -- they had to give me an injection to help me sleep.\"\nBecause her case was so difficult to treat, Funiwe became one of a handful of patients eligible to receive a brand new TB drug called Bedaquiline. She is now doing much better, but she faces another year and a half of treatment. She needs to finish the treatment not only for her own survival, but also to avoid spreading the disease to others. Only 13% of patients with XDR-TB get cured. \nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treated nearly 30,000 TB patients in 2013 in 90 projects around the world.

But some companies allow the use of new drugs under the compassionate use program, meaning that trials have not ended but early studies show some encouraging results. Bedaquiline is one of the drugs. It is the first new drug to treat tuberculosis in 50 years. \nThe fact that 250 patients are being prescribed this drug on compassionate grounds, a drug that is not even on the market yet, illustrates the gross inadequacy of existing treatments for MDR-TB. \nCurrent treatment regimens combine as many as 8 antiobiotics and require constant adjustments, depending on how effective they are and on the health of the patient. Treatment is often ineffective and the side effects can be serious: nausea, fatigue, deafness, psychosis, and organ failure to name a few.\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) treated nearly 30,000 TB patients in 2013 in 90 projects around the world.

Because when they see you going hungry in your house, one woman will tell the other 'let's get something to eat' and that's why we're still breathing,\" says Augustin Funguo.\nOut of the ashes of eastern DRC, a spirit of camaraderie rises which seems to prevail, even as people describe unimaginable horrors. Undoubtedly, a climate of suspicion and mistrust divides many communities along religious and ethnic lines but even though people are capable of committing unspeakable acts in the fog of war, genuine love and affection is also possible.\nMany displaced people stay close to home settling in a relatively nearby place of refuge, in the forest or with host families for example, hoping to return home once it is safe to do so. As a result, they are often out of sight and out of reach to humanitarian agencies, which tend to operate near urban centers, so have come to rely on each other for help and support.\nSome 2.96 million people are currently displaced in DRC and many of them have no access to humanitarian assistance. Many communities are cut off from medical care due to poor infrastructure, displacement and conflict, and adequate assistance is not being provided in rural and conflict-affected areas by aid organizations and by the state. At the same time, violence against civilians, medical staff and property is commonplace, and health care providers are regularly required to suspend operations, leaving people deprived of the medical care they urgently need. \nRead MSF's report, \"Everyday Emergency: Silent Suffering in Democratic Republic of Congo\": http://bit.ly/1mT34fk",

    "description": "Every day, MSF is confronted with the medical consequences of violence in its hospitals, health centers and mobile clinics in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Medical teams treat trauma injuries from guns, machetes, lances, rifle bayonets, knives, hammers, shells, bows and arrows. But for those on the receiving end, there is often no escape from the violence.\nHabagasi, an 80-year-old woman living in deplorable conditions at a displaced persons camp on the outskirts of Goma, has been looking after the orphaned children left behind when her family were murdered: \"I had eight sons; they were killed together with my husband and they pumped bullets into my body.\"\nHaving fled for their lives, Habagasi and her grandchildren thought they'd be safe at an 'official' displaced persons camp, but the violence continued: \"The first month here, M23 raided. They looted our food rations, clothes, phones... they stole all of that. They did bad things to me.\"\nUnfortunately, Habagasi is not alone in suffering violence at the hands of armed groups. \nSome 2.96 million people are currently displaced in DRC and many of them have no access to humanitarian assistance. Many communities are cut off from medical care due to poor infrastructure, displacement and conflict, and adequate assistance is not being provided in rural and conflict-affected areas by aid organizations and by the state.

    "description": "Veronica Ades is an ob-gyn in New York City. While working with MSF on a one-month obstetric mission in South Sudan she learned to identify teaching opportunities and to make decisions without the team of ob-gyn colleagues she was used to having. She also had to perform some difficult procedures and diagnose medical conditions she was encountering for the first time.\n\nThe MSF reference books Veronica refers to in this video can be downloaded for free from the MSF Reference Books site: http://www.refbooks.msf.org/MSF_Docs/En/MSFdocMenu_en.htm.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nMy name is Veronica Ades, I'm an OB/GYN in New York City, and I was in South Sudan doing a one-month obstetric mission.\n\nSo most of what we did was take care of the GYN and obstetrical patients, most of the disease that we saw was diarrhea, and urinary tract infection, and then a lot of labor -- a lot of obstructed labor, from either bad pelvises or the usual causes. The national staff really could do the labor and delivery themselves. The midwives were there to round on patients and then to handle complications, um, and then they called me for any complications they couldn't handle themselves -- operative deliveries, C-sections, or just really anything that seemed kind of over their heads.\n\nI think that the biggest difference was that the national staff was not very skilled. They were really eager, but just because of the -- really the lack of available medical education in the country, their skills levels were lower. Teaching was very well-received and was very much needed, but you couldn't necessarily take for granted that they were going to understand what you meant, even if it was a fairly basic nursing skill. For example, they didn't really know how to read a urine dipstick and brought it up to me and I arranged a teaching session around that. But for a long time I was assuming that they were diagnosing UTIs correctly when they weren't. So that was a challenge. I think they were extremely receptive to teaching and critique and so that made it a lot easier. But it certainly made me realize how much I had to be careful about what I was recommending and how much they understood. \n\nThen I think the other thing is having no other obstetrician around. I'm used to working among lots of other obstetricians and having other people's opinions, especially surgically. When I had to do these really complicated cases I literally had no one else's opinion who had ever seen the situation before, other than the anesthesiologist. And I think that's really daunting because you're worried you're going cut a ureter or you know, hit a vessel and you're the only one who can decide that, so. It's nerve-wracking.\n\nI think the most obvious thing that I hadn't really ever seen before was destructive deliveries -- having to remove a full-term infant vaginally by destroying it I think is something you hear about but never do. It's pretty gruesome. Other than that, I think a lot of the medical conditions -- one was either just conditions I'd never seen before, or two was trying to figure out what these conditions were without the benefit of diagnostic tools. The things I'd never seen before would be -- certainly typhoid and cholera were in the environment, and we didn't know if anyone specifically had it. It was really hard to get testing and you had to go symptomatically. I'd heard a lot about cholera and had learned about it in medical school, but to actually diagnose it myself, I had no idea. And so I really relied on my hospital supervisor to help me with that, and typhoid especially I thought was really challenging diagnosis because you know, the diarrhea is not particularly specific and how would I know that someone had typhoid as opposed to some other form of diarrhea? Everyone had diarrhea. So, I had to call my hospital supervisor and really talk about it and then, you know, MSF has some books in the field that you can look it up in. And then thankfully there was the Internet and you can Google it. \n\nBesides that, I think it was conditions that maybe I had seen before but I couldn't figure out which condition it was from the symptomotology I had. I had a pregnancy that I couldn't work up because I couldn't do liver function tests or a kidney test or anything. I had a hematuria patient that was really dangerous -- she was very, very anemic and just had red blood in her urine and no way to work it up. So things like that, where you just had to treat empirically, and the patient could easily die if you didn't get it right.",

    "description": "Veronica Ades is an ob-gyn and MSF aid worker from New York City. For one month she was the only ob-gyn in MSF's obstetric project in Aweil, South Sudan. Here she talks about the challenges that came with this assignment and the team of midwives and other staff who supported her.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nBefore I left, I was warned that I might be put in, like, surgical situations that I'd never had to do before. That didn't necessarily happen to me. I think it came close -- things like an appendectomy or just have someone with a surgical abdomen that might not be obstetrical. Luckily we did have a surgical program a few hours away that we could send people to, so I didn't encounter that particular problem, but I do think that just in general, surgically, not having access to other obstetricians was very different for me. For example I had to do a C-hyst and the patient was already very sick. To open her abdomen and she's continually bleeding, and I had no one to check in with, when usually you would call for help -- I think that to me was a new experience. It wasn't a different surgery from what I'd been trained to do, but it's very different when you're alone. \n\nI think working with midwives is something I've always done here, but working with midwives who were placed in a different position than they have been. At home, most midwives are trained to do labor really well and delivery very well, but not really medical management of patients, and I think that's a big challenge for them. So for me, I had to become sort of a teacher of midwives who were very well trained in obstetrics to actually become, in some ways, partial doctors. And that was actually really fun for me, it was certainly a challenge. But for them it was the challenge.\n\nBeing on call 24/7 is very different from home. I mean, and at home you'll work an entire 24-hour shift, and that's pretty routine. But then you go home and you'll sleep and you'll know that you're not going to be called because someone else is on. But there, for an entire month, I was the only OBE and if something came in, it was all me. And I'd have periods where I was barely called, and I would just round and come home; and I would have periods where I just thought it was never going to end. I think I did eight C-sections in three days, and just round-the-clock, pretty much. I had another time when I had a C-hyst over all night, and then the next day I had to stay really late doing a rape evaluation, and some -- I forgot, something else that required only me. And it was -- you know, those things weren't surgical, but I had to be the person, and it was so tiring. I just thought, if something comes in tonight, I don't know what I'm going to do, I'm so tired. And thankfully nothing did, and the midwives that I worked with were great about trying to help me out and make sure that I was -- actually the whole team was great about trying to make sure that I was rested enough, but that's something that was new and challenging, was being on 24/7 when not your entire team was, just you.",

    "description": "Veronica Ades is an ob-gyn in New York City. During a one-month obstetric mission with MSF in South Sudan, she witnessed the largely preventable tragedies that occur in areas lacking access to maternal health care.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nSo, pretty early on when I got to South Sudan, we had a really difficult case and this was my hardest experience there. It was actually my first day and the OB who I was taking over from was still there. I was getting oriented or whatever, and she called me over into the OR and said I'm doing a vacuum, you should come and see how it goes. \n\nI ended up participating because it was so difficult. And the situation was an 18-year-old girl who was having her first baby and had come in with a stillbirth after laboring for four days at home. And she was already septic, blood pressure was low, pulse was really high, and she was getting antibiotics and actually pressers in the OR. They needed a vacuum to get the baby out. And it was really tough, and I actually ended up scrubbing in with the other OB and we really needed the force of two of us to get that baby out, but we didn't want to have to open her abdomen because that would just make her so much sicker. But we got it out, it actually went okay, and we examined her afterward and tried to see if anything was necrotic but it looked okay. And then we sent her to the ward and in the beginning she was doing ok: she was weak and infected, but talking and her parents were there taking care of her and then um but still very infected, and over the course of the next day, her blood pressure started dropping, and we knew this was probably from sepsis. We made her antibiotics more aggressive, and briefly the anesthesiologist thought it would be a good idea to put her on pressers, because her blood pressure was so low, and we talked that over after a few hours and the hospital supervisor really weighed in, I think, very importantly here and said, \"You know, we can't put everyone on pressers, we can't run an ICU, we don't have that capability, and if she isn't better, and isn't supporting her blood pressure after 24 hours, she really needs to do it on her own, because we can't, we can't support this for long.\" \n\nShe was right. And so we stopped the pressers and she just continued to be very infected, um, and over the next two days, she really decompensated. I don't think the pressers would've saved her -- I think she was just too sick -- but it was really, really hard to watch her die. She just became unconscious and then she -- I think we had to put an NG tube. And her parents just stayed, like, literally sitting in her bed. And by the end her breathing was so labored and it was painful -- like it looked very painful even though she was unconscious -- and I wanted to do something to help her and I could've here, you know? I could've intubated her. I could've sedated her. but you can't -- you can't do anything there, so you just have to watch her die. And her parents at the end were sitting on her bed, each one holding a hand, and just watching her. And when I knew she was going to die, I told them that and I said, \"It's really, really likely she's going to die,\" and we had a translator explain to the parents. And they were accepting; they understood at that point and they said, \"You know, it's in God's hands,\" but to me that was tough. An 18-year-old shouldn't be dying having a baby. So that was hard. I think, you know, you rethink, \"What could I have done differently?\" and I don't know. I know that she would've lived if she'd given birth in New York, but, I don't know that in that setting that we could've done anything differently. \n\nIt's tough. Maternal mortality really boils my blood because it's entirely preventable, almost entirely preventable. That's a perfect example: she's a young, healthy woman, and if she'd come in after one day of labor instead of four, she'd be alive. I don't know that you ever make it go away. The hospital supervisor actually said something I think that's really true: she said, \"Every doctor has their own personal graveyard in their mind,\" and it's true. Like, you hold them with you forever and you think about them and nobody else knows it's there, but you, you carry it.",

    "description": "Ob-Gyn Veronica Ades was surprised at what she was able to do on her first assignment with MSF. Here she talks about performing a hysterectomy during a C-section in MSF's obstetric project in Aweil, South Sudan.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nI think there were two situations where I surprised myself in what I was able to do. I think the first was the C-hyst that I had to do. I hadn't done one in residency, and of course I've done hysterectomies, but they're so much more challenging during a C-section. And this woman just clearly needed it. She had a ruptured uterus and she was bleeding to death, and I was super-nervous, you know? I knew I had pieces of the skills, but I'd never put it together in that one situation. But there was -- she only had me, and I was there and I just kept thinking about what my teachers had told me of things like, you know, do what you can do until you're done, you know? Or, establish normal anatomy, or, just take it one step at a time, and things like that really, really helped. And so I was there, with her abdomen open, and the anesthesiologist going, \"When is she going to stop bleeding...?\" and I just said \"Okay, I can do this, so let me do this right now. And I can do this next, and let me do it right now.\" And I kept going until I think the most nerve-wracking part was when I was at the point where I had to transect the uterine arteries. I was nervous about her ureters; I couldn't see them. And I had used all the techniques I knew to try to identify them and I couldn't find them, and yet if she continued bleeding she wasn't going to need them because she was going to be dead. \n\nSo I said okay, you know, I have these skills, I've done all of these things that I know how to do, and I just need to go ahead and do this. And it was hard; my heart was really beating as I clamped her uterines, but it's fine, she has two intact ureters and that's great, and I think it was -- it just took me saying, I really do know how to do this. Maybe I've never done this particular situation, but I've done all the pieces that are required, and I did it. Alone, with no other obstetricians, and that's amazing.",

    "description": "Veronica Ades is an ob-gyn in New York City. While on a one-month obstetric mission with MSF in South Sudan, she sought to earn the trust of patients affected by years of conflict.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nI don't know if this is a direct effect of conflict, but I think that women's empowerment was quite strikingly low. It was sometimes hard to even get women to be willing to consent for themselves, um, which is difficult, coming from New York, where we expect the women to consent for herself, and her family can be involved, but she actually has to make the decision. And often, she herself was not really willing to do that, um, and often deferred to her husband, and for me ethically, it was important that she understand what was happening. \n\nAnd then, you know, I think another thing was that, I realized how connected I was to this nonverbal communication, obviously I don't speak Dinka, but when you don't speak the language at least you can make eye contact and smile. And I would assume that this was a result of chronic conflict, but people are very, very stoic and there's not a reflexive smile. And I realized that to connect with someone nonverbally, it's hard to do that when they don't smile as they're shaking your hand or immediately smile in response to your smile. And I think it's just cultural, but that was sort of striking when I got there. And it made it harder for me, or much more challenging, to find a way to get my patients to trust me without me being able to say anything to them, and I don't know that this is a result of war -- maybe it's just cultural -- but it seemed very striking, and more so than other places that I've been that are stoic and that are suffering, but not in active conflict.",

    "description": "Marc Levin, a family physician in New York City, has completed MSF missions in Chad, Niger, and the Central African Republic. His assignments with MSF brought him into contact with diseases he had never before treated in the United States, such as rabies, measles, and sleeping sickness.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nSo, there were a number of diseases that I treated during my missions with MSF that I hadn't seen in the U.S. and I learned a lot about.  Some things I had certainly heard about or learned about in school, but never actually treated.  Things like rabies, measles -- there always seemed to be measles outbreaks where I was working, both in Niger and the Central African Republic -- meningitis, and in the Central African Republic, part of our project was to address the high prevalence of African sleeping sickness.  \n\nThe African sleeping sickness project was really interesting because obviously that's not something we see here.  What we were doing was going into villages that had high prevalence.  Some of the villages had 15 percent prevalence of African sleeping sickness and we would go in and do a mass screening of everyone.  So they would get a finger prick blood test.  It is spread by the tsetse fly, so if anyone in village has it and they get bit by a fly, it can be spread to anyone in the village.  So really the goal is to check everyone on the village, because if you eradicate it from everyone, then no matter how many times the tsetse fly bites, it won't spread the disease.  So the treatment started with mass screening of villages across a huge area in the northern Central African Republic.  If people were positive, then they had further workup, often lumbar punctures.  They would often get ganglion cysts that we would feel and they would get biopsied and then they would be admitted for a week for inpatient IV treatment. \n\nAfter that they would need surveillance over two years.  So at six months, 12 months and then two years, they would have lumbar punctures.  So we would go back into the villages and really track these patients and repeat their lumbar punctures to see how they were feeling.  There were a fair number where there was a recurrence and then we would bring them to be retreated.  We reduced the prevalence from about 15 percent in some of the villages to less than 0.5 percent since 2008, I think the project started.  So it was an incredibly successful project.  For me as a physician to really learn and feel comfortable about a new disease that I had never seen was really interesting.",

    "description": "Marc Levin, a family physician in New York City, has completed MSF missions in Chad, Niger, and the Central African Republic. Here he talks about the challenge of diagnosing and treating patients in the field, and how he coped with sometimes limited equipment and diagnostic tests.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nI think that a lot of the things that you see with MSF are often things that you see here, in the U.S., just overseas they can often be fatal.  So things like upper respiratory infections and diarrhea in children.  You probably see more meningitis, tuberculosis, things like that.  But generally I felt I had what I needed.  There were often cases where I just wasn't clear on the diagnosis, where someone was confused.  There was one case in Chad of a teenage girl who just couldn't walk and just had pain in her legs, but the exam was normal and we had no idea why.  Children with severe respiratory illness where it would certainly be helpful to have an x-ray or a CAT scan or an EBG to figure that out.  I had another case that was in Chad where a woman came in just completely confused and we had no idea why.  Certainly something like a head CT or an MRI would be helpful in those cases, but I do feel like the vast majority of cases I had what I needed.  The common diagnoses were very common.  So malnutrition, malaria, during an epidemic, meningitis, respiratory infections, diarrhea.  I think those were the big things that I saw.  \n\nI think that there are cases that I will always remember that I wonder, Did I make the right call and did I treat for the right things?  I think often what happens with those cases is you sort of have your differential and you treat for the top three things.  So people might be on multiple antibiotics or multiple medicines where you are really trying to cover your bases.  \n\nWe had a patient, a 14-year-old girl in southeastern Chad and she just came in and she had leg pain and I think it was one-sided, unilateral leg pain.  She had trouble walking and moving her leg.  Her exam was completely normal.  Actually I got a second opinion because my supervising doctor had come from the capitol that week, so I had her look at the leg as well and do an exam and she could actually do a more extensive exam as a woman, because culturally there were parts of the exam that I couldn't do on a 14-year-old girl.  So she did a more extensive exam and everything was normal, everything was fine except the patient said she couldn't walk and she had pain in her leg.  In the U.S. she would have had an x-ray and blood cultures and maybe an MRI to look for acute fractures or osteomyelitus.  Of course, in a displaced persons camp in Chad we didn't have any of that.  We made our best guess and we treated her for osteomyelitus, a bone infection, and we gave her antibiotics IV and about a week later she was better and she went home.  I don't think we'll ever know what that was, but that is often how you have to practice medicine with MSF when you're stumped.",

    "description": "Marc Levin, a family physician in New York City, has completed MSF missions in Chad, Niger, and the Central African Republic. Here he talks about the added responsibilities he took on while working with MSF and the way he got more accustomed to the workload with each successive mission.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nSo I think with MSF I can speak as my role as a physician like all people with MSF you feel, you always feel you are a little stretched beyond what you're used to and you are always going to be asked to do more than you are used to in the U.S. and probably do things outside your comfort zone to some degree.  I think as a physician, I was certainly asked to do some things that I would never be asked to do here.  For example, in Chad I was the only physician for 35,000 people, so I was on call all the time, which here in the U.S., I don't think anyone would really ask me to do.  I think in southeastern Chad there wasn't an obstetrician.  I'm a family doctor, so the midwife would do most of the deliveries, but if there were complications, she would call me and so I often had to make decisions about obstetrical care that I would never be asked to do here in the U.S.  Decisions about interventions or assisted deliveries or decisions about C-sections -- things that here in the U.S. I would always have an obstetrician to call upon, but there the nearest surgeon was five hours away by car, so I was sort of the most qualified person in that environment.  \n\nI think non-medically, you have a lot more responsibilities as a physician.  Often you are overseeing the projects or really ensuring quality of care.  Making decisions about staff, about disciplinary actions, about staffing issues, about sort of the direction that a project is going to go in.  Often you are the person who's making those big decisions. \n\nI think in the U.S. we rely on more administrators or CEOs of health centers to make those decisions, and really with MSF, you're often the person who's making large decisions for the project, at least the medical piece of the project.  \n\nI actually really liked it.  I like being in charge.  Part of me, I felt like this is crazy.  You know I was on call all the time.  I arrived and I had, sort of training.  I overlapped with the doctor that was there previously, so we overlapped for about three days or five days or something, so that was my real training and orientation to the project in Chad.  I was really running the medical project after that.  Part of me thought it was insane to be on call all the time, but part of me really liked it.  I felt like I came to MSF wanting to work and wanting the experience and wanting to be really engaged in the project, so in that sense it was really useful.  I think after two or three months I was pretty exhausted, though.  But like I said before, I think you are always going to be stretched with MSF.  I think that it really pushes you and you come out a better person, a better physician after you go through that experience.  \n\nI think with each mission it got easier, because I understand what is expected.  I think even before it was clear that I would work hard.  It was clear, my responsibilities.  It was clear from my orientations in the New York office as well as meeting with people at the desk in Paris, as well as meeting with people in the capitol.  Really I was clear what the job description was, so I don't think that was really a surprise.  I felt like I got used to it.  I feel like I liked it.  I came back for more missions.  I feel each one was easier because I understood.",

    "description": "MSF aid worker, Marc Levin, has completed several missions with MSF while also maintaining his job as a family physician in New York City. Here he explains how careful planning -- both professionally and financially -- allows him to balance his work with MSF with his career in the United States.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\nIt was always my dream to work for MSF, and so it was important for me to find ways to make MSF work with my career.  I think the way that I most make it work is planning ahead, really speaking to my employer and finding times when it will work for both of us, when I can go away for periods.  I think financially it is often a challenge because certainly I get paid much less when I work with MSF than when I work in the U.S.  But I think in terms of making choices in my life and living pretty frugally so that I can go on a mission for six months where I don't make a lot of money and still cover my costs here.  \n\nI live in a small apartment here in New York; I sublet my apartment when I go away.  I'm careful about how I spend my money when I'm here so that I can have the MSF experience.  I think the biggest thing is finding an employer or finding a place that will be supportive of your work if it is something that you want to build into your career.  I think that's probably the biggest trick.  And it takes a lot of planning. \n\nI might want to go tomorrow, but it's just not feasible and I have to wait six months or a year or two years before it's the right time.  But for me, that's what's worked in terms of me maintaining a career here and also maintaining a career with MSF.",

Countries where Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works will lose their donor support to pay for vaccines soon, and will have to decide which killer diseases they can and can't afford to protect their children against.\nMSF is asking the GAVI Alliance to open up their discounted vaccine pricing to humanitarian actors that are often best placed to respond to vaccinating people in crisis.\nRead more here - http://bit.ly/117Wxy0\nThe GAVI Alliance is an international public-private partnership whose stated mission is to increase access to immunization for children in poor countries. GAVI co-finances the cost of vaccines with qualifying countries. Participants include governments of developing and donor countries, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, research and technical agencies, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other philanthropic organizations.",

It cost $1.37 to vaccinate a child 10 years ago, now it's $38.80. That's a whopping 2,700 percent increase. So how do we decide how many vaccines children need?

Now, Somali staff work alongside MSF staff from as far away as China and Denmark so that patients with medical emergencies receive quality health care. \n\nThe hospital's emergency room is the point of entry for many patients. More than 4,500 people were seen there during the first nine months of 2012. This first video in a series of three looks at the emergency room.",

    "description": "Francis Gatluak was one of the first people Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) ever treated for kala azar, a neglected disease also known as visceral leishmaniasis. Francis came from a small village in South Sudan's Unity State, still a conflict area today. When he was young, the men and boys fled the village to avoid being killed by fighters from either side of the conflict. As the war continued through the late 1980s, famine struck. And people became victims of an epidemic outbreak of kala azar, a rare and neglected tropical disease, transmitted by the bite of the sandfly. Left untreated, it's deadly 95 percent of the time. When people began dying in the MSF health clinic in Leer - including Francis's brother -  no one knew what was killing them. By the time Francis got sick, they had diagnosed the disease as kala azar. When Francis became better, he stayed at the hospital and began working with MSF, first as a translator, and then he began to learn how to provide treatment. He also offered valuable information to the MSF team. He knew that the majority of patients were coming from a famine-stricken area of Unity State called Duar. Nearly all the patients in Leer, and hundreds more other displaced people treated by MSF, had all come from the area around Duar. He urged MSF to go to Duar and provide treatment there. His persistence paid off. MSF established a clinic in Duar in 1990. Because of Francis's far-reaching\ninitiative, around 10,000 people were treated for kala azar, in the project's first year alone. Francis now works as a nurse. He's currently in his 23rd year with MSF. \nThis video was screened at the Fulbright Prize ceremony on September 8, 2012, when MSF was given this prestigious award.

Another was shot in the shoulder during a protest, severing the nerves. The third man suffered a gunshot injury that left him in a coma for four days. \n\nWithout official authorization to operate inside Syria, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) continues to support networks of Syrian doctors in Homs, Derah, Hama, Damascus and Idlib with supplies and medicines from neighboring countries. MSF doctors treat those who were wounded or tortured in Syria at a surgical hospital in Amman. Teams also provide primary health care and psychological support to Syrian refugees in Lebanon.\n\nMay 2012 © MSF\nFor more information, visit www.doctorswithoutborders.org.",

On June 12, Amal was brought to a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) mobile clinic at a refugee transit site called 'Kilometer 18' in Upper Nile State. She was thin, weak and coughing, and she could barely walk. Amal was immediately examined, an IV drip was inserted into her arm, and she was transferred to MSF's hospital in the Jamam refugee camp. MSF health staff suspect that she has tuberculosis and will start her on TB treatment soon. Amal weighs just 32 kilograms, or 80 pounds, and she is too weak to speak, so her cousin Hassan told her story on her behalf.",

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Medical Team Leader Dr. Erna Rijnierse described the situation in Maban on June 14. \n\nTRANSCRIPT: \"We are here at the clinic at kilometer 18. People have moved here since yesterday. As you can see there is a lot of patients at the moment. There is also a measles vaccination campaign going on which increases even more the number of people. \n\n\"People are in a very bad state. They have been walking for seven hours yesterday withot any water or nothing. Shelters have not been done yet. Water is being provided by MSF at the moment, but a lot of people still drink water from shallow places. We see a lot of diarrheal diseases, both bloody and not-bloody diarrhea. The other thing we see is malnutrition. A lot of kids haven't had proper food because they have been on the road for almost a month, up to six weeks.\n\n\"We are facing challenges in every single direction. Everything is not easy here. We are trying to increase our capacity to see as much people as we can. We are doing health promotion to stop people from drinking the bad water. We're doing everything that we can.\"",

Originally conceived as a temporary solution to shelter refugees of Somalia's civil war, the three neighboring sites that are referred to collectively as one refugee camp are now 20 years old, and have become a permanent home for the majority of people who have sought shelter there. \n\nWith a new influx of refugees last year due to increased fighting and hunger in Somalia, conditions for people inside and stranded outside the camps deteriorated to a shocking level before obstacles to increasing aid were resolved. \n\nWhile the numbers of deaths and malnutrition levels have dropped since then, living conditions in the camp remain precarious. The safety of those living in the camps and those assisting them have deteriorated dramatically with regular outbreaks of violence and attacks on refugees and aid workers, including the kidnapping of two Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff.

    "description": "In 2006 the drug company Novartis took the Indian government to court over its patent law, in a move that threatened access to affordable medicines produced in India for millions of people across the developing world. The company wanted to get the law changed so that they could more easily extend the patents on their products, and stop generic companies from producing the same medicines at a fraction of the price.\n\nMSF's Drop the Case campaign, launched in response to this move, gathered nearly half a million signatures calling on the company to drop its case. But six years later, the legal battle continues. India's Supreme Court is now due to give the final judgement on the case in March.\n\nThis week, MSF joined with activists from Health GAP, Act Up, and others to protest the Novartis lawsuit at the company's headquarters in New York. \n\n\nLearn more about the case and MSF's efforts to protect access to essential medicines: http://www.msfaccess.org/STOPnovartis/",

I was treating the wounded in Syria. At first, when the demonstrations started, we sent the injured to public hospitals. But then we were told that injured demonstrators were being tortured or left untreated. Many were even killed. Doctors are working in difficult security conditions and in tough medical conditions, too. Makeshift hospitals tend to be one or two rooms somewhere near a demonstration area. In addition to that, there's all the security pressure and difficulty in reaching certain areas. Doctors who treat the wounded are also being harassed by security forces. Security is what worries doctors most. It's difficult. The risk of being arrested is big. But despite that risk, many doctors are putting their lives in danger in order to fulfill their medical oath. It is difficult to find sterilized medical materials. Due to our limited means and the numbers of wounded, we have to resort to rudimentary medical practices. We are forced to use medical materials and perform medical acts that are far from the safe surgical procedures we would usually carry out. Activists and protestors don't really have any medical resources. They don't have ambulances, for example. The injured are transported by their friends and fellow protesters. When we receive serious casualties, a patient who needs to be hospitalized, we have two options: Either we let him die, or we send him to hospital not knowing what will become of him. Many hospitals are encircled and placed under tight control when security forces are informed that a casualty is due to arrive from a demonstration area.\"",

In the book Humanitarian Negotiations Revealed: The MSF Experience, published by Columbia University Press, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) takes a critical look at how its teams have negotiated to gain access to people in urgent need of lifesaving medical assistance in the 40 years since MSF was founded, including recent case studies from Somalia, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar.\nOn January 31, 2012, MSF hosted a live online discussion of these issues featuring several experienced MSF aid workers, who shared their first-hand experiences from past assignments. They described the often complicated process of negotiating with governments, armed groups, public health officials, international actors, community leaders, and local officials; as well as the struggle to define what compromises are acceptable in order to run programs in crisis zones.",

At the UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS beginning June 8, officials are expected to hammer out a blueprint for the next decade of the global response to the epidemic. The meeting takes place exactly 30 years since the discovery of HIV/AIDS and ten years after HIV/AIDS treatment started in developing countries. \r\n\r\nIt also follows closely on the heels of an immensely important medical finding. Just a few weeks ago new research supported by the US National Institutes of Health proved conclusively that treatment can reduce the transmission of HIV from one person to another by 96 percent. In other words, HIV treatment is also HIV prevention. This is something MSF has begun to see in its HIV projects, and having scientific confirmation of this evidence provides a crucial piece of support going forward.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit msf.org to find the MSF web site in your home country.

The WHO has just revised its guidelines calling for artesunate as the treatment of choice for children with severe malaria, and Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is making the switch. But to save hundreds of thousands more young lives across the continent, the countries where the disease is endemic also need to make the move from quinine to artesunate in their national treatment guidelines.

Teams are also on the Tunisian border providing support to people who have fled the conflict. On April 3, MSF evacuated 71 patients in need of emergency care by boat from Misrata to Tunisia. In the coastal city of Misrata people are surrounded on all sides by the fighting and what health facilities are functioning are overflowing with patients. The population of Benghazi has also been affected by the fighting. In March tensions became extremely heated prior to air strikes against Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi by international forces. With the security of his team in question, MSF's emergency coordinator Simon Burroughs and his colleagues temporarily withdraw to Egypt until they could ensure relative safety. The team re-entered Benghazi on March 26 and they continue to meet emergency medical needs there.\n\nLearn more about MSF's work in Libya. Go to msf.org to find the MSF web site in your home country.

    "title": "Libya: MSF Evacuates Wounded by Boat for Emergency Care",
    "description": "Some images might be disturbing. Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) evacuated 71 patients by boat Sunday, April 3, from the Libyan city of Misrata, where ongoing violence has overwhelmed medical facilities with the wounded. Among the evacuated patients were three people on life support, 11 people suffering from major trauma, and many others with abdominal wounds and open fractures. Intensive medical care was provided on board as the boat sailed to Tunisia, where it arrived the morning of April 4. \"We managed to dock at Misrata on Sunday afternoon, despite intense fighting in the city over the past few days,\" said Helmy Mekaoui, an MSF doctor who coordinated the medical evacuation. \"The violence caused an influx of wounded people and it was fortunate we could be there and get them onboard.\" The hospital in Misrata reportedly came under bombardment early Sunday. Remaining functional health clinics in the city are overflowing with severely injured patients and are running desperately short of medical supplies. MSF also donated six tons of emergency medical materials to the Libyan Health Committee in Misrata—including surgical kits for 1,000 operations, drugs, sterilization materials, and intravenous fluids—in order to help health facilities in the city cope with the influx of war-wounded people. The boat arrived early today at the Tunisian port city of Sfax and the patients were transferred to hospitals to receive urgent medical care. The 11-person MSF team on board—among them seven Tunisian medical personnel who volunteered to be part of the operation—included seven doctors, three nurses, and one psychologist. Tunisian health authorities organized the transfer of the patients to several health facilities. The medical evacuation and treatment of the patients was made possible thanks to the support and efforts of medical personnel in Misrata, who risked their safety. The evacuation was carried out independently from all the parties involved in the conflict, in accordance with MSF's principles of neutrality and impartiality. As conflict continues inside Libya, MSF is scaling up its assistance to people affected by the violence, regardless of their affiliation or origin. The organization is reinforcing its teams on the ground, sending additional medical supplies, and facilitating the evacuation of wounded and sick patients. However, it remains very concerning that many injured people reportedly cannot safely access life-saving medical care without further risking their lives. MSF reiterates its call on all belligerents to allow unhindered access to medical assistance for all Libyans affected by the violence. MSF also calls for the respect of medical facilities, healthcare personnel, and vehicles transporting patients. MSF in Libya: In the eastern city of Benghazi, MSF teams are providing medicine and medical supplies to health facilities, including anaesthetics and surgical materials for wounded patients, in coordination with the Libyan Medical Committee. So far, 44 tons of supplies have arrived in the country, with more on the way. MSF teams on the ground are being reinforced with additional medical personnel who will provide nursing care training. On 21 March, MSF sent a shipment of surgical kits for 300 wounded patients to the hospital in Misrata. In Ras Ajdir, Tunisia, at the border with Libya, MSF teams have been providing psychological support to people fleeing the conflict. They are also working in the transit camp at Choucha, where people are awaiting repatriation or resettlement. From the onset of violence in Libya, MSF's priority has been to access areas with the largest needs.",

    "description": "MSF has been in the west African country since December, responding to the violence that followed contested elections there. Over the past three months, as the dispute has deepened and pushed the nation to the brink of civil war, conditions for the population have gotten progressively worse. Insecurity due to the fighting in Abidjan, a city in the east with about 5 million residents, and around several towns in the west, combined with international sanctions on Ivory Coast have driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and severely hindered access to essential services—including health care. \n\nIn the West, MSF is providing primary healthcare in the towns of Man, Guiglo, Duékoué, Danané, Bin-Houyé and Bangolo, and supporting hospitals in that area. MSF teams in Abidjan are providing emergency medical services close to the fighting in a ministry of health hospital in the neighborhood of Abobo Sud. And in Liberia, teams are aiding refugees and residents with primary healthcare. \n\nWelcome to the MSF Frontline Report podcast.

Here MSf has established a decentralised model of care, whihc is based around the patient and aims at improving outcomes through diagnosing more people and starting them on treatment earlier. This is enabled by the model where patients are able to get treatment from their local clinics with a better treatment regiment, better diagnostic technics and more support for the patient.\r\n\r\nShot: March 2011, Khayelitsha township, South Africa\r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nDOCTOR JENNIFER HUGHES, DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS (DR-TB) COORDINATOR: Khayelitsha is one of the biggest townships in South Africa; it has a population of about half a million and it is located about 30 or 40 kilometres outside of Cape Town. It has one of the highest rates of TB (tuberculosis) and HIV in the country. So the decentralized model of care in Khayelitsha, is based around the patient and it aims at improving outcomes through diagnosing more people and starting people on treatment and that is enabled by the model where we allow patients to access treatment from their local clinics with a better treatment regiment, better diagnostic techniques and more support for the patient.\r\n\r\nTEMBINKOSI QONDELA, SUCCESSFULLY TREATED PATIENT: I had a first test and I was told I had normal TB. Then I was put on treatment for a month. Then I was told later on that I had drug-resistant \r\n\r\nDOCTOR JENNIFER HUGHES: We see different types of TB, apart from the regular drug sensitive TB, we also see drug resistant TB, which can be divided into multidrug-resistant TB, MDR TB, and extreme drug resistant TB, which is EXDR TB. \r\n\r\nMr. QONDELA: To take the MDR treatment. I could decide to go to the hospital, I chose to take the treatment from the clinic and then I was referred to the support group which is a drug-resistant support group run by MSF. For me being home was much better then being at the hospital, I was still there for my children, I was still there for the things that I had to do. So, even though I was sick, it did not affect me in a way that I felt paralyzed and not able to do anything. I think, being at hospital would have meant that I could not do the things I was able to do.\r\n\r\nDR. HUGHES: One of the main aspects of our program is support for the patients while they are taking their DRTB treatment. So we have a social assistant and we also have counsellors. The counsellors see patients on a one on one basis when they start their treatment, to provide intensified counselling for them. They also carry out home visits where they visit their home and they give infection control advice to the family, they educate the family and they reiterate the messages they gave in the first counselling session, and they are also used to track defaulting patients, if they have stopped taking their medicines for what ever reason. So by decentralizing drug resistant TB treatment, people have access treatment sooner and they are able to stay in the communities where they can get support from their families to continue their treatment.",

It can also prevent illnesses from occuring that can have disastrous consequences -- like obstetric fistulas. If a woman is experiencing complications during delivery and does not receive obstetric care, a fistula can form. A fistula is an opening between the bladder and the vagina, or between the rectum and the vagina. Close to a million and a half women in Africa suffer from them. Most of these women are shunned by society. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) runs a project at the Masisi General Hospital in North Kivu Province. Working with the Congolese health authorities, MSF offers surgery, primary and secondary health care, and support for victims of sexual violence.

Many must cross over illegally since they do not have passports. Not long ago, a new term was coined to describe people in their situation -- survival migrants.  These are vulnerable migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers; people who may not be fleeing a war, but who are fleeing economic hardship, a pronounced shortage of employment opportunities, a crumbling health care system, or political violence. \r\n\r\nWelcome to the MSF Frontline Report podcast for February 2, 2011.

While one in five patients under treatment for moderately resistant strains of the disease do not survive, patients with extensively resistant cases, if they can get treatment at all, usually must rely on less effective and more toxic medicines, with lower success rates. For these reasons and others, Xoliswa Armans is a remarkable patient.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the MSF Frontline Report podcast for December 23, 2010.

    "description": "MSF began treating adults living with HIV in developing countries in the 1990s. Ten years ago - in December of 2000 -- MSF teams also began treating children with antiretrovirals, or ARVs. Over the past decade, however, there has been little, or no, progress in key areas such as developing diagnostics for children under 18 months or creating medicines better adapted for children. In addition to these urgent medical needs, another side of providing care to child patients has been neglected as well. That's patient support -- it's a combination of mental health care, education about the disease, and help to get basic needs met, so the patient understands his disease, has what he needs to fight it, and will continue to fight it for the rest of his life. For children, this kind of support is crucial and it needs to be specific to each individual.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the November 30th, 2010, MSF Frontline Reports podcast. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF, is an independent medical humanitarian aid organization.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this story and to learn more about MSF or Doctors Without Borders, please visit msf.org to find the MSF web site in your home country. You can read the entire Eneza Ujumbe at doctorswithoutborders.org. Please send any comments and questions for the podcast to msfpodcast@msf.org. MSF is an independent medical humanitarian aid organization that delivers emergency assistance to people affected by wars, epidemics, and natural or man-made disasters in more than 60 countries around the world.",

Un pas important vient d'être franchi, puisqu'une première molécule va être déposée dans ce mécanisme. \r\nPierre Chirac, Pharmacien, MSF (en français)\r\n« Il y a une institution tout à fait importante, le National Institute of Health - donc c'est le principal, c'est le gros organisme de recherche publique aux Etats Unis - qui a offert à cette communauté de brevet, le brevet qu'il possédait sur l'anti-retroviral Darunavir. \r\nC'est un premier pas -- même s'il n'est pas suffisant - vers la production de médicament à bas coût pour les pays en développement.\r\nPierre Chirac, Pharmacien, MSF (en français)\r\nPour l'instant ça permet rien parce qu'en fait, sur le Darunavir, il y a d'autres brevets possédés en particulier par Tibotec, du groupe américain Johnson and Johnson. Mais de toute façon on va être très souvent dans ce cas là, c'est à dire des médicaments pour lesquels il y a plusieurs brevets. Donc il est important que les autres titulaires de brevet mettent leurs droits dans ce patent pool. \r\nC'est malgré tout une avancée importante. Car si d'autres suivent l'exemple, cela permettra de mettre au point de nouvelles combinaisons de médicaments et rendre plus accessibles les traitements contre le VIH/Sida.\r\nPierre Chirac, Pharmacien, MSF (en français)\r\nMSF a salué cette annonce, (...) parce que c'est vraiment un geste très important et à encourager qu'un organisme public cède ses droits à cette communauté de brevets. Et puis ça incite aussi, ça met une pression plus forte sur les firmes pharmaceutiques pour qu'elles mettent à disposition aussi leurs brevets. \r\nMSF traite actuellement plus de 160 000 personnes atteintes du VIH/Sida. 80% des médicaments ARV utilisés dans les projets de l'ONG sont produits par des compagnies génériques indiennes.",

The patients form small groups to support each other, nominating one member to pick up their ARVs and collectively helping each other adhere to the treatment program. This creates a support network for the patients and alleviates strain on Mozambique's under-resourced health system. It also provides a model for scaling up ARV treatment in developing countries with high HIV/AIDS burdens.",

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) had been working in Haiti since 1991 and was thus already on the ground. Moments after the earth shook, in fact, MSF staff was treating patients.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the time since, MSF's efforts in Haiti have not let up. Here, we both look back and look forward at the medical and humanitarian needs in Haiti and MSF's activities in the country, focusing in particular on surgery and post-operative care, access to primary care, access to specialized care, and living conditions. Our staff and donors have made possible a response unprecedented in MSF's history of responding to medical emergencies. But we proceed knowing that a great deal of work remains to be done.",

The US Government Accountability Office has found that the current system of sending domestically produced blended flour overseas costs as much as 34 percent more than buying food products locally.

WIC supports a quarter of all American children from birth to age four and has been shown to have dramatically reduced anemia and the rate of low birth weight. The access to nutritious, enriching foods that WIC provides to young American children is a stark contrast to the nutritionally devoid blend of fortified flour dumped on starving children outside the country.  \r\n\r\nDoctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and VII Photo present Starved for Attention, a multimedia campaign to uncover the hidden crisis of childhood malnutrition.

They lack access to proper health care and shelter and face physical and verbal abuse, police harassment and xenophobic attacks. For these migrants, proper legal status is often difficult to obtain, if not impossible. Gangs prey on them when they cross the border into South Africa and in the derelict buildings where they find temporary housing. As a result, many face further threats living in dangerous conditions, particularly in Johannesburg. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing health care to these vulnerable people in Musina, a town on the border with Zimbabwe, and in Johannesburg.",

MSF also stresses that such services need to be truly accessible, with guarantees for confidentiality and the offer of comprehensive care. \r\n\r\nLearn more: \r\nhttp://www.msf.org/shatteredlives",

The organization protests the order in the strongest of terms and appeals to the government to repeal these decisions and allow MSF to resume independent and impartial humanitarian assistance immediately.",

On May 13, MSF set up a stabilization center to provide 24-hour medical care to severely malnourished children suffering from complications such as malaria or pneumonia in Ropi, Oromiya region. Since then two more centers have been set up in Senbete Shinquille and Shashemene, Oromiya region. In total 927 children have been admitted to these three centers, with 290 currently receiving care.\r\n\r\nMany of them are suffering from kwashiorkor—a form of edema caused by malnutrition, which manifests in liquid retention in the legs and feet. Kwashiorkor is a serious condition that can lead to death from heart failure or other complications.\r\n\r\nChildren who are not suffering from complications are treated on an outpatient basis in 'outpatient therapeutic programs. They are provided with therapeutic food on a weekly basis, but are able to stay at home with their families. They return to these outpatient centers every week to be monitored by MSF medical staff and can be referred to a stabilization centre if necessary. In Oromiya MSF has eleven such outpatient centers in various locations throughout the region.\r\n\r\nOn June 2, MSF teams also started working in the Kambata zone of SNNPR. One stabilization center has been set up in Kachabira district. As of June 13, 150 children were receiving medical care there. Four outpatient centers have also been established; two in Kachabira district and two in Hadero district. In the last two weeks, more than 900 severely malnourished children have been admitted into these programs and are receiving therapeutic food.\r\n\r\nIn the coming days MSF will continue to expand its activities by increasing the number of outpatient centers in both Oromiya and SNNPR. In addition, MSF teams will continue to carry out assessments in order to identify the worst affected areas and respond where necessary.",
