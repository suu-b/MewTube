    "description": "🌙 Pull up a chair and join my late-night salon...\n\nI’m winding down and thinking out loud about Eugene Wigner’s “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.” \n\nWe drift from Ramanujan’s intuition and Banach–Tarski weirdness to gauge symmetries (why U(1) → photon, SU(3) → 8 gluons), Dirac’s equation → positron, and detours through Tegmark, Wolfram, and Penrose. I also pitch an evolutionary angle: maybe our brains like consistency because it kept us alive.\n\nIs math’s spooky accuracy in physics actually surprising… or exactly what you’d expect in a consistent universe? Leave your take—I’ll read them with my bedtime tea. ☕🐈 \n\nPour yourself something warm, get comfortable as we meander around these topics in this relaxed salon:\n\n🔮 Why do abstract mathematical symbols predict real particles?\n🗿 Are we discovering math or inventing it?\n🪐 Is reality itself mathematical, or is that just how we see it?\n🕉️ Intuition vs. symbol-pushing (Ramanujan's divine dreams)\n🎭 Banach-Tarski & the Axiom of Choice (getting two from one)\n🎲 Wigner's puzzle: prediction beyond description\n✨ Dirac's equation → positron discovery\n🌀 Gauge symmetry: U(1) ↔ photon; SU(3) ↔ 8 gluons\n🧬 Fields, generators, and \"are particles just symmetries?\"\n🎯 Should we be surprised? Selection bias & survivorship\n🏛️ Tegmark, Wolfram, Penrose—competing philosophies\n🧠 Evolution, beauty, and why consistency feels right\n\n\nIf you’re new here:\nI’m Lisha Li, founder/CEO of Rosebud AI. After hours I intend on hosting lo-fi salons on philosophy, physics and math—with occasional cat appearances.\n\nSweet dreams and deeper questions,\nLisha\n\nHashtags:\n#LateNightSalon #Wigner #PhilosophyOfMath #PhilosophyOfPhysics #GaugeTheory #Dirac #Ramanujan #BanachTarski #StandardModel #SU3 #Higgs #Tegmark #Wolfram #Penrose #TwistorTheory #Tegmark #Wolfram #ComputationalUniverse #EvolutionaryCognition #MathPredictsPhysics #ChatGPT #ScienceYouTube #LateNightSalon #PhilosophyOfMath #PhilosophyOfPhysics #Math #Physics #Wigner #UnreasonableEffectiveness #GaugeTheory #Dirac #Ramanujan #BanachTarski #AxiomOfChoice #StandardModel #SU3 #Higgs",

    "description": "One of ChatGPT's creators just raised $300 million at a $1B+to valuation to build an army of robot scientists. This isn't hype—it's AI's leap from bits to atoms.\n\nIn this video, I break down why I invested in Periodic Labs and why their autonomous labs could unlock room-temperature superconductors and materials we've only dreamed of. Led by Liam Fedus (one of the creators of ChatGPT at OpenAI) and Ekin Dogus Cubuk (who led materials science and chemistry at DeepMind), they're solving this fundamental problem: while language models learned from trillions of tokens on the internet, the physical world lacks that data.\n\nThey're building robotic labs that run experiments 1000x faster than humans, generating the data needed to train AI for materials discovery. Plus, they're developing AI systems to synthesize decades of existing research to guide what experiments to run next.\n \nWe dive into investor Slater Stich's breakdown of why this is the moment for this company—from the talent bringing together creators of attention mechanisms and GPT with world-class chemists, to what it actually takes to build labs that can synthesize thousands of materials per day. This is what happens when AI leaders from OpenAI and DeepMind team up to tackle the physical world. Slater also happens to be my husband but that's not why I'm recommending his blog post, it genuinely is so insightful. As I go on to explain in the video. \n\nBlog post referenced: https://baincapitalventures.com/insight/we-must-know-we-will-know/\nLearn more about Periodic Labs: https://periodic.com/\n\n\n#AIforScience #PeriodicLabs #MaterialsScience #OpenAI #DeepMind #ChatGPT #AutonomousLabs #Superconductors #VentureCapital #StartupFunding #SeedRound #TechInvesting #ScientificDiscovery #Robotics #MachineLearning #AIRevolution #MaterialsDiscovery #PhysicalAI #DeepLearning #TechStartup #Innovation #FutureOfScience #AIResearch #LabAutomation #Chemistry #Physics #AI #Technology #Science #Startup #Investment #Future",

    "description": "I used ChatGPT (gpt5) and Grok to help me understand the Riemann Hypothesis - arguably mathematics' most important unsolved problem. What started as trying to understand prime distribution turned into a brief foray into quantum physics, random matrix theory, and the Langlands program.\n\nThe conversation gets into:\n- How zeros of the zeta function control the \"wiggles\" in prime counting\n- How zero spacing matches quantum energy levels in nuclear physics\n- Why physicists think there's a \"prime number Hamiltonian\" out there (but can't find it)\n- How the Langlands program might crack this through automorphic forms\n\nWhat I liked: Grok handled my pushback when explanations got too hand-wavy. The AI was genuinely helpful for navigating between different mathematical areas and motivating what's interesting there.\n\nNext time I'm adding a blackboard - this really needs visuals.\n\nPart of exploring how AI can help with learning different subjects. \n\n00:01 - What is the Riemann zeta function?\n00:04 - Connecting zeta to prime numbers\n00:06 - The Riemann Hypothesis explained\n00:08 - How zeros shape the \"wiggles\" in prime distribution\n00:11 - Zero spacing and connections to quantum physics\n00:14 - Random matrix theory and nuclear energy levels\n00:18 - The search for a \"prime number Hamiltonian\"\n00:22 - The Langlands program and automorphic forms\n00:28 - Wrapping up: primes, physics, and the future\n\n\n#RiemannHypothesis #PrimeNumbers #QuantumPhysics #GrokAI #Mathematics #LanglandsProgram #NumberTheory #MillenniumPrizeProblem #AILearning #MathEducation #RandomMatrixTheory #QuantumChaos",

    "description": "Humans of AI is an art project I did over the summer using the GPT3 beta and free tools available by Rosebud (www.tokkingheads.com, www.rosebud.ai).  Humans of AI showcases virtual beings dreamed up by GANs and their stories by GPT3. The project uses GPT3 to synthesize relatable and emotionally rich monologues that characterize the Humans of NY series.  It was important to give the characters a visual representation.  Still somewhat in the uncanny valley, the project was created with tools that generate the text, images, videos and voice with tools freely available by Rosebud AI. This showcases how easy generative media has made certain story telling processes.  \n\nThe characters and their stories were curated to be diverse and to challenge stereotypes. Human curation, choice and intent is so important as it is our responsibility to guide a positive and constructive vision for storytelling with these tools and platforms.  AI is a tool in our desire for expression and connection, but at this point, the human in the loop is what’s essential to create art.  This is an evolving relationship. \n\nWe invite the spectator to participate in the project.  You can generating a character that does not exist and animate them with tokkingheads.  As an experiment in collaborative fiction, what stories do you want to tell?\n\nLearn more at www.rosebud.ai .",

Reach out if you want us to create a unique model for your visuals.\n\nGenerative.photos is a first step in our synthetic stock photo and API offering, which will eventually allow users to edit and fully synthesize visual content with an intuitive interface. We focused on bringing forth a way to diversify stock photo content since it was a need we heard voiced by stock photo users. All the faces in our 25k photo collection are not of real people.\n\nYou can use this collection to serve up dynamic ads catered to individual users, and even give your consumers the power to choose an advertising model that they can relate too. We’re excited to hear about more uses cases for this platform and collection and look forward to releasing more functionalities for control and synthesis.\n\nThe processing of this collection was completely automated, so there may be corner cases, and we’re happy to hear feedback to continue to improve it.",
