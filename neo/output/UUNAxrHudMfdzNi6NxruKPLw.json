    "description": "Sam Harris speaks with Ross Douthat about religion, modernity, and what can steady a culture that feels increasingly unmoored. They discuss the case for faith in an age of digital disembodiment, declining birthrates, and looming AI-driven upheaval. They also debate tribalism and dogmatism, whether secular societies can generate durable moral consensus, the foundations of ethics, consciousness and well-being, mathematics as a clue to ultimate reality, and, briefly, demonology.\n\nRoss Douthat is the host of “Interesting Times,” from New York Times Opinion. The show explores a future that feels more open and uncertain than ever, mapping both the New Right and the new world order through interviews and conversations with leading thinkers and newsmakers. He is the author of Believe: Why Everyone Should Be Religious, which was published in 2025. His other books include The Decadent Society and The Deep Places: A Memoir of Illness and Discovery.\n\nWebsite: www.nytimes.com/column/interesting-times\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/ OR become a channel member to access episodes on YouTube.

They discuss Edmonds’s book Death in a Shallow Pond, Peter Singer’s famous drowning child thought experiment, arguments for and against thought experiments, “trolleyology,” consequentialism, the origins of the Effective Altruism movement, the controversial strategy of “earning to give,” Derek Parfit’s influence on contemporary ethics, the backlash against effective altruists, Angus Deaton’s critique of the efficacy of foreign aid, and other topics.\n\nDavid Edmonds is a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford University and a former BBC radio journalist. He is the author or editor of many philosophy books (and one on chess!) which together have been translated into over two dozen languages. These include (with John Eidinow) the international best seller Wittgenstein’s Poker and, most recently, a biography, Parfit: A Philosopher and his Mission to Save Morality. David also hosts a couple of philosophy podcasts. Philosophy Bites, which he makes with Nigel Warburton has had over 45 million downloads.\n\nWebsite: http://www.davidedmonds.info/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/ OR become a channel member to access episodes on YouTube.

    "description": "Sam Harris speaks with George Packer about American democracy and authoritarianism. They discuss Packer's article \"America's Zombie Democracy,\" the erosion of democratic institutions, the Justice Department's independence, Congressional dysfunction, the weaponization of the military, Trump's unprecedented corruption, the public's failure to recognize democratic collapse, shamelessness as political superpower, the role of hypocrisy, potential threats to the 2026 midterm elections, hyperpartisanship and the loss of shared reality, the mainstreaming of white nationalism on the right, the damage done by wokeness and identity politics on the left, the Epstein files as a potential breaking point for MAGA, the post-Trump Republican landscape, wealth inequality and economic pain as catalysts for change, the role of status in American politics, social media's toxic effects on discourse, and other topics.\n\nGeorge Packer is an award-winning author and staff writer at The Atlantic. His books include The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America (winner of the National Book Award), The Assassins’ Gate: America in Iraq, and Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century (winner of the Hitchens Prize and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography). He is also the author of two novels and a play, and the editor of a two-volume edition of the essays of George Orwell.\n\nWebsite: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374614720/theemergency/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/ OR become a channel member to access episodes on YouTube.

So that’s what we’re trying here, with this new exploratory series we've creatively titled “More From Sam.” Sam jumped on with his manager and business partner, Jaron Lowenstein, to run through some of the topics you all suggested on Substack.

    "title": "What If Consciousness Is Fundamental?: A Conversation with Annaka Harris (Episode #404)",
    "description": "Sam Harris speaks with his wife, Annaka Harris, about LIGHTS ON, her ten-part audio documentary exploring the perplexities of consciousness and the cosmos. They discuss the hard problem of consciousness, whether consciousness is fundamental, what split-brain patients can teach us about consciousness, what consciousness being fundamental could mean for the world of physics, and other topics.\n\nAfter Annaka’s conversation with Sam, we present an excerpt from LIGHTS ON.\n\nChapter 8: Space and Time features author and science writer George Musser, as well as physicists Lee Smolin and Carlo Rovelli. Annaka draws on their noted expertise to explore some of the most mystifying conclusions in quantum theory, how they may validate certain meditative insights, and the ways in which they challenge our basic understanding of reality.\nEveryday experience tells us that space fills the universe; that causes have effects across time; that the future exists only as potential; that consciousness is confined to intelligent creatures, rather than fundamental to the very structure of being. These bedrock assumptions, when examined through both modern physics and contemplative practices, prove surprisingly fragile—and the fabric of existence profoundly counterintuitive.\n\nAnnaka Harris is the New York Times bestselling author of CONSCIOUS: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind and writer and producer of the audio documentary series, LIGHTS ON. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Nautilus Magazine, the Journal of Consciousness Studies, and IAI Magazine. She is also an editor and consultant for science writers, specializing in neuroscience and physics. Annaka is the author of the children’s book I Wonder, coauthor of the Mindful Games Activity Cards, and a volunteer mindfulness teacher for the organization Inner Kids.\n\nWebsite: https://annakaharris.com/\n\nX: @annakaharris\n\nEpisode References:\n- A Solution to the Combination Problem and the Future of Panpsychism by Annaka Harris: https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/imp/jcs/2021/00000028/f0020009/art00011\n- Consciousness Isn’t Self-Centered by Annaka Harris: https://nautil.us/consciousness-isnt-self_centered-237720/\n\nMarch 25, 2025\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/ OR become a channel member to access episodes on YouTube.

    "title": "Making Sense of Meditation and Eastern Spirituality",
    "description": "In this episode, we traverse a decade of Sam’s conversations on the topic of meditation. \n\nWe start with the very first recorded episode from the archives: a conversation with Sam’s meditation teacher and friend, Joseph Goldstein. Goldstein recalls how his thinking was unlocked—allowing him to fully realize the power of the practice—by the utterance of one single word.\n\nWe then hear from author Richard Lang as he guides us towards a strangely obvious insight that came to be known as “the headless way.” Next, philosopher and neuroscientist Thomas Metzinger employs his vast expertise in both neurobiology and meditation to show how our brains generate a model of the world and self, and how meditation can help us catch that process in the act.\n\nPsychiatrist Judson Brewer then shifts the conversation to some very practical applications of mindfulness meditation, addressing the problem of addiction to things like food, smoking, or drugs by retraining the reward centers in our brains. Next, Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson dig into the neuroscience of meditation and discuss how experienced meditators may actually be physically altering their brains. \n\nWe then listen in on Sam’s conversation with author Robert Wright, who defends the claim that “Buddhism is true.” Sam and Wright discuss the validity of this claim while ensuring they keep it separate from the political and moral behaviors of Buddhist nations and individuals.\n\nWe conclude with Sam delivering the answer to a question posed by the Belgian neuroscientist Steven Laureys. In doing so, Sam provides a comprehensive tour of his philosophies. He ties together his personal brand of moral analysis, his reverence for science and truth seeking, and his reasoning as to why he still meditates and why he proudly promotes the practice.\n\n\nAbout the Series\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive. Whether you are new to a particular topic, or think you have your mind made up about it, we think you’ll find this series fascinating.\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/ OR become a channel member to access episodes on YouTube.\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

    "description": "In this episode, we explore Sam’s conversations about the phenomenon of death.\n\nWe begin with an introduction from Sam as he urges us to use our awareness of death to become more present in our day-to-day lives. We then hear a conversation between Sam and Frank Ostaseski, founder of the Zen Hospice Project, who shares the valuable lessons he has learned through caring for those in their very last days. Next, we move on to a conversation with Scott Barry Kaufman, who explains what it means to pursue a good life by putting a modern spin on Abraham Maslow’s famous hierarchy of needs.\n\nResearcher and professor of neuroscience Roland Griffiths then details his findings on psychedelic therapies. He and Sam discuss the inexplicable powers of psychedelics in easing the anxiety around death, and how these experiences can potentially help us live fuller lives. Shifting perspectives, we move on by hearing NYU professor Scott Galloway explain the social and economic impacts of a society made painfully aware of death by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe then listen in to author Oliver Burkeman as he outlines how the knowledge of our mortality can inform practical time management techniques before addressing an age-old question with physicist Geoffrey West: Theoretically, could we engineer humans to live forever?\n\nSam closes this episode with a solo talk, explaining that we needn’t be cynical about the fact that all life must come to an end. Instead, it is the transient nature of life that might be the very thing which makes it beautiful in the first place.\n\nAbout the Series\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

    "description": "In this episode, we examine a series of Sam’s conversations centered around social media’s impact on the information landscape.\n\nWe begin with Sam’s second conversation with Tristan Harris, which was conducted shortly after the release of Tristan’s documentary, The Social Dilemma. The documentary lays out Tristan’s thesis on how social media is causing the deterioration of both individual and societal welfare. Author and technologist Jaron Lanier follows, echoing Tristan’s concerns and shifting the conversation to social media’s unique business model, addressing how perverse incentives reliably produce such detrimental outcomes.\n\nWe then hear from Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter. Sam and Dorsey’s conversation took place when Dorsey was still working at Twitter, and Sam still had an account. However, the questions they pose—relating to issues of content moderation and corporate transparency—are even more relevant today.\n\nNext, psychologist Jonathan Haidt presents the alarming findings from his research on the psychological effects of social media, detailing how teenage girls are bearing the brunt of a mental health crisis. \n\nShifting to a more political lens, Sam and Cass Sunstein discuss Sunstein’s book, #Republic, and Sunstein addresses one of Sam’s most pressing fears of the last seven years: how social media is warping our opinions on politics. We then narrow down on this issue, with Zeynep Tufekci explaining the real-life consequences of social media’s influence on protest movements.\n\nFinally, Sam and technology analyst Nina Schick dive into one of the most urgent concerns of the AI boom: deepfakes and how they might be weaponized to further pollute and degrade our information landscape.\n\nAbout the Series\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom expands on this idea by explaining how developing technologies like DNA synthesis could make humanity more vulnerable to malicious actors.\n\nSam and historian Fred Kaplan then guide us through a hypothetical timeline of events following a nuclear first strike, highlighting the flaws in the concept of nuclear deterrence. Former Defense Secretary William J. Perry echoes these concerns, painting a grim picture of his \"nuclear nightmare\" scenario: a nuclear terrorist attack.\n\nZooming out, Toby Ord outlines each potential extinction-level threat, and why he believes that, between all of them, we face a one in six chance of witnessing the downfall of our species.

    "description": "In this episode, we examine a series of Sam’s conversations centered around religion, atheism, and the power of belief. \n\nFirst, we hear the unique stories of three guests who have fled their respective oppressive religious organizations. We begin with Sarah Hairder, founder of the advocacy group Ex-Muslims of North America, who details how her encounters with militant atheists catalyzed her journey to secularism. Then our narrator, Megan Phelps-Roper, walks us through her story of abandoning the Westboro Baptist Church. Finally, Yasmine Mohammed presents her harrowing account of escaping fundamentalist Islamism and Sam’s role in inspiring her public advocacy work.\n\nWe then tackle the concept of belief more broadly, diving into Sam’s understanding of atheism and what sets it apart from the views of other atheist thinkers like Matt Dillahunty and Richard Dawkins. We also revisit an infamous conversation between Sam and Jordan Peterson, wherein they attempt to come to some universal definition of the word “truth.”\n\nThe episode concludes with two Q&A portions from life events in which Sam addresses some real concerns about purpose and meaning in the absence of religion.\n\nAbout the Series\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

    "description": "In this episode, we examine the timeless question of “free will”: what constitutes it, what is meant by it, what ought to be meant by it, and, of course, whether we have it at all. We start with the neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky who begins to deflate the widely held intuition and assumption of “libertarian free will” by drawing out a mechanistic and determined description of the universe.\n\nWe then hear from the philosopher who has long been Sam’s intellectual wrestling opponent on this subject, Daniel Dennett. Dennett and Sam spar about definitional and epistemological frameworks of what Dennett insists is “free will,” and what Sam contends could never be.\n\nThe author and physicist Sean Carroll then engages Sam with more attempts to find a philosophically defensible notion of free will by leaning on the unknowable nature of the universe revealed by quantum mechanics. We then listen in on Sam’s engagement with the mathematician and author Judea Pearl who focuses on matters of causation to tease out a freedom of will.\n\nAfter a historical review of Princess Elizabeth’s famous exchanges with Rene Descartes, we hear from the biologist Jerry Coyne, who firmly agrees with Sam that a deterministic picture of reality leaves absolutely no room for anything like free will.\n\nWe then hear from the curiously entertaining mind of comedian and producer Ricky Gervais who was thinking about free will while taking a bath when he decided to phone Sam.\n\nWe conclude with Sam’s own response to concerns that an erasure of free will inevitably result in fatalism, loss of meaning, and passive defeat. Sam insists that the loss of free will actually pushes us in the opposite direction where we begin to see hatred and vengeance as incoherent and start to connect with a deeper and truer sense of genuine compassion. \n\n\nAbout the Series\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

    "description": "This episode centers around the specter of violence and surfaces some of Sam’s most controversial positions and difficult conversations.\n\nWe begin with author and former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, who delivers some potentially life-saving aspects of “tactical empathy,” which can also be applied to less extreme circumstances. Author and security expert Gavin de Becker then lays out his thesis from The Gift of Fear, which recasts this unfairly maligned emotion as an important attention-demanding, evolved signal.\n\nWe then spend time with Sam’s position on “profiling” and the moral and political complexities woven into it. This careful consideration leads to a conversation with author and firearms instructor Scotty Reitz, as they paint a stark picture of certain extremes of violence and consider what responsible gun ownership might look like.\n\nSam then answers questions directly on his often criticized and often misunderstood position on gun ownership before we turn to author and former Navy Seal Jocko Willink to apply pressure on the philosophical stance of pacifism. We conclude with the philosopher Tamler Sommers, who ponders the idea of “honor” in society and inspects how third-party delegation of violence might generate an illusive sense of justice.\n\nAbout the Series\n\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

We then hear from the moral psychologist Paul Bloom who makes the case against empathy and points out how it is more often a “bug” in our moral software than a “feature.” Later, William MacAskill describes the way a utilitarian philosophy informs his engagement with the Effective Altruism movement.\n\nThe moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt then puts pressure on Sam’s emphasis on rationality and objective pathways towards morality by injecting a healthy dose of psychological skepticism into the conversation.\n\nAfter, we hear a fascinating exchange with the historian Dan Carlin where he and Sam tangle on the fraught issues of cultural relativism.\n\nWe end by exploring the intersection of technological innovation and moral progress with the entrepreneur Uma Valeti, whom Sam seeks out when he encounters his own collision with a personal moral failure.\n \n\nAbout the Series:\n\nFilmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced The Essential Sam Harris, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive. Whether you are new to a particular topic, or think you have your mind made up about it, we think you’ll find this series fascinating.\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

    "description": "Filmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced a new series of audio documentaries, exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.\n\nEach episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive. Whether you are new to a particular topic, or think you have your mind made up about it, we think you’ll find this series fascinating.\n\nAnd make sure to stick around for the end of each episode, where we provide our list of recommendations from the worlds of film, television, literature, music, and art.\n\nIn this episode, we survey the landscape of consciousness and get acquainted with the mystery of the mind. We start with an attempt to define consciousness–and veterans of conversations on consciousness will know that this is a huge part of the challenge. \n\nDavid Chalmers begins with his conception of what he coined “The Hard Problem of Consciousness” and a famous question offered by the philosopher Thomas Nagel. \n\nWe then construct a “Philosophical Zombie” before the philosopher Thomas Metzinger explains why he is thoroughly unimpressed by the ability to imagine “such a thing,” while he simultaneously warns us against ever attempting to build one. Anil Seth brings some hope of whittling away the intuition gap of the hard problem by pursuing the “easy” problems, with clear scientific reasoning.\n\nLater, Iain McGilchrist lays out the intuition-shattering implications of the famous Roger Sperry experiments with split brain patients that suggest that consciousness can be cut with a knife… at least temporarily. Annaka Harris then shifts the conversation to the realm of panpsychism, which suggests that consciousness is nomologically fundamental and potentially permeates all matter. \n\nFinally, Don Hoffman explains that consciousness is not only fundamental and non-illusory, but that the physical world we appear to be navigating is merely a virtual space-time interface, which has evolved to hide the true nature of reality from us.\n\nDecember 16, 2022\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

We’ll listen in on Sam’s conversation with decision theorist and artificial-intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, as we consider the potential dangers of AI — including the control problem and the value-alignment problem — as well as the concepts of Artificial General Intelligence, Narrow Artificial Intelligence, and Artificial Super Intelligence.\n\nWe’ll then be introduced to philosopher Nick Bostrom’s “Genies, Sovereigns, Oracles, and Tools,” as physicist Max Tegmark outlines just how careful we need to be as we travel down the AI path. Computer scientist Stuart Russell will then dig deeper into the value-alignment problem and explain its importance.\n\nWe’ll hear from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt about the geopolitical realities of AI terrorism and weaponization. We’ll then touch the topic of consciousness as Sam and psychologist Paul Bloom turn the conversation to the ethical and psychological complexities of living alongside humanlike AI. Psychologist Alison Gopnik then reframes the general concept of intelligence to help us wonder if the kinds of systems we’re building using “Deep Learning” are really marching us towards our super-intelligent overlords.\n\nFinally, physicist David Deutsch will argue that many value-alignment fears about AI are based on a fundamental misunderstanding about how knowledge actually grows in this universe.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

She advocates for the rights of women living within Islamic majority countries, as well as those who struggle under religious fundamentalism. She is the founder of Free Hearts Free Minds, an organization that provides psychological support for ex-Muslims living within Muslim majority countries.\n\nWebsite: YasmineMohammed.com\n\nTwitter: @YasMohammedxx\n\nReleased: September 28, 2022\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

    "description": "In this episode of the podcast, Sam Harris shares an audio essay exploring how psychedelics are, for many, the only way to glimpse \"the vast firmament beyond the prison walls” of the “conceptual mind”—and often serve as the gateway to meditation. He also discusses how the very profundity of the psychedelic experience can distract us from the true purpose of mindfulness—the recognition that consciousness is always already free, in every moment. Also included are highlights from the Waking Up app created for a recent Tim Ferriss podcast.\n\nWebsite: http://wakingup.com/makingsense\n\nReleased: June 28, 2022\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at https://samharris.org/subscribe/\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

    "description": "In this episode of the podcast, Rob Reid and Kevin Esvelt discuss USAID’s new “Deep VZN” program, which aims to discover new pandemic-grade viruses and publish their genomes to the world. Esvelt estimates that there are currently around 30,000 people who could then easily build them.\n\nRob Reid is a podcaster, author, and tech investor, and was a long-time tech entrepreneur. His After On podcast features conversations with world-class thinkers, founders, and scientists on topics including synthetic biology, super-AI risk, Fermi’s paradox, robotics, archaeology, and lone-wolf terrorism. Science fiction novels that Rob has written for Random House include The New York Times bestseller Year Zero, and the AI thriller After On. As an investor, Rob is Managing Director at Resilience Reserve, a multi-phase venture capital fund. He co-founded Resilience with Chris Anderson, who runs the TED Conference and has a long track record as both an entrepreneur and an investor. In his own entrepreneurial career, Rob founded and ran Listen.com, the company that created the Rhapsody music service. Earlier, Rob studied Arabic and geopolitics at both undergraduate and graduate levels at Stanford, and was a Fulbright Fellow in Cairo. You can find him at www.after-on.com, or on Twitter at @Rob_Reid.\n\nKevin M. Esvelt is an assistant professor of the MIT Media Lab, where he leads the Sculpting Evolution Group in advancing biotechnology safely. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University for inventing a synthetic microbial ecosystem to rapidly evolve useful biomolecules, and subsequently helped pioneer the development of CRISPR, a powerful new method of genome engineering.\nIn 2013, Esvelt was the first to identify the potential for CRISPR “gene drive” systems to alter wild populations of organisms. Recognizing the implications of an advance that could enable individual scientists to alter the shared environment, he and his colleagues chose to break with scientific tradition by revealing their findings and calling for open discussion and safeguards before they tested it and demonstrated reversibility in the laboratory.   \nAn outspoken advocate of sharing research plans to accelerate discovery and improve safety, Esvelt's lab at MIT seeks to accelerate beneficial advances while safeguarding biotechnology against mistrust and misuse. Projects include building catalytic platforms for directed evolution, pioneering new ways of developing ecotechnologies with the guidance of local communities, developing early-warning systems to reliably detect any catastrophic biological threat, applying cryptographic methods to enable secure and universal DNA synthesis screening, and advising policymakers on how best to mitigate global catastrophic biorisks.\nHis work has been published in Nature and Science, covered by the New York Times and Washington Post, and featured on Last Week Tonight and the Netflix special Unnatural Selection.

He shares that meditation isn't about understanding things conceptually, but is rather about the ability to experience things more clearly in order to experience psychological freedom.\n\nWhile many meditation tools today aim to improve symptoms of an untrained mind such as trouble falling asleep or anxious thinking, Waking Up treats the root cause of these struggles with carefully curated content aimed at developing a sound understanding of the practice and theory behind meditation. After all, it’s only in fully examining our minds that we’re able to unlock them.\n\nCredits\nAnimation: Zeino",

They discuss how he became the wealthiest self-made billionaire under 30, what might go wrong with cryptocurrency, the Giving What We Can pledge, how SBF thinks about using his resources to do the most good in the world, how not to stigmatize wealth, wealth redistribution, norms of generosity among the ultra-wealthy, pandemic preparedness, impact through lobbying, how ambitious should we be in doing good, and other topics.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried is the founder and CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. He is also the CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm. Forbes has described him as \"the richest person in crypto\" and \"one of the richest people under 30 in history.\" What is more remarkable is that he set out to make this money for the purpose of giving almost all of it away to the most effective charities, and to thereby do as much good in the world as he can. He was an early adopter of the Giving What We Can Pledge, and he is now one of the more prominent people in the effective altruist community.

    "description": "In this nearly 4-hour SPECIAL EPISODE, @Rob_Reid delivers a 100-minute monologue (broken up into 4 segments, and interleaved with discussions with Sam) about the looming danger of a man-made pandemic, caused by an artificially-modified pathogen. The risk of this occurring is far higher and nearer-term than almost anyone realizes. \n\nRob explains the science and motivations that could produce such a catastrophe and explores the steps that society must start taking today to prevent it. These measures are concrete, affordable, and scientifically fascinating—and almost all of them are applicable to future, natural pandemics as well. So if we take most of them, the odds of a future Covid-like outbreak would plummet—a priceless collateral benefit. \n\nReleased: April 23, 2021\n\nSUBSCRIBE to gain access to all full-length episodes of the podcast at samharris.org/subscribe.\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org",

His new offset strategy ushered in the age of stealth, smart weapons, GPS, and technologies that changed the face of modern warfare. \n\nIn 2015, he founded the William J. Perry Project, outlining his vision of a world free from nuclear weapons, and educating the public on the urgent but practical steps that could be taken to reduce nuclear dangers. \n\nDr. Perry has now co-authored a new book: THE BUTTON: The New Nuclear Arms Race and Presidential Power from Truman to Trump which recounts the terrifying history of nuclear launch authority, with firsthand testimonies from the front lines of our nation’s nuclear history.\n\nHe is the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor (emeritus) at Stanford University.

The granddaughter of Secretary Perry, she has dedicated her career to sounding the alarm about the modern threat of nuclear weapons for the post cold war generations. Lisa is committed to empowering the public by breaking down the complex issues surrounding these weapons.\n\nAt the Brink is a new podcast about humanity's most terrifying weapon and the stories of those who have shaped its history. When former Secretary of Defense William Perry declared he believed that the danger of a nuclear catastrophe was greater today than any time in history, his granddaughter, Lisa Perry, set out to discover why. Featuring the personal stories of presidents, cabinet members, congressmen, nuclear physicists, atomic bomb survivors, military officials, and activists, At The Brink is a primer for every world citizen to learn how close we’ve come to disaster, and how we can still step back from the nuclear brink.\n\nReleased: July 9, 2020\n\nWilliam Perry’s Nuclear Terrorism Scenario:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUuOskX3z7U\n\nWebsite: www.wjperryproject.org\n\nTwitter: @SecDef19 and @LisaAtTheBrink\n\nSUBSCRIBE to continue listening and gain access to all content on samharris.org/subscribe\n\nSubscribe to the YT channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=samharrisorg\n\nFollow Making Sense on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MakingSenseHQ\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg/\n\nFollow Sam on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg/\n\nFor more information about Sam Harris: https://www.samharris.org\n\nArtwork credit: Doug Chayka",
