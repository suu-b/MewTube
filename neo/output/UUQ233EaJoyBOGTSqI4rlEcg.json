That’s all the more reason we need to get out there - singing, dancing, speaking the positive, with signs that are positive, even waving American flags -  yet making it clear that in America we do NOT have a King…and we want to make sure things stay that way.\n\nObviously, this is a critical moment in our nation’s history.

    "description": "When hate is loud, love cannot afford to whisper. When forces of oppression are on the move, lovers of freedom must respond. When those who seek to replace democracy with theocracy are gaining ground, those who are sworn to preserve and protect democracy must stand our ground. \n\nJesus, of course, was neither oppressor nor hater nor promoter of theocracy. There are those who claim to speak for him at times, however, who are all of those things. One of the primary forces behind Project 2025 is a political movement called Christian Nationalism. Christian Nationalism speaks not of the teachings of Jesus - feeding the hungry, helping the poor, healing the sick, and kindness to the stranger. Their vision is not about love, but power - specifically a version of power that transgresses basic American Constitutional principles (subjugation of women, primacy of Christianity over other religions, and more).\n\nProgressive Christians are rising up in response, bringing to the theological as well as political sphere a voice that is much needed at this time. Theirs is a Jesus of the Gospels, recognizing love and love alone as the salvation of the world.\n\nMy guest in this interview is Brian Recker, author of HELL BENT: How the Fear of Hell Holds Christians Back from a Spirituality of Love. Recker, a former Evangelical pastor,  is an influential figure in the Christian Deconstructionist Movement. He explains a journey taken by millions of Christians in America today. who feel strongly that a Jesus of love, not retribution, should guide our hearts.\n\nWebsite: BrianRecker.com\nSubstack: BrianRecker.Substack.com\nInstagram: @berecker\n\n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack: MarianneWilliamson.Susbtack.com\n\nFollow Marianne on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nFollow Marianne on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/\nFollow Marianne on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@marwilliamsonofficial\n\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marianne-williamson-podcast/id1536043190\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0SogOup2lTWVkGwELXpiBM?si=20050e2c9f0442de",

    "description": "When I read Madeleine Albright’s book FASCISM: A Warning, I became deeply aware that what happened before could happen again. And it could happen here.\n\nBut what is fascism, really? Is it hyperbole to make any mention of Hitler, to draw a comparison between today’s politics and the Third Reich? The issue is critical. Nuance is important, but history’s lessons are important too.\n\nHistory is a great illuminator. John Lestrange is called The History Wizard, and I’ve enjoyed his everyman’s approach to teaching it. A scholar on Genocide Studies, he answered questions in our interview that cast light on a topic deeply relevant to our times.\n\nThere is much to learn, and much to consider…\n\nJohn Lestrange Instagram:   https://www.instagram.com/the_history_wizard\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack: MarianneWilliamson.Susbtack.com\n\nFollow Marianne on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nFollow Marianne on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/\nFollow Marianne on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@marwilliamsonofficial\n\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marianne-williamson-podcast/id1536043190\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0SogOup2lTWVkGwELXpiBM?si=20050e2c9f0442de",

    "title": "The Outer America, The Inner America -- Marianne Williamson",
    "description": "I met a young man a couple weeks ago who said something beautiful. He said, “America is stronger than anything they can do to us.” That sentence is not just lovely prose; it’s an understanding of energy. They can destroy a government but they can’t destroy the American dream. The very idea that people should be able to say whatever they want to say, do whatever they want to do, and be whoever they want to be as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else, is our civic North Star. There’s an ideal at the core of America that democracy’s enemies cannot touch. \n\nThere is an outer America and an inner America. The outer America is the externals of our government. It’s true they’re taking a hammer to it. They want to impose a corporate dictatorship in America, and in order to do so they have to demolish the basics of our democratic government. Whether it's Curtis Yarvin, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and the techno-bro crowd; or organized white supremacists; or Christian nationalists (promoting such things as repealing the 19th Amendment that grants women the right to vote!); or the Heritage Foundation touting Project 2025, such forces have a unique view of how America should operate. But let’s not kids ourselves. That view does not align with, or support, the founding principles of the United States.\n\nOnce again, as during the Civil War, a generation of Americans is called on to determine whether a nation “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal…can long endure.”\n\nPresident Trump and his henchmen can can tear up our Constitution. They can demolish our agencies. They can undermine the basic functionality of freedom and liberty in America. Those things they can do, and are doing. But they cannot touch the point of it all, because America’s deepest reality lies in another realm. America is an ideal, and if we hold that ideal close to our hearts - committing to its protection and praying for a miracle - then our nation so conceived will yet endure. \n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack: MarianneWilliamson.Susbtack.com\n\nFollow Marianne on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nFollow Marianne on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/\nFollow Marianne on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@marwilliamsonofficial\n\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marianne-williamson-podcast/id1536043190\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0SogOup2lTWVkGwELXpiBM?si=20050e2c9f0442de",

What are we called on to see right now? To be? And to do?\n\nAnd it’s helpful to remember that you’re not alone.

    "title": "Is Christian Nationalism Actually Christian? -- Marianne Williamson",
    "description": "Christian Nationalism is now a hot topic in the United States. It is not a religious movement articulating the love and teachings of Jesus as they relate to public policy. Rather, it is a political movement that bears little resemblance the teachings of the gospels - healing the sick, feeding the hungry, helping the poor, and being good to the stranger seem to have fallen by the wayside - and promotes the message that Christianity should take precedence over all other religions in this country. Its Seven Mountains Mandate is a rather chilling repudiation of religious freedom.\n\nMy video today is a conversation with public theologian Brandan Robertson, in which he gives answers to many of the questions I’ve had about this movement. Who are they? What do they stand for? What is their connection to far right wing conservative politics? And what is their plan for America’s future?\n\nA genuinely progressive Christianity, harkening back to the love of Jesus and its relevance to our individual as well as collective lives, is being powerfully articulated by such speakers as Robertson. Thankfully, progressive Christians are not quiet right now. Their numbers are growing, and they’re speaking up.\n\nI hope you find the interview interesting. It’s critically important that we understand what’s going on.\n\nRev. Brandan Robertson is a noted author, activist, and public theologian, dedicated to exploring the intersections of spirituality, sexuality, and social justice. He serves as the Pastor of Sunnyside Reformed Church in New York City and is the founder and Executive Director of The Devout Foundation. Known as the “TikTok Pastor,” Robertson’s inclusive theological content has garnered 10 million views. He has authored, contributed to, or edited 23 books, including the INDIES Book of the Year finalist True Inclusion. His work has been featured in TIME Magazine, CNN, and The Washington Post. Robertson is a sought-after speaker who regularly presents at prestigious platforms like The White House and Oxford University, continuing to inspire and challenge audiences around the world. Robertson acquired a Bachelor of Arts in Pastoral Ministry and Biblical Studies from Moody Bible Institute, an Master of Theological Study from Iliff School of Theology, and an Master of Arts in Political Science and Public Administration from Eastern Illinois University. He’s presently pursuing a PhD in Biblical Studies at Drew University. He currently resides in New York City.\n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack: MarianneWilliamson.Susbtack.com\n\nFollow Marianne on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nFollow Marianne on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/\nFollow Marianne on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@marwilliamsonofficial\n\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marianne-williamson-podcast/id1536043190\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0SogOup2lTWVkGwELXpiBM?si=20050e2c9f0442de",

    "description": "Old thinking will not solve new problems. Our greatest tool for rising to this moment is an expanded version of what it means to be political. Politics comes from a latin root “of the people.” It is the people - each and every one of us - who must now become the conduits through which our country can overcome.\n\nThe question is not just what we are supposed to do now, but at least as importantly, who we need to be. Psychological, emotional, and spiritual dynamics are as important as traditional political activism in turning us into the people who can handle this moment.\n\nNever underestimate your own contribution. Every thought, every word, every action contributes to a collective field of energy. Make yours a powerful expression of love for democracy and love for humanity. Every life and every moment matters.

    "title": "The Corporate Attack On Our Food Supply, Our Bodies, Our Planet - Marianne Williamson",
    "description": "When I was growing up, my mother believed the food she fed her family was safe for us to consume. In fact, the 1950’s was just the beginning of the corporate takeover of agriculture and food production in the United States. Over the next thirty years it would culminate in Big Ag, Big Chem, and Big Food all having their hey dey producing corporate profits at the expense of American’s health.\n\nIn a properly functioning democracy, the U.S. government - as part of its mandate to protect the common good - would regulate corporate behavior to insure  profits were never placed before the safety, health and well-being of people and planet. Yeah, well….that would be nice. Beginning in the 1980’s, our government began to promote corporate interests too often at the expense of our well-being. In area after area, corporate profits became America’s new bottom line.\n\nMore and more Americans realize this now. We need a world in which the safety, health and well-being of our children takes precedence over an economic trickle-down theory of economics. This is a fundamental way in which we’ve gone astray, and one of the ways in which in time we will self-correct.\n\nMy guest today is Bill Freese, science director at Center for Food Safety (CFS), a non-profit organization that supports sustainable agriculture and opposes harmful food production technologies.\n\nTake care. Stay informed. We’re going to create a far better world.\n\nYou can find out more at:\nGeneral website: https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/victories\n\nhttps://www.thenewlede.org/2025/09/epa-has-failed-us-the-maha-commission-just-proved-it/\nhttps://www.thenewlede.org/2024/04/an-herbicide-so-hazardous-that-courts-have-banned-it-twice/\nhttps://www.thenewlede.org/2024/10/epa-not-protecting-public-from-neonic-exposure-analysis-suggests/\n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack: MarianneWilliamson.Susbtack.com\n\nFollow Marianne on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nFollow Marianne on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/\nFollow Marianne on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@marwilliamsonofficial\n\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marianne-williamson-podcast/id1536043190\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0SogOup2lTWVkGwELXpiBM?si=20050e2c9f0442de",

What would Buddha say about that? In what way would the teachings of Jesus weigh in? What are the spiritual keys to beginning again, whether as an individual or as a country? How does a nation atone?\n\nOld thinking led to our problems. A new conversation, acknowledging the laws of consciousness and not simply tied to politics as usual, will help us solve them. Breaking free of old conversations, we will break free of certain chains that bind us.

Now the President is saying his plans to militarize cities is like preparing for “a war,” and Pete Hegseth has announced that the press can only cover Pentagon activities with pre-authorized reports.\n\nSo much for free speech.

    "description": "Israel has begun a ground offensive in Gaza City that promises a new round of horror in an already existing humanitarian disaster. Despite widespread global condemnation, Netanyahu continues doing what he is doing to carry out his Right Wing messianic vision for Israel.\n\nUnfortunately, with Trump - just as with Biden - the U.S. continues to send financial support for the Israeli effort. While our Secretary of State Marco Rubio says “It’s their war,” many would argue it is Israel’s war - and ours. In my interview today with Arab-American political advocate Raed Jarrar, he argues that without our help Israel could not do what they are doing.\n\nAccording to Jarrar, one phone call from Trump could stop all this. It’s a bit of a mystery why President Trump is not willing to make it.

    "title": "\"It's Time To Engage in Some Radical Thinking\" says Trump Whistleblower",
    "description": "On September 5, 2018, an anonymous Op Ed appeared in the New York Times entitled I am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration. Obviously that caused a stir, followed by the publication of a book by the same author called A Warning. Someone was yelling from the inside: Get away from this man as fast as you can. You get the drift.\n\nUltimately the Anonymous author revealed himself to be Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the US. Department of Homeland Security. Having worked in the Bush administration as well, Taylor knew how things were supposed to work in the White House - and how they were not supposed to work. He followed up A Warning with another bestseller, Blowback, in which he described what would happen in a worst case scenario during a second Trump term. Most of them have already occurred.\n\nIn today’s interview, Taylor told me it’s now “time to engage in some radical thinking.” He said we need a massive movement of non-violent resistance unlike anything America has ever seen.\n\nI’ve admired Taylor’s writing, his courage, and his continued call to the American people to wake up before it’s too late. If Paul Revere were alive today, he'd be called Miles Taylor.\n\nSubscribe to Miles Taylor's Substack: MilesTaylor.Substack.com\nSupport Miles' legal fund: https://endpresidentialrevenge.org/\n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack: MarianneWilliamson.Susbtack.com\nFollow Marianne on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nFollow Marianne on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne/\nFollow Marianne on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@marwilliamsonofficial\n\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marianne-williamson-podcast/id1536043190\nFind Marianne's Interviews on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0SogOup2lTWVkGwELXpiBM?si=20050e2c9f0442de",

    "description": "Trump Says Smithsonian Focuses Too Much on \"How Bad Slavery Was\".\n\nI visited the African American History Museum in D.C. last weekend, and it’s brilliant.\n\nThe museum is a magnificent feat of both design and content. Of course it doesn’t whitewash our history, nor should it. But neither does it ignore the heroism of those who have led us away from the evils of race-based cruelties over the last four hundred years.\n\nFunding for the museum’s creation was signed into law by George W. Bush in 2003, as he praised America for “not hiding its history.” Barack Obama shed tears as he spoke at its opening in 2016, ruminating on the day when he would bring his own grandchildren there. That’s how our Presidents are supposed to behave….with dignity and respect toward the triumphs and tragedies of American history.\n\nAs with so many things, however, Donald Trump has decided to forge his own way. He is less interested in the flowering of American cultural institutions than he is in controlling them. In March he issued an Executive Order No. 14253 to eliminate what he calls “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian and its museums. That might sound innocent enough, but it is not. From now on, every exhibit item at 19 national museums will be under the oversight of a political team led by J.D. Vance, there to make sure that every exhibit expresses the “unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.” Each museum was given thirty days to present its labeling and digital content for review, to be vetted by people who know nothing about museum curation but everything about a particular vision of America’s past, present, and future now deemed a “correct” one by the President.\n\nAn attack on historical museums is an attack on the truth, an attack on culture, an attack on freedom, and an attack on us. The reason Donald Trump wants oversight over our historical museums is not because they fail to celebrate the American spirit, but because they do. America at times has displayed the best as well as the worst of what humanity has to offer, yet throughout our history it has been people’s dedication to the possibilities of freedom that have ultimately had the last word. Nothing today could be a more important lesson for us to teach, or to learn, than this.\n\nMore from Marianne at:\nhttps://substack.com/@mariannewilliamson",

Yet here we are.\n\nPolitically we are at war, our country under attack by undemocratic forces seeking to demolish the foundations of our democratic society. Our weapons of defense are not, and must not, be violent. Our weapons are ideas. Understanding. Conviction. And love.\n\nThere are three phases in the march to fascism. We must understand what they are, responding with all the passion and power of the American spirit.\n\nLike our ancestors before us, we will not give in.

    "title": "The Desecration of The White House",
    "description": "One of the things I’ve always liked most about the White House is its size. It’s grand but not grandiose. It was built to be the president’s mansion, not a king’s palace. It’s a perfect reflection of an American ideal.\n\nBut for reasons I’ve loved the White House, the President finds it inadequate. It’s not currently palatial enough for his taste. The current White House, roughly 55,000 square feet, will now be dwarfed by a 90,000 square foot ballroom added to the East Wing. This will permanently change the building’s structure and its character.\n\nWhile the President claims the ballroom is needed to host State Dinners, I’ve never heard anyone say the tent set up for such occasions is “unsightly.” Trump isn’t doing this because what’s already there is inadequate. He’s doing it as a part of a larger strategy to impose his fingerprints on everything he can get his hands on. Trump wants us to forget the America that existed before he got here. This is not a president who respects our history; his wish is to rewrite it.\n\nEarlier today I drove past the WH and saw the new flag poles the President has installed. The normal sized flag pole has been replaced by two gargantuan flagpoles, each 100 feet high, with those oversized flags you often see in front of car dealerships. So much for the simple grandeur that used to say so eloquently who we are.\n\nAnd have you seen the Jacqueline Kennedy Rose Garden since it’s been paved over? Grass is just so yesterday.\n\nSo will be our democracy, if we don’t raise hell. Our voices are the only power we have to stop construction on the new ballroom. But public pressure matters.\n\nWrite a letter to an editor. Make a video. Create a meme. Spread the word. Write your Congressmen.\n\nWe are all so tired of this, I know. But they’re counting on our fatigue to quiet us. We must not go down this way. The White House as a building is just a symbol, of course, but it’s a symbol that matters. And unless we are willing to stand up for what matters, our very lives no longer do.",

A compliant Congress, after all, has been a primary vehicle for the passage of the Project 2025 agenda.\n\nI’ll gladly interview Congressional candidates who offer hope for real change in Washington. Today’s conversation is with J.D. Scholten of Iowa. J.D., now an Iowa State legislator, decided to jump into the race when he saw Senator Joni Ernst’s response to a constituent who complained that the Medicare cuts will cause people to die. She said, “Well, we all are going to die.” She then doubled down with a sarcastic apology that was pretty shocking even by today’s low standards. Wow.\n\nI hope you enjoy my talk with J.D. Washington will be a much better place if Scholten win this race, and I can give a personal endorsement that he’s a really, really, really good guy.\n\nHere’s J.D’s website.

    "description": "It's not enough to resist what's happening. We must consciously create a more beautiful world.\n\nThere are individuals doing extraordinary things to resist the authoritarian takeover of the United States. Some of them we can see because their actions are public. Others are out there doing what they do, saving and protecting things that matter most, in places and ways we will never know about. But the energy is there and you can feel it: the American spirit is rising up, a newfound patriotism making itself known.\n\nHell no, you cannot shred our Constitution. Hell no, you cannot undermine our values. Hell no, you cannot destroy our government. You will continue to do what you do, but we will continue to stymie your unAmerican plans. You seem to be in this for the long haul, but so are we.\n\nIn the 1700’s, colonial Governor Tom Hutchinson said that in American politics, all things happen “contrary to probability.” Such is true today, as well. The unpredictable nature of American politics has made it at times frightening and at other times awe-inspiring. Today we are having a frightening moment, it is true. It’s time to transform that.\n\nIt’s not enough to resist what we don’t want; we must generate a new beginning. Every day, in each of our lives, we can do the new thing, make the next call, refuse to procrastinate at whatever it is. We can let the universe know we mean business. Make new contacts. Reach out in new ways. Read new subjects. Have different conversations. Who we are willing to become, nut just what we do, will determine what happens next. That star-spangled banner can still yet wave “o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.” But we will only be free if we are willing to be brave.\n\nEvery day, in whatever way, give birth to something good and true. Commit to the long haul. They’re on a roll, but so are we.",

But there's something bigger going on here, and that is really the evolution of the human race.\n\n\nRead more from Marianne Williamson at MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com",

    "description": "My favorite kinda' guy...\n\n\n--------\n\nA parade to celebrate 250 years of the US military as well as Flag Day could have been a very powerful, positive thing - don’t get me wrong. It could have been a deep bow of appreciation for the men and women who have served in our military over the last 250 years, and an appropriate celebration of people in uniform today as well as veterans. But just parading a bunch of army tanks was not that. It was more like a gargantuan floating car show. Trucks, tanks, all sorts of heavy military equipment - see what we got?\n\nLet’s remember that President Trump, when visiting the cemetery of fallen American soldiers at Normandy, was heard to utter, “What was in it for them?” That’s how little appreciation he has for anyone sacrificing their life for the cause of freedom. And how little appreciation he has for freedom itself.\n\nBut that was just one of the major events of the weekend, on the eve of war and escalated global conflict.\n\nAround the country, an estimated over ten million people took to the streets to celebrate NO KINGS DAY. That was the true spirit of America on display.",

    "description": "When Dwight Eisenhower was asked if the United States should have a military parade, he responded this way:\n\n\"Absolutely not. we are the pre-eminent power on Earth. For us to try and imitate what the Soviets are doing in Red Square would make us look weak.”\n\nOur power doesn’t lie in our ability to destroy anyone or anything. Our power lies in our ability to help people live better lives. And that’s why what’s happening these days is so deeply disempowering. We’re seeing a perversion of the values that indeed did make America great.\n\nAh, what we could have done over the last fifty years to expand people’s opportunities, while instead we worked so steadily to diminish them. Deflecting attention onto a military parade that will cost taxpayers $25M to $45 is obscene, when the government literally took food from the mouths of hungry children because they say we waste too much money. This parade will not be a celebration of our military; it will be a celebration of our war machine. The arms manufacturers. What in DC is called “The Blob.” Those children, and our veterans, be damned.\n\nDoes it have to be this way? No. And on the other side of this twisted era, I pray that it will not be.\n\nMarianneWilliamson.Substack.com\n\nProduced by Mark Van Landuyt.\nThanks to Donald Goldmacher.\n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack at MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com",

    "description": "Every day something more outrageous happens, and none of it should be normalized. When a U.S. President transgresses the laws and principles of the Constitution, it's not a derangement syndrome to object to that. It's a derangement syndrome not to.\n\nThis is going to be a long haul, and obviously we have to manage our nervous systems so we don't fall apart. But we can't afford to take our eye off the ball, either. As a friend said to me the other day, \"It appears that the most cynical analysis is the one most likely to be true.\" And I agree with him.\n\nWe have everything we need to stand up to this insanity, to meet the moment, to save our democracy. We don't have to have every detail worked out yet of how we're going to do it; right now we just need to cultivate the conviction that we will. Every day, do something. A post you post. An article or book that helps you understand. An attendance at a Town Hall, a call to your legislators, whatever it is. Just do it.\n\nNo matter what, don't give up. Hold the line. Keep going. Be strong. Be loud. Be brave.\n#leadership #democracy #acourseinmiracles #politics #politicsandsociety",

    "title": "Married Women Take Heed | Marianne Williamson on the SAVE Act",
    "description": "Today the SAVE ACT passed the House of Representatives. It's a ridiculous bill that its supporters say will “ensure election integrity” but which everyone else knows is a voter suppression effort. If passed by the Senate as well, it will require proof of U.S. citizenship in order to vote.\n\nThat alone, however, is not why I’m mentioning it. The larger point is the threat to women who got married and took their husband’s name (according to Brennan Center for Justice, that’s roughly 70 million women). You would have to prove your citizenship, which theoretically was established either at birth or sometime before you married him!\n\nSo you’ll need a birth certificate or passport to take with you to the polls! Start now….make sure you get your birth certificate or a passport and store them away someplace safe.\n\nAlso - and this is important - this “married women” nonsense has to do with the Christian Nationalist view that since a man is the \"leader of the household,\" only he and not his wife should vote. I KID YOU NOT. (Remember, Christian Nationalism has little to nothing to do with Christianity; it is an extreme right wing political agenda).\n\nTomorrow, 4/11 at 5pm ET, I’ll be interviewing MONTE MADER live on my Substack. She has all the scoop on what’s going on there. Join us and spread the word.\n\n#politicsandsociety",

    "title": "MOVING FORWARD: Using the Spirit of Yesterday to Guide Us Today | Marianne Williamson",
    "description": "There was a lot of energy generated in those protests yesterday, but the challenge now is to keep it going. Think of yesterday as an activation point, not a destination point. The point is to take it from here. Non-violence in politics is a wave, not a particle; a revolution of love that has to be activated and reactivated as we move along. The new politics is relational, not transactional. It happens on the vertical axis of life, not just the horizontal. The politics that will transform events is different than the politics of the past.\n\nThe question now, is what will you do? Who did you see yesterday that you can meet with? What are the projects in your town, or state, or the country, that you feel moved to work on together? Complacency is what got us here; generative, invigorated energy is what will move us forward. “Ain’t it awful” is yesterday’s news. “Aint’ it wonderful” is the theme for the tomorrow we’re creating now.\n\nMarianneWilliamson.Substack.com\n\n#politicsandsociety",

She talks about how we need to step into our own power. We talk about finding truths of the universe, faith in the people, and trouble at the bagel store.  \n\nBio: For more than four decades, Marianne Williamson has been a leader of spiritually progressive circles. She is the author of 16 books, four of which have been #1 New York Times best sellers. A quote from the mega-bestseller A Return to Love, “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure…” is considered an anthem for a contemporary generation of seekers.\n\nHer other bestsellers have included A Woman’s Worth, The Law of Divine Compensation, Tears to Triumph, THE MYSTIC JESUS: The Mind of Love and The Gift of Change. With her books and online classes she has taught millions of people the universal spiritual principles at the heart of miracle-minded thinking.\n\nWilliamson founded Project Angel Food, a non-profit organization that has delivered more than 18 million meals to ill and dying homebound patients in the Los Angeles area since 1989. The group was created to help people suffering from the ravages of HIV/AIDS. She has also worked throughout her career on poverty, anti-hunger and racial reconciliation issues. In 2004, she co-founded The Peace Alliance and supported the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nInstagram: @MarianneWilliamson\nWebsite: Marianne.com\nSubstack: MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com",

    "description": "MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com\n\nWhile some are still keeping their heads in the sand, many no longer are. We’re in a full scale battle not just for the soul of our democracy, but for its body. \n\nThe President’s speech to Congress was filled with lies, such as the debunked stories about Social Security, or making fun of funds for “transgender mice”, or mocking an African nation “no one’s ever heard of.” \n\nFewer and fewer people are in denial regarding the President’s penchant for pathological lying. The difference is when people stop pretending to themselves that his lies don’t matter. \n\nThere are powerful people so high on the drug of proximity to power that they are selling their souls to go along with all this madness. On some level they know what’s happening, but to stand up and speak out entails courage they haven’t yet summoned up within themselves. \n\nHistory will record whether or not they do.\n#politicsandsociety",

The modern revolutionary is a healer, healing the systems of our world that have broken down. \n\nWe need an integrative approach to healing society just as we need an integrative approach to healing the body. Our inner work is as important as our outer work, if we’re to truly transform the world.\n\nRead more at MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com.",

You simply learn some things in life. You don’t date narcissists. You don’t excuse bad behavior.\n\nAnd you don’t accept dictators.\n\nIt’s America’s turn now to learn a few things. The gullibility of so many - believing Musk has only the most beneficent intent, and Trump has profound respect for the pillars of democracy - is leading us down a very dark path.\n\nI hope the video illuminates a few things.\n#politicsandsociety",

    "description": "A Powerful Call to Embrace Our Most Loving, Connected, and Fierce Selves\n\nIn this inspiring episode of the HEAL with Kelly Podcast, I am honored to welcome back my dear friend Marianne Williamson — a globally recognized spiritual leader, bestselling author, humanitarian, and of course a powerful voice in the documentary HEAL. Marianne is renowned for her wisdom on healing and spirituality, as captured in all of her books to date, including her latest work, The Mystic Jesus: The Mind of Love — which reimagines Jesus not as a distant historical figure but as a universal and transformative spiritual force that calls us to embody love in our daily lives.\n\nReflecting on the teachings of A Course in Miracles, Marianne shares insights into the journey from head to the heart and the importance of a daily ritual each morning to help set the tone to navigate the chaos of the modern world with grace. Together, we also dive deep into the transformative power of relationships, exploring how they offer opportunities to reconnect with love, embrace forgiveness, and transcend ego-driven patterns. Marianne passionately discusses the rise of the divine feminine — not as a passive or soft energy, but as a fierce protector of life, justice, and the planet. She also delves into the internalized patriarchy that many women carry and the sacred responsibility of sisterhood to support and uplift one another. Tune in now to learn how to activate miracles through the power of love. \n\nListen to this episode of the HEAL with Kelly Podcast on...\nSpotify - https://tinyurl.com/52cja9v2\nApple Podcasts - https://tinyurl.com/wazypd6p\n\nMarianne Williamson's Website:\nhttps://marianne.com/\n\nMarianne Williamson's Substack:\nhttps://www.transformarticles.com/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:58 The Mystic Jesus\n6:10 The Mind-Heart Connection\n11:50 Sacred Morning & Spiritual Hygiene\n15:50 Navigating Today's World\n23:45 Finding Safety & Security\n28:35 Forgiveness & Finding Growth\n36:30 Meditation, Prayer & Mindfulness\n39:05 The Mystic Mary & Divine Feminine\n50:00 Why We Are Here on Earth\n\nABOUT THE HEAL WITH KELLY PODCAST:\nThe HEAL with Kelly Podcast (formerly The HEAL Podcast) is a continuation of the HEAL documentary and HEAL book.

Western North Carolina, particularly the city of Asheville, has been damaged in ways that have tragically affected their community.\n\nPlease join me on Tuesday, November 12, 4pmPT/7pmET, for After the Storm, a virtual fundraiser to support the hurricane victims of Asheville. I will be joined by several residents who'll testify not only to the trauma of Hurricane Helene, but also to the miracles that emerge as people support one another in its aftermath. \n\nI hope our fundraiser will be one of those miracles. Registration is free, but I’ll be asking you throughout the evening to give generously to the non-profit organization chosen to distribute the funds.\n\nGather with us to support victims of Hurricane Helene. All proceeds will go to Beloved Asheville a nonprofit serving and distributing critical supplies to the citizens of Asheville following this tragedy.\n\nRegister for the Fundraiser: https://marianne.com/after-the-storm/",

    "description": "Since October, horrifying events have unfolded in the Middle East. In the drop-down menu at Marianne2024.com, there is a page called Israel and Palestine that includes various videos and articles on the subject which I’ve created over the last couple of years.\n\nWhat’s most important now is that the bombing in Gaza cease. America’s greatest ally should be humanity itself, and we must be equally committed to the safety, security, and sovereignty of both Israelis and Palestinians.\n       \nAs a candidate, my position is very different than that of President Biden. There was never a military solution to this problem and there isn’t now. The United States should not be supporting the bombardment of Gaza either financially or militarily. The only way forward is for a permanent ceasefire now, release of the remaining hostages, and architecture for a two state solution. As President I will be committed to all three.\n      \nWe need to be more than just “uncommitted” to what is happening now. We need to be passionately committed to the creation of a very different world.\n\n----\n\nMarianne Williamson is a candidate for the 2024 Democratic Party nomination.\n\nDonate to the campaign: https://marianne2024.com/donate\nJoin the movement: https://marianne2024.com\nBecome a Campaign Ambassador: https://marianne2024.com/action-hub/\nWatch videos on the issues: https://marianne2024.com/videos-on-issues/\nRead Marianne's policy platform: https://marianne2024.com/issues/\n\n#marianne2024",

    "title": "Marianne Williamson: Climate Action",
    "description": "Our biggest crisis regarding the climate emergency is humanity’s massive state of denial that it exists on the scale it does. Yet willingness to recognize the depth of the problem is prerequisite to our solving it. It is a psychological and moral challenge to face the horror of what stands before us over the next ten years should we not act; yet there – in our standing raw before the truth that it confronts us with – lies our only hope for surviving it.\n\nAnd our environmental crisis is not only climate; it is also water, air, food and soil. Our earth is like a body beginning to experience an all systems breakdown. The glacial ice melt is so extensive that the sheer weight of melted polar water is changing the shape of the earth’s crust.\n\nAs president, I will treat the problem holistically. Global warming harms the weather patterns which harms agriculture and animals which harms people’s capacity to live in certain areas which harms the city-to-rural ratio which harms social stability which creates a refugee crisis which all together lead toward untold catastrophe. What is imperative is that we awaken now and take immediate, bold steps to change course.\n\nWhat is necessary is a full scale climate emergency mobilization effort, not unlike the kind of effort undertaken by the United States during WW2. Without such an effort, the world will begin to see social collapse and mass starvation unprecedented during our lifetime. Climate disruption, if not itself disrupted, is on track to become “civilization-threatening.” Refugee crises, extreme weather events, non-survivable global temperatures making certain places uninhabitable, global food crisis, economic collapse — none of those phrases are hyperbolic. They are warnings.\n\nThe United States needs a president who understands that incremental change -even bold incremental change in regards to the climate crisis -is not enough to stave off environmental catastrophe. The American people must be informed of the severity of the problem, and enrolled in a massive national effort to deal with it.\n\nMy Climate Action plan: https://marianne2024.com/issues/climate-action/ \n\n#marianne2024 #election2024 #2024\n\nDonate to the campaign: https://marianne2024.com/donate\nJoin the movement: https://marianne2024.com\nBecome a Campaign Ambassador: https://marianne2024.com/action-hub/\nWatch videos on the issues: https://marianne2024.com/videos-on-issues/\nRead Marianne's policy platform: https://marianne2024.com/issues/\n\n#marianne2024 #anewbeginning",

    "description": "The issue of immigration at our Southern border must be dealt with not only on the level of symptom but also on the level of cause.\n\nU.S. policies have contributed mightily to the destabilization of economies throughout Latin America, fueling the desperation that then drives so many to migrate here. Of course we need an infrastructure in place to separate those with credible asylum claims from those who need to immigrate through other legal means. But nothing we do on the level of symptom will fundamentally solve the problem until we address the extreme poverty and drug cartel violence in countries from which people are seeking escape. \n\nWe need to address the forces that are driving people to seek refuge here in such massive numbers to begin with. Then and only then will we be able to carve a new path forward. That includes far more support to Latin American countries seeking to improve their economies. It also includes an end to America’s Drug War,  which actually aids the drug cartels by providing them a huge black market in the United States.\n\nDonate to the campaign: https://marianne2024.com/donate\nJoin the movement: https://marianne2024.com\nBecome a Campaign Ambassador: https://marianne2024.com/action-hub/\nWatch videos on the issues: https://marianne2024.com/videos-on-issues/\nRead Marianne's policy platform: https://marianne2024.com/issues/\n\n#marianne2024 #anewbeginning",

    "description": "This clip is from a Breaking Points interview done on June 26, 2023. It reflects my views on Israel and Palestine going back before October 7. Many saw a small clip out of context of the entirety of an interview I did about a week ago, and have now accused me of views I do not hold. Many use the word “siege” and “blockade” instead of “occupation” when it comes to Gaza, because the Israelis had left Gaza in 2005. That is what I was referring to in the now viral clip. I have spoken and written about the occupation of the West Bank, the illegality of the settlements, and the siege of Gaza for years. After the interview, I spoke to both Israelis and Arab friends who told me that the word “occupation” should still be used in reference to Gaza, and I immediately wrote a statement saying so. The mischaracterization on the part of many is purposeful and strategic. In fact, I have called for a ceasefire from the beginning of this horror. I criticized the very idea of military action before it even occurred. And my stand for Palestinian justice goes back many years. #marianne2024 #election2024 #2024 #anewbeginning #2024election #2024elections #nhpolitics #newhampshire #biden #mariannewilliamson\n\nDonate to the campaign: https://marianne2024.com/donate\nJoin the movement: https://marianne2024.com\nBecome a Campaign Ambassador: https://marianne2024.com/action-hub/\nWatch videos on the issues: https://marianne2024.com/videos-on-issues/\nRead Marianne's policy platform: https://marianne2024.com/issues/\n\n#marianne2024 #anewbeginning",

    "description": "The brilliant Kassi Underwood, Gina Marotta, and Taylor Mae Kanigowski have created Women of Wellness for Marianne.\n\nIf you’re in the field of wellness as a coach, therapist, healer or whatever else makes you feel “That’s me!” please check out the Women of Wellness in the link tree.\n\nIn my forty year plus career, I had never felt any blocks to my success due to my being a woman. But politics is a whole other story. I’m kind of amazed by the misogyny that exists there, with lies and smears and mischaracterizations that are never thrown at men the same way. Misogyny was a word I knew, yet never really experienced until now.\n\nI hope other women will see in my story a cause you too can relate too, not only for the issues I’m bringing forth of course, but in terms of the sisterhood needed to break through the resistance to women’s voices being heard. If your heart is saying “Yep,” please go to https://marianne2024.com/women-of-wellness and join us. You’ll get regular support and direction for ways you can help the campaign sprint to the finish line.\n\nIt’s time to make the COUNTRY well!🧙‍♀️💙🧚‍♂️",

    "description": "Many European countries are worker led. Whether or not ours is worker led, American workers should absolutely be on equal footing with the corporate overlords they work for.\n\nFor over 40 years, union busting has been enabled and unions have been in various ways squashed and diminished in power. That's beginning to change now, as everything from Amazon, to UAW to writers and actors arising up in a reinvigorated chapter of American labor. It's important for all of us to recognize that this is an issue central to American democracy. It has to do with whether or not there is economic justice and fair opportunity shown to the average American. This is not just about labor unions specifically; it's about what kind of country we want to live in. #union #labormovement \n\nDonate to the campaign: https://marianne2024.com/donate\nJoin the movement: https://marianne2024.com\nBecome a Campaign Ambassador: https://marianne2024.com/action-hub/\nWatch videos on the issues: https://marianne2024.com/videos-on-issues/\nRead Marianne's policy platform: https://marianne2024.com/issues/\n\n#marianne2024 #anewbeginning",

    "description": "Visit MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com\n\nAccording to journalist Andrew Cockburn in his latest book, The Spoils of War: Power, Profit and the American War Machine, our bloated $778 billion defense budget doesn’t necessarily provide for our safety. Cockburn, the Washington editor of Harper’s, has spent decades covering the Pentagon and defense industry and says money and power - not legitimate security concerns - is what drives our ballooning military budget.\n\nOur podcast conversation details how we got here. According to Cockburn, “The US defense complex is best thought of not as an organization, but as a living, insatiable, creature, dedicated only to its own defense and power.”\n\nWith our government so held hostage by the defense industry, it’s we the people who are going to have to change that.",

    "description": "Subscribe to Marianne's Substack, TRANSFORM: MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com\n\nVisit FreeDonziger.com to learn more about Steven and his case.\n\nFollow Steven Donziger on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sdonziger\n\nSteven Donziger is a Harvard law school graduate who went to Ecuador in the 1990’s. He was traveling with a team of lawyers and doctors to view the horrific evidence that Texaco, an oil giant since bought by Chevron, had poisoned a huge swath of the Ecuadorian Amazon during oil drilling in the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s. What they saw were the results of a massive and man-made environmental disaster that poisoned the water, earth and food of tens of thousands of people. Worst of all, the evidence indicated it was done deliberately as part of an engineering plan to save $3 per barrel. This horror was not an accident. \n\nUltimately, Steven led a team of lawyers in procuring a $9.5B judgement against Chevron that was affirmed by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court. Yet that was not the end of the story. For Chevron - while note even arguing the veracity of the disaster -  chose not to pay the judgment. Instead, they chose to come after the lead lawyer who held them accountable: namely, Steven Donziger. In Donziger’s words, “The company’s goal is to silence my advocacy, bankrupt my family, and intimidate activists and environmental allies.”\n\nDonziger has now spent more than 780 days under house arrest. He stands to be sentenced on Oct. 1 for contempt of court charges stemming from his refusal to turn over to Chevron his cell phone and computer containing confidential data on environmental activists here and in Ecuador. The Department of Justice having chosen not even to pursue the case, it was turned over- incredibly -to Chevron itself to prosecute. \n\nMost Americans would not believe that here in the United States, a corporation could literally use an American court to criminally prosecute its critics. And yet that is exactly what has happened: a show trial that leaves an American environmental lawyer punished harshly and at risk of imprisonment, for the not-to-be-tolerated crime of standing up to Chevron.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has not intervened in this private corporate prosecution, although he should. The request has been simply that he return the case from Chevron’s law firm to the US justice system. He has not chosen to do so despite pleas from Senators, Congresspeople, legal groups and Nobel Laureates. And this point you and I have to speak up, and speak up loudly  - for justice, for the earth, and for Steven Donziger.\n\nFollow Marianne on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/marwilliamson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mariannewilliamson",

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has also been charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 relating to classified material he published in 2010 about the war in Iraq, and according to Ellsberg the effort to punish him is as much a violation of the First Amendment as was the government's case against Ellsberg 50 years ago.\n\nEllsberg and Marianne talk about the impact of the Pentagon Papers, the importance of speaking up for Assange and how the U.S. government’s case against him puts the free press at risk.\n\nMore interviews to come on this subject. \n\nSubscribe to Marianne's Substack, TRANSFORM: MarianneWilliamson.Substack.com\n\nSubscribe to Marianne's TRANSFORM Podcast: https://spoti.fi/3mMKauu\n\nRead Daniel's books:\n- Papers on the War (https://bookshop.org/books/papers-on-the-war/9781439193761)\n- The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner (https://bookshop.org/books/the-doomsday-machine-confessions-of-a-nuclear-war-planner/9781608196739)\n\n\nFollow Marianne on Social Media\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/marwilliamson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/MarianneWilliamson",

    "description": "Palestinian-American Lana Shehadeh shares her experience about life in the West Bank with Marianne Williamson.\n\nPresident Biden has announced a ceasefire in the horrifying fighting between Israel and Hamas, obviously a very good thing. In the end however it’s merely the treatment of a symptom. The United States United States or any other country touting phrases about “peace and security” for both peoples, or even making titillating comments about “intense quiet diplomacy,” do not of themselves move us past the politics of the status quo.\n\nThis time, in a way that feels different than every other time before, the status quo is clearly untenable. US Congresspeople have stood in the well of the House to discuss the rights of the Palestinians. Congresspeople have introduced legislation to withhold military support from Israel. In the United States and around the world there is a growing consensus that when it comes to the systemic oppression of Palestinians, enough is enough.\n\nTo be clear, I believe Israel has a right to exist. But I also believe – as an American, as a Jew, and as a human being – that the right to nationhood rightfully belongs equally to the Palestinians. I am moved by neither right-wing nor left-wing propaganda to turn my back on that position. In the words of “A Course in Miracles”, “God does not give us victory in battle. He lifts us above the battlefield.” \nThere is a quote from Arundhati Roy that I love: “Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.” I believe that world indeed is possible, and where there is enough love it is inevitable.\n\n“A Course in Miracles” also says that miracles occur where total communication is given and received. The video I’ve posted is the first in a series of interviews I’m doing in which I feel total communication is given and received. And with what Lincoln described as “malice toward none and charity for all.” The people who tell the truth, but with love, are my beacons. I listen to them and I follow them. And I am glad to share their voices with you.",

That’s how much the people of the world are enchanted by the forests of Pandora, the wisdom of the Na'vi, and the drama of the Avatar.\n\nAll of those emerge from the mind of writer-director James Cameron, known not only for his extraordinary record as a filmmaker (Titanic, the Terminator films, etc.) but also as a deep sea explorer.\n\nI was excited to have a chance to sit down for a deep dive conversation with Jim Cameron, covering everything from the mysteries of Avatar to the current state of American capitalism. As he puts it, humanity is on a precipice between being “takers” and being “caretakers.” Which we choose will make all the difference.\n\nCameron is one of the geniuses of our time, and it was an honor to get to know him.\n\nFollow James on Social Media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JimCameron\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJamesCameron\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jamescameronofficial\n\nJoin The Marianne Williamson Podcast Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/themwpodcast/\n\nSubscribe to The Marianne Williamson Podcast\nYouTube Channel:  https://bit.ly/3lEb6JT\nApple Podcasts:  https://apple.co/36qnqH4\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2JV8pW4\n\nFollow Marianne on Social Media\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/marwilliamson\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mariannewilliamson\n\nWatch the full episode here: https://youtu.be/JdhWN-iG3eY\nListen to the full episode on Apple: http://apple.co/2Qirbdi\nListen to the full episode on Spotify: http://spoti.fi/3eQDMOZ",

Because, according to Kelton, we’ve\nbeen fed the “deficit myth” - the constant refrain that the only money\navailable is money that will help those who already have a lot of it.\n\nKelton’s book “The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People’s Economy” turns economic thinking on its head and\nleaves us hopeful that a compassionate, more equitable society is possible.\n\nHang around after the interview for Ask Marianne: Marianne answers\nquestions about arts in schools and the practice of peace-building.\n\nStephanie Kelton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/stephaniekelton\nStephanie’s website: https://stephaniekelton.com\nBuy The Deficit Myth: The Deficit Myth: bit.ly/3mmfSee \n\nSubscribe to The Marianne Williamson Podcast\nYouTube Channel:  https://bit.ly/3lEb6JT\nApple Podcasts:  https://apple.co/36qnqH4\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2JV8pW4\n\nFollow Marianne on Social Media\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/marwilliamson \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/williamsonmarianne\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mariannewilliamson",

I abhor and repudiate the current \"war on women,\" by which several states have in fact introduced restrictive legislation that limits women's reproductive rights.\n\nFrom my book \"A Woman's Worth\", to countless seminars and speeches in support of women and women's causes, to my Sister Giant seminars encouraging women to take a more active role as leaders, I feel my life's work speaks for itself. I hope all who agree will do what you can to spread the word that the \"soft on choice\" attack currently being waged against me is simply not true.\n\nMany thanks.\" - Marianne Williamson",

    "description": "What America needs is a politics of love, but there can be no love where there is no justice.\n\nThe greatest moral challenge of our generation is getting the money out of politics. Money now wields such a disproportionate influence on our politics compared to that wielded by the average citizen as to make a mockery of democracy. \n\nThrough banking, trade and tax policies enacted over the last few decades, the majority of the material resources of our country have been siphoned into the hands of a small percentage of Americans, creating a chronic pattern of economic, social and criminal injustice.\n\nThis pattern will not change because those who perpetrated it will choose to change it; it will only change through an uprising of the American people.  The American people don't need to demand change; we need to enact change.\n\nI hope my campaign is more than a winning one at the ballot box; I hope it provides a template by which others around the country will run on the same pro-democratic principles, helping to forge a national movement to both save and protect all that is best about the country we all love.\n\nDonate: https://mariannewilliamsonforcongress.nationbuilder.com/donate",

We all huddled together as the song was recorded. I love this song. I love this woman and I love a world that would vote for her.\" - Alanis Morissette\n\nLyrics:\nI've fallen down, joan of arc ailing, systems are failing the mission\nI've been taken down, wind from my sails, by tempers that flared and were vicious \n\nI'm going down down down\nI'm going down down down\n\nUnless we start a revolution\nAwaken from this frozen\nstart the mending of our union \nToday\n'less we revive this constitution\nFrom sure disintegration\nlive out this revelation\nToday\n\nSmile upside down, Rupture is rising,\nFamilies are scrambling for custody\nFaithlessly drowned\nThe chase of this dollar is tilting my altar t'ward apathy\n\nWe're going down down down\nWe're going down lest we move to new ground\n\n\n\n\nUnless we start a revolution\nAwaken from this frozen\nstart the mending of our union \nToday\n'less we revive this constitution\nFrom sure disintegration\nlive out this revelation\nToday\n\nWarm'd by this fire born from a flicker\nMy heart moves slower than technology\nThis dampened desire is rolling its sleeves up\nReplaced by a vigor and empathy\n\nI'm reaching higher and higher and higher\nI'm moving up and up and up\n\nAs we bandy round solution\ncelebrate our evolution\nThat antidotes our stations \ntoday\n\nAnd as we activate our nation\nAs we're joined by our companions\nwe ignite our generation \ntoday\n______\n\nVideo Paid for by Marianne Williamson for Congress",

Donate: https://mariannewilliamsonforcongress.nationbuilder.com/donate\n\nhttp://marianneforcongress.com/crowdfund\n\n_____________\n\nToday we're launching a major initiative. Many of you have asked how you can help, how you can do more to help us win this election.  We've come up with a powerful way that you can help from anywhere.\n\nWe're launching a national crowdfunding effort that allows you to personally raise funds with your own online fundraising page. You know how when you're running a marathon and you set up a fundraising page? This is the same thing!\n\nThis marathon is weeks away from the finish line; the June 3rd primary.  You can help us raise over a million dollars in the next few weeks to make it happen!\n\nWe need 500 people or more to say yes to crowdfunding this campaign. \n\nCrowdfunding is the practice of funding a cause by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet. \n\nYou would be surprised by how many people, if you were to ask them, would say they are fans and would be glad to support this campaign with a donation of $5 or more. If 500 people around the country reach a personal crowdfunding goal of $2,500, then we will raise over a million dollars quickly. \n\nWhether you help the campaign raise $50, $500 or $5,000, you'll be helping us win the race.\n\nBecoming a personal fundraiser is easy; you can do it from your computer, no matter where you are.  \n\nThe fundraising page is already set up for you!  You can promote your page using e-mail, Facebook and/or Twitter. \n\nLet's get started!\n\nVISIT http://marianneforcongress.com/crowdfund TO BEGIN \n\nIt's simple and easy to use, and our Crowdfunding Directors Linda and Tina are here to help you should you have any questions: crowdfundmarianne@marianneforcongress.com\n\nPlease note: You must be a U.S. Citizen or permanent resident/green card holder to be a fundraiser and/or to donate.\n\nAs you know, our campaign is completely grass roots: we raise no money from special interest PACs or lobbyists. This means it's up to us  -- we the people -- to fund this effort. \n\nI am deeply grateful for your contribution and support. \n\nWith love,\n\nMarianne\n\nP.S. We need volunteers on a daily basis. If you live in the greater Los Angeles area, the Campaign headquarters is open every day between 10-7 and until 10 pm on Thursdays.  \n\nIf you can't get to headquarters, please write us at volunteer@marianneforcongress.com and we will send you a packet so you can phone bank from your home.\n\nPaid for by Marianne Williamson for Congress",
