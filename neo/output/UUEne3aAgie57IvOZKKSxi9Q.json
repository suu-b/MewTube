    "title": "Valence Realism, Consciousness & AI - Andrés Gómez Emilsson",
    "description": "Andrés Gómez-Emilsson, director of research at the Qualia Research Institute (QRI) discusses valence realism, the mathematics of consciousness, and what all this might mean for AI alignment and the long-term future of sentient life. Valence realism, as QRI uses the term, is the claim that for any given conscious state there is a mind-independent fact of the matter about how good or bad it feels overall – even when our verbal reports or surface preferences disagree.\n\nGómez-Emilsson situates valence realism within “qualia formalism”: the hypothesis that every conscious experience corresponds to a specific mathematical object, such that the structure of that object is isomorphic to the structure of the experience. On this view, consciousness is not ineffable mush; it has a precise, if currently unknown, mathematical description. From there QRI develops “valence structuralism”: the idea that the pleasantness or unpleasantness of an experience is determined by specific mathematical features of that object, in principle allowing a sufficiently mature theory to compute how good or bad a state feels, “all things considered”.\n\nRead associated the blog post: https://www.scifuture.org/valence-realism-consciousness-and-ai-a-conversation-with-andres-gomez-emilsson/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Part 3 of 3 - David Enoch counters Sharon Street's evolutionary debunking argument (EDA), also known as the \"Darwinian Dilemma,\" challenges moral realism—the view that objective moral truths exist independently of human attitudes. The argument posits that natural selection has significantly shaped our moral beliefs for survival advantage, not for their accuracy in tracking independent moral facts, leading to the conclusion that our moral knowledge is likely an illusion if realism is true.\n\nDavid responds to the evolutionary debunking argument by employing a \"third-factor\" explanation and an argument from deliberative indispensability. He argues that the debunker fails to show that a correlation between moral facts and beliefs is impossible or improbable for the realist.\n\nEnoch accepts the premise that evolution has strongly influenced our moral beliefs in ways that promote survival, but he denies that this influence means our beliefs are unreliable regarding objective moral facts. He proposes a \"third-factor\" (or \"pre-established harmony\") explanation: \n\n - 1.    Survival as the Common Factor: Certain objective moral facts (e.g., that survival is good, that pain is bad) are true independently of human attitudes.\n - 2.

    "description": "Anders discusses the risks of AI gains in persuasion capability - which could lead to a broken epistemic system.  People will use AI to persuade each other (not just marketers, or politicians), but average people seeking to convince each other of the correctness of their own views - if they think others will do it then they may think they need to do it first because they might be persuaded by their wrong views - each not wanting to be persuaded by the other, this creates a multi-polar trap of persuasion - a molochian dynamic - a persuasion war may occur that reduces to more memes and less reason for every position in the world.  This could be even worse when there are fights about value systems - we may be getting wrong values from our interactions under this dynamic.    Once you have a broken value system & epistemic system things may fall apart. \n\nThough we may be too individualistic to be really persuaded - but we don't really know how many back-doors there are into the human psyche.\n\n\"You've Gotta Believe Me\" tech - was coined by Vernor Vinge.\n\nAnders Sandberg is a Swedish researcher, futurist and transhumanist.

    "description": "Anders: 10% AI will wipe us out - 90% things will go swimmingly.\nAccelerationists often say there is no AI risks and we should rush to superintelligence, without recognising that AI may produce outcomes that are profoundly non-human.  \n\nSome think AI will develop values that are alien, and that humans can't understand - but are nevertheless good ones.  \n\nI'll be writing about some reflections on the problem of value arbitrariness highlighted in the classic Euthyphro dilemma, and how it relates to AI value alignment. The dilemma is found in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro where Socrates asks Euthyphro: \"Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\"\n\nTake pious to mean moral. If the former is true, even if God doesn't exist, those moral facts would still be true.\n\nAn agnostic or secular AI alignment researcher considering the question of whether AI should be in alignment with values merely because humans value them, or whether AI should be in alignment with values because they are really valuable - in some grounded and/or robust sense.   Put in another way, is the rightness of value independent of our attitudes?  And if it's possible to do this, to what degree can we, and AI know or approximate real values, and if possible should this guide alignment efforts?\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

The classical ideals of truth, goodness and beauty — once the moral and aesthetic compass of the European tradition — are being twisted.\n\nStefan Lorenz Sorgner's book introduces the reader to Euro-Transhumanism—a distinctive, philosophically rich alternative to the individualistic, technocratic focus of classic transhumanism. It draws upon Europe’s continental cultural tradition, rejects eurocentrism, utopian fantasies and dualistic thinking, and explores pragmatic ways of increasing the diversity of personal flourishing.\n\nThe interview on Nietzsche, the Overhuman & Transhumanism with Stefan done in 2014 is here: https://youtu.be/xt3KJtoJ9KY\n\nSorgner on Eurotranshumanism: https://youtu.be/Y4Kdung14CU\n\nThis is a thought-provoking guide to critically reimagining our future.\nSee book: https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/euro-transhumanism\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Halloween special: a scary futures tier list that is spooky in theme & sobering in content.  This tier list isn't scientific, it isn't the final say, it doesn't exhaustively include all doomsday risks - its a bit of a gimmick, and a fun intuition pump.\n\nAnders Sandberg is a neuroscientist and futurist well known for sizing up the biggest canvases we’ve got. Formerly a senior research fellow at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, he’s worked on AI, cognitive enhancement, existential risk, and those deliciously unsettling Fermi-paradox puzzles. His forthcoming books include “Law, Liberty and Leviathan: human autonomy in the era of existential risk  and Artificial Intelligence”, and a big one - “Grand Futures—a tour of what’s physically possible for advanced civilisations”. He authored classic papers like \"Daily Life Among the Jupiter Brains\" (which came out in 1999), and co-authored  “Eternity in Six Hours” on intergalactic expansion, and “Dissolving the Fermi Paradox.”\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:33 Why a tier list of scary futures?\n3:32 Doom by natural causes - everyone dies by natural causes (all at once)\n5:03 Doom by asphyxiation - everyone suffocates (all at once)\n6:08 Reasoning about super-unlikely but super-high impact scenarios - Probing the Improbable [1]\n7:21 Death by LHC (Large Hadron Collider) - particle physics risks\n10:01 Dark Fire \n15:30 Vacuum Decay - bubbles of nothing\n18:34 How Unlikely is a Doomsday?

    "description": "Can current AI really reason - or are large language models just clever parrots, skipping the \"understanding\" step humans rely on?\n\nIn this interview, Ben Goertzel (founder of SingularityNET and OpenCog) digs into one of the most fascinating debates in AI today: he argues that there is a big difference between appearing to reason and actually building abstract representations required for reasoning. We talk about Google Gemini’s gold medal at the International Math Olympiad, the paper The Illusion of Thinking, and whether LLMs can ever reach true reasoning ability.\n\nAlso we discuss whether reasoning is required for morality, whether AI will ever win a Moral Olympiad, and if it does, will this be a reliable signal that the AI is actually moral.\n\nFinally we discuss whether AI may converge on new kinds of reasoning and logic, and also whether the ontology of the universe determines the kind of logic that arises within it.\n\nAlong the way we explore:\n\nWhy humans learn strategy differently from Deep Blue or AlphaZero\n\nThe link between reasoning, creativity, and Maggie Boden’s ideas on AI imagination\n\nWhat’s missing in current AI when it comes to abstract representation\n\nSearle’s Chinese Room and whether LLMs “understand” anything\n\nSam Altman’s redefinition of AGI\n\nAnd whether AI could one day win a “Moral Olympiad” — or if ethical reasoning requires grounding in empathy\n\nQuotes from the interview: \n- \"The way Deep Blue or AlphaZero are playing chess, they are not learning general strategic principles, they are learning highly particular patterns about that particular game. We are not as good at chess or Go as they are, but we are extracting more generalisable knowledge when we learn to play chess or than these other algorithms are.\n\n- \"Could you come up with a different go algorithm that combined the best of AlphaGo with the best of the human mind, and abstracted general strategic principles as well as a humongous library of very specific go playing patterns - quite possibly you could\"\n\n- \"A human cannot very easily turn knowledge into a bunch of text depicting an abstract representation of that knowledge without actually in it's mind constructing the abstract representation of that knowledge, right?  An LLM can go straight from that abstract representation of knowledge to some text depicting an abstract representation of that knowledge without ever having an inside it's ram state the [actual] abstract representation of that knowledge - because it's learning from a set of ordered pairs.. so it's making a leap from the [abstract representation of the] knowledge to the textual depiction of the abstract representation, right?\"\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:02 Grounding the idea of reasoning\n6:44 Paper: 'The Illusion of Thinking' / Google Gemini wins International Math Olympiad - can LLMs do 'actual' reasoning?\n19:52 Will LLMs ever get to 100% reasoning ability?  What's missing is creativity\n21:07 Humans, Deep Blue and AlphaZero all learn differently - humans learn from general strategic principles\n24:55  Maggie Boden & AI Creativity\n25:59 What else is required for AI to achieve true creativity?\n32:56 Is Gemini (or LLMs) capable of abstract representation?\n36:32  Searl's Chinese Room - and the pipeline from knowledge to the textual depiction of the abstract representation of the know\n41:22 Sam Altman's redefinition of AGI \n42:30 Olympiad level mathematics conquered - is common sense reasoning next?\n43:17 Will AI win a Moral Olympiad?\n44:38 Is it enough for AI predict human ethical judgements without understanding of what ethics is or grounding in empathy?  \n48:21 The danger of AI not understanding ethics\n50:59 AI grounding moral reasoning (in empathy)\n55:25 Are Google / Deepmind thinking about reasoning in the right way?

Colin is a leading voice at the intersection of AI ethics, cognitive science, and moral philosophy, with decades of work exploring how morality might be implemented in artificial agents.\n\nWe cover the current state of AI, its capabilities and limitations, and how philosophical frameworks like moral realism, particularism, and virtue ethics apply to the design of AI systems. Colin offers nuanced insights into top-down and bottom-up approaches to machine ethics, the challenges of AI value alignment, and whether AI could one day surpass humans in moral reasoning.\n\nAlong the way, we discuss oversight, political leanings in LLMs, the knowledge argument and AI sentience, and whether AI will actually care about ethics.\n\nAlso see this blog post about the interview: https://www.scifuture.org/are-machines-capable-of-morality-join-professor-colin-allen/\n\nThis video is a corrected version of a previous video.\n\n0:00 Intro\n3:03 AI: Where are we at now?\n7:53 AI Capability Gains\n11:12 Gemini Gold Level in International Math Olympiad & Goodhart's law\n15:42 What AI can and can't do well\n21:00 Why AI ethics?\n25:56 Oversight committees can be slow\n29:02 Sliding between out, on and in the loop\n31:19 Can AI be more moral than humans?\n32:22 Moral realism & moral naturalism\n25:26 Particularism\n39:32 Are moral truths discoverable by AI?\n45:40 Machine understanding\n1:00:15 AI coherence across far larger context windows?\n1:04:09 Humans can update beliefs in ways that current LLMs can't\n1:09:23 LLM political leanings\n1:11:23 Value loading & understanding\n1:16:36 More on machine understanding\n1:21:17 Care Risk: Will AI care about ethics?\n1:27:07 The knowledge argument applied to sentience in AI\n1:35:58 Autonomy\n1:47:47 Bottom up and top down approaches to AI ethics\n1:54:11 Top down vs bottom up approaches as AI becomes more capable\n2:08:21 Conclusions and thanks to Colin Allen\n\n#AI #ETHICS #LLM #MoralMachines \n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "James Barrat discusses his book ‘The Intelligence Explosion: When AI Beats Humans at Everything’ (Amazon link, Google Book link) which is expected to be released June 10, and also another up and coming book on AI-weapons (see video below).\n\nIn a thought-provoking discussion, James Barrett, author of “Our Final Invention,” lays out the complex and potentially perilous landscape of artificial intelligence, particularly the much-discussed “intelligence explosion.” This hypothetical tipping point envisions a rapid, self-driven surge in AI intelligence, potentially leading to artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even superintelligence. Barrett underscores the historical roots of this concern, referencing IJ Good’s early conceptualisation of an “ultraintelligent machine” and the inherent dangers of developing such powerful technology without adequate safeguards. The current corporate fervour to achieve AGI, exemplified by Open AI’s own definition, only amplifies these anxieties, bringing the critical “alignment problem” – ensuring AI aligns with human values – into sharp focus.\n\nTo understand the present trajectory of AI, Barrett takes us back to the foundational work of Frank Rosenblatt and his creation of the Mark 1 perceptron, a pioneering step in artificial neural networks. He navigates the early promise and subsequent limitations of these networks, including the influential critique by Marvin Minsky which stifled early interest in connectionist approaches to AI. This historical context illuminates the remarkable journey from these nascent beginnings to the sophisticated deep learning models and generative AI we see today. The evolution has been rapid, bringing us closer to may of the promises and perils envisioned in discussions about the intelligence explosion.\n\nScifuture Post 'The Looming Shadow of the Intelligence Explosion: A Deep Dive with James Barrett': https://www.scifuture.org/james-barrat-discusses-book-the-intelligence-explosion/\n\nJames Barrat's book: https://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Explosion-Beats-Humans-Everything/dp/1250355028\n\n#IntelligenceExplosion #AI #Superintelligence #AGI \n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "title": "Are We Ready for AI Welfare?  Jeff Sebo",
    "description": "Jeff Sebo argues that there is a realistic possibility that some AI systems will be conscious and/or robustly agentic in the near future. That means that the prospect of AI welfare and moral patienthood, i.e. of AI systems with their own interests and moral significance, is no longer an issue only for sci-fi or the distant future. It is an issue for the near future, and AI companies have a responsibility to start taking it seriously. Jeff also recommend three early steps that AI companies can take: They can (1) acknowledge that AI welfare is an important and difficult issue (and ensure that language model outputs do the same), (2) start assessing AI systems for evidence of consciousness and robust agency, and (3) prepare policies and procedures for treating AI systems with an appropriate level of moral concern. To be clear, Jeff’s argument is not that AI systems definitely are, or will be, conscious, robustly agentic, or otherwise morally significant. Instead, my argument is that there is substantial uncertainty about these possibilities, and so we need to improve our understanding of AI welfare and our ability to make wise decisions about this issue. Otherwise there is a significant risk that we will mishandle decisions about AI welfare, mistakenly harming AI systems that matter morally and/or mistakenly caring for AI systems that do not. \n\nBlog post here: https://www.scifuture.org/taking-ai-welfare-seriously-future-day-talk-with-jeff-sebo/\n\nThis talk is based on a 2024 multi-author report that you can find here.\n\nThis talk was held at Future Day 2025\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "We already can make deepfakes of ourselves and others. There is an issue of consent; ideally people should consent to have digital twins of themselves made, even if its your grandma.\n\nBut if we start making digital twins of ourselves, which is already being done, they can go out and do things on our behalf. Many may not object to this application, but it will raise questions about identity. We want them to be sophisticated enough, and attentive to us enough, to perfectly mimic us, but not so sophisticated that they develop goals or identity of their own.\n\nWhat if they do something criminal – are we liable?\n\nWhat if your deepfake of grandma isn’t just her best, more friendly, most knowledgeable version, but starts to get creative or go rogue?\n\nWhen would we have qualms about turning them off?\n\nPeople can make ‘Afterselves’ (or death-bots) for the dying or dead, but if we start making our own, and refine them over time, they become digital assets that our descendants could inherit. Like copyright, the consent of the dead is probably a matter of time. We can make Einstein bots as much as we want, but should get grandma’s permission. Gifting our digital assets including agents to our inheritors is even better than consent.\n\nIf the person died in the last 30 years you need permission, but not before.\n\nThe utility question is moot – having a specific personality is only a gimmick for humans. We would have “Top Engineer” not bots with Einstein’s personality – and you definitely don’t want them to have self.\n\nSee associated blog post: https://www.scifuture.org/the-future-virtual-you-how-will-digital-twins-and-afterselves-change-our-identities/\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:42 Talk Starts - The Future Digital You\n01:30 Blockchain and Agents - ChatGPT inspired James\n05:30 Origins of the Distributed Self\n08:09 Co-Evolution of Humans & Tech\n11:59 Self-Interest, Preferences, Agency\n16:08 Is Cognitive Offloading Bad?\n17:58 The Illusion of Agency and Autonomy\n23:15 Digital Twins and AI Superego\n23:31 Deathbots and Respect for the Dead\n27:23 Suffering and Compassionate Machines\n29:43 Talk End\n30:14 Would you want your death-bot to experience consciousness?\n33:13 What if your future 'digital you' shifted away from your values?\n36:05 Which values should we lock-in, which to evolve?\n37:52 Foundational principles for your digital twin representing you?\n39:26 The 'Great Library', and sentient books\n42:10 People editing your digital-twin's values\n43:46 Value updating via persuasion by good arguments vs ideological implant\n45:58 Implanting vast amounts of philosophical/ethical literature in your brain - normative enhancement?\n49:18 Why do LLMs generally exhibit liberal values?\n52:42 What moral obligations/leanings should be given to digital twins?\n55:29 Are LLMs more morally consistant than humans?\n58:28 Will authoritarian takeover of LLMs work?\n01:00:04 Worries about digital twins being caught in samsara\n01:01:38 Should death-bots/digital twins liberate people from samsara?\n01:03:02 Should multiple copies of your digital self be allowed?\n01:04:11 Governance of and cooperation with digital twins\n01:06:35 Should 'elder' digital-twins play the role of moral advisors?\n01:10:03 Digital selves joining hive minds - and do we want an afterself for america?\n01:12:41 Should your digial-selves be alowed to convert to extremist ideologies?\n01:16:04 Reconstructing digital versions of famous historical figures?\n01:17:13 Concluding thoughts - the future is so unpredictable\n\nJames Hughes Future Day talk on The Future Digital You\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

It might be important to assess how accurately LLMs can be aware of their own performances. Here we investigate the general metacognitive abilities of the LLMs by analysing LLM and humans confidence judgements. Human subjects tended to be less confident when they answered incorrectly than when they answered correctly. However, the GPT-4 showed high confidence even in the questions that they could not answer correctly.

    "description": "AI Consciousness Panel - Will machines wake up? \n🧠 AI consciousness: myth, reality, or an emergent inevitability?\n🧠 What is the ontological relationship between the mind and brain?\n🧠 Will EMs be conscious or will they be digital zombies? \n\nPanellists Ben Goertzel, Robin Hanson and Ken Mogi discuss the philosophical question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) will achieve consciousness or sentience, essentially \"waking up\" and becoming self-aware. While AI can mimic human behaviour and perform complex tasks, true consciousness with emotions and self-awareness remains a major mystery in the field, making the idea of AI \"waking up\" a topic of debate among scientists and philosophers.\n\nParticipants: Ben Goertzel, Ken Mogi, Robin Hanson\n\nBen Goertzel is a leading figure in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research and has a computationalist, emergentist, and optimistic view of AI consciousness. His work is centered on developing AI that is not just narrowly intelligent but capable of general cognition, self-reflection, and possibly consciousness. Goertzel believes that AI does not need to be biological to be conscious, the AI may end up having completely alien consciousness – evolving far beyond human intelligence and in the process, discover and embody varieties of types of consciousness.\n\nKen Mogi is a neuroscientist, philosopher, and author with a strong focus on qualia, the nature of consciousness, and the role of embodied experience in cognition. His views on AI consciousness are deeply influenced by neuroscience, Japanese philosophy, and the role of subjectivity in intelligence. Ken believes consciousness is deeply tied to subjective qualia, which AI may struggle to replicate, that consciousness is deeply tied to embodiment, sensory feedback, and lived experience and that AI may develop a different kind of subjective experience, possibly not human-like consciousness.\n\nRobin Hanson, an economist and futurist, approaches AI consciousness from an economic, evolutionary, and game-theoretic perspective rather than a philosophical or cognitive science angle. His work primarily focuses on the implications of AI minds rather than their underlying nature. Hanson's book The Age of Em (2016) explores a future where brain emulations (\"Ems\")-exact digital copies of human brains-become dominant. These emulations would function as fully conscious, economically productive digital minds, replacing most human labor. Hanson believes that the most likely route to AI consciousness is not AGI, but direct emulation of human brains.\n\nChaired by Adam Ford – futurist, Data architect, engineer, analyst & programmer, convener of conferences, blogger at scifuture.org, host at YouTube channel Science, Technology & the Future -with over , IEET scholar, founder of H+ Australia.\n\nMore detail: https://www.scifuture.org/ghosts-in-the-machine-can-ai-ever-wake-up\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Nick Bostrom discusses satiable values vs insatiable values.\n- Insatiable values: The amount of desirability is proportional to the size of the resources - with twice as many resources you can make twice as many paper-clips or happy beings - so AI would always be happy for more - it would be willing to have the kind of utility function that would gamble the world on a 50% chance of winning double the world, or double the share of the total pie.\n- Satiable values: A resource satiable value might be more of the standard value where one would want good for yourself and your kids etc - where you have rapidly diminishing returns from additional resources.\n\nNick is the author of the best selling books: \nSuperintelligence: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198739834\nand Deep Utopia: https://nickbostrom.com/deep-utopia/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\nBuy me a coffee? https://buymeacoffee.com/tech101z\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "In this interview Jeff Sebo discusses the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and why we must take the possibility of AI sentience seriously now. He explores challenges in measuring moral significance, the risks of dismissing AI as mere tools, and strategies to mitigate suffering in artificial systems. Drawing on themes from the paper 'Taking AI Welfare Seriously' and his up and coming book 'The Moral Circle', Sebo examines how to detect markers of sentience in AI systems, and what to do about it.  We explore ethical considerations through the lens of population ethics, AI governance (especially important in an AI arms race), and discuss indirect approaches detecting sentience, as well as AI aiding in human welfare. This rigorous conversation probes the foundations of consciousness, moral relevance, and the future of ethical AI design.\n\nPaper 'Taking AI Welfare Seriously': https://eleosai.org/papers/20241030_Taking_AI_Welfare_Seriously_web.pdf\n\nBook - The Moral Circle by Jeff Sebo: https://www.amazon.com.au/Moral-Circle-Matters-Norton-Short-ebook/dp/B0D4FRLFZL\n\nJeff's Website: https://jeffsebo.net/\n\nEleos AI: https://eleosai.org/\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n01:40 Implications of failing to take AI welfare seriously\n04:43 Engaging the disengaged\n08:18 How Blake Lemoine's 'disclosure' influenced public discourse\n12:45 Will people take AI sentience seriously if it is seen tools or commodities?\n16:19 Importance, neglectedness and tractability (INT)\n20:40 Tractability: Difficulties in measuring moral significance - i.e. by aggregate brain mass\n22:25 Population ethics and the repugnant conclusion\n25:16 Pascal's mugging: low probabilities of infinite or astronomically large costs and rewards\n31:21 Distinguishing real high stakes causes from infinite utility scams\n33:45 The nature of consciousness, and what to measure in looking for moral significance in AI\n39:35 Varieties of views on what's important.

    "description": "Interview with Eric Sampson on AI & Moral Realism - we dive into whether AI can discover and align with objective ethical truths and what this means for the broader projects of AI ethics and alignment. Topics include the challenges of designing AI as moral enquirers, indirect normativity, population ethics, and the implications of AI becoming superintelligent - and becoming closer approximations of ideal moral observers.\n\nWe discuss the risks of AI's taking treacherous turns, biases in AI moral reasoning, and the possibility of AI optimizing for values beyond those of humans. The conversation also delves into free will, the ontology of morality, and the moral significance of non-human entities including animals and AI.  We also discuss utopias, Nozick's 'Experience Machine' and hive minds.\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 If Moral Realism is true, will AI discover it?\n00:04:14 Motivating/designing AI to become a good moral enquirer / track the moral arc\n00:09:33 Stochastic parrotry or 'grokking' - can AI understand moral philosophy?\n00:13:38 Testing whether Black-box AI is doing actual moral reasoning\n00:16:07 AI may be great moral reasoners, but not care - treacherous turns\n00:17:31 Wise caution in epistemic deference to AI, learning moral strategies from AI\n00:18:36 Indirect Normativity\n00:22:16 Population axiology, repugnant conclusions, pluralistic strategies for forming agreement\n00:25:16 Bubble worlds, permeable utopias appealing to a plurality of values\n00:28:04 Superintelligent AI approaching an ideal observer - great at detecting moral truths\n00:30:51 If superintelligence had correctly identified moral truths, could they faithfully be communicated to us?\n00:32:41 Self-interested humans biasing the AI for personal gain\n00:35:53 Moral realism + market, political, religious dynamics\n00:42:43 AI governance?\n00:45:00 AI optimizing for a morally real goodness without humanity\n00:47:53 Uplift from human to morally permissible posthuman?\n00:50:46 Nick Bostrom's Deep Utopia - life and meaning in a solved / post instrumental world\n00:56:48 Indirect Normativity and Christianity\n00:59:24 Verifiability convincing rather than rhetorically convincing\n01:00:24 Nozick's experience machine, yes or no?\n01:02:47 Timed experience machines, Permutation City and drugs\n01:05:12 The Matrix. Reverse experience machine - would you leave and live in basement reality?\n01:07:05 Free will, compatibilism, libertarianism \n01:08:29 Can AI have free will?\n01:10:13 Is there a physical pattern to free will?  Will AI find it?\n01:12:34 Will AI discover a continuum of 'realness' between compartmentalised pillars of academic discipline?\n01:15:12 Trading off autonomy and well-being\n01:17:23 Hive minds - would you join?\n01:21:04 Mind uploading and the evolution of the concept of dying\n01:25:04 Gradual replacement\n01:28:05 The ontology of morality\n01:37:16 The moral significance of non-human animals and AI\n01:39:24 Directed panspermia - avoiding suffering vs preserving the capacity for value\n01:44:03 Metaethics for AI alignment\n\nThis video offers a comprehensive look at how AI might navigate the moral landscape of the future - ideal for those curious about AI ethics, moral philosophy, and the future of human-AI coexistence.\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Asher Soryl presents and does an extensive Q&A afterwards.\n\nAbstract: Directed panspermia involves the deliberate spread of life between planets by intelligent actors. While it was originally proposed to explain the origins of life on Earth, recent advancements in space and bio-technology suggest that humans could soon attempt this – and perhaps even succeed. Biocentric ethical theories support attempting directed panspermia to increase life’s cosmic abundance and to protect it from possible extinction risks on Earth. However, if this project succeeds and sentient life evolves within the resulting biospheres, it also carries the moral risk of creating astronomical levels of suffering. Taking into account epistemic and normative uncertainty, the potential irreversibility of our actions, and the lack of global coordination on the development and implementation of space technology, we argue for a temporary moratorium on directed panspermia – at least, until we can predict its long-term outcomes to ensure that whatever decision we make is ethically robust.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n01:34 Talk begins\n03:16 Outline\n05:19 What is Panspermia?\n09:38 Directed Panspermia is..\n10:51 Biocentrism\n16:42 Welfarism\n19:10 Evolution of Sentience\n22:34 Animal Suffering\n29:26 Value of Directed Panspermia\n33:00 Astronomical Waste\n36:06 What about X-Risk!\n40:36 Q&A\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Liberal and social democracy are in crisis. Democracy has always been in some crisis over the last century, but this time is different. Fewer people today participate in or trust the institutions of democracy – civic associations, parties, and unions – and more have tuned out politics or turned to strongman fiefdoms and far-right cults. In a global survey in 2023, the Pew Research Center found that almost two-thirds of people in 24 democracies believe their political systems need to be completely reformed. Support for representative democracy is sharply down since 2017 in half the countries surveyed and only higher in three countries (Brazil, Mexico, and Poland). Democracy is a very recent experiment in human governance and may be about to undergo a phase change for better or worse.\n\nSee substack article: https://ieet.substack.com/p/can-ai-improve-democracy\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Join us for an insightful conversation with Leslie Allan as we delve into the intricacies of freedom and free will. In this interview, we explore the meanings and implications of freedom and free will, examining how randomness, determinism, and indeterminism play into these concepts. \n\nLeslie introduces the '4C Theory of Free Will', which . \n1.   absence of Compulsion;\n2.   absence of Control by a third party;\n3.   consonant with the agent's Character;  and\n4.   Cognitive capacity to reason.\n\nWe also discuss the requirements for artificial intelligence to possess free will and the relationship between compatibilism and moral responsibility.\n\nOur conversation extends to the ethical considerations of mind-reading technology and moral enhancement, as well as the interaction between free will and the law. We clarify the two meanings of ‘libertarian’ and how linguistic conventions shape our understanding of free will, drawing insights from the Oxford School of Normal Language Philosophy. We navigate the delicate equilibrium between freedom and compulsion and explore how modern neuroscience informs the compatibilism debate.\n\nLeslie challenges the materialistic worldview by asking whether we are merely free-willing robots and discusses whether we can be morally good without compatibilism. We examine the role of praise, blame, and moral responsibility in compatibilism and take a critical look at Sam Harris’ dismissal of compatibilism. Finally, we explore the intricate connections between moral responsibility and determinism. \n\nDon't miss this engaging discussion that challenges our fundamental beliefs about free will, morality, and the human condition.

    "description": "Interview with Keith Wiley, author of science fiction novel 'Contemplating Oblivion.  \"A spectacular vision of the far future, in which the functioning of the mind is separated from the substrate of the brain, enabling light-speed interstellar travel and wild explorations of consciousness. Wiley depicts a society consumed with curiosity about the nature of consciousness, but also vexed by existential angst over the end of the universe, when even the immortals will perish.\"\n—RANDAL KOENE PHD • Founder & CEO of Carboncopies.org • Founder of Minduploading.org • past Director of the Department of Neuroengineering at Tecnalia\n\nDescription: \"Qualia: the quality or feeling of a conscious experience. Qualia can't be described, they must be experienced to be known. A million years in the future, physics is closed. Humanity has computerized the brain, solved death, and spread across the galaxy. The greatest challenge that remains is figuring out how a quadrillion immortal, nearly omnipotent humans might survive the eventual end of the universe.\n\nLysandra is a million-year-old quale-diver, a person who designs novel neural configurations in search of new conscious experiences—qualia. When she discovers a conscious state that hints at a solution to the universe-survival problem, the entire galaxy erupts with renewed excitement and hope. The final question to end all questions might be on the brink of a solution. But there are those who believe that surviving the end of the universe will destabilize the timeless cycle of infinite universes, leading to eternal oblivion, and they will stop at nothing to prevent Lysandra from completing her work.\" \n\nBuy the book here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9C5MJZT/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "When we think about the lives of free-living wild animals, it is easy to imagine that they have acceptable levels of welfare when left alone in nature. But if we consider the population dynamics and most common life history strategies of free-living wild animals, we find that many – perhaps most – individuals who come into existence lead very short lives, and the manner of their deaths plausibly involves considerable suffering. This suggests that their welfare might be very poor, which has serious implications on how we conceive of our ethical attitudes toward helping wildlife. This talk will explore some of the reasons for why suffering might be so prevalent in nature, and aims to show that the commonly held belief about wild animals being 'happy' when left alone is unsubstantiated.\n\nBio: Asher Soryl is an independent researcher at More Lucid, a PhD candidate at the University of Otago, and a part-time orangutan at 'Arataki.me'. His current projects concern directed panspermia, valence, phenomenology, and alternative ontologies for studying brain aging and consciousness.\nhttps://ashersoryl.com/\nhttps://arataki.me/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "'Generative debunking and the holy grail of fact-checking':  John Cook discusses the usefulness of AI in fact checking.  Misinformation researchers refer to automatic detection and debunking of misinformation as the “holy-grail of fact-checking”. Machine learning models have achieved high accuracy in detecting contrarian claims about climate change, as well as detecting logical fallacies in climate misinformation. However, there is a significant gap between misinformation detection and automatic generation of corrections that are both accurate and effective. Debunkings should adhere to the best-practice recommendations informed by psychological research, such as the fact-myth-fallacy-fact structure (aka the “truth sandwich”). In this presentation, Dr. John Cook will outline how he combined machine learning research on fallacy and contrarian claim detection with generative AI to develop a model that automatically debunks climate misinformation using “truth sandwich” corrections.\n\nHe recently co-authored 'Developing an Ad Hominem typology for classifying climate misinformation': https://www.meetup.com/science-technology-and-the-future/events/301013533/\n\nThis was an event hosted by SciFuture held at The Clyde Hotel - Thursday 23rd.\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "\"Thoughts on modernity’s monoculture mistake\" - Here Robin Hanson argues that \"cultural drift\" poses a significant threat to societies, especially in the context of rapid technological and social change. Cultural drift refers to the gradual shift in societal norms and values over time, often driven by small, incremental changes that go unnoticed until they lead to significant consequences. Hanson suggests that this phenomenon can erode important cultural values and institutions, leading to societal instability and conflict. He calls for greater awareness of cultural drift and a concerted effort to preserve and protect core cultural values and traditions.\n\nRobin Hanson is an associate professor of economics at George Mason University and a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University.\n\nArticle: https://quillette.com/2024/04/11/beware-cultural-drift/\n\n\"Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best.\" ~Herodotus circa. 440 BCE\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\nPlease support SciFuture by subscribing and sharing!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Jesse Hoogland the executive director of Timaeus, an AI safety research org working on Developmental Interpretability. \n\nLinks:\njessehoogland.com\nx.com/jesse_hoogland\ntimaeus.co\n\n\nAbout Interpretability (ML & AI): Transparency and interpretability is the ability for the decision processes and inner workings of AI and machine learning systems to be understood by humans or other outside observers.\n\nPresent-day machine learning systems are typically not very transparent or interpretable. You can use a model's output, but the model can't tell you why it made that output. This makes it hard to determine the cause of biases in ML models.\n\nA prominent subfield of interpretability of neural networks is mechanistic interpretability, which attempts to understand how neural networks perform the tasks they perform, for example by finding circuits in transformer models. This can be contrasted to subfieds of interpretability which seek to attribute some output to a part of a specific input, such as clarifying which pixels in an input image caused a computer vision model to output the classification \"horse\".\nhttps://www.lesswrong.com/tag/interpretability-ml-and-ai\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "A discussion between David Pearce and James Hughes moderated by Adam Ford exploring the ethical and philosophical landscapes of AI, human enhancement and the future of emerging technologies affording higher states of well-being.\n\nDavid Pearce, a philosopher known for his work on the Hedonistic Imperative and The Abolitionist Project, advocates for the use of biotechnology to abolish suffering and enhance well-being. His ideas center around the notion of 'paradise engineering,' aiming to redesign the living world so that sentient beings possess gradients of bliss, free from pain and suffering.\n\nJames Hughes, a sociologist and the executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technology (IEET), and author of Citizen Cyborg, specializes in bioethics and policy regarding human enhancement technologies. His approach integrates concerns about social justice with the potential benefits of technological advancements. He emphasizes the importance of democratic governance in the deployment of enhancement technologies and is a proponent of techno-progressivism, which supports the use of technology to enhance human capacities while advocating for policies that ensure these benefits are accessible to all.\n```\n\nPearce and Hughes will discuss the implications of transforming human experience via leveraging biotech and cybernetics. They will critically evaluate the feasibility, ethics, and societal ramifications of manifesting a post-human condition characterized by the radical reduction (perhaps the wholesale eradication) of suffering, increasing well-being (happiness, and novelty sensitivity etc) as well as interrogate the ethics, the hazards associated with biological technological interventions, and the deep philosophical quandaries surrounding the nature of well-being - and the ongoing journey of discovering what well-being is (whilst avoiding value lock-in).\n\nAdditionally, their conversation will consider artificial intelligence, reflecting on its recent capability gains. They will explore the potential of tomorrow's transformative AI technologies, probing whether these advances will serve as catalysts for good or vectors of risk. The dialogue will scrutinize how AI might either facilitate or obstruct ethical post-humanism. It will also consider AI’s potential to meticulously navigate the philosophical nuances of what value and well-being are and the need for equitable distribution of enabling technologies to prevent exacerbating social disparities.\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Interview with David Quarel at #EffectiveAltruism - EAGx Australia 2023.\nDavid Quarel, a Ph.D. student at the Australian National University, is deeply involved in the field of AI, specifically focusing on AI safety and reinforcement learning. He works under the guidance of Marcus Hutter and is currently engaged in studying Hutter's Universal AI model. This model is an ambitious attempt to define intelligence through the lens of simplicity and data compression. It operates on the idea that the better you can compress data, the more you understand it. This ties in with the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, suggesting that superior data compression is an indicator of higher intelligence.\n\nHowever, applying the Universal AI model practically is challenging, especially in complex environments like video games, due to its intricate nature. David also sheds light on the evolution from symbolic AI, which relies on clear sets of rules and axioms, to deep learning. Deep learning models, which are now more prevalent, learn from vast datasets to develop versatile and often uninterpretable solutions.\n\nThe size of AI models is a crucial factor in their effectiveness. Larger models have more capacity to learn and encode information but face risks of overfitting or underperforming if not balanced with adequate data and computational resources. An interesting phenomenon in deep learning, known as \"grokking,\" occurs when a model suddenly improves its performance on a test set after extensive training. This leap in understanding is not yet fully understood and might be comparable to how humans experience \"eureka\" moments in learning.\n\nDavid also discusses the unexpected capabilities emerging in AI models. For instance, models designed to predict sequences have spontaneously developed advanced skills like playing chess, suggesting they can learn planning and strategy. This advancement indicates a significant leap in AI's potential.\n\nFurthermore, the move towards multimodal AI, where models can process various types of data (like images and text), significantly broadens their potential applications and capabilities. The conversation touches upon finding the right balance in AI model size and the unpredictable nature of AI development, as evidenced by the grokking phenomenon and the emergence of new, unforeseen abilities in AI models. These developments raise critical questions about the future of AI and its implications, particularly in understanding and applying these advanced technologies.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:55 Universal AI, intelligence & compression\n03:44 The deep learning explosion\n04:47 Emergent capabilities in LLMs\n06:17 Grokking - can LLMs 'understand' stuff?\n08:26 Are there shared patterns of understanding? \n09:21 Operational undertandings of understanding\n11:35 Emergence of unexpected behaviors\n12:54 Planning capabilities appearing in LLMs\n15:29 Mechanistic interpretability of LLMs\n19:14 Can AI do closed-loop mechanistic interpretability?\n22:11 Why care about AI progress?\n26:37 AGI when?\n27:45 LLM tool use\n30:18 LLM multi-modiality\n32:39 AI fuelled wargames and other dangers\n35:34 Cybernetics & AI/human collaborative intelligence \n36:55 Post-work society\n38:00 Reactions to talk about AI risk\n40:14 Warning signs for surges in AI\n42:53 AI safety research directions\n44:58 An AI safety 'manhattan project'?\n46:56 Final thoughts \n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "In this interview Jonathan Leighton discusses suffering, ethical frameworks and his new book 'The Tango of Ethics' - https://www.jonathanleighton.org/the-tango-of-ethics\nJonathan Leighton is a writer, ethics strategist, social change advocate and public speaker.\n\"Despite existing for thousands of years, the field of ethics remains strongly influenced by several largely unquestioned assumptions and cognitive biases that can dramatically affect our priorities. The Tango of Ethics: Intuition, Rationality and the Prevention of Suffering proposes a deep, rigorous reassessment of how we think about ethics. Eschewing the traditional language of morality, it places a central emphasis on phenomenological experience and the unique urgency of suffering wherever it occurs, challenges our existence bias and examines the consequences of a metaphysically accurate understanding of personal identity.\n\nA key paradigm in The Tango of Ethics is the conflict and interplay between two fundamentally different ways of seeing and being in the world ― that of the intuitive human being who wants to lead a meaningful life and thrive, and that of the detached, rational agent who wants to prevent unbearable suffering from occurring. Leighton aims to reconcile these two stances or motivations within a more holistic framework he labels 'xNU+' that places them at distinct ethical levels. This approach avoids some of the flaws of classical utilitarianism, including the notion that extreme suffering can be formally balanced out by enough bliss, while maintaining a focus on impact. He also identifies some of the limits of rationality and our dependence on intuitions to make ethical decisions.\n\nThe book explores the implications of this way of thinking for real-world ethical dilemmas and how we might incorporate it into governance. With societal collapse, increasing totalitarianism and artificial general intelligence all very real threats in the coming years, Leighton argues that it is as important as ever to promote these ethics and their implementation while there is still an opportunity for some convergence around what matters.\"\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Leslie Allan talks about the importance of theory construction and testing as opposed to naive induction, as well as the need to be wary of profound conclusions stemming from self-evident axioms - these axioms demand rigorous scrutiny.\n\nIn the grand pursuit of knowledge, Descartes' method of deducing theories from self-evident axioms holds valuable lessons. His use of deductive reasoning showcased the power of logical consistency in theory-building, leading to coincidences with the best of known science in his time. Yet, this success also imparts a crucial caution. When profound conclusions arise from what we deem self-evident, we must question the very foundations of these axioms. What seems intuitively true demands scrutiny, empirical testing, and openness to alternative perspectives. History is replete with instances where seemingly self-evident axioms were toppled by progress. Let us cultivate the intellectual humility to critically examine our assumptions, for it is through rigorous evaluation that our understanding truly thrives.\n\n\nLeslie Allan is a philosopher & humanist  - here are some of his papers: https://latrobe.academia.edu/LeslieAllan\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "The self-undermining paradox of postmodernism and relativism is that they steadfastly propagate the absolute truth that there exists no absolute truth. This contradiction is the ultimate absurdity in their philosophy, a self-defeating axiom that undermines its own premise. Their insistence on the relativity of truths, paradoxically, becomes its own grand narrative, thus contradicting the core tenet of its philosophy. In discounting objectivity, they discount the collective exploration and validation of reality, an endeavor that forms the bedrock of science and human progress. Truth, by its nature, seeks universality, not relativity. In a cosmos striving for clarity, knowledge must always seek to illuminate, not obfuscate, our understanding, standing firm against the relativistic dilution of fact.\n\nLeslie Allan is a philosopher & humanist  - here are some of his papers: https://latrobe.academia.edu/LeslieAllan\n\nSee article: http://www.scifuture.org/leslie-allan-postmodernism-relativism-are-wrong/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Our scientific observations are not pristine windows to reality; they are tinted by the theoretical frameworks and conceptual schemes that scaffold our interpretations, often smuggling in with them implicit assumptions of the very thesis they’re meant to support. We don't simply absorb the world as it is; rather, we interpret it through the filter of theoretical presuppositions. This is not to say that objectivity is an illusion or that all observations are equally valid. Rather, it highlights that our theories shape what we observe and how we interpret, and that different observers with different theoretical frameworks can witness the same phenomenon yet arrive at different interpretations. Observational evidence can unwittingly assume the very thesis it aims to justify, creating challenges for scientific consensus. Disagreements arise when different theoretical backgrounds lead to divergent observations. Awareness of theory-laden observations is vital for untangling biases and fostering understanding in scientific inquiry. \n\nLeslie Allan is a philosopher & humanist  - here are some of his papers: https://latrobe.academia.edu/LeslieAllan\n\nSee related blog post: http://www.scifuture.org/leslie-allan-the-theory-ladenness-of-observation/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

He has also written textbooks on a variety of business subjects.\n\nRobert was adopted as a baby. His situation prompted him, in his 30s, to lead the adoptee-rights self-help and lobby group, Jigsaw Victoria, for a period of five years.  His leadership culminated in a major revision of adoption law around Australia.\n\nRobert has been an active member of the Humanist Society of Victoria for over 30 years. He has served previously as Treasurer and currently fulfills the role of Auditor. Robert has also addressed the Atheist Society in Melbourne annually on a diverse range of topics and challenges himself intellectually with his Graduate studies in criminology and archaeology.\n\nFor over 30 years, Robert's main recreational interest has been in the natural world. His activities include conservation volunteering and bush land restoration at a national park. Robert's current work involves managing two bat-box monitoring projects at a Council-owned reserve, for which he delivers progress papers at the biennial bat conferences.\n\nHe is also currently surveying frogs, skinks and fungi, and partaking in a variety of Earthwatch field biology projects.

The shift is the most significant change in AI, ever, if not in science as a whole. Machine Learning based systems are now successfully attacking both simple and complex problems using these novel Methods.\n\nWe are experiencing a revolution at the level of Epistemology which will affect much more than just the field of Machine Learning. We want to add more of these new Methods to our standard problem solving toolkit, but we need to understand the tradeoffs.\n\nBio: Monica Anderson, MSCS, is an independent AI and ML researcher and founder of Syntience Inc.\n\nHer work has focused on the Epistemology of AI but all her theory is based on her experiences of design and implementation of (Human Language) Understanding Machines based on Deep Discrete Neuron Networks since Jan 1, 2001.\n\nShe can adopt a Holistic or Reductionist stance as needed, and wants to teach others how to switch. Her current projects include creating a social medium where chat messages are routed by an Understanding Machine.

    "description": "Abstract: Superintelligence, the next phase beyond today’s narrow AI and tomorrow’s AGI, almost intrinsically evades our attempts at detailed comprehension. Yet very different perspectives on superintelligence exist today and have concrete influence on thinking about matters ranging from AGI architectures to technology regulation.\nOne paradigm considers superintelligences as resembling modern deep reinforcement learning systems, obsessively concerned with optimizing particular goal functions. Another considers superintelligences as open-ended, complex evolving systems, ongoingly balancing drives\ntoward individuation and radical self-transcendence in a paraconsistent way. In this talk I will argue that the open-ended conception of superintelligence is both more desirable and more realistic, and will discuss how concrete work being done today on projects like OpenCog Hyperon, SingularityNET and Hypercycle potentially paves the way for a path through beneficial decentralized integrative AGI and on to open-ended superintelligence and ultimately the Singularity.\n\nBio: In May 2007, Goertzel spoke at a Google tech talk about his approach to creating artificial general intelligence. He defines intelligence as the ability to detect patterns in the world and in the agent itself, measurable in terms of emergent behavior of “achieving complex goals in complex environments”. A “baby-like” artificial intelligence is initialized, then trained as an agent in a simulated or virtual world such as Second Life to produce a more powerful intelligence. Knowledge is represented in a network whose nodes and links carry probabilistic truth values as well as “attention values”, with the attention values resembling the weights in a neural network. Several algorithms operate on this network, the central one being a combination of a probabilistic inference engine and a custom version of evolutionary programming.\n\nThis talk is part of the ‘Stepping Into the Future‘ conference. http://www.scifuture.org/open-ended-vs-closed-minded-conceptions-of-superintelligence/\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Outer Space, Inner Space, and the Future of Networks\nSynopsis: Does the History, Dynamics, and Structure of our Universe give any evidence that it is inherently “Good”? Does it appear to be statistically protective of adapted complexity and intelligence? Which aspects of the big history of our universe appear to be random? Which are predictable? What drives universal and societal accelerating change, and why have they both been so stable? What has developed progressively in our universe, as opposed to merely evolving randomly? Will humanity’s future be to venture to the stars (outer space) or will we increasingly escape our physical universe, into physical and virtual inner space (the transcension hypothesis)? In Earth’s big history, what can we say about what has survived and improved? Do we see any progressive improvement in humanity’s thoughts or actions? When is anthropogenic risk existential or developmental (growing pains)? In either case, how can we minimize such risk? What values do well-built networks have? What can we learn about the nature of our most adaptive complex networks, to improve our personal, team, organizational, societal, global, and universal futures? I’ll touch on each of these vital questions, which I’ve been researching and writing about since 1999, and discussing with a community of scholars at Evo-Devo Universe (join us!) since 2008.\n\nFor fun background reading, see John’s Goodness of the Universe post on Centauri Dreams, and “Evolutionary Development: A Universal Perspective”, 2019.\n\nJohn writes about Foresight Development (personal, team, organizational, societal, global, and universal), Accelerating Change, Evolutionary Development (Evo-Devo), Complex Adaptive Systems, Big History, Astrobiology, Outer and Inner Space, Human-Machine Merger, the Future of AI, Neuroscience, Mind Uploading, Cryonics and Brain Preservation, Postbiological Life, and the Values of Well-Built Networks. \nHe is CEO of Foresight University, founder of the Acceleration Studies Foundation, and co-founder of the Evo-Devo Universe research community, and the Brain Preservation Foundation.

    "description": "Synopsis: The goal of Aligned AI is to implement scalable solutions to the alignment problem, and distribute these solutions to actors developing powerful transformative artificial intelligence.\nWhat is Alignment?\n\nAlgorithms are shaping the present and will shape the future ever more strongly. It is crucially important that these powerful algorithms be aligned – that they act in the interests of their designers, their users, and humanity as a whole. Failure to align them could lead to catastrophic results.\n\nOur long experience in the field of AI safety has identified the key bottleneck for solving alignment: concept extrapolation.\nWhat is Concept Extrapolation?\n\nAlgorithms typically fail when they are confronted with new situations – they go out of distribution. Their training data will never be enough to deal with all unexpected situations – thus an AI will need to safely extend key concepts and goals, similarly – or better – to how humans do it.\n\nThis is concept extrapolation, explained in more details in this sequence. Solving the concept extrapolation problem is both necessary and almost sufficient for solving the whole AI alignment problem.\n\nThis talk is part of the ‘Stepping Into the Future‘ conference.\n\nBio: Dr Stuart Armstrong, Co-Founder and Chief Research Officer\n\nPreviously a Researcher at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, Stuart is a mathematician and philosopher and the originator of the value extrapolation approach to artificial intelligence alignment. He has extensive expertise in AI alignment research, having pioneered such ideas as interruptibility, low-impact AIs, counterfactual Oracle AIs, the difficulty/impossibility of AIs learning human preferences without assumptions, and how to nevertheless learn these preferences. Along with journal and conference publications, he posts his research extensively on the Alignment Forum. \n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "title": "The Future of Consciousness – Andrés Gómez Emilsson",
    "description": "Synopsis: In this talk we articulate a positive vision of the future that is both viable given what we know, and also utterly radical in its implications. We introduce two key insights that, when taken together, synergize in powerful ways. Namely, (a) the long-tails of pleasure and pain, and (b) the correlation between wellbeing, productivity, and intelligence. This informs us how to distribute resources if we want to maximize wellbeing. Given the weight of the extremes, it is important to take them into account. But because of the causal significance of more typical hedonic ranges, engineering our baseline is a key consideration. This makes it natural to break down the task of paradise engineering into three components:\n\n(1) avoid negative extremes,\n(2) increase hedonic baseline, and\n(3) achieve new heights of experience.\n\nWith regards to (1): the future of consciousness is anodyne. It lacks extreme suffering in any of its guises. We will see how, if we aim right, a significant proportion of extreme suffering can be prevented with pragmatic technologies already available. Even just applying what we know today would be as significant for the reduction of suffering as the advent of anesthesia was in the context of surgery.\n\nOn (2): the future of consciousness is engaging. From novelty generation to Buddhist annealing, baseline-enhancing interventions will change the way we think of life. It is not only about making everyday fun, but also the economics of it.\n\nAnd (3): the future of consciousness is ecstatic. A science of ecstasy will allow us to safely and reliably sample from a wide range of time-tested ultra-blissful peak experiences. A common cause with other sentient beings, and indeed with the interests of consciousness at large, can be forged in the knowledge of such deep experiences.\n\nThey give you a genuine, non-sentimental, reason to live. Together, action on these three levels can significantly advance the cause of eliminating suffering and engineering paradise. And our assessment is: there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in this space. Let’s pick it up!\n\nThis talk is part of the Stepping into the Future conference 2022. http://www.scifuture.org/events/stepping-into-the-future/\n\nBio: Director of Research at Qualia Research Institute\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "title": "David Pearce - The End of Suffering: Genome Reform and the Future of Sentience",
    "description": "Synopsis: No sentient being in the evolutionary history of life has enjoyed good health as defined by the World Health Organization. The founding constitution of the World Health Organization commits the international community to a daringly ambitious conception of health: “a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing”. Health as so conceived is inconsistent with evolution via natural selection. Lifelong good health is inconsistent with a Darwinian genome. Indeed, the vision of the World Health Organization evokes the World Transhumanist Association. Transhumanists aspire to a civilization of superhappiness, superlongevity and superintelligence; but even an architecture of mind based on information-sensitive gradients of bliss cannot yield complete well-being. Post-Darwinian life will be sublime, but “complete” well-being is posthuman – more akin to Buddhist nirvana. So the aim of this talk is twofold. First, I shall explore the therapeutic interventions needed to underwrite the WHO conception of good health for everyone – or rather, a recognisable approximation of lifelong good health. What genes, allelic combinations and metabolic pathways must be targeted to deliver a biohappiness revolution: life based entirely on gradients of well-being? How can we devise a more civilized signalling system for human and nonhuman animal life than gradients of mental and physical pain? Secondly, how can genome reformists shift the Overton window of political discourse in favour of hedonic uplift? How can prospective parents worldwide – and the World Health Organization – be encouraged to embrace genome reform? For only germline engineering can fix the problem of suffering and create a happy biosphere for all sentient beings.\n\nA talk by David Pearce for the Stepping into the Future conference 2022. https://www.scifuture.org/events/stepping-into-the-future/\n\n\nA big thanks to Adam James Davies for doing the chapters!\n\n0:00 Introduction/beginning\n0:07 The Biohappiness Revolution\n1:53 Paradise Engineering: when?

    "title": "Cyborg Virtues: Using BCIs for Moral Enhancement - James Hughes",
    "description": "James Hughes discusses the neuroanatomy of moral cognition, and the potential for brain stimulation and brain-computer interfaces to modulate moral emotions, cognition and behavior.\n\nThis talk is part of the ‘Stepping Into the Future‘ conference.\nhttp://www.scifuture.org/james-hughes-cyborg-virtues-using-bcis-for-moral-enhancement/\n\nSynopsis: Links between brain structures and cognition began with studies of victims of brain injuries, and became more precise with advances in brain imaging. In the last two decades research has demonstrated that moral emotions and cognition can be modulated with internal and external stimulation focused on particular brain structures. While non-invasive methods of neuromodulation, like transcranial direct current stimulation, are widely available for the healthy, their effects are more diffuse and uncertain. Deep brain stimulation electrodes or implanted computer chips allow more precise sensing and stimulation, but are only applicable for severe conditions such as intractable epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. As BCIs are miniaturized and given more capacities they will be more feasible for use by those without severe disabilities. Soon hundreds or thousands of microscopic computer chips, sensors and electrodes implanted in the brain will allow real-time sensing, inhibition and boosting of thoughts and emotions, opening up morally enhancing applications.  Individuals with brain disorders that lead to violence and criminality, for instance, could be offered BCI therapy as an alternative to psychiatric treatment or incarceration. This essay proposes a model of six virtues that could be targets of neuromodulation: self-control, caring, intelligence, positivity, fairness and transcendence. Key parts of the brain implicated in the functioning of each virtue are reviewed as possible targets for morally enhancing neuromodulation.\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

The Great Resignation has put upward pressure on wages and benefits in the service sector, encouraging the implementation of automation. Climate change mitigation is encouraging a shift towards “green jobs.” Rapid changes in the labor market have made the payoffs of higher education uncertain for young people, while many societies are entering an old-age dependency crisis with too few workers paying taxes for growing numbers of pensioners. Before the pandemic proposals for universal basic income (#UBI) were seen as necessary adaptations to imminent technological unemployment, and the during the pandemic many countries provided temporary UBI to keep people safe.

    "description": "..the Meaning Nexus Between Memeplexes.\nAre there facts about whether something is beautiful, or good art, or are such things purely a matter of opinion?\n\nPost describing talk here: http://www.scifuture.org/the-aesthetic-of-the-meta-aesthetic-the-meaning-nexus-between-memeplexes-andres-gomez-emilsson/\n\nSynopsis: In the spirit of fostering a collaborative relationship between the memeplexes that currently occupy the minds of the post-political intelligentsia, Andrés shares a conceptual framework he believes is useful for sense-making independently of one’s subcultural affiliation. Namely, he will share a theory of aesthetics.\n\nAesthetics go much deeper than merely the preference one may have for clusters and correlations of sensorial patterns. Aesthetics, in fact, cut to the very root of our concept of identity.\n\nInspired by Rob Burbea’s Soulmaking, Andrés will discuss how aesthetics can be broken down into:\n(1) Eros – the set of images that energize one’s thirst for life,\n(2) Psyche – the network of relationships between Eros imagery, and\n(3) Logos – the overarching ontology upon which Psyche and Eros are based.\n\nAndrés discusses how these components emerge from specific philosophical background assumptions, are then adopted as social aesthetics, and ultimately risk becoming merely tribal markers. In so far as people are caught up in the dissonance between aesthetics without understanding the Logos that breaths life into them, they will continue to fight in unproductive ways. Ultimately, a careful map of the valence that an aesthetic associates to each symbol will allow us to create a music theory of aesthetics and liberate people from the burden of pointless memetic wars. Meaning that, we can predict in advance what kind of discussions are likely to break down due to different valences on key load-bearing symbols, and re-route them through a different path that nonetheless achieves the desired information processing. An understanding of how aesthetics bias our valuations would itself be an aesthetic, of course: the aesthetic of the meta-aesthetic.\n\nThis talk argues that such a meta-aesthetic could become the nexus that allows us to “get the best of each world”. The end-goal: to make aesthetic pluralism game-theoretically stable. \n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview? Want to be notified about future events?

Some possible explanations:\n\n    1. Aliens arise so rarely that the nearest ones are too far to see, or to have travelled to here,\n    2. Aliens are common but simply can’t travel between stars or make big visible changes,\n    3. Aliens are common and travel everywhere, but enforce rules against visible changes, or\n    4. Aliens arise rarely, but in small clumps; the first in clump to appear can control the others.\n\nOf these, only the last two can put aliens here now, and #3 seems too much a conspiracy (i.e., coordinate to hide) theory for my tastes. But scenario #4 works, and could plausibly result from “panspermia.”\n\nThat is, simple life might have arisen on a planet Eden long ago, via a very rare event. (My research suggests this happens only once per million galaxies.) After life evolved at Eden for billions of years, a rock hit Eden, kicking up another rock that drifted for millions of years carrying life to seed our Sun’s stellar nursery. A nursery that held thousands of new stars packed close with many rocks flying around, allowing life to spread quickly to them all.\"\n\nMany thanks to those who participated in the Q&A session.\n\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "The General Theory of General Intelligence: A Pragmatic Patternist Perspective - paper by Ben Goertzel: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15100 Abstract: \"A multi-decade exploration into the theoretical foundations of artificial and natural general intelligence, which has been expressed in a series of books and papers and used to guide a series of practical and research-prototype software systems, is reviewed at a moderate level of detail. The review covers underlying philosophies (patternist philosophy of mind, foundational phenomenological and logical ontology), formalizations of the concept of intelligence, and a proposed high level architecture for AGI systems partly driven by these formalizations and philosophies. The implementation of specific cognitive processes such as logical reasoning, program learning, clustering and attention allocation in the context and language of this high level architecture is considered, as is the importance of a common (e.g. typed metagraph based) knowledge representation for enabling \"cognitive synergy\" between the various processes. The specifics of human-like cognitive architecture are presented as manifestations of these general principles, and key aspects of machine consciousness and machine ethics are also treated in this context. Lessons for practical implementation of advanced AGI in frameworks such as OpenCog Hyperon are briefly considered.\" \nTalk held at AGI17 - http://agi-conference.org/2017/#AGI17 #AGI #ArtificialIntelligence #Understanding #MachineUnderstanding #CommonSence #ArtificialGeneralIntelligence #PhilMindhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenceMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nHave any ideas about people to interview?

    "description": "Adam Ford argues for the position that Artificial Intelligence Will Be Smarter Than Humans in the lifetime of a young adult (sometime before the end of this century).  This was one side of a debate put on my Melbourne University for a philosophy course.  Adam discusses reasons why AI becoming smarter than human level intelligence is likely and important - approaches to thinking about the issue, what evidence there is for AI becoming superintelligent, what experts think about this issue, the history of the idea., the potential outcomes of superhuman AI, what's at stake.. and more.\n\nWhy discuss this issue?

He is an expert in drug development and venture investments in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. He is the CEO at Youthereum Genetics and the Vice President at Science for Life Extension Research Support Foundation.\nhttp://youthereum.ca/\n\nYuri has a track record of not only raising over $20 million for his previous ventures but also initiating and overseeing 4 clinical trials and several preclinical studies, including studies in transgenic mice.\n\nAt Youthereum Genetics, Yuri is currently leading a project dedicated to developing an epigenetic rejuvenation gene therapy, as intermittent epigenetic partial reprogramming demonstrated great experimental results in mice: it extended their lifespan by up to 50%.\n\nHis life goal is to do everything possible to minimize human suffering from various diseases, especially terminal age-related diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease and to help humanity eradicate them. As an activist, blogger, and speaker, he is conveying the magnitude of human suffering these diseases cause, as they take over 100,000 lives each day. As a biotech entrepreneur, Yuri is doing his modest part by putting together projects that could yield such therapies, splitting his time between Toronto and Moscow.\n\nHe believes that one day humanity will cure all such diseases, and he wants to do whatever he can to hasten that day.\n\nSince 2013, Yuri also serves as the Vice President of the nonprofit Foundation, Science for Life Extension, whose goal is the popularization of the fight against age-related diseases. To further this cause, Yuri frequently blogs, speaks, writes op-ed pieces, and participates in various TV and radio shows. At the Science for Life Extension Foundation, Yuri is helping the Foundation create and implement social change strategies to create public awareness that aging is a curable disease. He is also working on initiating intergovernmental dialog and public hearings about including aging in WHO’s ICD-11.\n\nPreviously, Yuri was the COO and Managing Director at Pharma Bio in Moscow for almost 7 years. From 2015 to 2017, Yuri was the Vice President of Business Development at Manus Pharmaceuticals in Toronto, Canada where he worked on raising funding and forming strategic partnerships to develop breakthrough peptide compounds aimed at preventing Alzheimer’s disease. Before that, he was the VP of Business Development at Peptos Pharma in Moscow.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ydeigin\n\n\n#Rejuvenation #AntiAging #UndoingAging\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future - #SciFuture - http://scifuture.org",

He also collaborated with professor Alexey Moskalev's lab on aging research. After quitting academia, Alexander switched to machine learning engineering however he continued collaborating on aging research with professor Moskalev.\n\nHe developed a highly accurate non-invasive biomarker of aging based on markers of the cardiovascular system. Now his research interest is mainly focused on the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the aging process. He and professor Moskalev recently suggested treating non-enzymatic modifications of long-living proteins (mostly, in the ECM) as a 10th hallmark of aging.\n\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future - #SciFuture - http://scifuture.org",

It’s important to note that the goal of these tools is not necessarily to create consistent and believable alternative facts, but to create plausible levels of doubt in actual facts. The crisis we face about ‘truth’ and reliable facts is predicated less on the ability to get people to believe the wrong thing as it is on the ability to get people to doubt the right thing. The success of Donald Trump will be a flaming signal that this strategy works, alongside the variety of technologies now in development (and early deployment) that can exacerbate this problem. In short, it’s a successful strategy, made simpler by more powerful information technologies.”\n\nWe speak a bit about AI language modelling, the fact that it doesn't understand stuff, and the possibility of creating AI that actually understands stuff.  Highlighted in the news recently language modelling (i.e. GPT3) is being used to help generate fake news.. Interestingly 'a college student used GPT-3 to write fake blog posts and ended up at the top of Hacker News': https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog\n\nFrameworks for helping understand wickedly complex information - VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) vs BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible): \n\nJamais’ BANI piece on Medium “Facing the Age of Chaos\": \nhttps://medium.com/@cascio/facing-the-age-of-chaos-b00687b1f51d\nQuote: “There has always been uncertainty and complexity in the world, and we have devised reasonably effective systems to figure out and adapt to this everyday disorder. From weighty institutions like “law” and “religion” to habituated norms and values, even to ephemeral business models and political strategies, much of what we think of as composing “civilization” is ultimately a set of cultural implements that allow us to domesticate change. If we can make disruptive processes understandable, we hope, maybe we can keep their worst implications in check.” \n\nAnd on BANI “It doesn’t have to be that way. The BANI framework offers a lens through which to see and structure what’s happening in the world. At least at a surface level, the components of the acronym might even hint at opportunities for response: brittleness could be met by resilience and slack; anxiety can be eased by empathy and mindfulness; nonlinearity would need context and flexibility; incomprehensibility asks for transparency and intuition. These may well be more reactions than solutions, but they suggest the possibility that responses can be found.”\n\nThe Institute for the Future:\n - Digital Intelligence Lab: https://www.iftf.org/partner-with-iftf/research-labs/digital-intelligence-lab/\n- The Human Consequences of Computational Propaganda: https://www.iftf.org/disinfoeffects/\n\n#FakeNews #AlternativeFacts #Misinformation\n\nJamais Cascio is a distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future: https://www.iftf.org\n\nMany thanks for tuning in!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future - #SciFuture - http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Dr Stevan Harnad (Cognitive Scientist and author of The Symbol Grounding Problem) discusses animal welfare, ethics and the 'other minds' problem - The only feelings we can feel are our own. When it comes to the feelings of others, we can only infer them, based on their behavior — unless they tell us.. In trying to make do with inferences from behavior, the behavioral sciences have been at pains to avoid “anthropomorphism,”.. our human mind-reading capacities – biologically evolved for care-giving to our own progeny as well as for social interactions with our kin and kind – are really quite acute.. But what about other species? And whose problem is the “Other-Minds Problem”? Philosophers think of it as our problem, in making inferences about the minds of our own conspecifics. But when it comes to other species, and in particular our interactions with them, surely it is their problem if we misinterpret or fail to detect what or whether they are feeling.   \n   \n00:06 On the urgency of reducing suffering.

    "description": "Started out as an interview ended up being a discussion between Hugo de Garis and (off camera) Adam Ford + Michel de Haan.\n00:11 The concept of understanding under-recognised as an important aspect of developing AI\n00:44 Re-framing perspectives on AI - the Chinese Room argument - and how can consciousness or understanding arise from billions of seemingly discreet neurons firing?  (Should there be a binding problem of understanding similar to the binding problem of consciousness?)\n04:23 Is there a difference between generality in intelligence and understanding? (and extentionally between AGI and artificial understanding?)\n05:08 Ah Ha! moments - where the penny drops - what's going on when this happens?\n07:48 Is there an ideal form of understanding?  Coherence & debugging -  ah ha moments\n10:18 Webs of knowledge - contextual understanding\n12:16 Early childhood development - concept formation and navigation\n13:11 The intuitive ability for concept navigation isn't complete \nIs the concept of understanding a catch all?\n14:29 Is it possible to develop AGI that doesn't understand?  Is generality and understanding the same thing?  \n17:32 Why is understanding (the nature of) understanding important?\nIs understanding reductive?  Can it be broken down?\n19:52 What would be the most basic primitive understanding be?\n22:11 If (strong) AI is important, and understanding is required to build (strong) AI, what sorts of things should we be doing to make sense of understanding?  \nApproaches - engineering, and copy the brain\n24:34 Is common sense the same thing as understanding?  How are they different? \n26:24 What concepts do we take for granted around the world - which when strong AI comes about will dissolve into illusions, and then tell us how they actually work under the hood?\n27:40 Compression and understanding\n29:51 Knowledge, Gettier problems and justified true belief.  Is knowledge different from understanding and if so how?\n31:07 A hierarchy of intel - data, information, knowledge, understanding, wisdom\n33:37 What is wisdom?  Experience can help situate knowledge in a web of understanding - is this wisdom?  Is the ostensible appearance of wisdom necessarily wisdom?  Think pulp remashings of existing wisdom in the form of trashy self-help literature.\n35:38 Is understanding mapping knowledge into a useful framework?  Or is it making accurate / novel predictions?\n36:00 Is understanding like high resolution carbon copy like models that accurately reflect true nature or a mechanical process?\n37:04 Does understanding come in gradients of topologies? Is there degrees or is it just on or off?\n38:37 What comes first - understanding or generality?\n40:47 Minsky's 'Society of Mind'\n42:46 Is vitalism alive in well in the AI field?  Do people actually think there are ghosts in the machines?\n48:15 Anthropomorphism in AI literature\n50:48 Deism - James Gates and error correction in super-symmetry\n52:16 Why are the laws of nature so mathematical?  Why is there so much symmetry in physics?  Is this confusing the map with the territory?\n52:35 The Drake equation, and the concept of the Artilect - does this make Deism plausible?  What about the Fermi Paradox?\n55:06 Hyperintelligence is tiny - the transcention hypothesis - therefore civs go tiny - an explanation for the fermi paradox\n56:36 Why would *all* civs go tiny?  Why not go tall, wide and tiny?  What about selection pressures that seem to necessitate cosmic land grabs?\n01:01:52 The Great Filter and the The Fermi Paradox \n01:02:14 Is it possible for an AGI to have a deep command of knowledge across a wide variety of topics/categories without understanding being an internal dynamic?  Is the turing test good enough to test for understanding?  What kinds of behavioral tests could reliably test for understanding? (Of course without the luxury of peering under the hood)\n01:03:09 Does AlphaGo understand Go, or DeepBlue understand chess?  Revisiting the Chinese Room argument.\n01:04:23 More on behavioral tests for AI understanding.\n01:06:00 Zombie machines - David Chalmers Zombie argument\n01:07:26 Complex enough algorithms - is there a critical point of complexity beyond which general intelligence likely emerges?

    "description": "Interview with Pramod K. Nayar on posthumanism 'as both a material condition and a developing philosophical-ethical project in the age of cloning, gene engineering, organ transplants and implants'.  The book 'Posthumanism' by Pramod Nayar: https://amzn.to/2OQEA8z  Rise of the posthumanities article: https://bit.ly/32Q67Pm\n\n0:00 Intro / What got Pramod interested in posthuman studies?\n04:16 Defining the terms - what is posthumanism?  Cultural framing of natural vs unnatural.  Posthumanism is not just bodily or mental enhancement, but involves changing the relationship between humans, non-human lifeforms, technology and non-living matter.  Displacement of anthropocentrism.\n08:01 Anthropocentric biases inherited from enlightenment humanist thinking and human exceptionalism.  The formation of the transhumanist declaration with part of it focusing on the human perspective, with point 7 of the declaration focusing on the well-being of all sentience.  The important question of empathy - not limiting it to the human species.  The issue of empathy being a good lunching pad for further conversations between the transhumists and the posthumanists.\nhttps://humanityplus.org/philosophy/transhumanist-declaration/\n11:10 Difficulties in getting everyone to agree on cultural values.  Is a utopian ideal posthumanist/transhumanist society possible?\n13:25 Collective societies, hive minds, borganisms.  Distributed cognition, the extended mind hypothesis, cognitive assemblages, traditions of knowledge sharing. \n16:58 Does the humanities need some form of reconfiguration to shift it towards something beyond the human? Rejecting some of the value systems that enlightenment humanism claimed to be universal. Julian Savulescu's work on moral enhancement.\n20:58 Colonialism - what is it?\n21:57 Aspects of enlightenment humanism that the critical posthumanists don't agree with.  But some believe the poshumanists to be enlightenment  haters that reject rationality - is this accurate?\n24:33 Trying to achieve agreement on shared human values - is vulnerability rather than dignity a usable concept that different groups can agree with?\n26:37 The idea of the monster - peoples fear of what they don't understand.  Thinking past disgust responses to new wearable technologies and more radical bodily enhancements.\n29:45 The future of posthuman morphology and posthuman rights - how might emerging means of upgrading our bodies / minds interfere with rights or help us re-evaluate rights?\n33:42 Personhood beyond the human.\n35:11 Should we uplift non-human animals? Animals as moral patients becoming moral actors through uplifting?  Also once Superintelligent AI is developed, should it uplift us?  The question of agency and aspiration - what are appropriate aspirations for different life forms?  Species enhancement and Ian Hacking's idea of 'Making up people' - classification and how people come to inhabit the identities that exist at various points in history, or in different environments.\nhttps://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people\n38:10 Measuring happiness - David Pearce's idea of eliminating suffering and increasing happiness through advanced technology.  What does it mean to have welfare or to flourish?  Should we institutionalise wellbeing, a gross domestic happiness, world happiness index?\n40:27 Anders Sandberg asks: Transhumanism and posthumanism often do not get along - transhumanism commonly wears its enlightenment roots on its sleeve, and posthumanism often spends more time criticising the current situation than suggesting an out of it. Yet there is no fundamental reason both perspectives could not simultaneously get what they want: a post-human posthumanist concept of humanity and its post-natural environment seem entirely possible. What is Nayar's perspective on this win-win vision?\n44:14 The postmodern play of endless difference and relativism - what is the good and bad of postmodernism on posthumanist thinking?\n47:16 What does postmodernism have to offer both posthumanism and transhumanism?\n49:17 Thomas Kuhn's idea of paradigm changes in science happening funeral by funeral.\n58:58 - How has the idea of the singularity influenced transhumanist and posthumanist thinking? Shift's in perspectives to help us ask the right questions in science, engineering and ethics in order to achieve a better future society.\n1:01:55 - What AI is good and bad at today.  Correlational thinking vs causative thinking.  Filling the gaps as to what's required to achieve 'machine understanding'.\n1:03:26 - Influential literature on the idea of the posthuman - especially that which can help us think about difference and 'the other' (or the non-human) (Octavia Butler, James Hughes, Anders Sandberg, Gary Harper, Julian Savulescu, Mark Tenanbaum)\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture",

    "description": "In the age of the chimera, uncertainty and ambivalence generate unexpected anxieties. The dead, the near-dead, the brain dead, the yet to be born, the partially living and synthetic life all now share a material and proximal existence, with other living bodies, microbial life, operational machines and executable and viral code. Digital objects proliferate, contaminating the human biome. Bodies become end effectors for other bodies in other places and for machines elsewhere, generating interactive loops and recursive choreographies.

    "title": "Avatar Polymorph - The Ethics of Boosting Animals from Sentience to Self-Aware Consciousness",
    "description": "Should the move to 'self-directed' evolution include animals?  This video was posthumously published - RIP Avatar Polymorph.  Synopsis: The question of boosting the intelligence of animals other than humans, to the level of self-awareness and consciousness, is one that cannot be considered in isolation from the general process at work in the social and speculative movement known as Transhumanism. Transhumanism is partly about augmentation of the human body, for example by molecular computational nanotechnology (cell repair and DNA repair molecular machines, and rod logic molecular supercomputers for enhanced memory). More generally it is the movement to ‘self-directed’ evolution (replacing evolution by random mutation and natural selection). This was pointed out by Avatar in 1996 and by Damien Broderick in his book The Spike, which was the first popular book on the idea of the ‘technological Singularity’ (a time when technology surges forward based on accelerating computing).\n\nThis is a radical movement away from evolution as we understand it, and unchosen death. It is a movement towards chosen lifespans (and very extended ones, certainly some claim possibilities of hundreds of millions of years) and augmentation.\n\nIn this scenario, it is the internal environment that can alter the physical characteristics of a population. Make a mistake by modifying something essential to your will to live and you may well end up permanently dead.\n\nFor a conservative Transhumanist, the minimal rational position would be to consider us already effectively immortal. This is because genetic and proteomic therapies, along with cures for many diseases, will begin to be available within a very few years, perhaps the middle of the decade of the 2020s.\n\nThis will tide most people over until the arrival of computational superintelligence and computational nanotechnology (that is, not materials nanotechnology, but ‘intelligent’ nanotechnology, devices at the molecular scale that cannot reproduce but that can be ‘commanded’ to achieve goals). Stem cell therapies will provide a surface appearance of youth in terms of hair and wrinkles and teeth (this is already happening, in the case of teeth see the work of Dr Mao of Columbia University). The fuller issues of a long life are more complex (memory, consciousness, cosmic ray damage, skeletal structure and so on). However, telomerase therapy (for DNA repair), cell-sized ‘nanobots’ and smaller nanotechnological cell repair machines and molecular supercomputers (perhaps sixty in each cell) should be able to monitor and augment of both individual neurons and a person’s wider neural structure.\n\nAs a comparison to these ideas of living for many millions of years, the oldest living multicellular thing on Planet Earth currently is the clonal root system of the quaking aspen Populus tremuloides in Utah, dated to 80,000 years, probably older than modern humanity itself. In theory some of the ‘immortal’ jellyfish, Turritopsis nutricula, could live forever but in practice most are probably killed in the environment. Many animal species live longer than humans, for example the rougheye rockfish lives for 205 years.\n\nIt is important to understand that superintelligence will be required to solve deeper problems of memory and neural identity over the immense time scales projected, especially for those conservatives who choose to remain relatively human for much or all of the time.\n\nSome radicals may gradually move their neural structure into AI systems, or even into virtual realities within computer substrates (for example topological quantum computers or femtocomputers, both of which are devices which have not been built yet).\n\nIt is hard to argue against the physical possibility that such real human-AI or virtual beings could live until the end of the universe. For example, Abraham Loeb of the Centre for Astrophysics at Harvard University believes intelligences could orbit around red dwarfs for ten thousand billion years.\n\nThis then is a general structure for the consideration of ‘boosting’ of non-human animals.\n\n#transhumanism #animalethics #evolution\n\nhttps://hplusmagazine.com/2012/02/01/the-ethics-of-boosting-animals-from-sentience-to-self-aware-consciousness/ \n\nThis video was posthumously published - RIP Avatar Polymorph.

    "description": "Is technology inherently centralizing, invariably increasing the ability of a minority to dominate the majority?  By the mid-20th century this had become its dominant characteristic. Since then, and particularly with the rise of the Internet, things have become more complicated. This presentation will consider the historically tendency of technology to centralization, and discusses countervailing tendencies today.\n\nDr Greg Adamson is an Associate Professor and Enterprise Fellow in Cyber Security at the University of Melbourne School of Engineering. He has worked in cyber security for 25 years, in Australia and the UK​, for government, industry and academia.\n\nCompanies he has worked with include the BBC, Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, Fujitsu, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Telstra. The most recent industry engagement was 8 years with ANZ's Transaction Banking, a $1.7bn business unit, where he introduced consideration of cyber risk into business planning. Greg has worked with blockchain since 2014, and has a strong interest in its governance. He established the Blockchain Special Interest Group at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the 430,000 member global technical professional organisation operating in 161 countries. He is on Standards Australia blockchain standards technical committee. He also specialises in professional ethics, and recently moved successful amendments to the IEEE's Code of Ethics, requiring members to consider issues of ethical design practice, and be cognisant of the role of intelligent systems.

    "description": "McMullen is one of Australia's leading science-fiction and fantasy authors and has written over seventy stories and seventeen books. In 2011, his novelette \"Eight Miles\" was the runner-up in the Hugo Awards, and has won the Analog Reader's Award twice, for \"Ninety Thousand Horses\" in 2013 and \"Tower of Wings\" in 2002.\n\nHis first novel was originally published in Australia as two separate books, Voices in the Light (1994) and Mirrorsun Rising (1995). His first internationally published novel was \"The Centurion's Empire\" (1998), which featured a time machine built during the Roman Empire. After the success of \"The Centurion's Empire\", his first two novels were rewritten and combined for a publication in the US as Souls in the Great Machine (1999), which, in turn, became the first volume of the Greatwinter trilogy, a unique mix of the generally anti-genres Steampunk and Cyberpunk. This was followed by the \"Moonworlds\" series, which saw McMullen blend science and romance in a fantasy setting. His most recent series is the \"Century War\" series for young adult readers, set in Melbourne in 1901.\n\nSean's non-fiction work includes the non-fiction Strange Constellations: A History of Australian Science Fiction, a history of Australian science fiction jointly written with Van Ikin and Russell Blackford. He also co-wrote the first histories of Australian fantasy and horror with Steven Paulsen.\n\nMcMullen has a degree in physics and history from Melbourne University (1974), a postgraduate degree in library and information science, and a PhD in Medieval Literature. He was a professional musician in the 1970s, concentrating on singing and guitar playing. Sean has recently retired from a career in scientific computing to concentrate on his literary work. He is s a fourth dan black belt in karate, teaching at the Melbourne University Karate club. He is the father of C. S. McMullen, an Australian speculative fiction author. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McMullen\nhttps://seanmcmullen.net.au/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "title": "Hugo de Garis - From Nanotech to Femtotech - There's Plenty More Room at the Bottom",
    "description": "Hugo de Garis discusses the possibility of Femtotech and the technological possibilities it may unlock.  Not long ago nanotechnology was a fringe topic; now it’s a flourishing engineering field, and fairly mainstream.  For example, while writing this article, I happened to receive an email advertisement for the “Second World Conference on Nanomedicine and Drug Delivery,” in Kerala, India. It wasn’t so long ago that nanomedicine seemed merely a flicker in the eyes of Robert Freitas and a few other visionaries!\n\nBut nano is not as small as the world goes.  A nanometer is 10−9 meters – the scale of atoms and molecules.  A water molecule is a bit less than one nanometer long, and a germ is around a thousand nanometers across.  On the other hand, a proton has a diameter of a couple femtometers – where a femtometer, at 10−15 meters, makes a nanometer seem positively gargantuan.  Now that the viability of nanotech is widely accepted (in spite of some ongoing heated debates about the details), it’s time to ask: what about femtotech?  Picotech or other technologies at the scales between nano and femto seem relatively uninteresting, because we don’t know any basic constituents of matter that exist at those scales.  But femtotech, based on engineering structures from subatomic particles, makes perfect conceptual sense, though it’s certainly difficult given current technology.\n\nThe nanotech field was arguably launched by Richard Feynman’s 1959 talk “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.”  As Feynman wrote there,\n\n    \"It is a staggeringly small world that is below. In the year 2000, when they look back at this age, they will wonder why it was not until the year 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction.\n\n    Why cannot we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica on the head of a pin? \"\n\nBio: Hugo de Garis (born 1947, Sydney, Australia) is a researcher in the sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) known as evolvable hardware. He became known in the 1990s for his research on the use of genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks using three dimensional cellular automata inside field programmable gate arrays. He claimed that this approach would enable the creation of what he terms “artificial brains” which would quickly surpass human levels of intelligence.\n\n#Nanotechnology #Femtotechnology #Femtotech \n\n\nThis was filmed at the Humanity+ @Melbourne 2011 Conference - website (archived): https://web.archive.org/web/20131106021014/http://au.humanityplus.org/conference/\n\n\nhttps://hplusmagazine.com/2011/01/10/theres-plenty-more-room-bottom-beyond-nanotech-femtotech/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Biodiversity is vital to our food security, our industries, our health and our progress. Yet never before has the future of biodiversity been so under threat as we modify more land, burn more fossil fuels and transport exotic organisms around the planet. But in the face of catastrophic biodiversity collapse, scientists, community groups and not-for-profits are working to discover new ways to conserve biodiversity, for us and the rest of life on our planet. From techniques as simple as preserving habitat to complex scientific techniques like de-extinction, Lynette will discuss our options for the future to protect biodiversity, how the future of biodiversity could look and why we should start employing conservation techniques now. Our future relies on the conservation of  biodiversity and its future rests in our hands. We have the technology to protect it.\n\nBio: Dr. Lynette Plenderleith is a wildlife biologist by training and is now a media science specialist, working mostly in television, with credits including children’s show WAC!\nWorld Animal Championships and Gardening Australia.

    "description": "What is the future of human happiness and wellbeing?  We are currently treating mental illness at the level of individuals, yet rates of mental illness are not going down, and in some cases continue to rise. I will present research indicating that we need to start to tackle this problem at the level of culture. The cultural values places on particular emotional states may play a role in how people respond to their own emotional worlds. Furthermore, I will present evidence that basic cultural differences in how we explain events, predict the future and understand ourselves may also impact on the effectiveness of our capacity to deal with emotional events. This suggests that we need to begin to take culture seriously in how we treat mental illness. It also provides some important insights into what kind of thinking styles we might seek to promote and how we might seek to understand and shape our future selves. This also has implications for how we might find happiness in a world increasingly characterized by residential mobility, weak ties, and digital rather than face-to-face interaction.\n\nBio: Assoc Prof Brock Bastian is a social psychologist whose research focuses on pain, happiness, and morality.\n\nIn his search for a new perspective on what makes for the good life, Brock Bastian has studied why promoting happiness may have paradoxical effects; why we need negative and painful experiences in life to build meaning, purpose, resilience, and ultimately greater fulfilment in life; and why behavioural ethics is necessary for understanding how we reason about personal and social issues and resolve conflicts of interest. His first book, The Other Side of Happiness, was published in January 2018.\n\n \nBook: The Other Side of Happiness: Embracing a More Fearless Approach to Living\n\nOur addiction to positivity and the pursuit of pleasure is actually making us miserable. Brock Bastian shows that, without some pain, we have no real way to achieve and appreciate the kind of happiness that is true and transcendent.\n\nhttp://www.brockbastian.com/book\n\n\n\nEvent listing here: http://www.scifuture.org/future-day-melbourne-2019\n\n\n\n#FutureDay #Happiness #Psychology\n\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "\"In short, data is not knowledge; knowledge is not comprehension; comprehension is not wisdom\"\n\nThe standard account of understanding has been, since Aristotle, knowledge of the causes of an event or effect. However, this account fails in cases where the subject understood is not causal. In this paper I offer an account of understanding as pattern recognition in large sets of data without the presumption that the patterns indicate causal chains.\n\nAll nervous systems by nature desire to process information. Consequently, entities with nervous systems tend to find information everywhere, and on the principle that if some is good a lot is better, we have come up with “Big Data”, which is often suggested as the solution to the problems of one science or another, although it is unclear exactly what counts as big data and how it is supposed to do this. In this paper I will argue (i) that understanding does not and cannot come from larger and higher dimensionality data sets, but from structure in the data that can be literally comprehended; and (ii) that big data multiplies uncertainties unless it can be summarized. In short, data is not knowledge; knowledge is not comprehension; comprehension is not wisdom.\n\nSlides can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/jswilkins/comprehension-as-compression\n\nMeetup listing: https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Science-Technology-and-the-Future/events/265580084/\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

He is known for painting faith as the “reasonable” road, and falsely claiming that he can prove the validity of his religion.\n\nFrom his work attempting to show evidence for Jesus’ resurrection to his development of the Kalam cosmological argument for the existence of God, Craig is respected among his peers on the Christian side of the religious spectrum. But is that deserved? What’s at the core of these arguments? Are they philosophically sound? More importantly, is this Unreasonable Faith?\n\n\"an excellent destruction of W.L. Craig’s entire apologetics. Cogently argued and factually accurate, this is required reading for anyone keen to question the soundness of anything W.L. Craig has argued over the decades. Which makes it an invaluable resource for refuting Christian apologetics generally.\"\nRichard Carrier, author on the historicity of Jesus.\n\n\"This book should be required reading for anyone who is proposing to debate William Lane Craig on the existence of God. It should also be something that those who debate Craig on that topic advertise: 'this book gives an accurate idea of the amount of material that needs to be provided to begin to address the usual panoply of arguments that Craig puts forward in a debate'\"\nProfessor Graham Oppy, Monash.\n\nAs of 2020, James Fodor, is a student at the Australian National University, in Canberra, Australia.  James' studies at university have been rather diverse, and have at different times included history, politics, economics, philosophy, mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, and biology. Eventually he hopes to complete a PhD in the field of computational neuroscience.\n\nJames also have a deep interest in philosophy, history, and religion, which he periodically writes about on his blog, which is called The Godless Theist. In addition, James also has interests in and varying levels of involved in skeptical/atheist activism, effective altruism, and transhumanism/emerging technologies. James is a fan of most things sci-fi, including Star Trek, Dr Who, and authors such as Arthur C.

How long will it take?\nWelcome to STF - we are here with Stuart Armstrong and we’ll will discuss how very easy it might be to get a Dyson Swarm going - and once we have one, the surprisingly short time and small amount of resources it would take to get our intergalactic colonization efforts underway - and wow, forget disassembling mercury - we might need only a few medium to large size asteroids worth of material!  \nStuart is a researcher at the FHI, Oxford - he is the Author of ‘Smarter than Us’ who co-authored a fascinating paper with Anders Sandberg titled \"Eternity in six hours:  intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox\", which in a nut-shell suggests that intergalactic colonization of an appreciable portion of the visible universe seems possible given resources in our solar system alone, that it shouldn’t be that much more difficult to achieve than mere interstellar colonization (just our galaxy).  The seeming ease of colonization makes the Fermi Paradox sharper if we consider that earlier civilizations would likely have done this, and in this light, some standard resolutions to the fermi paradox probably need revision.\nNote, I did an interview with Anders Sandberg and George Dvorsky Robin Hanson recently on Galactic Megastructures.  And with Stuart Armstrong did some interviews on AI Safety in 2012 around the time of the Winter Intelligence conference in Oxford, and there have been few other interviews with Stuart since then so do check those out as well… but now, strap yourselves in to your futurology appreciation chairs and join us for a wild ride into the possibly near term future of exploratory engineering, superintelligence, cosmic megastrucutres, self-replicating von neumann\n\n\n'Eternity in 6 hours' paper co-authored by Stuart Armstrong and Anders Sandberg:  http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/intergalactic-spreading.pdf\n\n#FermiParadox #Civilization #Space #GameTheory\n\n\nStuart Armstrong’s research at the Future of Humanity Institute centers on the safety and possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), how to define the potential goals of AI and map humanity’s partially defined values into it, and the long term potential for intelligent life across the reachable universe. He has been working with people at FHI and other organizations, such as DeepMind, to formalize AI desiderata in general models so that AI designers can include these safety methods in their designs. His collaboration with DeepMind on “Interruptibility” has been mentioned in over 100 media articles.\n\n\nSee other interviews with Stuart Armstrong:\nThe Grand Challenge of Beneficial AI: https://youtu.be/INuLGGEhDwY\n\nPredicting the Timeline of Artificial Intelligence: https://youtu.be/HLW4a2KIeWc\n\nAI Safety: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI: https://youtu.be/OmtXZ9tZGso\nSmarter Than Us - the Rise of Machine Intelligence: https://youtu.be/RotShnjrmwI\n\nThe Flawed Turing test: Language, Understanding, and Partial p-Zombies: https://youtu.be/dt9ZUQOvwkc\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "How might selection effects on the frontiers of galactic expansion constrain #Kardashev Type 3++ civilizations behavior?\nAbstract: ”Attempts to model interstellar colonization may seem hopelessly compromised by uncertainties regarding the technologies and preferences of advanced civilizations. If light speed limits travel speeds, however, then a selection effect may eventually determine frontier behavior. Making weak assumptions about colonization technology, we use this selection effect to predict colonists’ behavior, including which oases they colonize, how long they stay there, how many seeds they then launch, how fast and far those seeds fly, and how behavior changes with increasing congestion. This colonization model explains several astrophysical puzzles, predicting lone oases like ours, amid large quiet regions with vast unused resources.”\nhttp://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/filluniv.pdf \n\n\nHow might an advanced technological civilization behave - how might they colonize cosmic frontiers?  \n\n\nRobin Dale Hanson is an associate professor of economics at George Mason University and a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson \n\n#FermiParadox #Economics\n\nAudio version: https://archive.org/details/robinhansonburningthecosmiccommons\n\n\n\n Many thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "title": "Ben Goertzel - Are We Building a Psychopathic Idiot Savant Global Brain?",
    "description": "Ben Goertzel's Future Day 2020 talk on Machine Understanding - and the Global Brain - a variety of topics are addressed - what is a global brain? what is understanding in individuals, and in groups? Can machines achieve understanding? What's the difference between AGI and machine understanding? What is causing the 'global brain' to act like a psychopathic idiot savant?\n\nApologies there was lag between Melbourne and Hong Kong which makes it appear like we are talking on top of each other. \n\n\n\n33:50   [Longterm beneficial applications for AI] just aren't getting the bulk of the resources right now. Now almost everyone who gets a PhD in AI gets sucked into a few different companies selling, spying and gambling. Even if they start a tech startup, the goal is to get bought within four or five years which sucks the whole team up into one of these same big companies which were the acquirer. This process then becomes the significant point of concern.\n\n    Suppose that the internet and all the AIs self-organizing congeal into a general intelligence whose only purpose in life is to spy on everyone, blow them up if they're part of the wrong religion, cheat them out of their money by weird financial derivatives games, and sell them junk they don't need through fake ads. If this is on the mind of the first general intelligence to emerge from the collective global brain, what happens when this general intelligence becomes super-intelligent? What kind of smuckhead super AI are we building?\n\n    We're building a psychopath which has no compassion who wants to achieve national hegemony and profit maximation. We're building a system which is an idiot savant in the sense that it's really good at figuring out which ads someone should stare at, whether someone is about to offend the government, but it doesn't have much attention for anything else. We probably don't want that.\n\n    We don't know how much difference the initial condition makes. It could be that however we get the AGI started out, its going to evolve toward some mind attracter regardless of the initial condition. On the other hand, the initial condition could matter. Therefore, if we make a compassionate, creative, open-minded AGI first, it will be nice to humans and other sentient beings, and do things that we like. If we make a psychopathic idiot-savant AGI first, it may evolve into a super AI that we don't care for too much.\n\n    My working hypothesis is that the initial condition does matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n Many thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "title": "Susan Gerbic - Guerrilla Skepticism",
    "description": "\"The mission of the Guerrilla Skepticism editing team is to improve skeptical content of Wikipedia. We do this by improving pages of our skeptic spokespeople, providing noteworthy citations, and removing the unsourced claims from paranormal and pseudoscientific pages. Why? Because evidence is cool. We train – We mentor – Join us.\"\n—GSoW slogan\n\nGerbic is the founder and leader of \"Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia\" (GSoW), an organization dedicated to improving the content on Wikipedia by improving and creating articles that reflect the ideals of scientific naturalism and scientific skepticism. As of August 2018, the Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia project had written or fully rewritten over 600 Wikipedia pages in multiple languages, which had collectively received over 30 million views.\n\nGerbic and Mark Edward came up with the name \"Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia\" (GSoW) to describe skeptical activism that is \"more underground, more grass-roots, more mole-like\". The idea for an organized effort came from Tim Farley after Gerbic was frustrated by typical WikiProjects, finding them either dormant or not user-friendly, especially for new editors. Instead, she started communicating and training other Wikipedia editors directly on Facebook or using email. She stated that the formal beginning of GSoW is May 2010, yet its birthday is celebrated in June.\n\nInterest in the project grew after Gerbic made presentations at SkeptiCalcon, did a Sunday paper presentation at The Amaz!ng Meeting, and also created a blog on the subject. In an interview with Richard Saunders, she states that this kind of project is \"a perfect storm, we would never have been able to do this without [the Internet]\".\n\nGerbic spends much of her time training the new members of the expanding team to perform basic tasks required to effectively edit the encyclopedia, tackling topics as diverse as Scientology, UFOs, and vaccines. Since its inception, the GSoW team has grown, with Wired reporting in July 2018 that the project had more than 120 international editors.\n\nMembers of GSoW are encouraged to identify noteworthy skeptical or science articles in the general media that could serve as significant references, and then cite these in any applicable Wikipedia pages. Gerbic calls such edits \"backwards editing\", which is the reverse of the more typical process where an editor will work on a single Wikipedia article, enhancing it with references from many sources. GSoW editors seek out skepticism-related articles that are in need of improvement by the addition of references from popular writing, podcast, and other citations. They will share research and otherwise collaborate amongst the team. Sometimes they will directly interview notable persons to improve the citations and resources. Gerbic used the example of psychic Sylvia Browne's Wikipedia page during the Amaz!ng Meeting lecture, suggesting that people looking for information might prefer Wikipedia as a neutral, virus free, user-friendly site. She calls this the Goldilocks effect.\n\nGSoW have written or improved a number of Wikipedia pages about skeptics, science educators, and science-based medicine proponents who push back against pseudoscience and the paranormal in the media, such as Ken Feder, Sara Mayhew, Indre Viskontes, Kiki Sanford, Bryan & Baxter, Jennifer Ouellette, Tim Farley, Alan Melikdjanian, William B. Davis, Mary Roach, and Sikivu Hutchinson. They also try to make sure all claims on paranormal themed pages are balanced and have citations to notable secondary sources. (For example, lots of obscure psychics have Wikipedia pages full of nutty claims that often turn out to be written by the psychics themselves.) GSoW also assists with translations of high-importance skeptical articles from English into other languages, such as Arabic, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Portuguese.\nSusan Marie Gerbic is an American skeptical activist living in Salinas, California. Gerbic is the co-founder of Monterey County Skeptics, founder and leader of the Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia (GSoW) project, a regular contributor to Skeptical Inquirer, The Skeptic Zone podcast, and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Gerbic has focused much of her skeptical activism on people claiming to be clairvoyant mediums, such as Sylvia Browne, Tyler Henry, and Thomas John, whom she calls \"grief vampires\"\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "In this address, Leslie Allan shares his early experiences and how they shape his humanist outlook today. He then outlines what he considers to be the three core principles underlying the humanist world view: reason and evidence, compassion and equality, and autonomy and dignity. Allan illustrates the application of these principles with historical and contemporary examples. He then draws upon each of these principles to draw out what it means to live a good life; a life of meaning and purpose.\n\nLeslie Allan curates a blog at : http://www.rationalrealm.com\nFollowing a lifelong interest in science and philosophy, Leslie created the Rational Realm web site with the primary aim of kindling the same spirit of inquiry in others. Rational Realm's point of difference with the plethora of web sites devoted to human knowledge and behaviour is its focus on the application of reason to intellectual and ethical problems. Rational Realm digs deeper by exploring the nature of reason and how we apply it in our belief systems and moral discourse.\n\nWith people's personal beliefs and our socially shared paradigms demonstrating such bewildering diversity, Rational Realm seeks to deconstruct many of the irrationalities of our time. Revealed religions, paranoid conspiracy theories and alternative medicine each possess a kernel of truth in their respective world views. Each lends credence to the veracity of personal experience and a mistrust of entrenched authority. The intriguing puzzle that Rational Realm thinkers investigate is the points at which each of these belief systems go off the rails.\n\nIn this vein, Rational Realm authors explore the nature of reality, the norms of rational belief and how we apply them to our favoured ideas. For some, their investigations take them to the limits of reason revealed at the cutting edge of scientific research. Physics, cosmology and cognitive psychology show the world and ourselves to be much more complex and mysterious than the simplistic dogmas of religion and superstition will have us believe. These thinkers explore the counterintuitive world of quantum mechanics and relativity and discuss how the human mind constructs reality. Black holes, the multiverse, quantum entanglement, out of body experiences, mass hysteria and the illusion of free will are just some of the mind-bending mysteries that engage Rational Realm thinkers. We invite you to share your experiences, contribute to the discussions and join us in learning about our mysterious and wonderful universe.\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Automating technologies threaten to usher in a workless future. But this can be a good thing―if we play our cards right.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Automation-Utopia-Human-Flourishing-without/dp/0674984242\n\nHuman obsolescence is imminent. The factories of the future will be dark, staffed by armies of tireless robots. The hospitals of the future will have fewer doctors, depending instead on cloud-based AI to diagnose patients and recommend treatments. The homes of the future will anticipate our wants and needs and provide all the entertainment, food, and distraction we could ever desire.\n\nTo many, this is a depressing prognosis, an image of civilization replaced by its machines. But what if an automated future is something to be welcomed rather than feared? Work is a source of misery and oppression for most people, so shouldn’t we do what we can to hasten its demise? Automation and Utopia makes the case for a world in which, free from need or want, we can spend our time inventing and playing games and exploring virtual realities that are more deeply engaging and absorbing than any we have experienced before, allowing us to achieve idealized forms of human flourishing.\n\nThe idea that we should “give up” and retreat to the virtual may seem shocking, even distasteful. But John Danaher urges us to embrace the possibilities of this new existence. The rise of automating technologies presents a utopian moment for humankind, providing both the motive and the means to build a better future.\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

In short, maybe what is really being measured is not simply our (lack of) commitment to hedonism or realism, but rather status quo bias.\n\nEven self-avowed classical utilitarians may balk on realising what their own ethics entails.\n\nBack in the real world, does the imminence of utopian designer drugs and technologies of immersive VR mean we must all shortly choose between the Red Pill and the Blue Pill, so to speak, i.e. between sordid reality and escapist fantasy worlds of delusion?\n\nNot necessarily.

While researching epilepsy, neuroscientist Itzhak Fried stumbled on a 'mirth' center in the brain - given this, what ought we be doing to combat extreme suffering and promote wellbeing?\n\n0:00 Mastery of reward circuitry\n0:25 Itzhak Fried's experiments on stimulating 'the Humor Centre' of the brain\n2:25 What should Effective Altruists be doing about the biological roots of suffering?\n3:00 The consequences of taking the Ipsos poll on reported happiness at face value\n4:24 Tackling biological and genetic causes of suffering & malaise \n5:37 Cost effectiveness for long-term impacts of pre-implantation genetic screening\n6:40 Effect of low mood on quality of life & economy\n7:36 Genes & alleles associated with low or high hedonic set points:  ADA2b deletion variant, COMT gene, serotonin transporter gene, FAAH & FAAH OUT gene, SCN9A gene\n8:19 CRISPR and the future of modifying the genetic source code\n8:45 Slow progress in psychopharmacology and issues of opioid dose escalation\n9:41 Genetic predispositions to super-happy & super-healthy\n\nBlog Post here: https://www.scifuture.org/the-anatomy-of-happiness-david-pearce/\n\nIf one finds oneself viscerally hostile to the idea of universal happiness, and if by contemporary standards one falls within the statistically normal range in one's emotional repertoire, then just how seriously should one contemplate the following possibility? Today we are the victims of what our successors will reckon an atavistic mood disorder. This disorder infects all our thoughts as well as all our feelings and volitions. It is a historical condition no less epistemically defective than are dream-psychoses from the perspective of the waking state.\n\n        Is the worry one might be locked in such an affective psychosis just the product of idle scepticism? Given the cognitive inaccessibility of most of the generically ecstatic states alluded to here, perhaps one wouldn't know if one were so afflicted. After all, damaged and disfigured minds may have limited self-insight. Nor would one necessarily have the conceptual resources even to grasp what was at stake if one suffered from such a neural deficit. Pure, \"unearned\", genetically-driven bliss of even the mildest flavour detracted from the inclusive fitness of one's genes in the ancestral environment. Constitutionally happy freaks-of-nature got eaten or outbred. Hence unipolar euphoric mania today is vanishingly rare; unipolar melancholic depression and chronic dysthymia are all too common. Is one's potential unease, if not revulsion, at the prospect of paradise-on-earth an incidental cultural by-product of natural selection? Or has selection pressure ensured that one is genetically predisposed to be biased against the idea of enduring bliss in the first instance? \n\nRead more: https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon5.htm\n\n#EffectiveAltruism #Happiness #Suffering @webmasterdave\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Interview with author and researcher Dr. Josh Mitteldorf who runs the aging research blog 'Aging Matters'.\n\nDr. Josh Mitteldorf is an evolutionary biologist and a long-time contributor to the growing field of aging science. His work in this field has focused on theories of aging. He asks the basic question: why do we age and die? \n\nJosh is the co-author of 'Cracking the Aging Code: The New Science of Growing Old - And What It Means for Staying Young' :  \"A revolutionary examination of why we age, what it means for our health, and how we just might be able to fight it.\n\nIn Cracking the Aging Code, theoretical biologist Josh Mitteldorf and award-winning writer and ecological philosopher Dorion Sagan reveal that evolution and aging are even more complex and breathtaking than we originally thought. Using meticulous multidisciplinary science, as well as reviewing the history of our understanding about evolution, this book makes the case that aging is not something that “just happens,” nor is it the result of wear and tear or a genetic inevitability. Rather, aging has a fascinating evolutionary purpose: to stabilize populations and ecosystems, which are ever-threatened by cyclic swings that can lead to extinction.\n\nWhen a population grows too fast it can put itself at risk of a wholesale wipeout. Aging has evolved to help us adjust our growth in a sustainable fashion as well as prevent an ecological crisis from starvation, predation, pollution, or infection.\n\nThis dynamic new understanding of aging is provocative, entertaining, and pioneering, and will challenge the way we understand aging, death, and just what makes us human.\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Aging-Code-Science-Growing/dp/1250061717\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.\n\n\nIntroduction to Denis' writing/research here: https://blog.singularitynet.io/the-impact-of-extracellular-matrix-proteins-cross-linking-on-the-aging-process-b7553d375744\n\"The Impact of Extracellular Matrix Proteins Cross-linking on the Aging Process\"\n\nBiomedical Longevity - Conquering Crosslinking of the Extracellular Matrix!\nSENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and enzymes to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as advanced glycation endproducts, and other common forms of chemical linking.\n \nGlycoSENS : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategies_for_Engineered_Negligible_Senescence#Extracellular_crosslinks%E2%80%94GlycoSENS\n\nScifuture blog post: http://www.scifuture.org/denis-odinokov-conquering-cross-linking-for-biomedical-longevity/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

How do we measure it? Once we have formalized it, what do we do with it?\n\n- What is the project attempting to achieve and why is it interesting?\n- How will the different goals of different theories of consciousness effect experimental design?\n- What should theories of consc aim to achieve? (an understanding of the phenomenology or the dynamics of relevant info processing?)\n- What do we do once consciousness has been solved?  What do we do with that knowledge?\n\n\"Whether or not this project, funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation, narrows the options for how consciousness arises, it hopes to establish a new way to do science for difficult, contentious problems.

    "title": "Scott Aaronson - Is Reality Discrete or Continuous?",
    "description": "Are there discrete “pixels” of spacetime?  Can we experimentally-confirm this?\nThe debate goes back to the ancient Greeks - the question has not been equivocally resolved ye, though with quantum mechanics, there are amplitudes (complex numbers) and there is an infinite amount of possible amplitudes (in a system that tries to model this should then have continuous parameters for these amplitudes) - before amplitudes (complex numbers) are observed - it's in a continuous state, then when it is observed it collapses into one of the finite possible discrete states that it could collapse into i.e. into either a complex amplitude representing either 1 or 0, a discrete state.. so in a sense it's continuous before observed then discrete afterwards.  Also there can be quantum systems where there could be an infinite amount of possible outcomes i.e. a particle with a position live in an infinite dimensional state space (where you would need infinite complex numbers to characterize their state) - so if these systems were formally described in fundamental physics then our fundamental physics would be continuous - and then therefore nature would too - but evidence emerged from Jackob Bekenstien and Stephen Hawking that these continuous models cannot appear in our fundamental descriptions of nature - a quantum theory of gravity..  that a bounded system seems to only able to be describable from a finite amount of quantum bits (finite list of amplitudes or dimensions) - and furthermore the discovery of dark energy and that the universe is expanding at an exponential rate means that we can only receive signals that only appear a certain distance away from us.. if dark energy is a cosmological constant then the whole of the observable universe is a bounded system.. and if we agree with the Bekenstien bound principle, then any measurement ever made could only have a finite amount of possible outcomes - and in this local sense nature would then seem discrete - on the other hand before we make the observation it would be described by an infinite set of amplitudes that form a continuum.\n\n#philosophy #physics #philosophyofphysics #philsci #science #quantum\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Scott discusses the perils of predicting the timing of future technologies - we can say a lot more about what technological capabilities could ultimately be achievable be able to do than the exact timing of these technological capabilities - however, any projected timelines of particular technologies is downstream from whether we have a functioning civilization around to develop them. In wishing he could be more optimistic about the future, Scott discusses a turning away from enlightenment values and current political turmoil.  \nPeople used to make fun of how bad AI was, for instance machine translation and image recognition - that is until they started working.  Scott doesn't think that Superintelligent AI will end up being as nearer term risk as things like climate change - though it's good to know people are now thinking about approaching mitigating AI risk - but how do we know we are making progress?\nIn the mean time we are dealing with relevant moral questions and how to implement solutions in AI (i.e. trolley problems in self driving cars)..\n\nRelevant blog posts\n-  'Better safe than sorry': https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=334 \"As a concerned citizen of Planet Earth, I demand that the LHC begin operations as soon as possible, at as high energies as possible, and continue operating until such time as it is proven completely safe to turn it off.\"\n- 'Quickies': https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3553 \"I suppose this is as good a place as any to say that my views on AI risk have evolved.  A decade ago, it was far from obvious that known methods like deep learning and reinforcement learning, merely run with much faster computers and on much bigger datasets, would work as spectacularly well as they’ve turned out to work, on such a wide variety of problems, including beating all humans at Go without needing to be trained on any human game.  But now that we know these things, I think intellectual honesty requires updating on them.  And indeed, when I talk to the AI researchers whose expertise I trust the most, many, though not all, have updated in the direction of “maybe we should start worrying.” \"\n\nBio : Scott Aaronson is a theoretical computer scientist and David J.

    "title": "Scott Aaronson - The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine",
    "description": "Scott discusses whether quantum computers could have subjective experience, whether information is physical and what might be important for consciousness - he touches on classic philosophical conundrums and the observation that while people want to be thorough-going materialists, unlike traditional computers brain-states are not obviously copyable.  Aaronson wrote about this his paper 'The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine' (found here https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0159 ).  Scott also critiques Tononi's integrated information theory (IIT).\n\nQuestions include: \n - In “Could a Quantum Computer Have Subjective Experience?” you speculate that a process has to ‘fully participate in the arrow of time’ to be conscious, and this points to decoherence. If pressed, how might you try to formalize this? \n- In “Is ‘information is physical’ contentful?” you note that if a system crosses the Schwarzschild bound it collapses into a black hole. Do you think this could be used to put an upper bound on the ‘amount’ of consciousness in any given physical system?\n- One of your core objections to IIT is that it produces blatantly counter-intuitive results. But to what degree should we expect intuition to be a guide for phenomenological experience in evolutionarily novel contexts? I.e., Eric Schwitzgebel notes \"Common sense is incoherent in matters of metaphysics. There’s no way to develop an ambitious, broad-ranging, self- consistent metaphysical system without doing serious violence to common sense somewhere. It's just impossible. Since common sense is an inconsistent system, you can’t respect it all. Every metaphysician will have to violate it somewhere.\"\n\nMany thanks to Mike Johnson for providing these questions!\n\nBio : Scott Aaronson is a theoretical computer scientist and David J.

A demonstration of this constructivist AI methodology has been given in the FP-7 funded HUMANOBS project, where an artificial system autonomously learned how to do spoken multimodal interviews by observing humans participate in a TV-style interview. The system, called AERA, autonomously expands its capabilities through self-reconfiguration. Thórisson has also worked extensively on systems integration for artificial intelligence systems in the past, contributing architectural principles for infusing dialogue and human-interaction capabilities into the Honda ASIMO robot.\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristinn_R._Th%C3%B3risson\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

Universal AI is such a mathematical theory of machine super-intelligence. More precisely, AIXI is an elegant parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment that possesses essentially all aspects of rational intelligence. The theory reduces all conceptual AI problems to pure computational questions. After a brief discussion of its philosophical, mathematical, and computational ingredients, I will give a formal definition and measure of intelligence, which is maximized by AIXI. AIXI can be viewed as the most powerful Bayes-optimal sequential\ndecision maker, for which I will present general optimality results. This also motivates some variations such as knowledge-seeking and optimistic agents, and feature reinforcement learning. Finally I present some recent approximations, implementations, and applications of this modern top-down approach to AI.\n\n\nPaper: http://www.hutter1.net/publ/suaiheavy.pdf \n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

Thórisson is an Icelandic Artificial Intelligence researcher, founder of the Icelandic Institute for Intelligent Machines (IIIM) and co-founder and former co-director of CADIA: Center for Analysis and Design of Intelligent Agents. Thórisson is one of the leading proponents of artificial intelligence systems integration.\n\nThórisson is a proponent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) (also referred to as strong AI) and has proposed a new methodology for achieving artificial general intelligence. A demonstration of this constructivist AI methodology has been given in the FP-7 funded HUMANOBS project HUMANOBS project, where an artificial system autonomously learned how to do spoken multimodal interviews by observing humans participate in a TV-style interview. The system, called AERA, autonomously expands its capabilities through self-reconfiguration. Thórisson has also worked extensively on systems integration for artificial intelligence systems in the past, contributing architectural principles for infusing dialogue and human-interaction capabilities into the Honda ASIMO robot.\n\nKristinn R.

    "description": "Historically, the use of the term understanding in AI has mostly focused on natural language, which relates to the parsing and manipulation of linguistic tokens, and scene or image understanding, which again relates to parsing or largely semantics-free processing, with any discussion of understanding proper a rare occurrence. To the field of AGI, for which the topic of generality is central, this state of affairs would seem far from ideal. To investigate the phenomenon of understanding, compare systems with respect to their potential for understanding, and get to the crux of what understanding really is, seems important enough to give it more scrutiny.\n\nPart of a session on Machine Understanding held at AGI17 - see : http://cadia.ru.is/workshops/uuw2017/\n\nFurther reading: Understanding and Common Sense: Two Sides of the Same Coin?\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-63703-7_19\nAbstract: The concept of “common sense” (“commonsense”) has had a visible role in the history of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in the context of reasoning and what’s been referred to as “symbolic knowledge representation.” Much of the research on this topic has claimed to target general knowledge of the kind needed to ‘understand’ the world, stories, complex tasks, and so on. The same cannot be said about the concept of “understanding”; although the term does make an appearance in the discourse in various sub-fields (primarily “language understanding” and “image/scene understanding”), no major schools of thought, theories or undertakings can be discerned for understanding in the same way as for common sense.

    "description": "Part of a session on Machine Understanding held at AGI17 - see : http://cadia.ru.is/workshops/uuw2017/\nAbstract: Understanding, as a cognitive function, can be studied in the context of either communication or general cognition. In both contexts, it is possible to understand the process as the forming and reforming of concepts. The major missing components in the current AI techniques include experience-grounded semantics and resource-bounded spontaneous inference. The relevant aspects of an AGI system, NARS, are discussed as an example on how understanding can be achieved in a general-purpose system.\n\nWhat is Understanding?\nLike many basic notions in cognitive science and artiﬁcial intelligence, “understanding” has no commonly accepted deﬁnition, though researchers agree that it is important. In AI study, at least two senses of “understanding” can be discussed. In a narrow sense, a system understands a message by getting its intended meaning; in a broad sense, a system understands an object, event, or situation by getting the necessary information to properly deal with it...\n\nPaper: https://github.com/PhillyAGITeam/Website/blob/master/Papers/PAGI-TR-4.pdf\n\n\n== NARS == \nNARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) is a general-purpose reasoning system, coming from my study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cognitive Sciences (CogSci).\n\nWhat makes NARS different from conventional reasoning systems is its ability to learn from its experience and to work with insufficient knowledge and resources.\n\nNARS attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, reacting, perceiving, categorizing, prioritizing, remembering, decision making, and so on.\n\nThe research results include a theory of intelligence, a formal model of the theory, and a computer implementation of the model.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this research is to fully understand the mind, as well as to build thinking machines. Currently this research field is often called \"Artificial General Intelligence\" (AGI).\n-- https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/\n\n\n== Contact ==\nhttp://www.cis.temple.edu/~pwang/index.html\nPHONE: (215)204-9255; FAX: (215)204-5082 (department)\nEMAIL: pei.wang@temple.edu\n\n\n== Research\n\n    Artificial Intelligence (AI): basic questions (talk in Chinese), A General Theory of Intelligence\n    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): introduction, journal, society, education, lecture notes\n    Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS): introduction, project website, open-source version, discussion group, tutorial\n    Selected publications and demonstrations, as well as my Curriculum Vitae\n    Student participation opportunity: CST Undergraduate Research Program\n\n#AGI17 #AGI #ArtificialIntelligence #Understanding #MachineUnderstanding #CommonSence #ArtificialGeneralIntelligence #PhilMind \n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "MEMES & TREMES: FROM BIOLOGY TO THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Universal Darwinism is the principle that when any kind of information is copied with variation and selection an evolutionary process inevitably begins. Genes are Earth’s best-known replicator, giving rise to biological evolution, but there may be others.\n\nProfessor Richard Dawkins coined the term ‘meme’ to apply to a second replicator that emerged when our ancestors became capable of imitation. Their memes – the sounds, actions and ways of doing things that they copied – spread and evolved, competing to use human bodies and brains, and creating human culture in the process. We became meme machines. The field of memetics differs from other theories of cultural evolution in being based on two “selfish replicators” – genes and memes. Arguably, memetics can better understand our fast-changing culture.\n\nCould a third replicator emerge from the culture created by the second? Professor Susan Blackmore believes this is already happening. Digital information is now being copied, varied and selected ever faster by the silicon-based technology that we have provided for it. Professor Blackmore will speculate that a third replicator, tremes, is already emerging, evolving new types of intelligence, which means we need to consider how our own role is inevitably changing.\n\nA joint lecture with the Victorian Branch of the Australian Skeptics.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nSusan BlackmoreProfessor Susan Blackmore is a psychologist, lecturer and writer researching consciousness, memes, and anomalous experiences, and a Visiting Professor at the University of Plymouth.

Brian discusses implications Artificial Intelligence and news of DeepMind AI (AlphaGo) beating the world grand champion in the board game Go.  He then discusses physics string theory, the territory of opinion on grand unifying theories of physics, the importance of supporting fundamental science, the possibility of alien life, the possible future of our space-faring civilization and of course gravitational waves!\n\nIn answer to the question on the importance of supporting fundamental research in science, Brain Greene said: \"I tell them to wake up!  Wake up and recognize that fundamental science has radically changed the way they live their lives today.  If  any of these individuals have a cell phone, or a personal computer, or perhaps they themselves or loved ones has been saved by an MRI machine.. I mean any of these devices rely on integrated circuits, which they themselves rely on quantum physics - so IF those folks who were in charge in the 1920s had have said, 'hey you guys working on quantum physics, that doesn't seem to be relevant to anything in the world around as so were going to cut your funding - well those people would have short circuited on of the greatest revolutions that our species has gone through - the information age, the technological age - so the bottom line is we need to support fundamental research because we know historically that when you gain a deep understanding of how things work - we can often leverage that to then manipulate the world around us in spectacular ways!  And that needs to be where our fundamental focus remains - in science!\"\n\nAudio (originally published  on March 14, 2016): https://archive.org/details/BrianGreeneInterviewAIPhysicsGravitationalWavesAlienLifeAndThePossibleFutureOfOurCivilization\n\nBrian Randolph Greene is an American theoretical physicist and string theorist. He has been a professor at Columbia University since 1996 and chairman of the World Science Festival since co-founding it in 2008. Greene has worked on mirror symmetry, relating two different Calabi–Yau manifolds (concretely, relating the conifold to one of its orbifolds). He also described the flop transition, a mild form of topology change, showing that topology in string theory can change at the conifold point.\n\nGreene has become known to a wider audience through his books for the general public, The Elegant Universe, Icarus at the Edge of Time, The Fabric of the Cosmos, The Hidden Reality, and related PBS television specials. He also appeared on The Big Bang Theory episode \"The Herb Garden Germination\", as well as the films Frequency and The Last Mimzy.

Once solving aging becomes demonstrably feasible, it is likely attitudes will shift regarding its desirability.  There is huge potential, for individuals and for society, in reducing suffering through the use of rejuvenation therapy to achieve new heights of physical well-being.  I also discuss the looming economic implications of large percentages of illness among aging populations - and put forward that focusing on solving fundamental problems of aging (i.e. accumulated damage), will reduce the incidents of debilitating diseases of aging - which will in turn reduce the economic burden of illness.

    "description": "Peter Voss on 'Deep Understanding' - machine intelligence understanding - what it means, what it isn't, what it should be, approaches to achieving it and implications of achieving it.\nPeter Voss: Entrepreneur, Futurist, AGI Developer: htp://agi-3.com http://Aigo.ai\nUnderstanding ‘Understanding’ article: http://churchandstate.org.uk/2018/04/understanding-understanding/\nLots of Peter's articles appear on Medium: https://medium.com/@petervoss\n\n‘Understanding’ is a ‘suitcase word’, and just like ‘intelligence’, has many quite distinct meanings that are ‘thrown into a suitcase’ with a label slapped on the whole jumble (paraphrase of Marvin Minsky’s version). Here are some key aspects and examples of ‘understanding’:\n\n“She understands English” — This could simply mean she can correctly respond to instructions like ‘turn up the heat’. Today’s smart thermostats can do that! It does not actually imply that individual words are actually understood, or that the wider context and implications are.\n“Do you understand what I said?” — Usually we’d expect the other person to be able to repeat the information in their own words, and answer some follow-up questions.\n“Did he understand the story?” — He should be able to give us a summary of the story, providing key aspects, as well as providing the moral or take-home message of the story.\n“They understand math/ English grammar” — Here we’d expect deep technical knowledge of the topic, skill in using it, and the ability to explain and teach it.\n“She understands me” — Knowing what motivates me, my personality, etc. — i.e. psychological visibility.\n“She understands horses” — Knowing a lot of facts about horse and how to handle them.\n“We understand what causes AIDS/ how electric motors work” — Having detailed knowledge of the mechanisms that cause something to happen and/or function.\n“My narrow AI understands emotions/ sentiment” — I don’t think so. Perhaps it can detect or categorize emotions, but not understand in the wider sense of the word.\nSo, ‘understanding’ at its simplest is ‘being able to respond appropriately’ — a purely behavioral measure. The next level is to be able to tell back the information in your own words. Another level is knowing the implications. Personal experience takes us to a much higher level of integration — this is where the connection to the ‘I’ comes in. Having deep subject knowledge and skill is another dimension. Finally, knowing how something functions in detail — knowing the specific cause-effect mechanisms.\n\n\nPeter Voss is an entrepreneur, inventor, engineer, scientist and AI researcher. In 2001 he (co-) coined the term ‘AGI’ (Artificial General Intelligence), and has been working towards achieving high-level AI since then. He also has a keen interest in the inter-relationship between philosophy, psychology, ethics, futurism, and computer science, and frequently writes and talks on these topics.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "#Pandemics - the word conjures up images of horrific diseases sweeping the globe and killing everyone in their path. But such highly lethal illnesses almost never create pandemics. The reality is deadly serious but far more subtle. \n\nPeter C. Doherty is winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, 1996 - See Peter Doherty's book 'Pandemics - What Everyone Needs to Know' : https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pandemics-9780199898121\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Pandemics-What-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/019989812X\n\nIn Pandemics: What Everyone Needs to Know®, Peter Doherty, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on how the immune system recognizes virus-infected cells, offers an essential guide to one of the truly life-or-death issues of our age. In concise, question-and-answer format, he explains the causes of pandemics, how they can be counteracted with vaccines and drugs, and how we can better prepare for them in the future. Doherty notes that the term \"pandemic\" refers not to a disease's severity but to its ability to spread rapidly over a wide geographical area. Extremely lethal pathogens are usually quickly identified and confined. Nevertheless, the rise of high-speed transportation networks and the globalization of trade and travel have radically accelerated the spread of diseases. A traveler from Africa arrived in New York in 1999 carrying the West Nile virus; one mosquito bite later, it was loose in the ecosystem. Doherty explains how the main threat of a pandemic comes from respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS, which disseminate with incredible speed through air travel. The climate disruptions of global warming, rising population density, and growing antibiotic resistance all complicate efforts to control pandemics. But Doherty stresses that pandemics can be fought effectively. Often simple health practices, especially in hospitals, can help enormously. And research into the animal reservoirs of pathogens, from #SARS in bats to #HIV in chimpanzees, show promise for our prevention efforts.\n\nCalm, clear, and authoritative, Peter Doherty's Pandemics is one of the most critically important additions to the What Everyone Needs to Know® series. \n\nLaureate Professor, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity \n\n Many thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Ethereum: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Abstract:  Central to the science of biology is the complex choreography of cells and molecules. A key problem with explaining this science to the public is that much of it exists in a microscopic world that is too small to be directly observed, or takes place at speeds beyond our normal perception of time.\n\nCreating visualisations of cellular and molecular biology has become increasingly important for exploring and showing biological mechanisms to the public, students and scientific peers.\n\nVisualisation is able to synthesize diverse structural and dynamic data derived from a variety of research sources, and can thus act as a visual hypothesis for a particular molecular process.\n\nBeyond the bench, visualisations are powerful communication tools that are being used in classrooms and in the mass media to educate and entertain.\nAbout the speaker\n\nBiography: Drew Berry  is a biomedical animator at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia. His scientifically accurate and aesthetically rich visualizations are elucidating cellular and molecular processes for a wide range of audiences.

    "description": "Abstract: Professor Hollenberg gives a quick intro to quantum mechanics, followed by quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing in biology.\nThis talk explores the strange and beautiful world of Quantum Mechanics – multiple realities, absolute uncertainty, quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum sensing. Amazingly, with rapidly improving abilities to control single atoms and photons, we are beginning to glimpse the true nature of quantum reality. And now a completely new class of technology based on these strange rules is being developed, with possibly far reaching implications. No maths required – just bring curiosity about the world and an open mind.\n\nQuantum Mechanics is the corner-stone theory of the physical world, which began with the ideas of Max Planck over a century ago. In recent years new and surprising aspects about quantum mechanics, and reality itself, have been uncovered as experiments probe further into the quantum realm. While we do not (and possibly cannot!) fully comprehend the sublime strangeness of quantum mechanics, a growing movement around the world seeks to harness the awesome processing power of microscopic systems obeying quantum laws. This is an international race for the new millennium to design and build new technology based on the spooky aspects of quantum mechanics, with enormous potential for communication, computing and imaging applications. Already quantum sensing of biological processes is becoming a reality, and ultra-secure quantum communication systems are being rolled-out around the world. The far flung future of this new quantum technology is the construction of a full-scale quantum computer, potentially a leap forward in information processing far greater than the development of the modern computer.\n\nLloyd Hollenberg - https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person3038\n\nQuantum Science and Technology Group @ University of Melbourne: http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/quantum-technology/\n\nTalk given at SciFuture conference in Melb Australia '13 \n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Abstract: Uncertain knowledge can be modeled by using graded probabilities rather than binary truth-values, but so far a completely satisfactory integration of logic and probability has been lacking. In particular the inability of confirming universal hypotheses has plagued most if not all systems so far. We address this problem head on. The main technical problem to be discussed is the following: Given a set of sentences, each having some probability of being true, what probability should be ascribed to other (query) sentences? A natural wish-list, among others, is that the probability distribution (i) is consistent with the knowledge base, (ii) allows for a consistent inference procedure and in particular (iii) reduces to deductive logic in the limit of probabilities\nbeing 0 and 1, (iv) allows (Bayesian) inductive reasoning and (v) learning in the limit and in particular (vi) allows confirmation of universally quantified hypotheses/sentences. We show that probabilities satisfying (i)-(vi) exist, and present necessary and sufficient conditions (Gaifman and Cournot). The theory is a step towards a globally consistent and empirically satisfactory unification of probability and logic.\n\nPaper: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/958d/3c35aa8cfd1d2c536947b7780257ed7898aa.pdf\n\nMarcus Hutter - http://www.hutter1.net/\nAustralian National University Canberra, ACT, 0200, Australia\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Genetic evolution is slow. Progress in artificial intelligence is fast. Only a handful of genes separate Homo sapiens from our hominid ancestors on the African savannah. Among our 23,000-odd protein-coding genes, variance in single nucleotide polymorphisms (“SNPs”) accounts for just a small percentage of phenotypic variance in intelligence as measured by what we call IQ tests. True, the tempo of human evolution is about to accelerate. As the reproductive revolution of “designer babies” gathers pace, prospective parents will pre-select alleles and allelic combinations for a new child in anticipation of their behavioural effects – a novel kind of selection pressure to replace the “blind” genetic roulette of natural selection. In time, routine embryo screening via preimplantation genetic diagnosis will be complemented by gene therapy, genetic enhancement and then true designer zygotes. In consequence, life on Earth will also become progressively happier as the hedonic treadmill is recalibrated. In the new reproductive era, hedonic set-points and intelligence alike will be ratcheted upwards in virtue of selection pressure. For what parent-to-be wants to give birth to a low-status depressive “loser”? Future parents can enjoy raising a normal transhuman supergenius who grows up to be faster than Usain Bolt, more beautiful than Marilyn Monroe, more saintly than Nelson Mandela, more creative than Shakespeare – and smarter than Einstein.\n\nEven so, the accelerating growth of germline engineering will be a comparatively slow process. In this scenario, sentient biological machines will design cognitively self-amplifying biological machines who will design cognitively self-amplifying biological machines. Greater-than-human biological intelligence will transform itself into posthuman superintelligence. Cumulative gains in intellectual capacity and subjective well-being across the generations will play out over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years – a momentous discontinuity, for sure, and a twinkle in the eye of eternity; but not a BioSingularity.\n\n The Bio-Intelligence Explosion:\"\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140228040420/http://2013.scifuture.org:80/the-bio-intelligence-explosion-david-pearce/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "title": "David Pearce - Towards the Abolition of Suffering",
    "description": "The term “abolitionism,” used to describe the use of biotechnology to eliminate suffering, was first proposed by Lewis Mancini in 1986, in his articles for Medical Hypotheses Journal. Abolitionism is the use of science to maximize happiness and minimize suffering — not just in humans but in all sentient life. It is a philosophy inspired by utilitarian ethics: if happiness equals value, then the elimination of suffering or 'maximization of value' should be the prime objective of the human race.\n\nAbolitionism makes no distinction among sentient creatures— all are deemed worthy of being saved from suffering by biotechnological intervention.\n\nAn ethical system that is similar to transhumanism, Abolitionism deliberately defines its rationale and method of determining value according to a prime ethical directive with a focus on eliminating involuntary suffering, whereas Transhumanism promotes a collection of values including the well-being of all sentient beings without addressing the question of whether or not involuntary suffering should eventually be eliminated. \n\nhplusmagazine.com/2013/10/26/david-pearce-the-naturalisation-of-heaven/\n- talk given at SciFuture 2013\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "title": "Aubrey de Grey - Towards the Future of Regenerative Medicine",
    "description": "In recent times there as been surprising progress in stem cell research and in regenerative medicine that will change the world.   Aubrey de Grey is the Chief Science Officer of SENS Foundation - an organisation focused on going beyond ageing and leading the journey towards the future of regenerative medicine!  What will it take to get there?  Here are some topics covered: \n- 2:00 What projects will recent donations fund? (Buck Institute/Julie Campisi - stimulating the immune system, helping other projects get spun-off into )\n- 3.25 AgeX Therapeutics (Mike West) - where Aubrey is vice president of new technology\n- 4.12 - SENS 7 point plan broken into two major categories (1) Two few or too many cells and molecular where Mike West has been predominantly successful- (2) changes inside the cell, or in the extra-cellular space - where SENS has been predominantly successful.\n- 6.17 \n- \n- Highlights of promising progress in regenerative medicine in general\n- Recent funding successes, what can be achieved with this?\n- Discussion on getting the message across - desirability & feasibility of rejuvenation therapy\n- Robust Mouse Rejuvenation - now Aubrey predicts only half a decade away\n- What could be the future of regenerative medicine?\n- Given progress so far, what can people alive today look forward to?\n- Multi-factorial diseases - Fixing amyloid plaque buildup alone won't cure Alzheimer's\n- moth-balling anti-telomerase approach to fighting cancer in favor of cancer immunotherapy (for the time being) as it's side effects need to be compensated against...\n- Cancer immunotherapy - stimulating the bodies natural ability to attack cancer with it's immune system -2 approaches - car-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptors and T cells),  and  checkpoint inhibiting drugs.. then there is training the immune system to identify neoantegens (stuff that all cancers produce)\n- Auto-immune diseases (considered incurable to some) - they get worse with aging for the same reason we loose general ability to fight off infections and attack cancer.  Essentially the immune system looses it's precision - it has two arms: the innate system and the adaptive - the adaptive side works by having polyclonality - a very wide diversity of cells with different rearrangements of parts of the genome that confer specificity of the immune cell to a particular target (which it may or may not encounter at some time in the future) - this polyclonality diminishes over life  such that the cells which are targeted towards a given problem with the immune system are on average less precisely adapted towards it - so the immune system takes longer to do it's job or doesn't do it effectively - so with autoimmune system it looses it's ability to distinguish between things that are foreign and things that are part of the body.  So this could be powerfully addressed by the same measures taken to rejuvenate the immune system generally - regenerating the thyamis and illuminating senescent cells that are accumulating in the blood. \n- 38:50 Bottlenecks: which bottlenecks does Aubrey believes need most attention from the community of people who already believe aging is a problem that needs to be solved?  The first thing: Funding.  The shortage of funding is still the biggest bottleneck.  The second thing:  The need for policy makers to get on board with the ideas and understand what is coming - so it's not only developing the therapies as quickly as possible, it's also important that once they are developed, the therapies get disseminated as quick as possible to avoid complete chaos.  It's very urgent to have proper discussions about this.  Anticipating the anticipation - getting ready for the public anticipating these therapies instead of thinking that it's all science fiction and is never going to happen.\n- 42:47 Effective Advocacy - it's a big ask to get people from extreme opposition to supporting regenerative medicine.  Nudging people a bit sideways - that is getting them from complete offense to less offense, or getting people who are un-decided to be in favor of it.\n\nBio :  Chief Science Officer, SENS Research Foundation, Mountain View, CA - http://sens.org\nAgeX Therapeutics - http://www.agexinc.com/\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

Attendance online or in person is free of charge. The workshop is designed to both introduce whole brain emulation and the Carboncopies organization as well as provide an update of current status and activities. The workshop will emphasize participation through Q&A and topical discussion. The agenda includes the following topics:\nMind Uploading: A brief introduction into the philosophy, science and technology of mind uploading and whole brain emulation.\n\nRoadmap 2018: The Carboncopies status update. How do we map the structure of a brain? How do we record the response characteristics of its neurons and synapses? How is a working model generated with parameters defined by those data maps? Finally, how is a model brought to life in a real implementation of whole brain emulation?\n\nKernel and Neuralink: Commercial efforts to bridge the machine-human divide.\n\nCarboncopies Technology Review: Launching this research project.\n\nSpecial topic: Discovering Neural Circuits in Brain Data.\n\nPresenters include Prof. Theodore Berger (USC), Prof. Tony Zador (CSHL), Dr. Shawn Mikula (Max Planck Institute), Dr. Adam Marblestone (MIT/Kernel), Dr. Randal Koene (Carboncopies, Chairman), Dr. Diana Deca (USC), Dr. Sim Bamford, and others.\n\nEveryone is invited to attend and participate.

    "description": "Interview with Robin Hanson about his new book 'The Elephant in the Brain'(co-authored with Kevin Simler). \n\nHuman beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains are therefore designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to get ahead socially, often by devious means.\n\nBut while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better. And thus we don’t like to talk — or even think — about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain,” an introspective blind spot that makes it hard to think clearly about ourselves and the explanations for our behavior.\n\nThe aim of this book is to confront our hidden motives directly — to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once our minds are more clearly visible, we can work to better understand human nature: Why do people laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?\n\nBeyond our personal lives, unconscious motives also lurk within large-scale social institutions such as art, charity, education, politics, and religion. In fact, these venerated institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their “official” ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates and cast fatal doubt on many polite fictions. You won’t see yourself — or the world — the same after confronting the elephant in the brain. \n\nhttp://elephantinthebrain.com\n\nYou can buy the book from:\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0190495995/\nGoogle: https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Kevin_Simler_The_Elephant_in_the_Brain?id=p_lADwAAQBAJ\n\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Interview with John Danaher on his book 'Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications' https://academic.oup.com/mit-press-scholarship-online/book/13257?login=false\n\nSome of the topics to be covered (relating to sections of the book):\n • It may not be possible to ‘have sex’ with a robot (Chapter 2)\n • Sex robots could improve the quality and distribution of sexual experiences, and improve human relationships (Chapter 3)\n • We probably should not campaign against sex robots, as some have argued (Chapter 4)\n • Sex robots could be used to secure the sexual rights of persons with disabilities (Chapter 5)\n • We should approach the development of sex robots as a social experiment (Chapter 7)\n • We should not use child sex robots to treat paedophiles (Chapter 8)\n • Being a pre-programmed robot sex slave might not be that bad (Chapter 9)\n • Loving relationships with robots are unlikely but if they were that could be a good thing and address many of the concerns people have about sex robots (Chapters 11 and 12)\n • Sex robots might improve the quality of human marriages (Chapter 15)\n\nAbstract: Sexbots are coming. Given the pace of technological advances, it is inevitable that realistic robots specifically designed for people’s sexual gratification will be developed in the not-too-distant future. Despite popular culture’s fascination with the topic, and the emergence of the much-publicized Campaign Against Sex Robots, there has been little academic research on the social, philosophical, moral, and legal implications of robot sex. This book fills the gap, offering perspectives from philosophy, psychology, religious studies, economics, and law on the possible future of robot-human sexual relationships. Contributors discuss what a sex robot is, if they exist, why we should take the issue seriously, and what it means to “have sex” with a robot. They make the case for developing sex robots, arguing for their beneficial nature, and the case against it, on religious and moral grounds; they consider the subject from the robot’s perspective, addressing such issues as consent and agency; and they ask whether it is possible for a human to form a mutually satisfying, loving relationship with a robot. Finally, they speculate about the future of human-robot sexual interaction, considering the social acceptability of sex robots and the possible effect on society.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Discussion with James Hughes on\n-  Algocracy - governance by algorithm.  What could go wrong/right?\n- the need for efficient governance which can’t keep pace with accelerating technological change & the need for agility & flexibility.\n\n\nJames Hughes will be releasing a paper on this shortly.\n\nAbstract: Since the Enlightenment there have been advocates for the rationalizing efficiency of enlightened sovereigns, bureaucrats and technocrats. Today these enthusiasms are joined by calls for replacing or augmenting government with algorithms and artificial intelligence, a process already substantially underway. Bureaucracies are in effect algorithms created by technocrats which systematize governance, and their automation simply removes bureaucrats and paper. The growth of algorithmic governance can already be seen in the automation of social services, regulatory oversight, policing, the justice system and the military. However there have also always been justified democratic and economic criticisms of autocracy, bureaucracy, technocracy and algorithmic governance. Bureaucrats, technocrats and algorithms embody biases that tend to serve the interests of elites, and all require transparency and democratic accountability, oversight individual citizens are ill-equipped to exercise. As state apparatuses are increasingly automated, mechanisms for collective action and democratic oversight also need to be automated. Algorithms and cyborg citizenry will enable a posthuman democracy. Democratically accountable algorithmic governance, enabled by artificial intelligence and human enhancement, can automate bottom-up citizen surveillance, inform debate, aggregate decision-making, and ensure the efficient workings of the gradually withering state. As paid work disappears and we transition to a post-capitalist economy with a universal basic income, market mechanisms can be replaced with democratic planning. Indeed, only algorithmic governance can secure our future against the accelerating threats from technological innovation.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Interview with George Dvorsky on recent AlphaGo Zero news.\n\nRead George's Gizmodo article here: https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/10/stunning-ai-breakthrough-takes-us-one-step-closer-to-the-singularity/\n\nRead the Nature paper 'Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge' by DeepMind here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ\n\nAbstract: A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100–0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nb) Donating \n- Bitcoin: 1BxusYmpynJsH4i8681aBuw9ZTxbKoUi22\n- Etherium: 0xd46a6e88c4fe179d04464caf42626d0c9cab1c6b\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture \n\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

As the founder of Biogineers, he is on the cusp of revolutionizing brain therapies with microscopic nanorobots that will make certain degenerative diseases become a thing of the past. But after his research is stolen by an unknown enemy, seventy thousand people die in Las Vegas in one abominable moment. No one is more horrified than Peter, as this catastrophe sets in motion events that will forever change not only his life but also the course of human evolution.\nPeter’s company is torn from his grasp as the public clamors for his blood. Desperate, he turns to old friend, who introduces him to the Phoenix Club, a cabal of the most powerful people in the world. To make himself more valuable to his new colleagues, Peter infuses his brain with experimental technology, exponentially upgrading his mental prowess and transforming him irrevocably.\nAs he’s exposed to unimaginable wealth and influence, Peter’s sense of reality begins to unravel. Do the club members want to help him, or do they just want to claim his technology? What will they do to him once they have their prize? And while he’s already evolved beyond mere humanity, is he advanced enough to take on such formidable enemies and win?\n\n== (ID)ENTITY\nBuy: https://www.amazon.com.au/d/ID-entity-Phoenix-Horizon-Book-ebook/B00WL6QGFO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506347976&sr=8-1&keywords=pj+manney\nIn the guise of political revolutionary Thomas Paine, bioengineer Peter Bernhardt brought down the corrupt and powerful Phoenix Club—and then turned revolution into evolution by becoming the first artificial human intelligence: Major Tom. In the two years since Major Tom revealed his digital existence and spread his freedom manifesto, he has been revered as a god and vilified as a demon. The United States and Europe have splintered into ideologically independent regions. Russia and China prepare to expand their empires.\nIn the midst of the chaos, pirates attack a seastead in the Pacific Ocean, capturing one of Major Tom’s allies. A mysterious and powerful group wages a secret war. To rescue his ally, Major Tom must first regain his own humanity and somehow save a species he no longer identifies with, and which seems determined to destroy itself.\n\nBio: PJ Manney writes the same way she lives—with an abiding passion for exploring new, exhilarating, and utterly unique experiences. A devotedly positive futurist, she was chairperson of the board of directors of Humanity+, an international nonprofit organization that advocates the ethical use of technology to expand human capabilities. Manney has also been active in communications, public relations, and film production. To date, she has written numerous scripts for television pilots and has also worked on shows such as Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess. She has lived as far afield as New York and New Zealand and loves delving into the cultural landscape of wherever she finds herself. Whenever she’s not working on her novels, she continues to expound on her perspective of a technology-driven posthumanity while encouraging hopeful visions of the future. She lives with her husband of twenty-eight years and their two children. \n--\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Exclusive interview with Stuart Russell.  He discusses the importance of achieving friendly AI - Strong AI that is provably (probably approximately) beneficial.\n\nPoints of discussion: \nA clash of intuitions about the beneficiality of Strong Artificial Intelligence\n  - A clash of intuitions: Alan Turing raised the concern that if we were to build an AI smarter than we are, we might not be happy about the results.  While there is a general notion amoungst AI developers etc that building smarter than human AI would be good.\n  - But it's not clear why the objectives of Superintelligent AI will be inimicable to our values - so we need to solve what some poeple call the value alignment problem.\n  - we as humans learn values in conjunction with learning about the world\n\nThe Value Alignment problem\n  \nBasic AI Drives: Any objective generates sub-goals\n\n\n- Designing an AI not want to disable it's off switch\n  - 2 principles\n - 1) its only objective is to maximise your reward function (this is not an objective programmed into the machine but is a kind of (non-observed) latent variable \n - 2) the machine has to be explicitly uncertain about what that objective is \n  - if the robot thinks it knows what your objective functions are, then it won't believe that it will make you unhappy and therefore has an incentive to disable the off switch\n   - the robot will only want to be switched off if thinks it will makes you unhappy  \n   \n- How will the machines do what humans want if they can't see their objective functions?\n  - one answer is to allow the machines to observe human behaviour, and interpret that behaviour as providing evidence of an underlying preference structure - inverse reinforcement learning \n  \n  \nAggregated Volition: How does an AI optimise for many peoples values?\n - Has the benefit of symmetry \n  - difficulties in commensurbaility of different human preferences\n - Problem:  If someone feels more strongly about a value X should they get more of a share of value X?    \n\nHow to deal with people who's preferences include the suffering of others?\n\nShould a robot be more obligated to its owner than to the rest of the world?\n  - should this have something to do with how much you pay for the robot?\n\nMoral philosophy will be a key industry sector\n \nIssues of near term Narrow AI vs future Strong AI\n - Very easy to confuse the near term killer robot question with the existential risk question\n \n  \nDifferences in the issues with the risk of the misuse of Narrow AI and the risk of Strong AI\n- Weaponised Narrow AI\n\nShould we replace the gainful employment of humans with AI?\n\nA future where humans lose a sense of meaning & dignity\n\nHostility to the idea of Superintelligence and AI Friendline\n - there seems to be something else going on for AI experts to make rational arguments as simple minded as 'If the AI goes bad, just turn the AI off'\n - beating alphago is no problem - we just need to play better moves\n - it's theoretically possibe that AI could pose existential risk - but it's also possible that a black hole could appear in near earth orbit - we don't spend any time worrying about that so why should we spend time worrying about the existential risk of AI?\n\nDefensive psychological reactions to feeling one's research is under attack\n - People proposing AI safety are not anti AI any more than people wanting to contain a nuclear reaction are anti physics\n\nProvably beneficial AI\n - where the AI systems responsibility is to figure out what you want \n - though the data to train the AI may be sometimes unrepresentative - leading to a small prossibility of deviation from true beneficiality - probably approximately beneficial AI\n \nConvincing the AI community that AI friendliness is important\n\nWill there be a hard takeoff to superintelligence?\n \nWhat are the benefits of building String AI?\n\n--\n\nCenter for Human-Compatible AI - UC Berkley\nhttp://humancompatible.ai/\n\nStuart Jonathan Russell is a computer scientist known for his contributions to artificial intelligence.

    "description": "Peter received his B. Sc. (Hons) from Melbourne University (Australia) in 1972, majoring in Physics and Applied Mathematics; his M. Phil. in 1974 from Waikato University (New Zealand), majoring in Applied Mathematics, and his Ph.D. in 1978 from\nMonash University (Australia) in artificial intelligence (AI). After 4 years spent teaching advanced computing (University of Technology Sydney), he moved to SRI International (California) where he continued his AI research in planning, search and reasoning under uncertainty. At SRI he developed new algorithms for efficient Maximum Entropy inference that foreshadowed later Bayes Net algorithms, now standard in AI. In 1985 he co-founded the annual Uncertainty in AI conference. While at SRI, he developed a new approach to reasoning with spatial uncertainty called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). This SLAM approach is now standard for robot navigation and tolerance stacking.\nIn 1985, he moved to NASA Ames Research Center (Bay Area) where he extended his research on reasoning under uncertainty to automatic discovery of structure in data, and unsupervised learning (i.e., automated discovery of natural classes in data), leading to the influential, and widely used AutoClass program. During this period he also discovered the foundational result that computationally hard problems occur at the solvability phase\ntransition boundary. In 1991 he received US patent 5,302,509 for a new method of DNA sequencing he invented. He and his collaborators were the first to apply Bayesian learning methods to the problem of 2-D super-resolution from multiple images, and more recently extended these methods to produce super-resolved 3-D surfaces from multiple view-point images. In 2004 he moved back to Sydney Australia to head the Symbolic Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition group at NICTA. His team’s research at\nNICTA worked on developing a general integrated AI system. In 2006, he moved back to the Bay Area to focus on the development of a new efficient internal combustion engines. In 2007 he was awarded the AAAI classic paper prize for his AutoClass paper.\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting SciFuture by:\na) Subscribing to the SciFuture YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media SciFuture creates: http://scifuture.org \n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future",

    "description": "Strong AI: Why we should be concerned about something nobody knows how to build\n#AI #AGI #JoschaBach\nSynopsis: At the moment, nobody fully knows how to create an intelligent system that rivals or exceed human capabilities (Strong AI). The impact and possible dangers of Strong AI appear to concern mostly those futurists that are not working in day-to-day AI research. This in turn gives rise to the idea that Strong AI is merely a myth, a sci fi trope and nothing that is ever going to be implemented. The current state of the art in AI is already sufficient to lead to irrevocable changes in labor markets, economy, warfare and governance. The need to deal with these near term changes does not absolve us from considering the implications of being no longer the most intelligent beings on this planet.\nDespite the difficulties of developing Strong AI, there is no obvious reason why the principles embedded in biological brains should be outside of the range of what our engineering can achieve in the near future. While it is unlikely that current narrow AI systems will neatly scale towards general modeling and problem solving, many of the significant open questions in developing Strong AI appear to be known and solvable.\n\n\nTalk held at 'Artificial Intelligence / Human Possibilities' event as adjunct to the AGI17 conference in Melbourne 2017.\n\nAssessing emerging risks and opportunities in machine cognition\n\nWith AI Experts Ben Goertzel, Marcus Hutter, Peter Cheeseman and Joscha Bach. \n\nEvent Focus:  \nGiven significant developments in Artificial Intelligence, it's worth asking: What aspects of ideal AI have not been achieved yet?  \nThere is good reason for the growing media storm around AI - many experts agree on the big picture that with the development of Superintelligent AI (including Artificial General Intelligence) humanity will face great challenges (some polls suggest that AGI is not far).

    "title": "Peter Cheeseman - Implications of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)",
    "description": "Synopsis: It looks highly probable that the first AGI is only a few decades away. When it arrives, the implications for continued human existence are dire! One indicator is that we do not know of any alien intelligences--but why? Given the recent discovery that most stars have planets, and that life on earth got started shortly after it formed, it is likely that there will be billions of planets in our galaxy with life. It is also likely that at least some of these lifeforms will have advanced to human level of intelligence and beyond--yet we see no evidence of this! While there are many possible explanations for the missing aliens, one explanation is that alien civilizations developed AGIs and the AGIs then destroyed their creators. Another explanation is that the aliens merged with their AGIs making them individually super-powerful.\nIn this case it only takes one rogue super-intelligent alien to destroy them all. Even if we are very cautious in developing a \"friendly\" AGI, the risk of bad unintended consequences is very high. Trying to out-smart an AGI that is orders of magnitude smarter than us is a losing proposition, so once created, it is unstoppable. While I believe there are possible technical methods to develop an AGI that is benevolent to us, mainly by interacting with us as it develops, this misses the main risk. The main risk is not the AGI, but who owns it! Developing an AGI will take considerable resources, so whoever puts up these resources will want to exploit it to recover their investment, and gain a powerful dominating position. Other organizations will regard this monopoly on power to be intolerable, and will try to develop their own AGI or steal the existing AGI technology. Once we have competing hostile organizations with AGIs, the game is up!\n\nTalk held at 'Artificial Intelligence / Human Possibilities' event as adjunct to the AGI17 conference in Melbourne 2017.\n\nAssessing emerging risks and opportunities in machine cognition\n\nWith AI Experts Ben Goertzel, Marcus Hutter, Peter Cheeseman and Joscha Bach. \n\nEvent Focus:  \nGiven significant developments in Artificial Intelligence, it's worth asking: What aspects of ideal AI have not been achieved yet?  \nThere is good reason for the growing media storm around AI - many experts agree on the big picture that with the development of Superintelligent AI (including Artificial General Intelligence) humanity will face great challenges (some polls suggest that AGI is not far).

And so part of what we consider will be - is there anything that we could put in case that would constrain it?\nI mean after all technology has already taught us some rather anxiety provoking lessons...\"\n\nHope you enjoyed watching this as much as I did when doing the interview - if you liked it, please share it :)\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "The price of a well functioning political order is the vigilance of an informed populace.  A. C. Grayling discusses the need in a liberal democracy for people to be ever vigilant and aware of the political process - lest it be co-opted by oligarchies who know how to work the levers of influence.  \n\n\"We've got to speak up when things are going a little bit of track - because they so easily can.  There will always be interests in a polity that will want to take that polity in it's direction whether or not it's in the interests of everybody.\"\n\n- Liberal Democracy & the need for an attentive populace \n- The UK Parliament Hijacked by the Party Discipline System\n\nAnthony Clifford Grayling, usually known as A. C. Grayling, is a philosopher and author. He was born in the British expatriate community in Zambia (formerly Northern Rhodesia) and spent most of his childhood there and in Malawi.  In 2011 he founded and became the first Master of New College of the Humanities, an independent undergraduate college in London. Until June 2011, he was Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London, where he taught from 1991. He is also a supernumerary fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford.\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "The mission posted on the March for Science international website states:    \"The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest. The March for Science is a celebration of science.\"\n\nPeter Doherty piece in 'The Conversation': http://theconversation.com/peter-doherty-why-australia-needs-to-march-for-science-76476\n\nTo me, it seems the reason concerned people across the planet are marching today is that, at least for the major players in the English-speaking world, there are major threats to the global culture of science.\n\nWhy? A clear understanding of what is happening with, for example, the atmosphere, oceans and climate creates irreconcilable problems for powerful vested interests, particularly in the fossil fuel and coastal real estate sectors.\n\nContrary to the data-free “neocon/trickle down” belief system, the observed dissonance implies that we need robust, enforceable national and international tax and regulatory structures to drive the necessary innovation and renewal that will ensure global sustainability and a decent future for humanity and other, complex life forms.\n\nHere in Australia, the March for Science joins a global movement initiated by a perceived anti-science stance in Donald Trump’s administration. \n\nhttp://theconversation.com/peter-doherty-why-australia-needs-to-march-for-science-76476\n\nPeter C.

    "title": "José Cordeiro habla sobre el Transhumanismo y la Singularidad Tecnológica",
    "description": "La singularidad tecnológica es el advenimiento hipotético de inteligencia artificial general (también conocida como \"IA fuerte\", del inglés strong AI). La singularidad tecnológica implica que un equipo de cómputo, red informática, o un robot podrían ser capaces de auto-mejorarse recursivamente (rediseño de sí mismo), o en el diseño y construcción de computadoras o robots mejores que él mismo. Se dice que las repeticiones de este ciclo probablemente darían lugar a un efecto fuera de control -una explosión de inteligencia  - donde las máquinas inteligentes podrían diseñar generaciones de máquinas sucesivamente cada vez más potentes, la creación de inteligencia muy superior al control y la capacidad intelectual humana.\n\nEl primer uso del término «singularidad» en este contexto se hizo en 1958 por el matemático y físico húngaro John von Neumann. En 1958, en relación con un resumen de una conversación con von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam describió \"el cada vez más rápido progreso tecnológico y los cambios en el modo de la vida humana, lo que da la apariencia de que se acerca alguna singularidad esencial en la historia de la raza humana más allá de sus propios asuntos tales como los conocemos, no puede seguir\". El término fue popularizado por el matemático, informático y autor de ciencia ficción Vernor Vinge, quien sostiene que la inteligencia artificial, la mejora biológica humana, o interfaces cerebro-ordenador podrían ser las posibles causas de la singularidad. Ray Kurzweil citó el uso de von Neumann del término en un prólogo de von Neumann del clásico The Computer and the Brain.\n\nKurzweil predice que la singularidad ocurrirá alrededor del 2045,6 mientras que Vinge la predice en algún tiempo antes del 2030. En la Cumbre de la Singularidad del 2012, Stuart Armstrong hizo un estudio sobre las predicciones de la inteligencia artificial general (AGI) de los expertos y se encontró una amplia gama de fechas predichas, con un valor medio de 2040. Discutiendo el nivel de incertidumbre en las estimaciones de AGI, dijo Armstrong en 2012, «No es completamente formalizada, pero mi estimación actual del 80 % es algo así como a partir de cinco a 100 años».\n\nSingularida tecnológica: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularidad_tecnol%C3%B3gica\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

Recent policy changes have caused heightened worry among scientists, and the incredible and immediate outpouring of support has made clear that these concerns are also shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter. It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted.\n\nON APRIL 22, 2017, WE WALK OUT OF THE LAB AND INTO THE STREETS.\n\nWe are scientists and science enthusiasts. We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone.\n\nScience is often an arduous process, but it is also thrilling. A universal human curiosity and dogged persistence is the greatest hope for the future. This movement cannot and will not end with a march. Our plans for policy change and community outreach will start with marches worldwide and a teach-in at the National Mall, but it is imperative that we continue to celebrate and defend science at all levels - from local schools to federal agencies - throughout the world.\"\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Speculative ideas for new AI/AGI/Artificial-Life/Artificial-Chemistry development that could be done on top of the OpenCog platform, leveraging OpenCog tools in a novel way.\n\nThese are not necessarily proposed for immediate-term development – we have a lot of other stuff going on, and a lot of stuff that’s half-finished or ¾-finished or more, that needs to be wrapped up and improved, etc.   They are, however, proposed as potentially fundamental enhancements to the OpenCog and PrimeAGI (CogPrime) designs in their current form.\n\nThe core motivation here is to add more self-organizing creativity to the AGI design.   One can view these ideas as extending what MOSES does in the PrimeAGI design – MOSES (at least in its aspirational version) is artificial evolution enhanced by pattern mining and probabilistic reasoning; whereas Cogistry is, very loosely, more like artificial biochemistry similarly enhanced.\n\nhttp://blog.opencog.org/2016/10/25/cogistry-accelerating-algorithmic-chemistry-via-cognitive-synergy/\n\nAlgorithmic Chemistry: A Model for Functional Self-Organization - Walter Fontana\nhttps://www.santafe.edu/research/results/working-papers/algorithmic-chemistry-a-model-for-functional-self-\n\nReplicode: A constructivist programming paradigm and language\nhttp://wiki.humanobs.org/_media/public:publications:replicode.v2.4.rutr-scs13002.pdf\n\nThis talk was part of the Hong Cogathon that was held at Robotics Garage Dec 2016\nhttp://wiki.opencog.org/w/Hong_Cogathon_Dec_2016\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "ECAN is a general term for the way that Attentional dynamics (centrally, the Competition for Attention) is carried out within OpenCogPrime.\n\nEach Atom has an Attention Value attached to it. The process of updating these values is carried out according to nonlinear dynamical equations that are derived based on \"artificial economics,\" utilizing two separate \"currencies,\" one for Short Term Importance (STI) and one for Long Term Importance (LTI).\n\nOne aspect of these equations is a form of Hebbian Learning: Atoms called HebbianLinks record which Atoms were habitually used together in the past, and when it occurred that Atom A's utilization appeared to play a role in causing Atom B's utilization. Then, these HebbianLinks are used to guide the flow of currency between Atoms: B gives A some money if B thinks that this money will help A to get used, and that this utilization will help B to get used.\n\nVery roughly speaking, these dynamical equations play a similar role to that played by activation-spreading in Neural Network AI systems.\n\nThis is an important process because\n\n-    most MindAgents select which Atoms to act upon via a choice function that is biased based on Short Term Importance\n-    the Forgetting MindAgent utilizes \"low Long Term Importance as a criterion for removing Atoms from the AtomTable, thus eliminating them from Long Term Memory (and either deleting them permanently or pushing them to Ultra Long Term Memory).\n\nECAN on the OpenCog wiki: http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Economic_attention_allocation\n\nBen Goertzel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel\n\nHong Cogathon was held at Robotics Garage Dec 2016\nhttp://wiki.opencog.org/w/Hong_Cogathon_Dec_2016\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "There  is  no  strong  reason  to  believe  that  human-level intelligence represents an upper limit of the capacity of artificial intelligence, should it  be  realized.  This  poses  serious  safety  issues,  since  a  superintelligent system  would  have  great  power  to  direct  the  future  according  to  its possibly  flawed  motivation  system.  Solving  this  issue  in  general  has proven to be considerably  harder than expected.  This paper looks at one \nparticular approach, Oracle AI. An Oracle AI is an AI that does not act in the  world  except  by  answering  questions.  Even  this  narrow  approach presents  considerable  challenges.  In  this  paper,  we analyse  and  critique various methods of controlling the AI.  In general an Oracle AI might be safer than unrestricted AI, but still remains potentially dangerous. \nPaper:  http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/oracle.pdf\n\nStuart Armstrong’s research at the Future of Humanity Institute centers on the safety and possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), how to define the potential goals of AI and map humanity’s partially defined values into it, and the long term potential for intelligent life across the reachable universe.

    "description": "Stuart talks about how prediction, how we predict for AI, and how we keep failing - also how to make better predictions. Strong AI will probably be here this century.\n\nAlso see his talk at Winter Intelligence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwULqhOTm34\n\nStuart Armstrong’s research at the Future of Humanity Institute centres on formal decision theory, general existential risk, the risks and possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), assessing expertise and predictions, and anthropic (self-locating) probability.\nhttps://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/team/stuart-armstrong/\n\n\nHow We’re Predicting AI—or Failing To: https://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAI.pdf\nAbstract\nThis paper will look at the various predictions that have been made about AI and pro-pose decomposition schemas for analyzing them. It will propose a variety of theoretical tools for analyzing, judging, and improving these predictions. Focusing specifically on timeline predictions (dates given by which we should expect the creation of AI), it will show that there are strong theoretical grounds to expect predictions to be quite poor in this area. Using a database of 95 AI timeline predictions, it will show that these expectations are borne out in practice: expert predictions contradict each other considerably,\nand are indistinguishable from non-expert predictions and past failed predictions. Predictions that AI lie 15 to 25 years in the future are the most common, from experts and non-experts alike.\n\nSee other interviews with Stuart Armstrong:\nThe Grand Challenge of Beneficial AI: https://youtu.be/INuLGGEhDwY\nPredicting the Timeline of Artificial Intelligence: https://youtu.be/HLW4a2KIeWc\nSmarter Than Us - the Rise of Machine Intelligence: https://youtu.be/RotShnjrmwI\nAI Safety: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI : https://youtu.be/OmtXZ9tZGso\nThe Flawed Turing test: Language, Understanding, and Partial p-Zombies: https://youtu.be/dt9ZUQOvwkc\n\nBootstrapping Intergalactic Colonization - Eternity in 6 Hours: https://youtu.be/0U3sClR6m8s\n\n\n Many thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

From an early age he developed an interest in philosophy, mathematics and science, leading him to compete nationally and internationally in Math and Science Olympiads. At 16 his main interest was mathematics, but a so-called mystical experience made him turn his attention to consciousness and the philosophical problems that it poses. He studied Symbolic Systems (with an Artificial Intelligence concentration) at Stanford, and later finished a masters in computational psychology at the same university. During his time at Stanford he co-founded the Stanford Transhumanist Association and became good friends with David Pearce, taking on the flag of the Hedonistic Imperative. Thus his ongoing interest in the functional, biochemical and quantum substrates of pure bliss. He is currently working at a Natural Language Processing startup in San Francisco, and in his free time he develops psychophysical tools to study the computational properties of consciousness (for more see http://qualiacomputing.com).\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

What will our descendants think of our morals today – will they be weird to future generations?\n\nRelated article (inc transcript): http://www.scifuture.org/narratives-values-progress-anders-sandberg/\n\n\"One of the interesting things about our current world is that we are aware that a lot of ideas about morality are things going on in our culture and in our heads - and are not just the laws of nature - that's very useful.  Some people of course think that there is some ideal or best moral system - and maybe there is - but we're not very good at finding it.  It might turn out that in the long run if there is some kind of ultimate sensible moral - we're going to find it - but that might take a very long time and might take brains much more powerful than ours - it might turn out that all sufficiently advanced alien civilizations eventually figure out the right thing to do - and do it.  But it could also turn out actually when we meet real advanced aliens they're going to be as confused about philosophy as we are - that's one of the interesting things to find out about the universe.\"\n\nPoints covered:\n- Technologies of the Future\n- Efficient sustainability, in-vitro meat\n- Living in an era of awareness of change\n- Values have changed over time\n- Will our morals be weird to future generations?\n- Where is ethics going?\n- Does moral relativism adequately explain reductions in violence?\n- Is there an ideal 'best moral system'? and if so, how do we find it?\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Anders Sandberg discusses solving coordination problems - including discussion on game theory including:the prisoners dilemma (and the iterated form), the tit-for-tat strategy, and reciprocal altruism.  He then discusses politics, and why he considers himself a 'heretical libertarian' - then contrasts the benefits and risks of centralized planning vs distributed trial & error and links this in with discussion on Existential Risk - centralizing very risky projects at the risk of disastrous coordination failures.  He discusses groupthink and what forms of coordination work best.  Finally he emphasises the need for a science of coordination - a multidisciplinary approach including:\n- Philosophy\n- Political Science\n- Economics\n- Game Theory\n\nRelated Article: http://www.scifuture.org/can-we-improve-the-science-of-solving-global-coordination-problems-anders-sandberg/\n\nAnd see the related video on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6G8jkWlXY\n\nFurther reading\nThe Coordination Game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

The models range from conceptual sketches to detailed endogenous growth models, as well as attempts to  fit empirical data to quantitative models. Such models are useful for examining the dynamics of the world-system and possible types of future crisis points where fundamental transitions are likely to occur.  Current models suggest that,  generically,  even  small  increasing  returns  tends  to  produce radical  growth.   If  mental  capital  becomes  copyable (such as would be the case for AI or brain emulation) extremely rapid growth would also become likely.\n\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Anders Sandberg demonstrates how the prisoner's dilemma works - a standard example of game theory that shows why two completely \"rational\" individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so - and contrasts this with the iterated prisoner's dilemma. \n\nThe prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many real world situations involving cooperative behaviour. In casual usage, the label \"prisoner's dilemma\" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it merely difficult or expensive, not necessarily impossible, to coordinate their activities to achieve cooperation.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\n\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Humans have an evolved capacity to learn moral systems - we became more adept at learning moral systems that aided our survival in the ancestral environment - but are our moral instincts fit for the future?\n\nSee full article (inc transcript) here: http://www.scifuture.org/moral-enhancement-are-we-morally-equipped-to-deal-with-humanities-grand-challenges-anders-sandberg/  \n\nWe already use complex social structures and years of education to aid us to be more able to morally function in the complex world - though this world is very different from that of our ancestors.  Can we engineer ourselves to be more fit for our current word and the future?\n\nPeter Singer discussed how our circles of care and compassion have expanded over the years - through reason we have been able to expand our natural propensity to act morally and the circumstances in which we act morally.\n\nWe may need to expand our circle of ethical consideration to include artificial life - to consider software as a moral patient.\n\nSo how do we achieve Moral Enhancement - that's a big topic - and the answers depend on what our goals might be.  One idea (among many others) is to regulate the level of Oxytocin (the cuddle hormone) - though this may come with the drawback of increasing distrust in the out-group.\nAlso Intelligence Enhancement could be an effective  moral enhancement \n\nThe future of Moral Enhancement Therapy will be interesting - it may be needed in order to increase the likelihood that we will as a civilization cooperate and cope with the many complex ethical quandaries involved with unprecedented technological change.\n\n-- Papers:\n\nAnders contributed to this paper 'Neuroenhancement of Love and Marriage: The Chemicals Between Us'.  This paper reviews the evolutionary history and biology of love and marriage. It examines the current and imminent possibilities of biological manipulation of lust, attraction and attachment, so called neuroenhancement of love. We examine the arguments for and against these biological interventions to influence love. We argue that biological interventions offer an important adjunct to psychosocial interventions, especially given the biological limitations inherent in human love.  : http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-007-9002-4\n\nAnders also contributed to the paper “Human Engineering and Climate Change” which argues that cognitive, moral and biological enhancement could increase human ecological sustainability: http://www.smatthewliao.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/HEandClimateChange.htm\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "An unscripted conversation as part of an interview series with Anders Sandberg - It turned out quite interesting.  \n\n\"We have ways of making people go to sleep, and ways of preventing people going to sleep - but that's not nessecarily the best solution.  The best solution is guaranteed 8 hours of sleep.\"\n\n\"[melatonin] Now that's useful because you can reset your diurnal rhythm. Now typically jet-lag is nasty because your brain is out of synch - it's sending signals to the rest of the body on what it's supposed to do that doesn't fit your activity - so everything goes a bit haywire. Melatonins kind of good because it cuts in a reset signal - right now, it's just after midnight.\"\n\n\"The problem is of course that that doesn't nessecarily help you sleep.\"\n\"Sleeping pills shut you down well enough so that you get unconscious at least, but it's not necessarily that you get good sleep - because during sleep your doing memory consolidation among a lot of other things.  So that's an interesting issue that during the day we want to learn things quickly - we need to get a lot of information.  And then we want to store it permenantly but if you learn quickly into your memory, it can erase it quickly too.  So ideally you want to re-write it at a slower rate - you actually want to have a kind of write protection on part of your brain. Now that's probably what's going on during sleep. During deep sleep the hyppocampus can replay what you have learned during the day - especially the stuff that turned out to be important - to the rest of the brain to store it more safely.  And without sleep of course, you're not going to do that very well.\" \n\nAlso there is another section on cognitive enhancers coming soon.\n\nArticle: http://www.scifuture.org/wake-enhancement-is-sleep-better-than-medicine/\n\nSee Anders' page on 'Optimized Sleep': http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Individual/Mental/sleep.html\n\nConsider reading Anders Paper 'Sleep better than medicine? Ethical issues related to “wake enhancement”'\nhttp://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sleep-better-than-medicine.pdf\nAbstract: This paper deals with new pharmacological and technological developments in the manipulation and curtailment of our sleep needs. While humans have used various methods throughout history to lengthen diurnal wakefulness, recent advances have been achieved in manipulating the architecture of the brain states involved in sleep. The progress suggests that we will gradually become able to drastically manipulate our natural sleep-wake cycle. Our goal here is to promote discussion on the desirability and acceptability of enhancing our control over biological sleep, by illustrating various potential attendant ethical problems. We draw attention to the risks involved, possible conflicts of interests underlying the development of wake enhancement, and the potential impact on accountability for fatigue related errors. \n\nMany thanks for watching!\n\nConsider supporting me by:\na) Subscribing to my YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\nb) Donating via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture and/or\nc) Sharing the media I create\n\nKind regards,\nAdam Ford\n- Science, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "title": "The Pitfalls of Pop Science!",
    "description": "Sundance Bilson-Thompson discusses the pitfalls of pop-science and the practicality of scientific literacy.  Discussion points:\n- The value in questioning accepted wisdom\n- popularizing science should not become popularizing argument from authority - accepting information from people dressed in lab coats is not science (see Milgram experiments)\n- Richard Fenymann said \"I'd rather have 1000 unanswered questions than one unquestioned answer\"\n- The central core of science: the iterative process of generating hypothesis, testing, falsification of hypotheses, and the development alternate hypotheses\n\nInterviewers (Adam Ford) personal take on pop science that focuses too much on impact and accessibility rather than simplicity and correctness:\nI have a gripe with much of the science popularization going on.  Einstein said \"Make things as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" Arguably, much of popular science aspires to *accessibility* rather than *simplicity*, which often results in the science communication being just plain wrong. \n\nMuch talk of the Higgs Boson being referred to as the 'God Particle' - it got peoples attention, great click bait, or Intelligent Design advocates wanted to take yet another stab at tying science back to God.  People were left thinking things like 'did we just find evidence for God in physics?'.\nAlso there is a fair amount of talk of immortality - a concept impossible to measure, though it's effective click-bait.  Immortalists refer to 'biological immortality' as being scientific support for the concept of immortality thinking that they will live forever - though 'biological immortality' is misunderstood to mean  something like that if an organism isn't eaten, survives in a friendly environment, have their biological needs for nutrients met then the organism is immortal. They often ignore many of the factors that contribute to senescence (biological aging) - telomere rejuvenation is popular lately, but there is also DNA mutation, oxiditive stress etc (google SENS: Seven Deadly Things for more info). \n\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "I am editing this and reuploading to fix some errors.  Dr Sundance Bilson-Thompson discusses principles of distinguishing science from pseudoscience - referred to as the 'baloney detection kit'.\nMain points:\n1. Reproducibility\n2. Falsifiability\n3. Repeatability\n4. Source Quality\n5. Parsimony\n6. Mechanistic\n\nHe then discusses the relationship between this and the problem of demarcation.\n\nIs scientific progress made through 'paradigm shifts'  OR the accumulation of empirically obtained knowledge?  \n\nExplanatory Value: What makes an explanation useful?\n\nIt's the test that determines what is true or false! \n\n\nSundance Bilson-Thompson's Research focus:\nTopological invariants and particle states in the context of quantum gravity. Our current best attempts to describe the most fundamental physical phenomena are String Theory, which postulates that all particles are tiny vibrating bands of energy which exist in higher dimensions, and Loop Quantum Gravity, which postulates that space and time form a kind of finely-structured mesh rather than a smooth arena through which matter and energy propagate. Dr Bilson-Thompson will be working on the idea that in theories like Loop Quantum Gravity, this \"mesh\" structure of spacetime can naturally include tangles and that these can be classified in such a way that they correspond exactly to the particles (electrons, neutrinos, quarks,...) that matter is made of.\nThis is an exciting project because it suggests that matter may be topological structures built into spacetime itself, rather than a separate type of entity.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

He has developed the idea that certain preon models may be represented topologically, rather than by treating preons as pointlike particles. His ideas have attracted interest in the field of loop quantum gravity, as they may represent a way of incorporating the Standard Model into loop quantum gravity. This would make loop quantum gravity a candidate theory of everything. At the time he was a Visiting Academic at the University of Adelaide. From 2006 to 2009 he was a full-time academic at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

    "description": "Bill Gates is excited about the rise of artificial intelligence but acknowledged the arrival of machines with greater-than-human capabilities will create some unique challenges.\n\nAfter years of working on the building blocks of speech recognition and computer vision, Gates said enough progress has been made to ensure that in the next 10 years there will be robots to do tasks like driving and warehouse work as well as machines that can outpace humans in certain areas of knowledge.\n\n\"The dream is finally arriving,\" Gates said, speaking with wife Melinda Gates on Wednesday at the Code Conference. \"This is what it was all leading up to.\"\n\nHowever, as he said in an interview with Recode last year, such machine capabilities will pose two big problems.\n\nThe first is, it will eliminate a lot of existing types of jobs. Gates said that creates a need for a lot of retraining but notes that until schools have class sizes under 10 and people can retire at a reasonable age and take ample vacation, he isn't worried about a lack of need for human labor.\n\nThe second issue is, of course, making sure humans remain in control of the machines. Gates has talked about that in the past, saying that he plans to spend time with people who have ideas on how to address that issue, noting work being done at Stanford, among other places.\n\nAnd, in Gatesian fashion, he suggested a pair of books that people should read, including Nick Bostrom's book on superintelligence and Pedro Domingos' \"The Master Algorithm.\"\n\nMelinda Gates noted that you can tell a lot about where her husband's interest is by the books he has been reading. \"There have been a lot of AI books,\" she said.\n\nhttp://www.recode.net/2016/6/1/11833340/bill-gates-ai-artificial-intelligence\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

Though algorithms have been around long before computers - though used to involve in far more human input than they do today.\n\n\ncentral thesis: That the increase in algorithm-based decision making poses a threat to the legitimacy of our political and legal system. The threat in question is relatively unique (due to its technological basis) and difficult to resist and accommodate.\n\n1. What is 'algocracy'? Broadly speaking, to me 'algocracy' is the phenomenon whereby algorithms takeover public decision-making systems. More precisely, the term 'algocracy' can be used to describe decision-making systems in which computer-coded algorithms structure and constrain the way in which human beings interact with these decision-making processes (see, generally, Aneesh 2009). There are many different possible algocratic systems. I focus on algocratic systems made possible by the rise of big data, the internet of things, surveillance, data-mining and predictive analytics.\n2. What is the 'threat of algocracy'?  Public decision-making processes ought to be legitimate. Most people take this to mean that the processes should satisfy a number of proceduralist and instrumentalist conditions. In other words, the processes should be fair and transparent whilst at the same time achieving good outcomes. The problem with algocratic systems is that they tend to favour good outcomes over transparency and fairness. This is the threat they pose to political legitimacy.\n3. Can we (or should we) resist the threat? I argue that it is difficult to resist the threat of algocracy (i.e. to dismantle or block the creation of algocratic systems) due to the ubiquity of the technology and the strength of the political and economic forces favouring the creation of algocratic systems. I also argue that, in many cases, it may not be morally desirable to dismantle or block the creation of such systems.\n4. Can we accommodate the threat?

    "description": "John Daley, the Chief Executive Officer of the Grattan Institute, an independent think tank in Australia. Daley discussed how and why government doesn’t leave room for effective altruism and where and how EA can be useful. Government, he said, isn’t very good at identifying local issues, it doesn’t like change, and politicians are increasingly reactive to media pressures. EA can shake things up by advocating for policy change that is in the public interest.\n\nUnfortunately, identifying such issues is harder than most people realise. People, Daley said, are full of opinions, but not data and analysis. Governments can be influenced, but it takes a lot of high-quality work. Policy reform is a long, slow, tedious process that requires a lot of time and a lot of money.\nhttp://magickly.com/effective-altruism/\n\nAlso see John Daley's bio at The Conversation: https://theconversation.com/profiles/john-daley-1870\n\n\n\nJohn Daley is the CEO of Grattan Institute, which conducts independent, rigorous and practical analysis of Australian public policy. John's work at Grattan Institute has focused on budget, tax, and economic reform policy. He is a consistent advocate of the importance of government prioritisation.\n\nJohn Daley has 25 years experience at the intersection of the public sector, private enterprise, and academia. His diverse background includes law, finance, education, and workers compensation.\n\nPrevious roles include the University of Melbourne, the University of Oxford, the Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet, consulting firm McKinsey and Co, and most recently ANZ where he was Managing Director of the online stockbroker, E*TRADE Australia.\n\nJohn has a DPhil in Public Law from the University of Oxford, and degrees in Law and Science from the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "title": "Jamais Cascio - Global Catastrophic Risks",
    "description": "Jamais Cascio, who blogs at Open the Future discusses Global Catastrophic Risks: http://www.scifuture.org/?p=3711\n\nWe are surrounded by catastrophic existential risks – you know, personally, societally, civilizationally. The intriguing thing about them is that the chance of any one of the happening is extremely slim. So very low likelihood, very significant results. Yet there is a non-zero chance that at the end of this sentence a meteor will come down and strike me in the head. It didn’t happen, but it could – there is no physical reason why it wouldn’t and given enough time eventually something will happen.\nSo we face – We are dealing with existential risks, catastrophic, globally & civilizationally catastrophic risks all the time and it’s easy to ignore them. The problem – the dilemma – is when you have a slight uptake in the the likelihood of a catastrophic risk.\nNASA has a risk scale for the likelihood of an asteroid impact that would and the damage that it would produce – we’ve never gotten above essentially a level 1 risk – out of 10 – at least since they started taking measurements. There has been a couple of times when the likelihood of this happening has gotten up to – I think the highest we ever got was a temporary 4 – but were pretty likely that this level of risk isn’t going to be maintained. But we have these metrics of deciding – ok these risks are plausible – how can we contextualize them? So we do that with telling stories.\nWe deal with catastrophic risks by creating mythologies – and what the mythologies do – mythologies here count as making movies or writing novels or engaging in speculative conversations.. and playing with toys.\nWe craft the mythologies as a way of understanding how these catastrophic events could play out, and more importantly, how humans respond to catastrophe.\nSo you know, recently there was a movie called “San Andreas” starring ‘The Rock’ – scientifically terrible – but ultimately it was a story about ‘how do humans respond to seeing each other in mortal terror? in mortal peril?’ and ‘how do we try to help each other?’ – and that I think becomes a really important ‘pedagogy of catastrophe’. It’s not about understanding the details of every possible dooms day scenario – it’s about understanding what our options are for helping each other afterwards, or helping each other avoid the catastrophe. And – I think all to often, especially the world of science/scifi/foresight, there’s kind of a dismissal of those kinds of ‘soft narratives’ “they’re not scientifically accurate therefore we can ignore them”. But I think we ignore them at our peril – because those are the stories that we viscerally, we as a human society viscerally respond to. We are driven by emotion, we are driven by empathy – and intelligence a way of contextualizing why we feel things – what our relationship is to things that we have emotional connections with. Allowing us to continue to have – our intelligence allows us to continue to have and maintain persistent emotional connections.\n\n\nCascio gave the closing talk at GCR08, a Mountain View conference on Global Catastrophic Risks. Titled \"Uncertainty, Complexity and Taking Action,\" the discussion focused on the challenges inherent in planning against future disasters emerging as the result of global-scale change: https://vimeo.com/2712394\nhttp://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/eventinfo/ieet20081114/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "\"The claim that robots are taking our jobs has become so commonplace of late that it's a bit of a cliché. Nonetheless, it has a strong element of truth to it. Not only are machines taking \"blue collar\" factory jobs -- a process that's been underway for years, and no longer much of a surprise except when a company like Foxconn announces it's going to bring in a million robots (which are less likely to commit suicide, apparently) -- but now mechanized/digital systems are quickly working their way up the employment value chain. \"Grey collar\" service workers have been under pressure for awhile, especially those jobs (like travel agent) that involve pattern-matching; now jobs involving the composition of structured reports (such as basic journalism) have digital competition, and Google's self-driving car portends a future of driverless taxicabs. But even \"white collar\" jobs, managerial and supervisory in particular, are being threatened -- in part due to replacement, and in part due to declining necessity. After all, if the line workers have been replaced by machines, there's little need for direct human oversight of the kind required by human workers, no? Stories of digital lawyers and surgeons simply accelerate the perception that robots really are taking over the workplace, and online education systems like the Khan Academy demonstrate how readily university-level learning can be conducted without direct human contact.\n\nWith advanced 3D printers and more adaptive robotic and computer systems on the near horizon, it's easy to see that this trend will only continue.\n\nExcept for one arena, that is, and it's a pretty interesting one. Jobs where empathy and \"emotional intelligence\" can be considered requirements, often personal service and \"high touch\" interactive positions, have by and large been immune to the creeping mechanization of the workplace. And here's the twist: most of these empathy-driven jobs are performed by women....\" \n- See more at: http://www.openthefuture.com/2012/05/the_pink_collar_future.html\n\nAlso see: 'Three Possible Economic Models' http://www.fastcompany.com/1334602/three-possible-economic-models-part-1\n\nhttp://www.usbig.net/whatisbig.php\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Now that Google DeepMind's AlphaGo has beaten Go grand-master Lee Se-dol - what will it be tasked with next?  How did AlphaGo become such a powerful game playing AI so quickly? The improvement was largely down to the fact that the more AlphaGo plays, the better it gets, says Miles Brundage, a social scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, who studies trends in AI. AlphaGo uses cognitive architectures (Neural Nets), in which connections between layers of simulated neurons strengthen on the basis of experience. It learned by first studying 30 million Go positions from human games and then improving by playing itself over and over again, a technique known as reinforcement learning. Then, DeepMind combined AlphaGo’s ability to recognize successful board configurations with a ‘look-ahead search’, in which it explores the consequences of playing promising moves and uses that to decide which one to pick.\n\nMiles' talk at Winter Intelligence 2012: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJSVr5SEgI\n\n#AI #AGI #DeepLearning  #MilesBrundage #FHI\n\nWhat Google’s winning Go algorithm will do next?\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/what-google-s-winning-go-algorithm-will-do-next-1.19573",

Though he is usually not someone to jump at a chance to apply the precautionary principle, he thinks this is one case that warrants it.\n\nLongevity may increase peoples tendency to be thoughtful about the future - imagine a decade to think about the ramifications of a certain action (or inaction).  \"If we have more ability to think about the consequences of our actions, we have a greater ability not just to see the future, but to see ourselves in the future.\"\nSince we evolved to think about our immediate relations, we are somewhat selfish - living a long time might cause us to be more concerned about the future and those in it.\n\n\"I believe that one of the benefits of radical life-extension will be the radical expansion of our sense of time - our presence in time\"\nMany thanks for watching!\n\n\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

It can be used to essentially translate the legalities of a contract into a self-executing algorithm - quite interesting implications for micro-payments  etc\n- Asteroid 3: The End of Advertising - go adblock!  increasing support in handheld devices like iphone6 to block certain content\n- Asteroid 4: Digital = Hackable  - social and economic hacking possible as a result of expanded use of digital technology\n- Asteroid 5: The Transformation of Labor - many manifestations: \n  - Gig economy - moment by moment task based jobs with shaky future, people can be easily swapped out for cheaper options\n  - Semi-automatic labor - both customers and machines doing the labor (ATMs + customers replace bank tellers, automated supermarket checkouts + customers replace checkout staff) - where the end user supplies the input that a computer can't yet do easily\n \nBecause of the rise of automation we have a dilemma - how do you a) increase efficiency, while b) maintain a livable lifestyle when you don't have reliable jobs? \n\nPerhaps the most difficult human trait for machines to replace is empathy - the kinds of jobs that have sometimes been considered to be less critical (often done by women).  \n\n\"How do we deal with a world where the kinds of jobs that have been historically good strong middle class jobs are increasingly easy to automate ... and the kinds of jobs that persist have historically not been given respect?\" - Jamais Cascio\n\n\n\n\n@cascio\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

Put your seat-belts on - we are in for a wild ride!\n\nFuture Day is on March 1st, and Jose is organising a future day in Venezuala: https://www.facebook.com/events/1568721653419212\n\nMr. Cordeiro studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, USA, where he received his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and Master of Science (M.Sc.) degrees in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Economics and Languages. His thesis consisted of a dynamic modeling for NASA’s “Freedom” Space Station (the “International” Space Station of today). He later studied International Economics and Comparative Politics at Georgetown University in Washington, USA, and then obtained his Masters of Business Administration (MBA) at the Institut Européen d’Administration des Affaires (INSEAD) in Fontainebleau, France, where he majored in Finance and Globalization. During his studies, Mr. Cordeiro worked with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Vienna, Austria, and with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC, USA. He started his doctoral degree at MIT, which he continued later in Tokyo, Japan, and finally received his PhD at Universidad Simón Bolívar (USB) in Caracas, Venezuela. He is a lifetime member of the Sigma Xi (ΣΞ, Scientific Research) and Tau Beta Pi (ТΒΠ, Engineering) Honor Societies in North America, is also a honorary member of the Venezuelan Engineers College (CIV), and his name has been included in the Marquis Edition of Who’s Who in the World.\n \nFollowing his graduation, Mr. Cordeiro worked as an engineer in petroleum exploration for the French company Schlumberger. For several years, he served as an advisor for many of the major oil companies in the world, including Agip, BP, ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, PDVSA, Pemex, Petrobras, Repsol, Shell and Total. Later, in Paris, he initiated his relation with the international consulting company Booz-Allen & Hamilton, where he specialized in the areas of strategy, finance and restructuring. In Latin America, he has served as an advisor for some of the most important regional corporations and has taken part in the transformation and privatization of a number of oil companies in the continent. His experience and studies in monetary policy, currency boards, dollarization and monetary unions have taken him to participate in several monetary changes in Latin America and Eastern Europe.",

Might be able to estimate ruff orders of magnitude of how effective X would be.  Where Give Well is focused on easier to quantify outcomes. \nTyler uses diagrams to discuss the Cause Prioritization exercise of keeping three metrics in mind: Tractability, Scale and Neglectedness.  Interestingly he uses diagrams to help illustrate this!\n\nQuote from interview: \"Effective altruism is unusual in terms of social and intellectual movements, in that it's much more like the Enlightenment or the scientific revolution rather than, say, the climate-change movement or the anti-HIV movement. And the reason is that it's much more based around a process.\n\nSo, science isn't actually just a bunch of facts and it's not an end. It's rather a process by which you continue improving your state of knowledge. And similarly effective altruism is this process of first trying to figure out how do I do the most good, and then doing it.\"\n-- Tyler Alterman\n*Thanks to Timo Timo for highlighting this quote\n\nTyler Alterman is the director of growth at the Centre for Effective Altruism - a think tank based at Oxford University:  https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org\nAlso he is President at Effective Altruism Global - a conference series (Also EAGx) : http://eaglobal.org\n\nResources:\n'13 articles that will change your life' by Tyler Alterman: https://medium.com/@tyleralterman/the-full-crazy-these-13-articles-will-change-your-life-a5d736eca913#.h3cc6aamm\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\nGive Well: http://www.givewell.org\nOpen Philanthropy Project: http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\nTyler discussed the flowchart on 'How can we help the world?': http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/09/flowhart/\nEffective Career Choice - 80,000 Hours: https://80000hours.org/\nBook: 'Stumbling upon happiness' by Daniel Gilbert : http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427  (in reference to the discussion about following one's passion)\nThe Pareto Fellowship: http://paretofellowship.org/",

After five years they have been unable to meet our prize requirements even when their methods were tested (by a third party) under ideal laboratory conditions. Out of respect for loved ones I will not comment on any particular case, but it is clear from online case reports that their actual results are often far worse than the laboratory prepared tissue we imaged. Speaking personally, I wish that all such companies would stop offering services until, at a minimum, they demonstrate in an animal model that their methods and procedures are effective at preserving ultrastructure across the entire brain.

JFRC is perhaps the leading research institution in the field of connectomics in the United States. At JFRC, Hayworth is currently researching ways to extend Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIBSEM) imaging of brain tissue to encompass much larger volumes than are currently possible. For an overview of this work see his recent review paper and online presentation. Prior to moving to JFRC, Hayworth was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University. Hayworth is co-inventor of the Tape-to-SEM process for high-throughput volume imaging of neural circuits at the nanometer scale and he designed and built several automated machines to implement this process. Hayworth received a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Southern California for research into how the human visual system encodes spatial relations among objects. Hayworth is a vocal advocate for brain preservation and mind uploading and a co-founder of the Brain Preservation Foundation which calls for the implementation of an emergency glutaraldehyde perfusion procedure in hospitals, and for the development of a whole brain embedding procedure which can demonstrate perfect ultrastructure preservation across an entire human brain.",

    "description": "Andrew Baron discusses Connectomics - mapping and modelling  neural structures based on the connections between neurons in blocks of tissue.  \n-- So - what's so exciting about Connectomics?\n\"What's exciting about connectomics is that until very recently the kinds of projects that were being proposed were impossible - so we were limited to having to - in a very mechanical way - sextain and section blocks of tissue and then draw the neurons in each block and then painstakingly reconstruct each slice to reconstruct a three dimensional picture.  Thanks to new advances in computing and imaging we are making enormous strides automating that.  Now the connectome is important - it gives you the architecture of possible links between neurons - that is a very very important piece of information if you want to model neural circuits.\"\n\"I think people who bang connectomics misunderstand it as 'knowing a connectome will tell you how the circuit works' - that's absolutely not the case.  But equally you cannot really understand a connectome unless you have at least a partial sense of how neurons are connected.  Certainly knowing how neurons are connected is not everything - it won't tell you how the brain works if you simply know what neurons are connected to what.\"\n\n --  Are we our connectome?\n\"I would not say that 'we are our connectome' - the connectome is simply the physical connections between cells which may or may not be active.  The extent level and level of activity and the rate of change in the patterns of activity is far more informative of what we are than the simple structure of the connectome itself....\"\n\n --  Cryonics - will it work?\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "What technologies will have high impact in the future?\nSee transcription: http://www.scifuture.org/high-impact-technologies-with-andrew-barron/\n\nAndrew Barron: I think what we are seeing at the moment - and we are seeing it quite rapidly - is the fusion of the biological sciences and the information sciences period - so it goes beyond AI.\nWe're seeing a capacity to manipulate and rewrite genomes - again we are actually need an involvement of an AI to do that properly - but we really are truly seeing a fusion of the biological and information sciences which is opening absolutely transformative technologies - that we probably can't quite properly predict or name currently - but I imagine that the future would see explosive growth in this area and the emergence disciplines that we can't even imagine currently.\nYep.. exactly... exactly - so new capacities to manipulate genomes - and equally we are getting much smarter about the risks of that and much more careful with that - but we are realizing also that the genome itself is highly self-organized and massively data-heavy - and yet this fusion of biology and information sciences is liberating entirely new disciplines - and it's happening at such a pace.  I mean, just in terms of my life as a scientist - we've gone from - when I was at school we were told that the human genome was impossible - informatically impossible - there would never be enough computing power in the world to sequence the human genome.  Now we're sequencing genomes for just over $1000 very very quickly and easily - our challenge now is to be intelligent in what to do with that data.\nWhat's interesting about the iPhone is not the technology itself - it's the way that it has changed human behaviour.  So we've suddenly adapted very very very rapidly to a carryable device that enables us to have immediate communication / immediate access to databases and reference libraries - and their capacity to store endless amounts of images if we choose to do so - and we've adapted to that seamlessly - to a point when people feel lost and panic if their phone is broken or is taken away from them.  That's the more interesting interesting impact of the iPhone - and I think what that says is that we're going to see humans adapt very quickly easily to other forms of wearable or insert-able technologies - I think we've shown by the iPhone example that we have a capacity embrace that kind of change - if it offers convenience and ease and improves our connectivity and quality of life.\nIn terms of technology though I think that the biggest strides will come from biological - there is research that fuses biology and technology - I think that we are on the cusp of that - the more interesting technological changes will come not through simple technology - but by an understanding of how our brains work - by understanding the human brain.  If we can actually crack that and then interface that with technology - that will get completely transformative technological solutions.\nSo in the far future could we see humans being a mixture of technology and organic solutions - and would be basically see a re-imagining of humanity - in a far future?  Again I see no reason why not in a far future.\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_cente...\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "The humble honey bee with a brain the size of a sesame seed solves complex navigational challenges incredibly well - understanding the brain of a honey bee, being a simpler system to understand than a mammalian brain (let alone a human brain), will be of huge value in understanding the larger more complex systems. In this video, Associate Professor Andrew Barron discusses why: \"This is a particularly exciting time to be involved in Neuroscience - I think that were seeing an explosion of possibility.  There was a while when we were limited by the experimental techniques and that limited the amount of data that we could gather.  We are now in a new situation that if anything we are more capable of generating data than we know what to do with.  It means that questions of really broad scope can be addressed now - we are limited more by our capacity to imagine what we can do with the data than our capacity to generate the data - and that's what makes it particularly exciting.\"\n\nAssociate Professor Andrew Barron's Bio: http://bio.mq.edu.au/research/groups/cognitive-neuroethology/dr-andrew-barron/\n\n- Emergence in Neuroscience\n- SWARM INTELLIGENCE\n\n- Neuroscience Studying the Honeybey - a useful point of reflection and a possible prototype for a study of a more complex (i.e. mamalian) mind - the honey bee can solve survival problems as successfully as other species with larger brains. \n\n- Distributed Cognition\n- OFFLOADING COGNITION ONTO THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n\nWow: fun info - honey bee genome is more similar to a human genome than to a dresophela genome - convergent evolution?\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Jacy Reece discusses reducing suffering in animals and Animal Charity Evaluators.\nWe also discussed his recent Vox article on reducing animal suffering in the wild found here \"Wild animals endure illness, injury, and starvation. We should help.\" : https://www.vox.com/2015/12/14/9873012/wild-animals-suffering\n\nAudio of interview here: https://archive.org/details/AnimalCharityEvaluatorsWithJacyReese\n\nAnimal Charity Evaluators is a 501(c)(3) non-profit located in the United States. Our mission is to find and promote the most effective ways to help animals. We do this by analyzing research on methods of helping animals in order to provide research of interventions and top-charity recommendations. We offer suggestions on being a more effective animal advocate by providing career, charity, and volunteering advice, and also plan on working with other organizations to help them conduct their own research. You can find a more detailed explanation of our philosophy as an organization in our Position Statement.\n\nACE website: http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org\n\nTopics discussed:\n - Brief Introduction to who you are, and why you got involved in ACE\n - What drives your passion?  where does your energy for ACE come from?\n - What kinds of philosophy guide your views on animal suffering? \n - Animal Charity Evaluators - what do they do? and why?\n - The broadly consequentialist approach that ACE takes in evaluating animal charities\n      a) Is animal advocacy an effective cause area?\n      b) Which part of animal advocacy should we focus on?\n      c) What are some top charities that deal with animal advocacy?\n      d) What can we do about the problem of animal suffering?\n - What is most distressing to you about animal suffering?   (from an intuitive perspective and from a philosophical/analytical perspective?  is it suffering involved while animals are alive, and/or the lack of positive experience / loss of potential flourishing / life years?  (i.e. male chicks killed early on in life))\n - Is the problem of animal suffering being solved?  \n - What are your thoughts on Peter Singer’s idea of the expanding circle of ethical consideration?  and Stephen Pinker’s extension to this idea in his book Better Angels of Our Nature?\n - What do we really need to do to keep the circle of ethical consideration expanding?\n - When you see a video of male chicks being ground down or pigs being slaughtered one can get a gut reaction - but it’s hard to know how much suffering is involved.  Without a complete picture of suffering and it’s neural correlates in animals it is hard to make exact judgements as to how much suffering is involved in factory farming.  Though I'm more comfortable with overcompensating in reducing possible suffering than to do nothing but wait until there is a complete picture of suffering. so - what are some good ways to measure suffering in animals?  \n - How cautious should we be in relation to reducing animal suffering?\n - What can we do to have clearer vision into what entails suffering in animals today, and in the future?\n - Is there some kind of morally equivalency in donating money to ACE approved charities (in offsetting one’s own meat consumption) to going vegetarian or vegan? (like carbon offsetting?)\n - In relation between speciesism and other isms like racism and sexism - what aspects of other rights movement can we import into the animal rights movement?\n - How do we evaluate whether to give to a charity to reduce human suffering vs various non-human animal suffering?\n - How does ACE go about evaluating the difference between different animal charities?  \n - What are your thoughts on experimental interventions to reduce animal suffering - i.e. the Non-human Rights Project, artificial meat etc?\n - Is it ok that suffering happens in the wild? (naturalistic fallacy)\n - In an article on motherboard, the debate is tinged with negative character traits (‘narcissism’, ‘hubris’ etc) aimed at those who are looking at reducing suffering in the wild  - there seems like a fair bit of caricaturing going on here - how can this add to the debate?\n\n== Questions from Brian Tomasik\n- What's your probability that aggregate wild-animal experiences are positive on balance?\n- Thoughts on the sign of the expected value of the far future, AI safety, etc.\n- How to trade off short-term helping vs. far-future impact and how much to discount the far future for reasons of uncertainty, anthropics, etc.\n\n#EffectiveAltruism #Ethics #AnimalAdvocacy #JacyReese #AnimalCharityEvaluators",

    "description": "Hilary Greaves discusses effective altruism, population ethics and existential risk in this interview held between sessions at the Effective Altruism Global Melbourne confenrence in 2015\n\nPopulation ethics is the philosophical study of the ethical problems concerning populations. It is also sometimes called population axiology, which is \"the theory of when one state of affairs is better than another, where the states of affairs may differ over the number of people who ever live\". (See 'Population Ethics, Aggregate Welfare, and the Repugnant Conclusion' http://www.repugnant-conclusion.com/index.html ) \nIt deals with the special problems that arise when actions or policies cannot be said to affect individual persons but merely to substitute one group of people with another. Such problems usually only arise when our actions affect future generations.\n\n“Most discussion in population ethics has concentrated on how to evaluate populations in regard to their goodness, that is, how to order populations by the relations “is better than” and “is as good as”. This field has been riddled with paradoxes which purport to show that our considered beliefs are inconsistent in cases where the number of people and their welfare varies.” - see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion\n\nPopulation ethics is especially important when making large-scale decisions like those regarding climate policy.\n\nSee 'Population Ethics: Theory and Practice.

    "description": "A view from Moral Psychology.\nWhat have we learned from an empirical approach to moral psychology?  Especially in relation to the role of rationality in most every day morality.  What are some lessons that the EA movement can take from moral psychology?\nVarious moral theorists over the years have had different emphasis on the roles that the head and heart play in moral judgement.  Early conceptions of the role of the head in morality were that it drives moral judgement.  A Kantian might say that the head/reasoning drives moral judgement - when presented with a dillema of some kind, the human engages with 'system 2' like processes in a controlled rational nature.  An advocate of a Humean model may favor the idea that emotion or the heart ('system 1' thinking) plays the dominant role in moral judgement.  Modern psychologists often take a hybrid model where both system 1 and system 2 styles of thinking are at play in contributing to the way we judge right from wrong.\n\n\nArtice: http://www.scifuture.org/?p=3381\n\nSimon Laham is a senior lecturer in the psychology department at Melbourne University.  He has worked over the last 8 years on the psychology of morality from the point of view of experimental social psychology. \n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Studies of the nature of life, evolutionary epistemology, anthropology and history of technology leads me reluctantly to the conclusion that Moore’s Law is taking us towards some kind of post-human singularity. The presentation explores fundamental aspects of life and knowledge, based on a fusion of Karl Popper’s (1972) evolutionary epistemology and Maturana and Varela’s (1980) autopoietic theory of life to show that knowledge and life must co-evolve, and that this co-evolution leads to exponential growth of knowledge and capabilities to control a planet (and the Universe???). The initial pace, based on changes to genetic heredity, is geologically slow. The addition of the capacity of living cognition for cultural heredity, changes the pace of significant change from millions of years, to millennia. Externalization of cultural knowledge to writing and printing increases the pace to centuries and decades. Networking virtual cultural knowledge at light speed via the internet, increases the pace to years or even months. In my lifetime I have seen the first generation digital computers evolve into the Global Brain.\n\nArticle: http://www.scifuture.org/life-knowledge-and-natural-selection-co-evolution-of-cognition-and-tools-leads-to-a-singularity-bill-hall/\n\n\n\nPlaylist of talks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7qI6NZpO3sQrI2S8nmhVKYcAFmm2UTh\n\nProgram: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806044711/http://2014.scifuture.org/program/\nRecorded at the Philosophy of Science conference in Melbourne 2014: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806044711/http://2014.scifuture.org\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

Pseudosciences have little in common but their negation: they are not science.\nThey reject meaningful empirical assessment in some way or another. Popper proposed a clear demarcation criterion for Science v Rubbish: Falsifiability. However, his criterion has not stood the test of time.

    "title": "Philosophy of Science - Skepticism & Science  -  Scifuture 2014",
    "description": "Panelists: Terry Kelly (Former president of Vic Skeptics),  Chris Guest (Current president of Vic Skeptics), Bill Hall (Researcher at the Kororoit Institute)  -  Article: http://www.scifuture.org/?p=3171\nDiscussion includes the history of skepticism, what skepticism is today, the culture of skepticism as a movement and how skepticism relates to broader philosophy.\n\n00:26 Terry discusses Active Skepticism - Where Science, Skepticism & Consumer wrights overlap,  - he brings up hypnotism\n\n01:26 Skepticism does not equal cynicism - including some cool observations about the difference between the empiricism and the plausibility argument.  The issue of plausibility vs empiricism - some issues might seem implausible... some things are so implausible they have to be addressed in that way... but some people bring up the argument that some things may seem counter-intuitive - but end up being likely after empirical observation.\n\n04:14 Chris Guest - Discusses passion about critical thinking - it's not so much what skeptics believe, it's the approach to arguments -\n\n04:42 Historical definitions of skepticism - relating to cynicism (ancient greeks).  Though skepticism is not considered cynicism today, ideally they are treated as separate concepts - there are a lot of magicians in the skeptics movement - they have a trained eye - intuitively see past common blind spots and cognitive biases - whereas scientists often take things on face value.\n\n06:22 Bill Hall discusses his background in Popperianism - and pseudoscience and belief vs rational thinking (NOTE: Contrast with Kevin Korb's presentation on Pseudoscience vs Science - Kevin isn't a Popperian and thinks that falsificationism is flawed).  The demarcation problem between science and mysticism.   Bill says falsification is part of skepticism - part of debunking false claims.\n\n08:55 Chris Guest discusses group dynamics and belief systems - people reinforce each others beliefs - so Chris tries to be tougher on people they agree with than those whom he disagrees with demanding a higher standard of argument.   Straw man arguments - where someone sets up a really bad representation of an opponents arguments rather than going into the specifics of the opponents arguments.   Steel Man arguments - kind of the opposite of straw man arguments - rather than trying to create a refutable form of the opponents arguments, try to put together the best possible representation of their arguments, even better than the one they are presenting to you - take on the best possible, most charitable arguments.   Value in moving beyond conflicts based on group identity. \n\n11:00 Terry Kelly discusses disproving a persons beliefs - though this often results in them going away and believing harder than before.  Ashley Barnett brought up an example earlier that intelligent people are easier to fool because they had stronger attention - James Randi says academics are easier to fool because they belief if they can't work it out, since they are so smart then it must be a special power.   Intelligent people will find smart ways to justify their rational beliefs.  So sometimes it's not so easy to change peoples minds even though you have good evidence.\n\n\n14:36 Chris Guest discusses approaches to debating climate change deniers - using existing models that make predictions find out what assumptions the climate change deniers disagree with, and ask for an alternative model that gives better predictions.   Then the deniers might claim that the climate alarmists get more funding to create the models as an explanation to why they have the more robust models. \n\n15:35 Q: How people asses the nature of evidence? \nChris Guest: Instead of going head to head with someone who believes in homeopathy, say 'let's go to a homeopathy open day and listen to the talks' - then let people go through their own process of discovery.\n\n\n17:37 How people become rational - how do people go from magical thinking to being rational?  Turning point or slowly drift into it?\n\n\nAcoustics made it difficult to hear people asking questions\n\n\"Where skeptics get interested is whether people are getting what they paid for\" - Terry Kelly\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "title": "Justin Oakley - Virtue Ethics & Effective Altruism   EA Global Melbourne 2015",
    "description": "After briefly outlining virtue ethics, Justin explains how virtue ethics can support effective altruism as an expression of what Aristotle called the virtue of ‘liberality’ (sometimes translated as generosity). A person who has the virtue of liberality “does not value wealth for its own sake”, and “will refrain from giving to anybody and everybody, that he may have something to give to the right people, at the right time.” This virtue also involves acting from the right motives, “with pleasure or without pain”. So, virtuous giving, for Aristotle, involves giving with both the head and the heart. Justin also explains how effective altruism is supported by the Aristotelian virtue of justice.   However, there are a great variety of virtuous ways of giving, and Justin argues that it is important that effective altruism does not lead to other forms of helping, such as family care-giving to a frail and elderly relative, being undervalued. \n\nJustin also talks about how ethical career choices can justifiably make allowances for personal fulfillment and self-realisation, even where one’s career choice is not the most effective way of being altruistic. Here Justin draws on the commentary he gave on Will MacAskill’s paper on the ethics of career choice, at the 2012 UK Society for Applied Philosophy Conference in Oxford.\n\n In closing, Justin briefly suggests that it need not be unethical for two people to start a long-term relationship which is likely to result in their being a less 'optimal team' for the world, compared with the relationships that each of them might have formed with others.\n\nSlides here : https://www.slideshare.net/adam_ford/justin-oakley-virtue-ethics-and-effective-altruism-ea-global-melbourne-2015\n\n\n---\n\nJustin Oakley discusses Effective Altruism from the perspective of a Virtue Ethicist and the way that Virtue Ethics could endorse at least some of the ideas in EA.  Justin then speaks about Aristotle and his key ideas which influenced modern Virtue Ethics.  Justin compares a Virtue Ethicist approach to the Utilitarian approach to ethics and Effective Altruism.\n\nJustin Oakley BA, PhD (Philosophy) is Associate Professor at Monash University Centre for Human Bioethics. He is the author of Morality and the Emotions (Routledge, 1993), and Virtue Ethics and Professional Roles (with Dean Cocking) (Cambridge University Press, 2001), and is editor of Informed Consent and Clinician Accountability: The ethics of report cards on surgeon performance (with Steve Clarke) (Cambridge University Press, 2007), and Bioethics (Ashgate, International Library of Essays in Public and Professional Ethics, 2009). He has published articles in international journals on the ethics of clinical trials, informed consent, surrogate motherhood, surgeon report cards, whistleblowing, reproductive cloning, and various topics in ethical theory. Justin is also co-editor of the quarterly refereed journal Monash Bioethics Review.\n    Justin teaches clinicians and other professionals in the Master of Bioethics course at Monash, along with an undergraduate philosophy subject on the moral psychology of evil. He is currently working on a project on policy applications of virtue ethics in medical practice, and a project on the moral significance of genetic parenthood and the regulation of assisted reproduction.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "title": "Peter Singer - Non-Human Animal Ethics - EA Global Melbourne 2015",
    "description": "Peter Singer discusses moral value of non-human animals - the history of moral progress around equality of human animals and how we ought to treat animals - from Judaism & Christianity to Aristotle to Bentham (father of modern utilitarianism).  Singer highlights Benthan's view that the capacity for suffering/joy is the vital characteristic that entitles a being to moral consideration.  He discusses why we should take non-human animal suffering seriously and what we can do to alleviate the suffering of non-human animals.\n\nSlides are here: https://www.slideshare.net/adam_ford/peter-singer-nonhuman-animal-ethics-ea-global-melbourne-2015\n\nAnimal Liberation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_%28book%29\n\nPeter paper 'SPECIESISM AND MORAL STATUS' where he convincingly rejects Speciesism: http://www.oswego.edu/~delancey/Singer.pdf\nAbstract: \"Many people believe that all human life is of equal value. Most of them also believe that all human beings have a moral status superior to that of nonhuman animals. But how are these beliefs to be defended? The mere difference of species cannot in itself determine moral status. The most obvious candidate for regarding human beings as having a higher moral status than animals is the superior cognitive capacity of humans. People with profound mental retardation pose a problem for this set of beliefs, because their cognitive capacities are not superior to those of many animals. I argue that we should drop the belief in the equal value of human life, replacing it with a graduated view that applies to animals as well as to humans.\"\n\nPlato.Stanford Entry on Moral Status of Animals: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/\n\nBiography: Peter Singer is Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics in the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University, a position that he now combines with the position of Laureate Professor at the University of Melbourne.  His books include Animal Liberation, Practical Ethics, The Life You Can Save, The Point of View of the Universe and The Most Good You Can Do.  In 2014 the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute ranked him third on its list of Global Thought Leaders, and Time has included him among the world’s 100 most influential people.  An Australian, in 2012 he was made a Companion to the Order of Australia, his country’s highest civilian honour.\n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "== Repugnant Interventions - Doublethink in Global Prioritization Outline:\n1) Global prioritisation: child mortality, family planning and the\ncancellation worry\n2) Making it quantitative: the benefit-cost approach\n3) CBA for child mortality reduction\n3.1) Arguments for not counting ‘knock-on effects’\n3.2) Critique of the CBA\n4) CBA for family planning\n4.1) An excursion into population axiology\n4.2) Critique of the CBA\n5) Conclusions\n\nSlides are here: https://www.slideshare.net/adam_ford/hilary-graves-repugnant-interventions-ea-global-melbourne-2015\n\nSummary / Conclusions:\n• Child mortality and family planning are both (fairly) frequently cited as ‘top picks’ in global prioritisation.\n• This is prima facie curious, since the most-obvious effect of the second intervention is precisely to undo the most-obvious effect of the first.\n• Benefit-cost analyses (indeed) only manage to make both interventions simultaneously come out as ‘top picks’ by engaging in ‘doublethink’: making inconsistent decisions as to which effects (‘direct’ vs ‘indirect’) to count vs disregard, across the two interventions.\n    • Analyses of mortality-reduction projects neglect indirect (e.g. economic) effects.\n        • There may be a case for ignoring such effects in some\ncontexts (e.g. doctor-patient relationships), but not at the level of global prioritisation.\n      • Analyses of family planning programs ignore the (‘direct’) ‘value of lives not born’, counting only the ‘indirect’ effects on others.\n        • This presupposes a person-affecting and/or an average-utilitarian approach to population ethics. Those approaches are initially intuitive, but ultimately indefensible.\n• There is a resulting danger that we are currently wasting billions of dollars per year, by doing and then undoing good.\n• To fix this: More sophisticated analysis, including serious attempts to put neo-Malthusianism and the value of individual additional lives in dialogue with one another, is required.\n\nSlides for a similar talk here: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/talks/doublethink.pdf\n\nHilary Greaves is Associate Professor in Philosophy at the University of Oxford, specializing in moral philosophy. She is currently particularly interested in what moral philosophy has to say about actions that affect the number of people who will live, and in connecting abstract theoretical work in this area to real-world issues that are relevant to public policy and philanthropic intervention.\n\nOxford Bio: users.ox.ac.uk/~mert2255/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "title": "David Pearce - Abolitionist Bioethics - EA Global Melbourne 2015",
    "description": "David Pearce is author of The Hedonistic Imperative (1995), which calls for the use of biotechnology to phase out suffering throughout the living world. In 1998, he co-founded with Nick Bostrom the World Transhumanist Association (H+). Transhumanists believe in using technology to overcome our biological limitations.\n\n\n\"May all that hath life be delivered from suffering\", said Gautama Buddha. Abolitionist bioethics isn't new. What's changed is the technology to make it feasible. Until the biotech revolution, talk of \"ending suffering\" belonged to the realm of religious prophets and utopian dreamers. Natural selection didn't design living organisms to be happy. Discontent evolved because it's been hugely genetically adaptive. Human biology means that socio-economic reform and material abundance can't cheat the negative feedback mechanisms of the hedonic treadmill. Practising the Noble Eightfold Path won't recalibrate hedonic set-points or dismantle the cruelties of the food chain. By contrast, editing our genetic source code can potentially phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world. Future life can be animated by information-sensitive gradients of well-being - a motivational architecture of gradients of intelligent bliss. Such scenarios for the future of the biosphere are clearly speculative; but what's in question is their sociological credibility, not technical feasibility.\n\nWhy does abolitionist bioethics matter? Well, if you are in agony or despair, then the answer is self-intimating. My pain and suffering is deeply important to me. On the face of it, nothing follows from this commonplace to any wider bioethical project. As La Rochefoucauld remarks, \"We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others.\" Yet natural science gives none of us reason to believe that we are special, or to suppose that this space-time location is somehow unique or privileged. The egocentric illusion is a genetically adaptive lie. If suffering is self-evidently important for me, and if I'm not really special in the way evolution makes each of us feel, then suffering is bad for anyone, anywhere, anytime. For reasons that science still doesn't understand, the pain-pleasure axis discloses a natural metric of (un)importance: the world's intrinsic axis of (dis)value. Hence not just personal morality but also collective decision-theoretic rationality suggests that the scope of the abolitionist project should be global rather than parochial. In the post-genomic era, to confine the relief of suffering to a single person, race or species would express an arbitrary and self-serving bias.\n\nMy own values are secular and utilitarian. Yet it's not necessary to endorse secularism or utilitarian ethics to recognise that minimising suffering and promoting happiness is important - even if promoting subjective well-being is only one of your values among others. The reason for laying such stress on a strategy of genetic-biological intervention rather than older, environmental approaches is comparative long-term efficacy. Socio-political reforms, economic growth and personal self-help are important. But they aren't going to abolish the metabolic pathways of suffering. Six months after a quadriplegia-inducing accident or a mammoth lottery win, scientific studies suggest that most people will have reverted to their self-reported level of subjective well-being or ill-being before the accident or jackpot. Unless we tackle the genetic basis of suffering, the evolutionarily ancient cycle of misery and malaise will persist indefinitely. Or as Thoreau puts it, “There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root”.\n\nOne of the biggest technical challenges ahead is to retain the computational-functional role of vital adaptations such as nociception, i.e. our biological capacity to avoid and respond to noxious stimuli, while simultaneously getting rid of their nasty \"raw feels\", i.e. mental and physical pain. I think the ideological challenges to biohappiness may prove more formidable.\n\n\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/bioethics.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_%28bioethics%29\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Probability Theory Ensues from Assumptions of Approximate Consistency: A Simple Derivation and its Implications for AGI\n\nAbstract: By slightly tweaking some recent mathematics by Dupre and Tipler, it is shown that, if an intelligence even approximately\nobeys certain  simple  consistency  conditions  in  its  reasoning  about  uncertainty, then  its  uncertainty  judgments  must\napproximately obey  the  rules  of probability theory. It is argued that, while real-world cognitive systems will rarely be fully consistent, they will often possess approximate consistency of the sort required by this mathematics. The conclusion is that, much of the time, cognitive systems' uncertainty judgments will roughly\nresemble the conclusions of probability theory { with more deviation from probability theory when fewer resources are devoted to the maintenance of  consistency.  Implications  for  AGI  architecture  are  briefly  discussed, including the viability of hybrid systems that use (explicit or implicit) probabilistic inference when resources are available for adequate consistency maintenance, and other heuristic methods elsewise.\n\nPaper: http://goertzel.org/agi-13/Why_probability_v1.pdf\n\nAlso see: www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2MM6SXPSl0\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Abstract : AGI systems have to learn from experience, build models of the environment from the acquired knowledge, and use these models for prediction (and action). In philosophy this is called inductive inference, in statistics it is called estimation and prediction, and in computer science it is addressed by machine learning. I will first review unsuccessful attempts and unsuitable approaches towards a general theory of uncertainty and induction, including Popper’s denial of induction, frequentist statistics, much of statistical learning theory, subjective Bayesianism, Carnap’s confirmation theory, the data\nparadigm, eliminative induction, pluralism, and deductive and other\napproaches. I will then argue that Solomonoff’s formal, general,\ncomplete, consistent, and essentially unique theory provably solves most issues that have plagued the other approaches. Some theoretical properties, extensions to (re)active learning agents, and practical approximations are mentioned in passing, but they are not the focus of this talk. I will conclude with some general advice to philosophers and AGI researchers.\n\nSlides: http://www.hutter1.net/publ/suiagi.pdf\nweb: http://www.hutter1.net/\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "The concept of emergence is controversial to some - for example Eliezer Yudkowski, who favors reductionism, wrote a critique at Less Wrong (see link below).  Do reductionists often dismiss emergence?\n\nBen formalized emergence in his book 'The Evolving Mind' as patterns that appear when you put two or more things together that are not there in any of the individual parts.\nBook - 'The Evolving Mind': http://www.goertzel.org/books/mind/contents.html  http://www.amazon.com/Evolving-Futures-General-Evolution-Studies/dp/2881245870\n\nEliezer's post on 'The Futility of Emergence' at Less Wrong: http://lesswrong.com/lw/iv/the_futility_of_emergence/\n\nTalking points: EMERGENCE & REDUCTION, CONFUSION REGARDING EMERGENCE, LARGE SCALE NEUROSCIENCE PROJECTS, EMERGENCE AS A WAY OF EXPLAINING AWAY COMPLEXITY, IS CONSCIOUSNESS AN EMERGENT EFFECT? EMERGENCE & ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n\nThe Attack of the Aliens from Vector Space: Steps Toward a Complex Systems Theory of Categorization and Similarity: http://www.goertzel.org/papers/catpap.html (Emergence & Compression) Extract: \"The important concept of emergent pattern is defined: a pattern emerges between two entities if it is present in the combination of the two entities, but not in either of the entities separately. And the structural complexity of an entity is defined as the \"total amount\" of pattern in it. If the Metapattern is accepted, then these two concepts become essential to any analysis of biological reality.\n\nWe turn from these abstractions to a concrete biological example: the mammalian immune system. The theory of clonal selection states that immune systems evolve by natural selection; using the computer simulations of Alan Perelson, Rob deBoer and their colleagues as a guide, we inquire as to the exact nature of this evolution.\n\nWe conclude that, in immune systems, survival is roughly proportional to emergence: those antibodies which generate a large amount of emergent pattern in conjunction with other antibodies, will tend to survive.\n\n It is argued that this correlation between emergence and survival also applies to the evolution of species: that an organism which generates a large amount of emergent pattern in conjunction with its environment will tend to survive. Since the environment of each organism consists partially of other organisms, this implies that an ecosystem is an enormously complex \"system of pattern equations.\" This principle is illustrated with biological examples.\"\n\nThis interview appears on IEET: http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/ford20150722\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

However, as a result of what he said, members of our community could have been encouraged to join an uprising against Australia. If that were the case, and my safety were to be jeopardised, would you consider restricting freedom of speech?\nWhere do you draw the line between protecting free speech and defending national security? \n\nDE-RADICALISATION\nMike Honiball asked: How do we balance the repulsion that most Australians feel towards people who join ISIL, and the potential merits of using ex-militants to de-radicalise would-be jihadis at home when both sides of politics are playing to the most base instinct within the Australian community? \n\nTANYA & LEADERSHIP\nEva Klima asked: Tanya Plibersek, the ABC's documentary The Killing Season showed the way Julia Gillard was treated as the first female Prime Minister and highlighted that Bill Shorten lied about his role in her demise. Do you think the next female Prime Minister will be treated better and if so, should Bill Shorten now step aside and let you take over as leader of the opposition?\n\nSCIENCE & RELIGION\nKeenan Fitzsimons asked: Professor Lawrence Krauss, I am a year 8 student and would love to pursue a career in the field of theoretical Physics or Cosmology. I am also a devout Catholic and have a very strong faith. I am particularly interested in Black Holes and where we are in the universe.\nThe great physicist Einstein once said, “Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind”.\nDo you believe there is a place in this world where both Science and Religion can be compatible and work side by side? \n\nINDIGENOUS RECOGNITION\nJacqueline Olling asked: How long do you think it will be before a long-overdue referendum is put to the Australian people to recognise the rights of Indigenous people in the constitution?\nWould you also support increased representation of Indigenous people in the federal parliament as a further constitutional amendment? \n\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas about Living Ethically - With Peter Singer, Hosted by Dr. Linda Barclay - brought to you by Live on Stage Australia\n\nMonash University welcomes Professor Peter Singer to discuss how effective altruism is changing ideas about living ethically. Professor Singer will be making two presentations while visiting Monash University, on the evenings of May 14 and 15.\n\nPeter Singer, often described as the world’s most influential living philosopher, presents a challenging new movement in the search for an ethical life, one that has emerged from his own work on some of the world’s most pressing problems.\n\nEffective altruism involves doing the most good possible. It requires a rigorously unsentimental view of charitable giving, urging that a substantial proportion of our money or time, should be donated to the organisations that will do the most good with those resources, rather than to those that tug the heartstrings. But what counts as ‘the most good’? How do we balance emotional and practical concerns when trying to do good? How should we feel about making donations that give us a self-satisfying ‘warm glow’ but don’t save the greatest number of lives? Does everyone’s suffering count equally? What about other values, like justice, freedom, equality and knowledge?\n\nA percentage of proceeds from the events are directed to our official non-for profit partners; the Oxfam – Monash Partnership and The Fred Hollows Foundation.\n\n‘Peter Singer’s status as a man of principles and towering intellect—a philosopher extraordinaire, if you will—is unrivalled in Australia.’\n\n--Sydney Morning Herald\n\n‘Peter Singer may be the most controversial philosopher alive; he is certainly among the most influential.’\n\n--New Yorker\n\nPeter Singer is Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics, Princeton University, and Laureate Professor, School of Historical and Philosophical Studies, University of Melbourne. He is the author of more than twenty books, including The Life You Can Save, The President of Good and Evil and The Ethics of What We Eat. Singer was born in Australia. He divides his time between New York City and Melbourne.\n\n\n--Event Details\n\nLocation: Alexandra Theatre, Monash University, Clayton Campus\nDate: Thursday 14th of May\nhttp://www.mostgoodyoucando.com/\n\nLive on Stage Australia: https://www.facebook.com/liveonstageaustralia\n\nhttp://artsonline.monash.edu.au/events/events/peter-singer-the-most-good-you-can-do/\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

During his career he specialised in making large scale applications reliable and fast, saving several major projects from being cancelled due to poor performance and excessive running costs. This led to an interest in the progress of computer hardware and in Moore’s Law, which states that the power of computers grows roughly 10-fold every 5 years. In his spare time he contributed to various open source projects such as the GNU Compiler Collection. After attending the first Singularity Summit in Australia, he decided to retire so he could devote himself full-time to researching Artificial Intelligence, the Technological Singularity and Trans-humanism. He is currently working on applying AI techniques to financial and investment applications.\nTalk: The Surprising Rate of Progress in Artificial Intelligence Research\n\nArtificial Intelligence is one of the foundations of Transhumanism, along with nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics. This talk will survey the rapidly accelerating progress in building machine intelligence, particularly over the last 10 years and the prospects for the next one to three decades. We cover advances in hardware such as the single molecule transistor and the first computer with processing power comparable to the human brain as well as the continuation exponential growth in processing power courtesy of Moore’s Law. Accessible descriptions of breakthroughs in software and algorithms such as self-learning machines, reinforcement learning, Support Vector machines, and hierarchical learning networks illustrate how the “software bottleneck” is being overcome. The talk includes video footage of applications of Artificial Intelligence technology.\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty talks about what it takes to become a scientist.  You need to be curious, well enough organised, be able to write good English (to get grants), and resilient psychologically.  Also patience towards hypocrisy, and not no great respect for general wisdom and common sense.  \n\nSolving problems with behavioral changes vs scientific development.  It's difficult to change peoples behaviour - we can however focus on doing the science that will help mitigate dangers to human civilization - like climate change.\n\nDiscovery related research.  If you want to have new initiatives, you have to have discovery related research as opposed to research targeted at very specific goals.  \n\n\nCategorizing research. The difference  basic research and application can be extremely narrow.  \n\n\nPeter Charles Doherty AC (born 15 October 1940) is an Australian veterinary surgeon and researcher in the field of medicine. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1995, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Rolf M.

    "description": "Pandemics. The word conjures up images of horrific diseases sweeping the globe and killing everyone in their path. But such highly lethal illnesses almost never create pandemics. The reality is deadly serious but far more subtle.\n\nIn Pandemics: What Everyone Needs to Know®, Peter Doherty, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on how the immune system recognizes virus-infected cells, offers an essential guide to one of the truly life-or-death issues of our age. In concise, question-and-answer format, he explains the causes of pandemics, how they can be counteracted with vaccines and drugs, and how we can better prepare for them in the future. Doherty notes that the term \"pandemic\" refers not to a disease's severity but to its ability to spread rapidly over a wide geographical area. Extremely lethal pathogens are usually quickly identified and confined. Nevertheless, the rise of high-speed transportation networks and the globalization of trade and travel have radically accelerated the spread of diseases. A traveler from Africa arrived in New York in 1999 carrying the West Nile virus; one mosquito bite later, it was loose in the ecosystem. Doherty explains how the main threat of a pandemic comes from respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS, which disseminate with incredible speed through air travel. The climate disruptions of global warming, rising population density, and growing antibiotic resistance all complicate efforts to control pandemics. But Doherty stresses that pandemics can be fought effectively. Often simple health practices, especially in hospitals, can help enormously. And research into the animal reservoirs of pathogens, from SARS in bats to HIV in chimpanzees, show promise for our prevention efforts.\n\nCalm, clear, and authoritative, Peter Doherty's Pandemics is one of the most critically important additions to the What Everyone Needs to Know® series.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Pandemics-What-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/019989812X\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses cannot reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T cells to recognise infected cells, they had to recognise two molecules on the surface of the cell – not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

It was invented by Jerome C. Glenn in 1971, when he was a student at the Antioch Graduate School of Education (now Antioch University New England).\n\n The Futures Wheel is a way of organizing thinking and questioning about the future – a kind of structured brainstorming. (Jerome C. Glenn (1994) The Futures Wheel)\n\n\n-  The Future of Work: Future of Work and Glocal Strategies to Improve Long-Term Prospects\n\nThe future of work and increasing income gaps are among the most discussed topics of long-term prospects at the moment. However, systemic perspectives and global as well as local strategies to improve the long-term outlook are often lacking. The Millennium Projects plans to address this gap and invites donations to support the study.\n\n-  About the Millennium Project: The Millennium Project connects futurists around the world to improve global foresight. It was founded in 1996 after a three-year feasibility study with the United Nations University, Smithsonian Institution, Futures Group International, and the American Council for the UNU. It is now an independent non-profit global participatory futures research think tank of futurists, scholars, business planners, and policy makers who work for international organizations, governments, corporations, NGOs, and universities. The Millennium Project manages a coherent and cumulative process that collects and assesses judgments from over 3,500 people since the beginning of the project, selected by its 50 Nodes around the world. The work is distilled in the annual \"State of the Future\", \"Futures Research Methodology\" series, special studies, and integrated into its Global Futures Intelligence System.\n\n-  About Global Futures Intelligence System (GFIS) : The Millennium Project is integrating all of its information, groups, and software into a \"Global Futures Intelligence System.\" GFIS* is The Millennium Project’s new way for you to participate with and have access to all of our resources in one place. Those who buy a one-year subscription can interact with all the elements of the system, make suggestions, initiate discussions with experts around the world, and search through over 10,000 pages of futures research and 1,300 pages of methods. The text has built-in Google translation with 52 languages. MP Node chairs and content reviewers will have free access.\n\nInstead of publishing the State of the Future once a year, the material is being updated in the Global Futures Intelligence System on a continual basis – the same is true with Futures Research Methodology – you do not have to wait five or so years to get a new version. Some Real-Time Delphi studies and other research are also being made available as soon as they are completed, and will be accessible for discussion of conclusions. \n\nThe GFIS is not just new software, vast information, and global experts; it is also a system to produce synergies among these three elements for greater intelligence than their separate values. It is rather a global intelligence utility from which governments, UN agencies, businesses, NGOs, universities, media, and consultants can draw different values. The GFIS staff is more interested in synergistic intelligence than competitive intelligence, and how the world can work for all, not just for a single nation, ideology, or issue. It can provide decision makers, advisors, and educators with insights that reflect the consensus and/or range of views on the important issues of our time. The engagement of the user with our information, participants, and software is intended to help humanity become more proactive.\nhttp://www.millennium-project.org/millennium/GFIS.html\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\nJerome C Glenn - Futurology &  Future Day 2015 02 21 08 08 12",

    "title": "Aubrey de Grey - Catalyzing Future Day - Progress in Regenerative Medicine - CRISPR",
    "description": "-Why Future Day? \n-How can we use Future Day to raise awareness of and catalyze action in 1) general future thinking and 2) specific projects?\n\nContact media in lead up to Future Day - tell them that the future is coming, but in some cases not fast enough?\nRaising awareness of specific projects (i.e. like SENS and the defeat of aging) - Aubrey has always been very strong on promoting the mission - getting people to reorient themselves, that aging is a bad thing - from a 1000 foot perspective, once poeple get some momentum in their heads with regard to caring about a particular issue then it's almost automatic - it certainly a lot easier to get poeple interested and involved in relevant projects and making a contribution.  So future day can help with symbolism - a banner to rally towards certain projects.  one thing about anti-aging research is that it is based on, and complimented by strides in technological and scientific progress that is making strides ahead for perhaps much simpler reasons. E.g.  There has been enormous breakthroughs in the last 12 months i.e. in getting stem cells to do more, building artificial organs, and gene therapy -  SENS leans on progress in these fields.  Though gene therapy has made progress, some aspects are still a little way off  - but we are already very well ahead of where we were compared to 12 months ago let alone 24 or 5 years... especially because of the 'semi-miraculous' technology known as CRISPR (progress in safety and versatility)!\n-What are your thoughts on the potential for CRISPR style technology to have impact on regenerative medicine?  If there is potential in your mind, can you describe how?  What is the potential for CRISPR to aid in regenerative medicine?\nCRISPR has been called the 'adaptive immune system of bacteria' - meaning backteria can incorporate bits of their own infections (bacterial phages) into their own genomes - as a way of triggering themselves to be able to destroy these sequences when they see them again.  The mechanism by which this is safely & usefully incorporated into the bacteria's genome has recently been elucidated reasonably well - so we have been able to do this in mammalian and human cells to, and also do it work rather more efficiently and technologically feasibly than in it's natural environment.  The result of this is that we have been able to create genetic modifications to cells much more easily and reliably than before. At the beginning when CRISPR shot to promise early on, that was the whole story.  Since then people have been working very hard on making CRISPR only make desired modifications, avoiding 'off-target' effects - George Church's lab has been doing a lot in this space.  Increasing the range of applications in which CRISPR can be applied.  Origionally the idea is that that it could be used to make site-specific changes (one or two base pairs in a particular location and not elsewhere accidentally)  - this location coudl be customised very easily.  The idea of being able to use site-specific modifications to genomes is not new and can be done by other techniques, but no where near as efficiently as CRIPSR - as these other techniques require the creation of new protiesn to be designed for each target sequence - CRISPR does not require this.  On top of that, additional tricks to change RNA - effecting the rate at which things can be transcribed - also a way in which one can use the RNA that a human virus is creating as targets with which to destroy that virus - this is important because it enhanses our immune systems ability to eliminate that virus.  Some viruses are particularly difficult for the immune system to get rid of, the immune system may be able to suppress these viruses well, but only into a latent dormant state, where the viruses can re-activate periodically.  This reactivation plays a big part in why our immune systems to perform so well as we get older.  If we can stop this from happening, truely getting rid of viruses so they can't reactivate after being in a latent form, this is a big piece of progress!  A program at stanford has announced a first step towards this using CRISPR. \n\nweb: http://futureday.org\nFaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/futureday/\nTwitter: @futureday #futureday\nG+: https://plus.google.com/communities/113593172674200566221\n\nFuture Day interview - Aubrey de Grey 2015 02 20",

Hard to tell.  Sometimes firms (i.e. google) are tied to a particular image - google have the image of innovation - google gets attention for projects like calico - pie in the sky moonshot projects are a compliment to their image.  Employees are more likely to want to work for google because of its sexiness... \n\nJustin Rattner (former CTO of Intel) spoke about the singularity quite a bit.. but not many CEOs/CTOs bring it up - with the exception of a few... though this could change. \n\nUpdates blockchain currency (bitcoin, etherium) - opportunities / risks\n\nFuturists are often eager for big change - enthusiastic - people who are itching for big change often focus on scenarios for the future where there is big change.\n\nWhy is there little interest in quadratic voting compared to small iterations in gadgetry (which seems to get a lot of press)?\nThere is a lot of new and inventive gadgets, and ideas in physics that have huge communities of interest - but social technologies, ways we organise meetings, for instance Quadratic Voting...  Many voting systems don't do a good job at weighing different votes based on how much you care about the issue.  QV pays for votes in proportion to the square of the number of votes - can produce outcomes that weigh votes based on how much the voters care about the issue.  People can be given votes as a point system, and they can choose to distribute their points based on how much they care about certain issues.\nQV: http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/16996\n\nAI Dev - what are the big improvements?

    "title": "Smarter then Us - the Rise of Machine Intelligence - Stuart Armstrong on AI Risk & his book",
    "description": "What happens when machines become smarter than humans? Forget lumbering Terminators. The power of an artificial intelligence (AI) comes from its intelligence, not physical strength and laser guns. Humans steer the future not because we're the strongest or the fastest but because we're the smartest. When machines become smarter than humans, we'll be handing them the steering wheel. What promises—and perils—will these powerful machines present? Stuart Armstrong’s new book navigates these questions with clarity and wit.\n\nBuy the book: http://www.amazon.com.au/Smarter-Than-Us-Machine-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B00IB4N4KU\nGood Reads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20830144-smarter-than-us\n\nCan we instruct AIs to steer the future as we desire? What goals should we program into them? It turns out this question is difficult to answer! Philosophers have tried for thousands of years to define an ideal world, but there remains no consensus. The prospect of goal-driven, smarter-than-human AI gives moral philosophy a new urgency. The future could be filled with joy, art, compassion, and beings living worthwhile and wonderful lives—but only if we’re able to precisely define what a \"good\" world is, and skilled enough to describe it perfectly to a computer program.\n\nAIs, like computers, will do what we say—which is not necessarily what we mean. Such precision requires encoding the entire system of human values for an AI: explaining them to a mind that is alien to us, defining every ambiguous term, clarifying every edge case. Moreover, our values are fragile: in some cases, if we mis-define a single piece of the puzzle—say, consciousness—we end up with roughly 0% of the value we intended to reap, instead of 99% of the value.\n\nThough an understanding of the problem is only beginning to spread, researchers from fields ranging from philosophy to computer science to economics are working together to conceive and test solutions. Are we up to the challenge?\n\nA mathematician by training, Armstrong is a Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford University. His research focuses on formal decision theory, the risks and possibilities of AI, the long term potential for intelligent life (and the difficulties of predicting this), and anthropic (self-locating) probability. Armstrong wrote Smarter Than Us at the request of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a non-profit organization studying the theoretical underpinnings of artificial superintelligence. \n\n“A waste of time. A complete and utter waste of time” were the words that the Terminator didn’t utter: its programming wouldn’t let it speak so irreverently. Other Terminators got sent back in time on glamorous missions, to eliminate crafty human opponents before they could give birth or grow up. But this time Skynet had taken inexplicable fright at another artificial intelligence, and this Terminator was here to eliminate it—to eliminate a simple software program, lying impotently in a bland computer, in a university IT department whose “high-security entrance” was propped open with a fire extinguisher.\nThe Terminator had machine-gunned the whole place in an orgy\nof broken glass and blood—there was a certain image to maintain.\nAnd now there was just the need for a final bullet into the small lap-top with its flashing green battery light. Then it would be “Mission Accomplished.” \n\n\n\n#Superintellligence #SmarterThanUs #ExistentialRisk #AGI\n\n See other interviews with Stuart Armstrong:\nThe Grand Challenge of Beneficial AI: https://youtu.be/INuLGGEhDwY\nPredicting the Timeline of Artificial Intelligence: https://youtu.be/HLW4a2KIeWc\nAI Safety: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI: https://youtu.be/OmtXZ9tZGso\nSmarter Than Us - the Rise of Machine Intelligence: https://youtu.be/RotShnjrmwI\nBootstrapping Intergalactic Colonization - Eternity in 6 Hours: https://youtu.be/0U3sClR6m8s\n\n Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

In the debate about climate change, science should be at the center.\n\nAlso see this open letter to Tony Abbot that Peter Doherty was a contributor to: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2014/201/5/open-letter-hon-tony-abbott-mp\n\nLateline: http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2014/s3985479.htm\n\nABC's Big Ideas with Peter Doherty on Climate Change and Science: http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2009/06/26/2609568.htm\n\nPeter Charles Doherty AC (born 15 October 1940) is an Australian veterinary surgeon and researcher in the field of medicine. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1995, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Rolf M. Zinkernagel in 1996 and was named Australian of the Year in 1997. In the Australia Day Honours of 1997, he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his work with Zinkernagel. Zinkernagel was named an honorary Companion. He is also a National Trust Australian Living Treasure. He had a younger brother named Ian and had two parents named Linda and Eric. He skipped a grade in school and entered the University of Queensland when he was 17.\n\nDoherty's research focuses on the immune system and his Nobel work described how the body's immune cells protect against viruses. He and Rolf Zinkernagel, the co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, discovered how T cells recognise their target antigens in combination with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins.\n\nViruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses cannot reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T cells to recognise infected cells, they had to recognise two molecules on the surface of the cell – not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "This show is a follow up after the Techoprogressive Declaration was released and discussed at the Transvision conference in France.  \n\n0:57 Quick Intro - What is Technoprogressivism?\n2:46 The Technoprogressive Declaration and the Transvision Conference in France  where it was discussed.   ‘Technoprog’ (Didier Cornele + others from Belgium) distanced themselves from a reactionary right \n7:22 The points that the Technoprogressive Declaration addresses\n11:21 Is a party format the best way to make change in politics?  Or should we focus on forming caucuses within existing political parties?   Diversity and Thinness of Transhumanism to be a Political Party\n13:20 Where do the interests of the Transhumanist Party & the Pirate Party intersect?  \n15:10 The role of the state from a Technoprogressive point of view (not eliminativists, push back against overreach of intellectual property, but not anarchists)\n17:14 The Basic Income Guarantee, media attention & public policy  -\n26:24 What is the incentive for the state to support it's subjects?  Why would the state support basic income guarantee?\n30:23 the State vs the Individual - a realistic dichotomy?  (Is the State a bully & the Market is individuals coming together freely to aggregate their interests through exchange?  Is the State an opportunity for individuals on the basis of equal democratic citizenship to aggregate their interests through political discussion and create public policy & the Market is an unequal terrain where workers are bound by poverty to sell their labour & the wealthy corporations get to dictate the terms?)\n34:32 More on Basic Income Guarantee in the media &  the Imminence of Technological Unemployment \n36:40 Movements within the political landscape of transhumanism including Zoltan Istvan's presence: Zoltan Istavan’s philosophical musings in his book are worse than Randian objectivism - too bad that he has been the first to raise the flag - on the other hand the UK effort is solid politially (though what about it’s strategic logic - i.e. shouldn’t they be working withinin the labour party as a courcus?)\nWorking with the thinktalks, the policy and academia may be the right way to go.  \n40:20 The Neuroscience of political persuasion - discussion on Joshua Green's Moral Tribes & Moral Enhancement\n42:30 Moral Enhancement - how  does it work, how will it work in the future - the outcome?  When will it go mainstream?\n45:47 The Technoprogressive Declaration - where to go from here?  Need to be explicit on what politics we don't agree on. Groups should be up front and unambiguous about their political persuasion - otherwise they just end up beating themselves/each other up over political differences.  \n53:00 Strong opinions about the efficacy of the market in a stateless society to solve almost any problem - What attracts people to these ideas?\n56:45 Do people agree on the idea of Basic Income Guarantee?  Most people see it as an offspring from the socialist movement.\n58:53 Where to go to from here?  \n  - Conferences on Basic Income Guarantee - BIEN conferences.\n  - Technoprogressives should build alliances with social justice movements and futurists who believe that technological unemployment is an inevitability - trade unions have a problem grasping this kind of future - so we need to talk to trade unionists and the public policy sector for them to see what kind of great future we could have ahead and how to counter technological unemployment\n1:01:41 Funding orgs (i.e. IEET) who are trying to make a difference in this arena\n\nAlso see part I: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fo6MmLcw44\n\nhttp://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/biopolitics - Technoprogressivism is an ideological stance with roots in Enlightenment thought which focuses on how human flourishing is advanced by the convergence of technological progress and democratic social change.

    "description": "Many people think about science in a fairly simplistic way: collect evidence, formulate a theory, test the theory. By this method, it is claimed, science can achieve objective, rational knowledge about the workings of reality. In this presentation I will question the validity of this understanding of science. I will consider some of the key controversies in philosophy of science, including the problem of induction, the theory-ladenness of observation, the nature of scientific explanation, theory choice, and scientific realism, giving an overview of some of the main questions and arguments from major thinkers like Popper, Quine, Kuhn, Hempel, and Feyerabend. I will argue that philosophy of science paints a much richer and messier picture of the relationship between science and truth than many people commonly imagine, and that a familiarity with the key issues in the philosophy of science is vital for a proper understanding of the power and limits of scientific thinking.\n\nSlides to the presentation available here: http://www.slideshare.net/adam_ford/the-shaky-foundations-of-science-slides-james-fodor\n\nVideo / Slides / Abstract: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806044711/http://2014.scifuture.org/abstract-the-shaky-foundations-of-science-an-overview-of-the-big-issues-james-fodor/\n\nPlaylist of talks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7qI6NZpO3sQrI2S8nmhVKYcAFmm2UTh\n\nProgram: https://web.archive.org/web/20160924002311/http://2014.scifuture.org/program/\nRecorded at the Philosophy of Science conference in Melbourne 2014: https://web.archive.org/web/20160924002311/http://2014.scifuture.org\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

He has appeared on Q & A among other shows. Lawrence Krauss is Director of the ASU Origins Project at Arizona State University and Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the Department of Physics.\nDescribed by Scientific American as a unique scientific ‘public intellectual’,  Krauss is a renowned theoretical physicist as well as one of the most well-known advocates for science  worldwide. In addition to over 300 scientific publications, He has written nine books for a general audience, including the international bestsellers The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, with translations into over 20 languages.  His research has focused on the intersection on cosmology and elementary particle physics, including general relativity and quantum gravity, the early universe, the origin of mass, neutrino astrophysics, and the long term future of the universe.  He is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received the major awards from all three US physics societies.  In 2012, he was awarded The National Science Board’s Public Service Award for his many contributions.  He frequently appears on TV and radio and contributes to newspapers and magazines, and is the subject of a new full-length feature film, The Unbelievers, which follows Krauss and Richard Dawkins around the world as they discuss science and reason.\n\nThe evening was held at Graduate House Conference Centre, 220 Leicester Street Carlton on Friday 29 August with proceedings beginning at 6:30pm.\n\nhttp://vicskeptics.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/lawrence-krauss-dinner-and-talk-29-august/\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "See: http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/biopolitics - Technoprogressivism is an ideological stance with roots in Enlightenment thought which focuses on how human flourishing is advanced by the convergence of technological progress and democratic social change. Technoprogressives argue that technological innovations can be profoundly empowering and emancipatory when they are democratically and transparently regulated for safety and efficacy, and then made universally and equitably available.\n\nTechnoprogressives maintain that accounts of\"progress” should focus on ethical and social as well as scientific and technical dimensions. For most technoprogressives, then, the growth of scientific knowledge or the accumulation of technological powers will not represent the achievement of proper progress unless and until it is accompanied by a just distribution of the costs, risks, and benefits of these new knowledges and capacities. At the same time, for most technoprogressives the achievement of better democracy, greater fairness, less violence, and a wider rights culture are all desirable, but inadequate in themselves to confront the quandaries of contemporary technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by progress in science and technology to support and implement these values.\n\nTechnoprogressives support the rights of persons to either maintain or modify his or her own mind and body, on his or her own terms, through informed, consensual recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling biomedical technology.  Technoprogressivism extends beyond cognitive liberty and morphological rights to views on safe, accountable and liberatory uses of emerging technologies such as genomic choice in reproduction, GMOs, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, surveillance and geoengineering.\n\nAlso see this video interview with James Hughes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5NtXTekHac\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\n 2014 11 17 10 16 29\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "Keith Wiley - The Fermi Paradox, Self-Replicating Probes, Interstellar Transport Bandwidth",
    "description": "It has been widely acknowledged that self-replicating space-probes (SRPs) could explore the galaxy very quickly relative to the age of the galaxy. An obvious implication is that SRPs produced by extraterrestrial civilizations should have arrived in our solar system millions of years ago, and furthermore, that new probes from an ever-arising supply of civilizations ought to be arriving on a constant basis. The lack of observations of such probes underlies a frequently cited variation of the Fermi Paradox. We believe that a predilection for ETI-optimistic theories has deterred consideration of incompatible theories. Notably, SRPs have virtually disappeared from the literature. In this paper, we consider the most common arguments against SRPs and find those arguments lacking. By extension, we find recent models of galactic exploration which explicitly exclude SRPs to be unfairly handicapped and unlikely to represent natural scenarios.\nWe also consider several other models that seek to explain the Fermi Paradox, most notably percolation theory and two societal-collapse theories. In the former case, we find that it imposes unnatural assumptions which likely render it unrealistic. In the latter case, we present a new theory of interstellar transportation bandwidth which calls into question the validity of societal-collapse theories.\nFinally, we offer our thoughts on how to design future SETI programs which take the conclusions of this paper into account to maximize the chance of detection. \nFermi Paradox paper on Arxiv http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6131\n\nVon Neumann Self-Replicating Probes. Percolation Theory, Interstellar Societal Collapse,  ETI May Still Exist in our Galaxy\n\n==Conclusion==\nThis paper was arranged in three parts. First, we introduced SRPs, presented the prevalent arguments against them, and showed that such arguments leave room for future SRP consideration. Namely, we proposed that recent literature has been overzealous in its exclusion of SRPs and we encourage their return to the field.\nSecond, we presented percolation theory and its nonsociological explanation for the Fermi Paradox. We then showed that the theory can be extended in very reasonable ways which\nundermine its primary conclusion that galactic expansion might\nbe intrinsically bounded.\nThird, we reviewed two theories of interstellar societal collapse and showed a few counter-arguments to each theory. Furthermore, we introduced ITB theory and showed that its implications might suggest a fundamental error in such theories.\nWe then discussed one additional paper theorizing that interstellar societies shrink back to their homeworlds and explained that the model involves a number of unlikely assumptions. Following this final analysis, we described the best theory yet oered on the Fermi Paradox which permits intragalactic ETI, namely that exploration probes may currently reside in our solar system, yet undiscovered. Lastly, we offered our thoughts on how to design future SETI programs so as to maximize the likelihood of success\n\n\nhttp://keithwiley.com/\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n2014 11 07 15 23 34",

    "description": "Abstract: http://2014.scifuture.org/abstract-the-revolutions-of-scientific-structure-colin-hales/ Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/adam_ford/t-ro-ssabstract\n\"The Revolutions of Scientific Structure” reveals an empirically measured discovery, by science, about the natural world that is the human scientist. The book’s analysis places science at the cusp of a major developmental transformation caused by science targeting the impossible: the science of consciousness, which was started in the late 1980s by a science practice that cannot, in principle, ever succeed. This impossible science must fail, not because it is malformed, but because it cannot deliver to engineers what is needed to build artificial consciousness.\n\nThe book formally reveals how fully expressed scientific behaviour actually has two faces, like the Roman god Janus. Currently we only use one face, the ‘Appearance-Aspect’ and it is measured and properly documented by the book for the first time. Where some scientists accidentally use the other, the two faces are shown to be confused as one. There are actually two fundamental kinds of ‘laws of nature’ that jointly account for the one underlying natural world. The recognition and addition of the second kind, the ‘Structure-Aspect’, is the book’s proposed transformation of science.\n\nThe upgraded framework is called ‘Dual Aspect Science’ and is posited as the adult form of science that had to wait for computers before it could emerge a fully formed butterfly from its millennial larval form that is single (appearance)-aspect science. Only ‘Structure-Aspect’ computation can scientifically reveal the principles underlying the nature of consciousness — in the form of the consciousness that is/underlies scientific observation. While this outcome ultimately affects all scientists, initially only neuroscience and physics are those that, together, have the responsibility for the empirical work needed for the introduction of Dual-Aspect science. This is not philosophy.

    "title": "John Wilkins - What is the Philosophy of Science All About?",
    "description": "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/jswilkins/what-is-po-s Abstract: http://2014.sci philosophy-of-science-what-why/\nSee this post by John Wilkins at Evolving Thoughts: http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/07/why-do-philosophy-of-science.\n\nJohn-Wilkins---Phil-Sci-IntroEvery so often, somebody will attack the worth, role or relevance of philosophy on the internets, as I have discussed before. Occasionally it will be a scientist, who usually conflates philosophy with theology. This is as bad as someone assuming that because I do some philosophy I must have the Meaning of Life (the answer is, variously, 12 year old Scotch, good chocolate, or dental hygiene).\n\nBut it raises an interesting question or two: what is the reason to do philosophy in relation to science? being the most obvious (and thus set up the context in which you can answer questions like: are there other ways to find truth than science?). So I thought I would briefly give my reasons for that.\n\nWhen philosophy began around 500BCE, there was no distinction between science and philosophy, nor, for that matter, between religion and philosophy. Arguably, science began when the pre-Socratics started to ask what the natures of things were that made them behave as they did, and equally arguably the first actual empirical scientist was Aristotle (and, I suspect, his graduate students).\n\nBut a distinction between science and philosophy began with the separation between natural philosophy (roughly what we now call science) and moral philosophy, which dealt with things to do with human life and included what we should believe about the world, including moral, theological and metaphysical beliefs. The natural kind was involved in considering the natures or things. A lot gets packed into that simple word, nature: it literally means “in-born” (natus) and the Greek physikos means much the same. Of course, something can be in-born only if it is born that way (yes, folks, she’s playing on some old tropes here!), and most physical things aren’t born at all, but the idea was passed from living to nonliving things, and so natural philosophy was born. That way.\n\nIn the period after Francis Bacon, natural philosophy was something that depended crucially on observation, and so the Empiricists arose: Locke, Berkeley, Hobbes, and later Hume. That these names are famous in philosophy suggests something: philosophy does best when it is trying to elucidate science itself. And when William Whewell in 1833 coined the term scientist to denote those who sought scientia or knowledge, science had begun its separation from the rest of philosophy.\n\nOr imperfectly, anyway. For a start the very best scientists of the day, including Babbage, Buckland and Whewell himself wrote philosophical tomes alongside theologians and philosophers. And the tradition continues until now, such as the recent book by Stephen Hawking in which he declares the philosophical enterprise is dead, a decidedly philosophical claim to make. Many scientists seem to find the doing of philosophy inevitable.\n\nSo why do I do philosophy of science? Simply because it is where the epistemic action is: science is where we do get knowledge, and I wish to understand how and why, and the limitations. All else flows from this for me. Others I know (and respect) do straight metaphysics and philosophy of language, but I do not. It only has a bite if it gives some clarity to science. I think this is also true of metaphysics, ethics and such matters as philosophy of religion.\n\n\nPlaylist of talks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7qI6NZpO3sQrI2S8nmhVKYcAFmm2UTh\n\nProgram: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806044711/http://2014.scifuture.org/program/\nRecorded at the Philosophy of Science conference in Melbourne 2014: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806044711/http://2014.scifuture.org\n...\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "Lawrence Krauss - Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?",
    "description": "A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing is a book by physicist Lawrence M. Krauss, first published in 2012, discussing modern cosmogony and its implications for the debate about the existence of God.\n\nBy Nothing, Lawrence Krauss means a Quantum Vacuum - not the philosophical meaning of nothing, which is 'not anything' - he certainly does not mean no physics.\n\nQuantum Vacuum (Vacuum State): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_state\n\nNothingness: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/\nSo, Why is there something rather than nothing?\n\nWell, why not? Why expect nothing rather than something? No experiment could support the hypothesis ‘There is nothing’ because any observation obviously implies the existence of an observer.\n\nIs there any a priori support for ‘There is nothing’? One might respond with a methodological principle that propels the empty world to the top of the agenda. For instance, many feel that whoever asserts the existence of something has the burden of proof. If an astronomer says there is water at the south pole of the Moon, then it is up to him to provide data in support of the lunar water. If we were not required to have evidence to back our existential claims, then a theorist who fully explained the phenomena with one set of things could gratuitously add an extra entity, say, a pebble outside our light cone. We recoil from such add-ons. To prevent the intrusion of superfluous entities, one might demand that metaphysicians start with the empty world and admit only those entities that have credentials. This is the entry requirement imposed by Rene Descartes. He clears everything out and then only lets back in what can be proved to exist.\n\nBio: Lawrence Maxwell Krauss (born May 27, 1954) is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is Foundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University and director of its Origins Project. He is known as an advocate of the public understanding of science, of public policy based on sound empirical data, of scientific skepticism and of science education and works to reduce the impact of superstition and religious dogma in pop culture. He is also the author of several bestselling books, including The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.\n\nRecorded at Vic Skeptics event late August 2014 : http://vicskeptics.wordpress.com/events/lawrence-krauss-dinner-and-talk-29-august/\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca - When Martin Krzywinski took a systems administrator job at Canada’s Michael Smith Genome Center, he didn’t plan on becoming a pioneer of 21st century biological data visualization. In fact, he didn’t even have a biology background: He’d done his graduate studies in physics and math. But it was the late 1990s, and he could handle a computer.\n\nMany thanks to VLSCI (Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative) for supporting the interview: https://www.vlsci.org.au\n\n--\n\nKrzywinski built the Center’s first IT system, beefed up their security, designed optimized keyboard layouts, and generally geeked out. Along the way, he started helping researchers with their projects, getting to know their data and its possibilities. The rest is design history.\n\nFalling DNA sequencing prices and a growing appreciation of cellular complexity soon unleashed a torrent of genetic data. The tools for gathering data, though, had outpaced those for portraying it. “I was frustrated, reading a lot of the scientific papers and not understanding what they were saying. I just wanted them to be simpler,” said Krzywinski. “There’s nothing I can do to make biology simpler, but I started telling people to make clearer figures.”\n\nTo do this, Krzywinski developed Circos, an open source visualization tool that arranges tabular data in circular form. It was a simple idea, but transformative: It’s since been used for thousands of visualizations, and its distinctive aesthetic is synonymous with the informational richness of our moment.\n\n \n-- http://www.wired.com/2013/11/wired-data-life-martin-krzywinski/\n\nMartin Krzywinski on How Graphics Can Save Lives: http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-24/martin-krzywinski-on-how-graphics-can-save-lives\n\n---\n\n\nMartin Krzywinski is a scientist who specializes in bioinformatics—the practice of organizing vast sets of biological data and representing them graphically for research and analysis. His work focuses on cancer research, which he performs at the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver.\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Can spiritual experience be proven?  No, things can only be falsified... validated? well... \n\nLawrence Maxwell Krauss (born May 27, 1954) is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is Foundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University and director of its Origins Project.

And what science deals with is not ‘true’ and ‘false,’ it’s ‘likely’ and ‘less likely.’ And some things are so unlikely, you just chop them off.”\n\n“So I can’t tell someone that what they’ve heard, or what they’ve seen, or [have had] some mystical experience — I can only say that it’s likely a coincidence,” he concluded.\n\n“But none of us like to believe that things that happen to us are coincidences. We’re all hard-wired to believe that things that happen to us are significant.”\n\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Peter Singer discusses the new book 'The Point Of View Of The Universe - Sidgwick & Contemporary Ethics' (By Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer) \nHe also discusses his reasons for changing his mind about preference utilitarianism.\n\nBuy the book here: http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199603695.do\n\nBart Schultz's (University of Chicago) Review of the book: http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/49215-he-point-of-view-of-the-universe-sidgwick-and-contemporary-ethics/\n\"Restoring Sidgwick to his rightful place of philosophical honor and cogently defending his central positions are obviously no small tasks, but the authors are remarkably successful in pulling them off, in a defense that, in the case of Singer at least, means candidly acknowledging that previous defenses of Hare's universal prescriptivism and of a desire or preference satisfaction theory of the good were not in the end advances on the hedonistic utilitarianism set out by Sidgwick. But if struggles with Singer's earlier selves run throughout the book, they are intertwined with struggles to come to terms with the work of Derek Parfit, both Reasons and Persons (Oxford, 1984) and On What Matters (Oxford, 2011), works that have virtually defined the field of analytical rehabilitations of Sidgwick's arguments. The real task of The Point of View of the Universe -- the title being an expression that Sidgwick used to refer to the impartial moral point of view -- is to defend the effort to be even more Sidgwickian than Parfit, and, intriguingly enough, even more Sidgwickian than Sidgwick himself.\"\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "Peter Singer - The Life You Can Save",
    "description": "The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty is a 2009 book by Australian philosopher Peter Singer. The author argues that citizens of affluent nations are behaving immorally if they do not act to end the poverty they know to exist in developing nations.\n\nText Interview (inc Transcription): http://www.scifuture.org/the-life-you-can-save-interview-with-peter-singer-by-adam-ford/\n\nThe book is focussed on giving to charity, and discusses philosophical considerations, describes practical and psychological obstacles to giving, and lists available resources for prospective donors (e.g. charity evaluators). Singer concludes the book by proposing a minimum ethical standard of giving.\n\nChristian Barry and Gerhard Overland (both from the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics) described the widespread acceptance for the notion that \"the lives of all people everywhere are of equal fundamental worth when viewed impartially\". They then wonder, during the book review in the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry, why \"the affluent do so little, and demand so little of their governments, while remaining confident that they are morally decent people who generally fulfil their duties to others?\" The reviewers agree with Singer, and say they see a conflict between the behaviours of the affluent and the claims of the affluent to being morally decent people. The reviewers also discuss other practical ways to fight poverty.\n\nWeb: http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org - Can I Really Save Lives?\n\nThe good news, in fact the great news, is that you can!

    "title": "Peter Singer - Extinction Risk & Effective Altruism",
    "description": "Many Effective Altruists think a lot about the future, and there are questions of course in how much we should invest in trying to prevent small risks that we will become extinct. Another cognitive bias might be that we are not very good at accounting for small risks - we tend to dismiss them.  We can't see the difference between a 1 in 1000 chance and a 1 in 100,000 or a 1 in 1,000,000 is all that important. But really when you think about it, if there is a lot at stake, there is a huge gain in reducing the chance of risk from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 1,000,000.  Meaning it is only 1 thousandth as likely to occur...  And if what we are concerned about is the future of our species, and if we do value the idea that there should be human beings in the future, if you like the human story will continue, and that we hope there will be progress and that we will solve the problems that we are immediately faced with, and that eventually we will have potentially very large numbers of people, perhaps trillions of people or quintillions or larger amounts of people that exist over many generations - many effective altruists see this as a really important value, because they think that that is a good thing that people should flourish and have good lives.   And if you can reduce the risk of extinction, and thereby increase the probability that there will be these people living good lives, then that can be seen as an important cause to donate to - and one that has a high payoff in terms of cost effectiveness given the number of people that will benefit from it. \nNow not everybody thinks like this, and there is a philosophical question that it raises.  Some people would say  - look, I'm concerned with people who exist now, and i'm concerned with people who will exist in future whatever happens, they will say it's very probable that people will exist in, let's say, 200 years time, even if none of them exist now - and we wouldn't want to make their lives miserable by, say for example continuing climate change or by leaky radioactive waste from nuclear power-plants or something like that - but they will say, if people don't come into existence at all, they have nothing to loose.  Nobody regrets never having existed because if they never exist they can't regret it.  So some people think this is not a pressing mile priority to make sure people do exist who would never know what they would have missed out on - it is not a pressing priority.  So they would see some kind of accident that caused the extinction of our species as a bad thing because it kills the 7 or 10 or 15 billion people on the planet at the time the accident occurs - and they would see that as a terrible thing - but they wouldn't see it as a terrible thing because there are these huge numbers of people who would have come into existence had this accident not occurred - but now will never come into existence.   \nSo in order to decide how concerned we ought to be about the risk of extinction we need to reach a conclusion on that question on whether it is a huge loss of value if very large numbers of beings who would otherwise exist, never come into existence. \nEffective altruists need to have some information about the consequences of your actions - obviously you can't be effective if you don't know what consequences you are going to have - but one of the problems we have is that when we get into the more distant future, it's very difficult to predict what the world will be like - and therefore it is difficult to know how much value to place on, let's say, preventing bad things from happening.  So some people might say. well we don't have to worry about climate change beyond the next century because if we go beyond that there will be new technologies, people will be able to take carbon out of the atmosphere cheaply and effectively, and will be able to manipulate the climate the way they want.  Is that true or not?  We don't know\nand it would be good if there were some way of predicting whether it is true - and the same is true for almost any problem that you can think of where we don't know what the world will be like, we don't know what technologies will be like, and we could easily waste money and resources in doing things that we thought would be useful that in fact are not useful for the world in the future.\nIt clearly would be good if we could become better at predicting, but it's also very hard to do, because in a way to predict new technologies requires predicting the discoveries on which they will be based - and if we could predict those discoveries, we could make them now!  We wouldn't have to wait around for 50 years for them to be invented.  \n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\n\nFacebook group on Existential Risk: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk",

    "title": "David Pearce - Global Catastrophic & Existential Risk - Sleepwalking into the Abyss",
    "description": "Existential risk? I think the greatest underlying source of existential and global catastrophic risk lies in male human primates doing what evolution \"designed\" male human primates to do, namely wage war. (cf. http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/4576 ) Unfortunately, we now have thermonuclear weapons to do so.\nDoes the study of ERR diminish or enhance ER? One man's risk is another man's opportunity. 2) Is the existence of suffering itself a form of ER insofar as it increases the likelihood of intelligent agency pressing a global OFF button, cleanly or otherwise? If I focussed on ERR, phasing out suffering would be high on the To Do list.\n\nAGI?\nWell, I'd argue it's a form anthropomorphic projection on our part to ascribe intelligence or mind to digital computers. Believers in digital sentience, let alone digital (super)intelligence, need to explain Moravec's paradox.\n(cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec's_paradox) For sure, digital computers can be used to model everything from the weather to the Big Bang to thermonuclear reactions. Yet why is, say, a bumble bee more successful in navigating its environment in open-field contexts than the most advanced artificial robot the Pentagon can build today? The success of biological lifeforms since the Cambrian Explosion has turned on the computational capacity of organic robots to solve the binding problem (http://tracker.preterhuman.net/texts/body_and_health/Neurology/Binding.pdf) and generate cross-morally matched, real-time simulations of the mind-independent world. On theoretical grounds, I predict digital computers will never be capable of generating unitary phenomenal minds, unitary selves or unitary virtual worlds. In short, classical digital computers are invincibly ignorant zombies. (cf. http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/pearce20120510) They can never \"wake up\" and explore the manifold varieties of sentience. \n\n..\nSo why support initiatives to reduce existential and global catastrophic risk? Such advocacy might seem especially paradoxical if you're inclined to believe (as I am) that Hubble volumes where primordial information-bearing self-replicators arise more than once are vanishingly rare - and therefore cosmic rescue missions may be infeasible. Suffering sentience may exist in terrible abundance beyond our cosmological horizon and in googols of other Everett branches. But on current understanding, it's hard to see how rational agency can do anything about it.\n ..\nThe bad news?\nI fear we're sleepwalking towards the abyss. Some of the trillions of dollars of weaponry we're stockpiling designed to kill and maim rival humans will be used in armed conflict between nation states. Tens of millions and possibly hundreds of millions of people may perish in thermonuclear war. Multiple possible flash-points exist. I don't know if global catastrophe can be averted. For evolutionary reasons, male humans are biologically primed for competition and violence. Perhaps the least sociologically implausible prevention-measure would be a voluntary transfer of the monopoly of violence currently claimed by state actors to the United Nations. But I wouldn't count on any such transfer of power this side of Armageddon.\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/social-media/pre2014.html\n\n\nDoes the study of existential and global catastrophic risk increase or decrease the likelihood of catastrophe?\n\nThe issue is complicated by the divergent senses that researchers attach to the term \"existential risk\":\nhttp://www.abolitionist.com/anti-natalism.html\n\nAn important strand of Bostrom’s research concerns the future of humanity and long-term outcomes. He introduced the concept of an existential risk, which he defines as one in which an \"adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential.\" In the 2008 volume \"Global Catastrophic Risks\", editors Bostrom and Cirkovic characterize the relation between existential risk and the broader class of global catastrophic risks, and link existential risk to observer selection effects[8] and the Fermi paradox.[9] In In a 2013-paper in the journal Global Policy, Bostrom offers a taxonomy of existential risk and proposes a reconceptualization of sustainability in dynamic terms, as a developmental trajectory that minimizes existential risk.\n\nBostrom has argued that, from a consequentialist perspective, even small reductions in the cumulative amount of existential risk that humanity will face is extremely valuable, to the point where the traditional utilitarian imperative—to maximize expected utility—can be simplified to the Maxipok principle: maximize the probability of an OK outcome (where an OK outcome is any that avoids existential catastrophe).\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nFacebook group on Existential Risk: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk",

    "title": "Peter Singer - Suffering, Ethical Progress & Moral Enhancement",
    "description": "Suffering is bad - Peter Singer (who is a Hedonistic Utilitarian), and most Effective Altruists would agree with this.  Though in addressing the need for suffering today Peter acknowledges that, as we are presently constituted, suffering is useful as a warning sign (e.g. against further injury).  But what about the future?\n**What if we could eliminate suffering?\nPerhaps in the future we will have advanced technological interventions to warn us of danger that will be functionally similar to suffering, but without the nasty raw feels.   \nPeter Singer, like David Pearce, suggests that if we could eliminate suffering of non-human animals that are capable of suffering, perhaps in some way that is difficult to imagine now - that this would be a good thing.\n\"I would see no reason to regret the absence of suffering\"  - Peter Singer\nPeter can't see any regret to lament the disappearance of suffering, though perhaps people may say it would be useful to help understand literature of the past.  Perhaps there are some indirect uses for suffering - but on balance Peter thinks that the elimination of suffering would be an amazingly good thing to do.\n\nSinger thinks it is interesting to speculate what might be possible for the future of human beings, if we do survive over the longer term?  To what extent are we going to be able to enhance ourselves?  In particular to what extent are we going to be more ethical human beings - which brings to question 'Moral Enhancement'. \n\nHave we made Progress in Ethics?  Peter argues for the case that our species has expanded the circle of our ethical concern we have in his book 'The Expanding Circle', and more recently Steven Pinker took up this idea in 'Better Angels Of Our Nature' - and this has happened over the millennia, beyond initially the tribal group, then to a national level, beyond ethnic groups to all human beings, and now we are starting to expand moral concern to non-human sentient beings as well.  \n\nSteven Pinker thinks that increases in our ethical consideration is bound up with increases in our intelligence (as proposed by James Flynn - the Flynn Effect - though this research is controversial (it could be actual increases in intelligence or just the ability to do more abstract reasoning)) and increases in our ability to reason abstractly.\n\nAs mentioned earlier there are other ways in which we may increase our ability and tendancy to be more moral (see Moral Enhancement), and in the future we may discover genes that may influence us to think more about others, to dwell less on negative emotions like anger or rage.  It is hard to say whether people will use these kinds of moral enhancers voluntarily, or whether we need state policies to encourage people to use moral enhances in order to produce better communities - and there are a lot of concerns here that people may legitimately have about how the moral enhancement project takes place.  Peter sees this as a facinating prospect and that it would be great to be around to see how things develop over the next couple of centuries.\n\nNote Steven Pinker said of Peter's book \"Singer's theory of the expanding circle remains an enormously insightful concept, which reconciles the existence of human nature with political and moral progress. It was also way ahead of its time. . . . It's wonderful to see this insightful book made available to a new generation of readers and scholars.\"\n\nOn Moral Enhancement see Julian Savulescu's writings on the subject.\n\nThe Expanding Circle - http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9434.html - What is ethics? Where do moral standards come from? Are they based on emotions, reason, or some innate sense of right and wrong? For many scientists, the key lies entirely in biology--especially in Darwinian theories of evolution and self-preservation. But if evolution is a struggle for survival, why are we still capable of altruism?\n\nIn his classic study The Expanding Circle, Peter Singer argues that altruism began as a genetically based drive to protect one's kin and community members but has developed into a consciously chosen ethic with an expanding circle of moral concern. Drawing on philosophy and evolutionary psychology, he demonstrates that human ethics cannot be explained by biology alone. Rather, it is our capacity for reasoning that makes moral progress possible. In a new afterword, Singer takes stock of his argument in light of recent research on the evolution of morality.\n\nThe Flynn Effect: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect \n\nPeter Singer - Ethics, Evolution & Moral Progress  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91UQAptxDn8\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "David Pearce -Timescales of the Hedonistic Imperative",
    "description": "\"The blueprint set out [in the Hedonistic Imperative] outlines only a cartoonish prototype of a mature post-Darwinian paradise. Its sketch of likely future neuro-scientific breakthroughs may well be wrong both in its few specifics and its projected time-scales. Experts in the relevant specialist fields will doubtless wince, at least in places. For The Hedonistic Imperative consists in a hand-waving, cross-disciplinary romp through dauntingly complex specialist topics. Inevitably, some of the pop neuroscience is simplistic to the point of parody. Eyebrows should be raised, too, at the dogmatic brevity with which various philosophical problems deserving book-length treatment are dispatched in a single sentence. The multitude of practical, medico-legal and socio-political problems which fulfilling our neurochemical Manifest Destiny will entail are largely passed over as well.\n\n         These caveats are important. Yet leaving them aside, the biological program may be divided, somewhat arbitrarily, into three stages. They are here ranked in order of difficulty. Luckily, the stages happen to coincide in relative ethical importance, since crude harm-reduction, cruelty-prevention and pain-abolition are easier to accomplish than refining the architectural subtleties of paradise. Less happily, any biochemical description of the mechanics of the sublime just travesties the nature of the experience itself. The sub-academese prose below unavoidably debases what it aims to evoke. This is because of the contaminated associations of any terms associated with drug-abuse, genetic engineering, eugenics, or even the emotionally frigid atmosphere of the laboratory. Our present perspective on utopian biopsychiatry is jaundiced. For our education system virtually ignores the neurobiological foundations of all emotional life. Happily, that system also provides the formal tools for us to describe and escape from our predicament.\" \n\n\"Unfortunately, there's no way to map out the extent of our cognitive closure from within. This is frustrating. If quantum cosmologists can theorise about the first 10-43 second after the Big Bang, thirteen billion and more years ago, and still, rightly, be counted as practising hard science, it's a shame that conjectures we do make about the living world a few thousand or million years hence have to be treated, not even as soft science, but as science-fiction. There are too many unknown unknowns to predict with any rational confidence. Merely extrapolating present trends is bound to mislead. The projected time-scales of even relatively predictable biomedical triumphs, e.g. the elimination of the ageing process, are vague. HI may veer towards heady speculation; but by the end of third millennium, life and consciousness may be more foreign to the contemporary imagination than even the most extravagant prediction dreamed up here. On the other hand, for all we know, some variant of the pleasure-principle is a universal - and universally intelligible - signature of sentient life; and its apotheosis in some sort of sublime cosmic orgasm is the ultimate destiny of the Universe. [This may overtax one's credulity; the Big Bang indeed!] We simply don't have enough evidence. That said, we may still incautiously proceed.\n\n        Once suffering has been abolished, the era of old-fashioned moral choices will come to an end. The physiological mechanisms underlying the mind-brain's value-creation processes will be unravelled during the invention of a pain-free world; but the kind of naturalised, mind-dependent value created by paradise-engineers after the phenomenology of nastiness has disappeared won't embrace ethical categories in a sense we presently understand. The heroic moral urgency will have gone; indeed there is a risk that truly hedonistic themes as discussed in these sections of HI will divert attention away from the utter moral seriousness of the whole post-Darwinian project as conceived today. \"\n\nThe Hedonistic Imperative - Chapter 1: http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon1.htm\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Adam Ford records IEET Fellow, David Pearce on the topic of “Politics & Abolition From Suffering.” David Pearce believes that libertarian-socialist ideals (a needed term because American Libertarians have hijacked the original definition of “libertarian”) will probably lead the way to the freedom for parents to choose their children’s genes, and for society to abolish any need or want for factory farms, condemning them as one of the cruelest institutions to have ever existed. http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/pearce20140922z\n\nDavid Pearce (born 3 April) is a British philosopher. He promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His book-length internet manifesto The Hedonistic Imperative outlines how technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, pharmacology, and neurosurgery could potentially converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals, replacing suffering with gradients of well-being, a project he refers to as \"paradise engineering\".\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "\"Well, there are technical obstacles and ideological obstacles to the abolitionist project. But if one deals first with the technical challenges, I think there are essentially three options. One is wireheading. Wireheading is (probably) a dead-end. But it is illuminating because the procedure shows that pleasure has no physiological tolerance. That is to say, it’s just as exhilarating having one’s pleasure centers stimulated 24 hours after starting a binge as it was at the beginning....\"\n\n\"The neural basis of our so-called basic moods and emotions is simpler than so-called higher cognitive functions. But undeniably, this neural basis is still fiendishly complicated, the simplicity of wireheading notwithstanding. For instance, the mesolimbic dopamine system may not be, as we’ve sometimes supposed, the final common pathway of pleasure in the brain: dopamine apparently mediates “wanting” (i.e. incentive-motivation) as much as “liking”, which is signaled by activation of the mu opioid receptors. But if we focus here on the simple monoamines, an obvious target for intervention is indeed the mesolimbic dopamine system. One of the most common objections to the idea of abolishing suffering – ignoring here the prospect of full-blown paradise-engineering – is that without the spur of discontent we’d soon become idle and even bored. “If we were all happy, what would we do all day?” But enhanced dopamine function is associated, not just with euphoria, but with heightened motivation; a deeper sense of meaningfulness, significance and purpose; and an increased sensitivity to a greater range of rewards. So one possible option for paradise engineering is to focus on enriching the dopaminergic system to promote (a genetic predisposition to) lifestyles of high achievement and intellectual productivity.\n\nThat’s one option at least. Another sort of predisposition is to pursue a lifetime of introspection, meditation and blissful tranquility. If I seem to dwell unduly on ways of enriching dopamine function, that’s because exploring its amplification is a useful corrective to a widespread misconception i.e. that happiness inevitably leads to stagnation. The critical point, I think, is that to be blissful isn’t the same as being blissed out.\"\n.See: http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/interview.html\n\nDavid Pearce (born 3 April) is a British philosopher.

    "title": "What is Utilitarianism? David Pearce Explains",
    "description": "David Pearce discusses various forms of Utilitarianism and there (sometimes less obvious) implications.\n== Hedonistic Utilitarianism: \"A utilitarian theory which assumes that the rightness of an action depends entirely on the amount of pleasure it tends to produce and the amount of pain it tends to prevent. Bentham's utilitarianism is hedonistic. Although he describes the good not only as pleasure, but also as happiness, benefit, advantage, etc., he treats these concepts as more or less synonymous, and seems to think of them as reducible to pleasure. John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism, also described as hedonistic, differs importantly from Bentham's in taking some pleasures to be higher than other ones, so that when considering the values of the consequences of an action, not only the quantity but also the quality of pleasure has to be considered. This complicates the summing up, or may even make it impossible.\" - The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy\n\n== Negative Utilitarianism: Ethical negative-utilitarianism is a value-system which challenges the moral symmetry of pleasure and pain. It doesn't question the value of enhancing the happiness of the already happy. Yet it attaches value in a distinctively moral sense of the term only to actions which tend to minimise or eliminate suffering. This is what matters above all else. The doctrine is counter-intuitive, not least insofar as it entails that from a purely ethical perspective it wouldn't matter if nothing at all had existed, or everything ceased to exist. Indeed, if the option were humanly available, the logic of the position morally obligates bringing the world to an end were this the only way to banish the suffering endemic to it.\n\n         Happily, there is a much better way to rid the natural world of its endemic nastiness. This is to use biotechnology to eradicate aversive experience in all sentient life. Life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed. In the post-Darwinian Era, applied nanotechnology will extend hedonic engineering to all life-forms on the planet.\n\n        Following through the logical implications of this seemingly bizarre and perverse perspective is clearly not for the faint-hearted. Yet negative utilitarianism doesn't derive from self-hatred or some nihilistic death-wish. It stems instead from a deep sense of compassion at the sheer scale and intensity of suffering in the world. No amount of happiness or fun enjoyed by some organisms can notionally justify the indescribable horrors of Auschwitz. Nor can it outweigh the sporadic frightfulness of pain and despair that occurs every second of every day.\n\n       Read more at:  see: http://www.hedweb.com/negutil.htm\n\nThe instrumental case from means-ends rationality derives from the broad applicability of psychological hedonism. This isn't here\nconstrued as a universal law. It's just a trite everyday rule of thumb: we spend a lot of time trying to make ourselves happy. Often we fail.\nHI achieves what we're striving for with unique efficiency and success. The ethical utilitarian case for HI, on the other hand,\nrests partly on a conception of how morality can be naturalised consistently with a recognisably scientific account of the nature of the world. Value is here construed as a distinctive - and biologically maximisable - mode of experience. Its subjective texture is coded by a particular type of biomolecular architecture. That architecture can be enriched and extended. Positive value can be maximised. Negative value can eventually be eliminated. Thus HI, it will be claimed, amounts to rather more than one individual's quirky conjectures and value-judgements. The biological program is also our natural destiny. The coming of the pain-free post-Darwinian\nEra will mark both a major transition in the evolution of life and the moral foundation of any future civilisation. \n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Three dominant areas of Transhumanism: super longevity, super intelligence and super well-being.\n\nTranshumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international cultural and intellectual movement with an eventual goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition by developing and making widely available technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of developing and using such technologies. They speculate that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with such greatly expanded abilities as to merit the label \"posthuman\".\n\nDavid Pearce (born 3 April) is a British philosopher.

    "description": "The philosophy of biology is a subfield of philosophy of science, which deals with epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical issues in the biological and biomedical sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., Aristotle, Descartes, and even Kant), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s. Philosophers of science then began paying increasing attention to biology, from the rise of Neodarwinism in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 to more recent advances in genetic engineering. Other key ideas include the reduction of all life processes to biochemical reactions, and the incorporation of psychology into a broader neuroscience.\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n@john_s_wilkins  #philsci",

    "title": "John Wilkins - Physicalism & Materialism",
    "description": "Materialism was a pre-socratic view that for something to be real it has to be matter - physical stuff made of atoms (which at the time were considered hard like billiard balls - fundametal parts of reality).  The reason these days the term physicalism is used is because it can describe things that aren't matter - like forces, or aren't observable matter - like dark matter, or energy or fields, or spacetime etc..  Physicalism is the idea that all that exist can be described in the language of some 'ideal' physics - we may never know what this ideal physics is, though people think that it is something close to our current physics (as we can make very accurate predictions with our current physics).\n\nIf magic, telepathy or angels were real, there would be a physics that could describe them - they'd have patterns and properties that would be describable and explainable.  A physicist would likely think that even the mind operates according to physical rules.  Being a physicalist according to John means you think everything is governed by rules, physical rules - and that there is an ideal language that can be used to describe all this.\n\nArticle: http://scifuture.org/physicalism-materialism-john-wilkins/\n\nWikipedia says:\nIn philosophy, physicalism is the ontological thesis that \"everything is physical\", that there is \"nothing over and above\" the physical, or that everything supervenes on the physical. Physicalism is a form of ontological monism—a \"one substance\" view of the nature of reality as opposed to a \"two-substance\" (dualism) or \"many-substance\" (pluralism) view. Both the definition of physical and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.\n\nPhysicalism is closely related to materialism. Physicalism grew out of materialism with the success of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of physics describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law). Common arguments against physicalism include both the philosophical zombie argument and the multiple observers argument,that the existence of a physical being may imply zero or more distinct conscious entities.\n\n\"When I lost my belief in religion I had to decide what I needed to accept as a bare minimum. I decided that I needed to believe in the physical world. I never found the slightest reason to accept the existence of anything else. To this day I am a physicalist only because I never found the need to be anything else.\n\n    The principle of parsimony suggests that one should not believe in more than one needs to. Even if it does make you feel comfortable.\"\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n@john_s_wilkins  #philsci",

    "description": "In his 2009 book 'The Life You Can Save', Singer presented the thought experiment of a child drowning in a pond before our eyes, something we would all readily intervene to prevent, even if it meant ruining an expensive pair of shoes we were wearing. He argued that, in fact, we are in a very similar ethical situation with respect to many people in the developing world: there are life-saving interventions, such as vaccinations and clean water, that can be provided at only a relatively small cost to ourselves. Given this, Singer argues that we in the west should give up some of our luxuries to help those in the world who are most in need.\n\nBlog Post: http://www.scifuture.org/peter-singer-ethics-utilitarianism-effective-altruism\n\nAround this central idea a new movement has emerged over the past few years known as Effective Altruism, which seeks to use the best evidence available in order to help the most people and do the most good with the limited resources that we have available. Associated with this movement are organisations such as GiveWell, which evaluates the relative effectiveness of different charities, and Giving What We Can, which encourages members to pledge to donate 10% or more of their income to effective poverty relief programs\n\n0:00 Intro\n5:55 Bridging the Is-ought gap\n45:51 More on grounding morality\n47:09 Sources in which the objectivity of utilitarianism is defended\n1:23:21 Even more sources on morality: On what matters (Derek Parfit)\n\n\nBook 'The Point of View of the Universe - Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics' - by Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer : http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199603695.do\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

Effective altruists consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.

    "description": "Magician James Randi (known as ‘The Amazing Randi’) has spent the bulk of his career debunking the claims of self-proclaimed psychics and paranormalists. Randi has an international reputation as a magician and escape artist, but he is perhaps best known as the world’s most tireless investigator and de-mystifier of paranormal and pseudoscientific claims.\n\nThe event is run as the first and exclusive public screening of Randi’s new biographical documentary, ‘An Honest Liar’ followed by a fireside chat and Q&A session to hear the tales of this (de)mystifying 86-year-old.\n\nThose attending the event will have a unique opportunity to learn more about the wonderful world of magic and skepticism in an entertaining light with this mastermind. With a cult following, An evening with James Randi will be another sold-out Think Inc. event.\n\nThe Amazing Randi has pursued ‘psychic’ spoon benders, exposed the dirty tricks of faith healers, investigated homeopathic water ‘with a memory,’ and generally been a thorn in the sides of those who try to pull the wool over the public’s eyes in the name of the supernatural. Randi is also starring in his own biographical documentary ‘An Honest Liar,’ which will be screened alongside his fireside chat across four Australian cities.\n\nHe has received numerous awards and recognitions, including a MacArthur Foundation Prize Fellowship (also known as the ‘MacArthur ‘Genius’ Grant’) in 1986. He’s the author of numerous books, including Flim-Flam!: Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions (1982), The Truth About Uri Geller (1982), The Faith Healers (1987), and An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural (1995).\n\nIn 1996, the James Randi Education Foundation was established to further Randi’s work. Randi’s long-standing challenge to psychics now stands as a $1,000,000 prize administered by the Foundation. It remains unclaimed.\n\n\n\n\nThe Amazing Randi brought his unique superheroic brand of sceptic justice to Australia: http://thinkinc.org.au/jamesrandi/\n\n\nFor all media inquires please contact suzi[at]novacane.com.au\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question \"how is the success of science to be explained?\" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make valid claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables, as opposed to instrumentalism.\nPoints Covered:\nIS THERE SUCH A THING AS A GENE?\nARE SPECIES REAL?\nWHAT DOES SCIENCE IMPLY?\nWHAT DOES SCIENCE MEAN?\nQUESTIONS OF REALITY\nANTI-REALISM\nIS PHILOSOPHY A WASTE OF TIME?\n\nwww.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-nature-of-classification-john-s-wilkins/?K=9780230347922\n\nScientific realism and inference to the best explanation\nA major argument for the existence of the entities in scientific theories is that if these entities did not, on the whole, exist, the empirical adequacy of the theories would be miraculous.

    "description": "Frequentist inference is one of a number of possible techniques of formulating generally applicable schemes for making statistical inference: That implies of drawing conclusions from sample data by the emphasis on the frequency or proportion of the data. An alternative name is frequentist statistics. This is the inference framework in which the well-established methodologies of statistical hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are based. Other than frequentistic inference, the main alternative approach to statistical inference is Bayesian inference, while another is fiducial inference.\n\nWhile \"Bayesian inference\" is sometimes held to include the approach to inference leading to optimal decisions, a more restricted view is taken here for simplicity.\n\n--\n\nIn statistics, Bayesian inference is a method of inference in which Bayes' rule is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired. Bayesian updating is an important technique throughout statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics. For some cases, exhibiting a Bayesian derivation for a statistical method automatically ensures that the method works as well as any competing method. Bayesian updating is especially important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a range of fields including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine and law.\n\nIn the philosophy of decision theory, Bayesian inference is closely related to discussions of subjective probability, often called \"Bayesian probability\". Bayesian probability provides a rational method for updating beliefs.\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n@john_s_wilkins  #philsci",

    "title": "John Wilkins - The Demarcation Problem - Science & Pseudoscience",
    "description": "See: http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/12/04/the-demarcation-problem-again - The issue is (raised, as always, by the existence of woo science, antiscience, and pseudoscience) how do we know when something is, or isn’t, science? This is often called the “demarcation problem” (DP hereafter). I’m going to offer a couple of ways to do this, based on the notion that science, like every other historical entity, evolves.\n\nJanet discusses Popper’s “solution” – something is science if it is potentially falsifiable. Leaving aside the problems with the notion of falsifiability, and indeed the problems with the whole Popperian view of science (which I happen to think is fundamentally incomplete and deeply flawed, in that it excludes around three quarters of what scientists actually do), let’s consider if there might not be other ways to determine if something is science or not.\n\nThere are three classes, broadly speaking, of claims that vie for science status. One are those that are simply not at issue; they just are science by almost universal consent. These include the tenets of relativity theory, atomism, germ theory, immunology, genetics, the expanding universe, and yes, evolution. Anyone who denies that these are scientific theories or precepts is simply outside the pale of viable hypotheses.\n\nThe second class is that of obviously unscientific claims. Now these are not defined purely in terms of being the denial of established scientific views, as they are also inclusive of ethical claims, aesthetic claims, and other normative or fact-insensitive propositions, as well as those things that are just wrong. So, being nonscientific is not in itself a Bad Thing. Being nonscience that claims to be science is, and being nonscience that claims to be science but has been shown to be false is the Worst Thing.\n\nBut there is a third “class”, if we can call it that: the Grey Area. Things that might be science or might not, we just don’t know. And this, you may be surprised to know, is by far the largest class, because there are indefinitely many things we do not know if they are right or wrong, empirically decideable or not. How much of that very large class shall we allow to be included in the “might-be science” category? When is it woo and when is it reasonable?\n\n-- \n\nAlso see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUm_7lo_eXA\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n@john_s_wilkins  #philsci",

    "title": "John Wilkins - Philosophy of Science - An Introduction",
    "description": "See this post by John Wilkins at Evolving Thoughts: http://evolvingthoughts.net/2011/07/why-do-philosophy-of-science/\nEvery so often, somebody will attack the worth, role or relevance of philosophy on the internets, as I have discussed before. Occasionally it will be a scientist, who usually conflates philosophy with theology. This is as bad as someone assuming that because I do some philosophy I must have the Meaning of Life (the answer is, variously, 12 year old Scotch, good chocolate, or dental hygiene).\n\nBut it raises an interesting question or two: what is the reason to do philosophy in relation to science? being the most obvious (and thus set up the context in which you can answer questions like: are there other ways to find truth than science?). So I thought I would briefly give my reasons for that.\n\nWhen philosophy began around 500BCE, there was no distinction between science and philosophy, nor, for that matter, between religion and philosophy. Arguably, science began when the pre-Socratics started to ask what the natures of things were that made them behave as they did, and equally arguably the first actual empirical scientist was Aristotle (and, I suspect, his graduate students).\n\nBut a distinction between science and philosophy began with the separation between natural philosophy (roughly what we now call science) and moral philosophy, which dealt with things to do with human life and included what we should believe about the world, including moral, theological and metaphysical beliefs. The natural kind was involved in considering the natures or things. A lot gets packed into that simple word, nature: it literally means “in-born” (natus) and the Greek physikos means much the same. Of course, something can be in-born only if it is born that way (yes, folks, she’s playing on some old tropes here!), and most physical things aren’t born at all, but the idea was passed from living to nonliving things, and so natural philosophy was born. That way.\n\nIn the period after Francis Bacon, natural philosophy was something that depended crucially on observation, and so the Empiricists arose: Locke, Berkeley, Hobbes, and later Hume. That these names are famous in philosophy suggests something: philosophy does best when it is trying to elucidate science itself. And when William Whewell in 1833 coined the term scientist to denote those who sought scientia or knowledge, science had begun its separation from the rest of philosophy.\n\nOr imperfectly, anyway. For a start the very best scientists of the day, including Babbage, Buckland and Whewell himself wrote philosophical tomes alongside theologians and philosophers. And the tradition continues until now, such as the recent book by Stephen Hawking in which he declares the philosophical enterprise is dead, a decidedly philosophical claim to make. Many scientists seem to find the doing of philosophy inevitable.\n\nSo why do I do philosophy of science? Simply because it is where the epistemic action is: science is where we do get knowledge, and I wish to understand how and why, and the limitations. All else flows from this for me. Others I know (and respect) do straight metaphysics and philosophy of language, but I do not. It only has a bite if it gives some clarity to science. I think this is also true of metaphysics, ethics and such matters as philosophy of religion.\n\nNow there are those who think that science effectively exhausts our knowledge-gathering. This, too, is a philosophical position, which has to be defended, and elaborated (thus causing more philosophy to be done). I don’t object to that view, but for me, it is better to be positive (say that science gives us knowledge even if other activities may do) than to be negative (deny that anything but science gives us knowledge). It may be that we get to the latter position after considering the former; if so, that would be a philosophical result.\n\nI am fascinated by science. It allows us to do things no ancient Greek (or West Semitic) thinker would have been even able to conceive of. It means we make fewer mistakes. Philosophy is, and ought only to be, in the service of knowledge (I’m sure somebody has said that before). Science is a good first approximation of that.\n\nBut scientists who reject philosophy, as if that very rejection is not a philosophical stance (probably taken unreflectively or on the basis of half-digested emotive appeals), them I have no time for as philosophers.

    "title": "David Pearce - High-Tech Jainism",
    "description": "\"I can understand why many will, in some sense, \"switch off\" if one is talking about technologies and events that are going to be happening, unfolding, later this century and beyond. \nBut insofar as we aspire to be ethical agents, I think we do have a responsibility to consider the long-term future of sentient life in the universe, starting with our own planet.\" -  David Pearce\n\n“Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.”\n―Edward Gibbon\n\n\"May all that have life be delivered from suffering\", said Gautama Buddha. The vision of a happy biosphere isn't new. Jains, for instance, aim never to hurt another sentient being by word or deed. But all projects of secular and religious utopianism have foundered on the rock of human nature. Evolution didn't design us to be happy.\n\nYet the living world is poised for a major evolutionary transition. Natural selection has thrown up a species able to self-edit its own genetic source code; phase out experience below \"hedonic zero\"; and engineer the well-being of all sentience in our forward light-cone. Intelligent agents will shortly be able to pre-select their own hedonic range: its upper and lower bounds, and hedonic set-points. Posthuman life can be animated by gradients of intelligent bliss - a default hedonic tone orders of magnitude richer than today's peak experiences.\n\nWhy Does Suffering Exist?\nNo one knows why suffering exists at all. To the best of our knowledge, unpleasant experience doesn't play any irreplaceable or computationally unique role in intelligent agents. Inorganic robots can be programmed or trained up to avoid and respond to noxious stimuli without undergoing subjective distress. Likewise, nonbiological machines can functionally replicate the role of our nastier core emotions without their \"raw feels\" - the ugly implementation detail that blights so many lives today.\n\nFortunately, solving the problem of suffering doesn't depend on our first solving the Hard Problem of consciousness. Neuroscanning and the tools of molecular biology are deciphering the \"neural correlates of consciousness\". If we use biotechnology to eradicate the molecular signature of experience below \"hedonic zero\", then on some fairly modest assumptions, phenomenal suffering becomes physically impossible.\n\nSo a practical question arises. Which existing psychological functions should we enrich, replicate or scrap? What kinds of function are best offloaded onto smart prostheses rather than biologically tweaked? Ideally, adaptations such as a predisposition to jealous behaviour might be abolished along with their nasty subjective textures. Such Darwinian traits have few defenders, even among bioconservatives. Other roles, notably nociception, will presumably be functionally essential for sentient beings to flourish for the foreseeable future - and perhaps indefinitely. Initially, preimplantation genetic screening of prospective children can ensure tomorrow's humans are endowed with benign, \"low-pain\" alleles of e.g. the SCN9A(1) gene to modulate pain-sensitivity. People blessed with high pain tolerance aren't vulnerable to the life-threatening information-processing deficits of congenital analgesia. Eventually, the avoidance of noxious stimuli can be offloaded onto smart inorganic prostheses, allowing life based entirely on information-sensitive gradients of bliss. \n\n\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/neojainism.html\n\nAudio: https://archive.org/details/DavidPearceHighTechJainism\n\n“Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.” ―Edward Gibbon\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "David Pearce (interviewed by Adam Ford) discusses the difference between Physicalism & Materialism - and also discusses Strawsonian Physicalism - the idea that consciousness discloses the intrinsic nature of the physical.  May answer which breathes fire into the equations. \nWhat makes our minds distinctive - isn't that we are composed of novel stuff (along the conjecture that we everything is made up of fields of experience) - is that they support bound phenomenal consciousness.  A Neurosurgeon may detect modules in the brain that are responsible for many things (vision processing, auditory perception, etc) but they can't - for whatever reason - find that they are bound in phenomenal objects apprehended by a unitary phenomenal self.\n\nBlog post here: http://www.scifuture.org/materialism-vs-physicalism-and-strawsonian-physicalism-with-david-pearce/\n\nPHYSICALISTIC IDEALISM\nDoes reductive physicalism entail monistic idealism?\nA testable conjecture about the nature of the physical world. \n\nNatural science promises a complete story of the world. No \"element of reality\" should be missing from the mathematical formalism of physics, i.e. relativistic quantum field theory or its more speculative extensions. The Standard Model is extraordinarily well tested. Within its conceptual framework, consciousness would seem not only causally impotent but physically impossible. Hence the \"Explanatory Gap\" and the Hard Problem of consciousness.\n\nIn recent years, a minority of researchers have proposed that the Hard Problem may be an artefact of materialist metaphysics. Contra Kant, but following Schopenhauer, Russell, Lockwood, Strawson, et al., the new idealists conjecture that the phenomenology of one's mind reveals the intrinsic nature of the physical - the elusive \"fire\" in the equations about which physics is silent. Our ordinary presupposition that the intrinsic character of the physical is devoid of phenomenal properties is an additional metaphysical assumption. This is hugely plausible, for sure, but not a scientific discovery. Perhaps most tellingly, the only part of the \"fire\" in the equations to which one ever enjoys direct access, i.e. one's own consciousness, discloses phenomenal properties that are inconsistent with a materialist ontology.\n\nUntestability cuts both ways. Any conjecture that the world's fundamental quantum fields - and, presumably, fundamental macroscopic quantum phenomena such as superconductors or superfluid helium - are intrinsically experiential would seem unfalsifiable too: just speculative metaphysics.\n\nRather surprisingly, we shall see this isn't the case. \n\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/physicalism/\n\nAlso of interest is John Wilkins on Materialism & Physicalism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xn5w_KcdII\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nScience, Technology & the Future\n\n2014 08 05 19 59 00",

    "title": "Hugo de Garis - Innovating Beyond the Nanoscale, Femtometer Scale Technology",
    "description": "Femtotech: Computing at the femtometer scale using quarks and gluons\nHow the properties of quarks and gluons can be used (in principle) to perform computation at the femtometer (10^-15 meter) scale.\n\nI’ve been thinking on and off for two decades about the possibility of a femtotech. Now that nanotech is well established, and well funded, I feel that the time is right to start thinking about the possibility of a femtotech.\n\nYou may ask, “What about picotech?” — technology at the picometer (10-12m) scale. The simple answer to this question is that nature provides nothing at the picometer scale. An atom is about 10-10 m in size.\n\nThe next smallest thing in nature is the nucleus, which is about 100,000 times smaller, i.e., 10-15 m in size — a femtometer, or “fermi.” A nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons (i.e., “nucleons”), which we now know are composed of 3 quarks, which are bound (“glued”) together by massless (photon-like) particles called “gluons.”\n\nHence if one wanted to start thinking about a possible femtotech, one would probably need to start looking at how quarks and gluons behave, and see if these behaviors might be manipulated in such a way as to create a technology, i.e., computation and engineering (building stuff).\n\nIn this essay, I concentrate on the computation side, since my background is in computer science. Before I started ARCing (After Retirement Careering), I was a computer science professor who gave himself zero chance of getting a grant from conservative NSF or military funders in the U.S. to speculate on the possibilities of a femtotech. But now that I’m no longer a “wager,” I’m free to do what I like, and can join the billion strong “army” of ARCers, to pursue my own passions.\n\nSo I started studying QCD (quantum chromodynamics), the mathematical physics theory of the strong force, or as it is known in more modern terms, the “color force.”\n\nSince I have a computer science background, I knew what to look for when sniffing through QCD text books, to be able to map computer science concepts to QCD phenomena.\n\nBits and logic gates : the heart of computation\n\nIf you want to compute at the femto level, how do you do that? What would you need? To me, the essential ingredients of (digital) computing are bits and logic gates.\n\nA bit is a two-state system (e.g., voltage or no voltage, a closed or open switch, etc.) that can be switched from one state to another. It is usual to represent one of these states as “1” and the other as “0,” i.e., as binary digits. A logic gate is a device that can take bits as input and use their states (their 0 or 1 values) to calculate its output.\n\nThe three most famous gates, are the NOT gate, the OR gate, and the AND gate. The NOT gate switches a 1 to a 0, and a 0 to a 1. An OR gate outputs a 1 if one or more of its two inputs is a 1, else outputs a 0. An AND gate outputs a 1 only if the first AND second inputs are both 1, else outputs a 0.\n\nThere is a famous theorem in theoretical computer science, that says that the set of 3 logic gates {NOT, OR, AND} are “computationally universal,” i.e., using them, you can build any Boolean logic gate to detect any Boolean expression (e.g. (~X & Y) OR (W & Z)).\n\nSo if I can find a one to one mapping between these 3 logic gates and phenomena in QCD, I can compute anything in QCD. I would have femtometer-scale computation. That was the big prize I was after.\n\nSo, I set out to find phenomena in QCD that I could map bits and logic gates to. I was quickly rewarded. It was a case of “low hanging fruit.” I just happened to be the first person (as far as I know) wandering around the QCD orchard with a very specific type of cherry picking in mind.\n\nhttp://www.kurzweilai.net/femtotech-computing-at-the-femtometer-scale-using-quarks-and-gluons\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Discussion on the SCN9A & ADRA2B gene variants, the MDMA drug, and 'Utopian Pharmacology' - Mental Health in the Third Millennium MDMA and Beyond.\n\nGENE VARIANTS EFFECTING WELL BEING\n\n== SCN9A gene - \"odium channel, voltage-gated, type IX, alpha subunit\"\n\nThe SCN9A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.\n\nThe SCN9A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.7. NaV1.7 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals. Nociceptors are part of the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain. Nociceptors are primarily involved in transmitting pain signals. The centers of nociceptors, known as the cell bodies, are located in a part of the spinal cord called the dorsal root ganglion. Fibers called axons extend from the cell bodies, reaching throughout the body to receive sensory information. Axons transmit the information back to the dorsal root ganglion, which then sends it to the brain. NaV1.7 sodium channels are also found in olfactory sensory neurons, which are nerve cells in the nasal cavity that transmit smell-related signals to the brain.\n\n\n== ADRA2B - Alpha-2B adrenergic receptor - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-2B_adrenergic_receptor\nIn October 2013 researchers from the University of British Columbia confirmed this and further reported that the variant predisposed those people who had it to focus more on negative aspects of a situation. Prof. Rebecca Todd claimed \"This is the first study to find that this genetic variation can significantly affect how people see and experience the world.” http://news.ubc.ca/2013/10/10/genes-predispose-some-people-to-focus-on-the-negative\n\nhttp://adra2b.com/\n\n\n== MDMA / Ecstasy /  UTOPIAN PHARMACOLOGY\nhttp://www.mdma.net/  Mental Health in the Third Millennium\nMDMA and Beyond\n\nCan safe, sustainable analogues of MDMA be developed? There is an urgent need for non-neurotoxic empathogens and entactogens suitable for lifelong use. Alas no single \"magic bullet\" yet exists that replicates the subjective effects of MDMA on a long-term basis. Hence most of us are doomed to display the quasi-psychopathic indifference to each other characteristic of the MDMA-naïve state.\n\n In the long run, genomic medicine can underwrite mental and physical superhealth for everyone. For in principle, lifelong well-being can be genetically hardwired from conception. In the short run, better-designed research tools and therapeutic agents can probe, and then repair, our damaged minds. As chemical stopgaps go, MDMA is a magical revelation. It's perhaps the best aid to insight-oriented psychotherapy ever synthesized. Tragically, when MDMA is used to excess the outcome can be harmful, not healing. So as a weekend club drug, MDMA is seriously flawed. Today, of course, empathogens and entactogens are outlawed for any purpose. The altered states of consciousness they induce are criminalised. People who take such agents are stigmatised as \"drug abusers\". Yet some MDMA users feel, rightly or wrongly, they've been granted a tantalising glimpse of what true mental health may be like in centuries to come; and an insight into what the rest of us are missing.  http://www.mdma.net/\n\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Dr. Stefan Lorenz Sorgner is director and co-founder of the Beyond Humanism Network, Fellow at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) and teaches philosophy at the University of Erfurt. He studied philosophy at King's College/University of London (BA), the University of Durham (MA by thesis; examiners: David E. Cooper, Durham ; David Owen, Southampton), the University of Giessen and the University of Jena (Dr. phil.; examiners: Wolfgang Welsch, Jena; Gianni Vattimo, Turin). In recent years, he taught at the Universities of Jena (Germany), Erfurt (Germany), Klagenfurt (Austria) and Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany). His main fields of research are Nietzsche, the philosophy of music, bioethics and meta-, post- and transhumanism.\nArticle: http://www.scifuture.org/?p=3261 http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/pellissier20120423 www.sorgner.de\nOverman / Übermensch\nDid Nietzsche have something like Transhumanism in mind when he wrote about the Übermensch?\n\nWill to Power & Transhumanism\n\nThe Last Man\n\n\"To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities - I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures.\" (The Will to Power, p 481)\nDo we live in a world where we need these types of suffering to become better people?  Why do you think Nietzsche's measure of worth was ones ability to ‘endure’?\n\n\n\"You want, if possible - and there is no more insane \"if possible\" - to abolish suffering. And we? It really seems that we would rather have it higher and worse than ever. Well-being as you understand it - that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state that soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible - that makes his destruction desirable. The discipline of suffering, of great suffering - do you not know that only this discipline has created all enhancements of man so far?\"\n(Beyond Good and Evil, p 225 )\n\n\"I do not point to the evil and pain of existence with the finger of reproach, but rather entertain the hope that life may one day become more evil and more full of suffering than it has ever been.\" - Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)\n\n\"Bostrom rejects Nietzsche as an ancestor of the transhumanist movement, as he claims that there were merely some “surface-level similarities with the Nietzschean vision” (Bostrom 2005a, 4). In contrast to Bostrom, I think that significant similarities between the posthuman and the overhuman can be found on a fundamental level. In addition, it seems to me that Nietzsche explained the relevance of the overhuman by referring to a dimension which seems to be lacking in transhumanism. In order to explain my position, I will progress as follows. First, I will compare the concept of the posthuman to that of Nietzsche’s overhuman,  focusing more on their similarities than their differences. Second, I will contextualise the overhuman in Nietzsche’s general vision, so that I can point out which dimension seems to me to be lacking in transhumanist thought.\"\nhttp://jetpress.org/v20/sorgner.htm\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\n\nAlso see David Pearce's view on whether Nietzsche was a Transhumanist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vOP3uEHEdc \n2014 08 02 01 16 09",

    "description": "\"What's the worst that could happen?\" - 16 years ago Robin Hanson said: “Humanity seems to have a bright future, i.e., a non-trivial chance of expanding to fill the universe with lasting life. But the fact that space near us seems dead now tells us that any given piece of dead matter faces an astronomically low chance of begating such a future. There thus exists a great filter between death and expanding lasting life, and humanity faces the ominous question: how far along this filter are we?” : http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html\n\nPost on SciFuture: http://www.scifuture.org/the-great-filter-a-possible-explanation-for-the-fermi-paradox-interview-with-robin-hanson/\n\nRefuge Markets: http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/07/refuge-markets.html\nRefuge Resorts: http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/12/compare-refuges-resorts.html\nGalaxy Calc Shows Aliens: http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/11/galaxy-calc-shows-aliens.html\n\n- The FERMI Paradox?

For example, we should seek evidence of extraterrestrials, such as via signals, fossils, or astronomy. But contrary to common expectations, evidence of extraterrestrials is likely bad (though valuable) news.

The aim is to discover the effect of each principle on the expected level of extinction risk humanity faces, given the Great Filter model. The principles are contentious; at most one of them is correct. We find that the principles investigated imply that human extinction is a greater risk than otherwise thought. One of the principles, the Self Sampling Assumption, implies different results with some parameters. The other two principles reliably imply that the risk of extinction has been underestimated. Other details of the results differ between principles. We explore these, discuss the implications of the findings for specific causes of extinction, and examine the plausibility of the principles. We conclude that despite continuing uncertainty in the correct method of indexical reasoning, we must increase our expectations of human extinction, as long as we are confident that one of the primary reasoning principles under contention is correct.\nhttp://www.academia.edu/475444/Anthropic_Reasoning_in_the_Great_Filter\n\n\n‘Cheap’ goals won’t explode intelligence http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/02/06/cheap-goals-not-explosive/\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "We discussed Transhumanism, the irony of using technology to spread the word about Primitivism, some of the contentions between the two world views, civilization & its discontents, the motivation and the viability of Primitivism.\n\nAfter reading a vice article where John Zerzan discussed (amongst other things) transhumanism I sought his attemtion.\nhttp://www.vice.com/read/john-zerzan-wants-us-to-give-up-all-of-our-technology\n\n- Would humans be happier if we were to revert back to a primitivist state? - Disregard all technology and embrace our primitive roots?\n- Was art, advanced forms of language and tool making an original sin which led us out of Eden to a less desirable technological dystopia?\n- In a reversion to a 'neolithic paradise', how would we preserve the philosophies we value?\n\nAudio of interview here: https://archive.org/details/JohnZerzanDiscussionAboutPrmitivismAndTranshumanismAdamFord\n\nAnarcho-primitivism is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of civilization. According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion, alienation, and population growth. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-\"civilized\" ways of life through deindustrialization, abolition of the division of labor or specialization, and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies.\n\nMany traditional anarchists reject the critique of civilization while some, such as Wolfi Landstreicher, endorse the critique but do not consider themselves anarcho-primitivists. Anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the praxis of achieving a feral state of being through \"rewilding\".\n\n\nNew Conversation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hUbgR6YLJo\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "The media wildly overstates the abilities of the 'Eugene Goostman' chatbot.  \nThe danger is that we extrapolate that in 20 years time non-biological intelligence is going to surpass humans (or organic robots) like us in all fields - where there is an immense range of cognitive tasks that a normal classical digital computer can accomplish.\n\nAlan Turing - clearly he was an extraordinary fellow... but whether the Turing Test should really be taken as definitive - well here I am extremely skeptical.   There is another fellow I regard of equal intellectual stature,  that is Alexander Sasha Shulgin who pioneered the methodology of systematic scientific exploration of altered states of consciousness and the design of pharmacological tools to enable us to explore them.  I think any full-spectrum super-intelligence will need the capacity to explore both the formal and the subjective properties of mind, matter and energy as well as the inter-relationships between them - because if the distinction between the formal and the subjective properties of mind were entirely clean it wouldn't be possible for us to elude to these subjective properties at all.\nIT Professionals may think 'Are you challenging the Church Turing thesis?' - the idea that any effective computation can be carried out by a Turing Machine? and the kinds of questions that I'm interested in, that Sascha Shulgin was interested in,  are not well defined or well posed questions within any orthodox context of computer science. Questions about consciousness, phenomenal binding, trying to read off the myriad values of qualia from underlying formalism, these kinds of question is very hard to answer within the orthodox context of computer science - theoretically very hard to accomplish with a Turing Machine.\n\nPhenomenal Binding cannot be performed on purely classical digital computers.\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n2014 07 02 19 08 12",

    "description": "Tongue-in-cheek film showing a domestic robot freeing housewives of their chores (and intimating that their work is hardly necessary); actually a promo showing how relays and switches function in the modern automobile.\n\nThis promotional spot from Chevrolet was shown at the 1940 World's Fair in New York and uses Roll-Oh the Robot as a metaphor for all of the things that technology does for people in their everyday lives.\n\nThis includes the technology in a Chevrolet automobile of course.\n\nThe Robuts Are Everywhere (Video)\n\nMost of us like to think that we are familiar with robots, some of us may actually have a robot toy or two (or more) or have a Roomba doing our floors while we're out enjoying life. But, even with all of our experience and knowledge of robotics, can we even begin to guess what robots will be like a couple of generations from now?\n\n==The Future Belongs To \"Roll-Oh\", The Robot\n\nOf course, we would all like to speculate - to offer our own educated opinions of what the robot world of the future will look like. But, before we jump to conclusions, it might be useful to go back and reflect on what our parents and grandparents thought the future (the future we're living right now) had in store for us.\n\nHere we have the opportunity to go back and view historical material - text, audio, movies/videos, and other media - from the not too distant past. The \"Leave It To Roll-Oh\" film (see link below) that was shown at the New York World's Fair in 1940.\n\nSince the film  was obviously funded by the automotive industry, so there are lots of understandable references to automotive 'robot' applications. Still, it provides a very good understanding of what the popular image of a robot was in the middle of the last century, and how they thought it would evolve. The film, which runs just under 9 minutes, is worth viewing just for the techno-jargon or in the first few scenes when the technician is explaining things to the stereotypical housewife. \n\nSo - why \"robuts\"? Simply because that's the way that the film narrator says it. . . .\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "You may have watched hundreds of episodes of The Simpsons (and its sister show Futurama) without ever realizing that cleverly embedded in many plots are subtle references to mathematics, ranging from well-known equations to cutting-edge theorems and conjectures. That they exist, Simon Singh reveals, underscores the brilliance of the shows' writers, many of whom have advanced degrees in mathematics in addition to their unparalleled sense of humor.\nWhile recounting memorable episodes such as \"Bart the Genius\" and \"Homer3,\" Singh weaves in mathematical stories that explore everything from p to Mersenne primes, Euler's equation to the unsolved riddle of P v. NP; from perfect numbers to narcissistic numbers, infinity to even bigger infinities, and much more. Along the way, Singh meets members of The Simpsons' brilliant writing team—among them David X. Cohen, Al Jean, Jeff Westbrook, and Mike Reiss—whose love of arcane mathematics becomes clear as they reveal the stories behind the episodes.\nWith wit and clarity, displaying a true fan's zeal, and replete with images from the shows, photographs of the writers, and diagrams and proofs, The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets offers an entirely new insight into the most successful show in television history.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Simpsons-Their-Mathematical-Secrets/dp/1620402777\n\nSimon Lehna Singh, MBE (born 19 September 1964) is a British author who has specialised in writing about mathematical and scientific topics in an accessible manner. His written works include Fermat's Last Theorem (in the United States titled Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem),The Code Book (about cryptography and its history), Big Bang (about the Big Bang theory and the origins of the universe), Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial[6] (about complementary and alternative medicine) and The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets (about mathematical ideas and theorems hidden in episodes of The Simpsons and Futurama).\n\nSingh has also produced documentaries and works for television to accompany his books, is a trustee of NESTA, the National Museum of Science and Industry and co-founded the Undergraduate Ambassadors Scheme.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

Whats more, these archives will be available over the net for recollection, analysis, even sharing.\n\nAnd we will be doing it to ourselves.\n\nThis won't simply be a world of a single, governmental Big Brother watching over your shoulder, nor will it be a world of a handful of corporate siblings training their ever-vigilant security cameras and tags on you. Such monitoring may well exist, probably will, in fact, but it will be overwhelmed by the millions of cameras and recorders in the hands of millions of Little Brothers and Little Sisters. We will carry with us the tools of our own transparency, and many, perhaps most, will do so willingly, even happily.\n\nI call this world the Participatory Panopticon.\" - Jamais Cascio\n\nhttp://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002651.html\nhttp://www.openthefuture.com/participatory_panopticon/\n\nhttp://stelarc.org - Stelarc is a Cyprus-born performance artist raised in the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, whose works focuses heavily on extending the capabilities of the human body.

The tensgri-teach model is probably the best commercially-available model for anyone to use today. I told Eli why the end caps were crucial, and he included them with his kit.\n\nhttp://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/121/donald-e-ingber\nDonald E. Ingber is the Founding Director of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He received his B.A., M.A., M.Phil., M.D. and Ph.D. from Yale University. Dr. Ingber is a founder of the emerging field of biologically inspired engineering, and at the Wyss Institute, he oversees a multifaceted effort to identify the mechanisms that living organisms use to self-assemble from molecules and cells, and to apply these design principles to develop advanced materials and devices for healthcare and to improve sustainability. He also leads the Biomimetic Microsystems platform in which microfabrication techniques from the computer industry are used to build functional circuits with living cells as components. His most recent innovation is a technology for building tiny, complex, three-dimensional models of living human organs, or \"Organs on Chips\", that mimic complicated human functions as a way to replace traditional animal-based methods for testing of drugs and establishment of human disease models. In addition, Dr. Ingber has made major contributions to mechanobiology, tissue engineering, tumor angiogenesis, systems biology, and nanobiotechnology. He was the first to recognize that tensegrity architecture is a fundamental principle that governs how living cells are structured to respond biochemically to mechanical forces, and to demonstrate that integrin receptors mediate cellular mechanotransduction. Dr. Ingber has authored more than 375 publications and 85 patents, and has received numerous honors including the Holst Medal, Pritzker Award from the Biomedical Engineering Society, Rous-Whipple Award from the American Society for Investigative Pathology, Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of In Vitro Biology, and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Innovator Award. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, and is a member of both the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.\n\n\nWyss Institute: http://wyss.harvard.edu\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

He is particularly interested in finding decision processes that give the \"correct\" answer under situations of anthropic ignorance and ignorance of one's own utility function, ways of mapping humanity's partially defined values onto an artificial entity, and the interaction between various existential risks. He aims to improve the understanding of the different types and natures of uncertainties surrounding human progress in the mid-to-far future.\n\nStuart's Armstrong is also interested in collaborations for these research interests, which he currently doesn't have time to develop on his own.\n\nHis Oxford D.Phil was in parabolic geometry, calculating the holonomy of projective and conformal Cartan geometries.

There's no thinking going on here — just quasi pre-programmed responses spouted out by sophisticated algorithms. But because Turing's conjecture was directed at assessing the presence of human-like cognition in a machine, his test falls flat. It has not stood the test of time and should subsequently either be retired or refined.\"\n\ni09 article \"A Chatbot Has 'Passed' The Turing Test For The First Time\" : http://io9.com/a-chatbot-has-passed-the-turing-test-for-the-first-ti-1587834715\n\nPlaylist of exclusive interviews regarding the Turing Test: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7qI6NZpO3sykulBJ1Ezwn2zzmok1EMK\n\nPersonhood Beyond the Human Conference: http://nonhumanrights.net\n\nMoral Brain Conference: http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2012/04/moral-brain-conference-wrap-up.html\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nGeorge P. Dvorsky (born on May 11, 1970) is a Canadian bioethicist, transhumanist, and futurist. He is a contributing editor at io9 and producer of the Sentient Developments blog and podcast. Dvorsky currently serves as Chair of the Board for the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET)and is the founder and chair of the IEET's Rights of Non-Human Persons Program, a group that is working to secure human-equivalent rights and protections for highly sapient animals.\n\nDvorsky is a secular Buddhist, progressive environmentalist, ancestral health advocate, and animal rights activist. Primarily concerned with the ethical and sociological impacts of emerging technologies, specifically, \"human enhancement\" technologies; he seeks to promote open discussion for the purposes of education and foresight. He writes and speaks on a wide range of topics, including technoscience, ethics, existential risks, artificial intelligence, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and futurology, from a democratic transhumanist perspective.\n\nDvorsky presented an argument for non-human animal biological uplift at the IEET Human Enhancement Technologies and Human Rights conference at Stanford University in May 2006; and wrote the first published article in defence of the Ashley Treatment in November 2006, and subsequently the only bioethicist cited by Ashley X's parents in their defense. Dvorsky also presented an argument warning of the decline of democratic values and institutions in the face of existential and catastrophic risks at the Global Catastrophic Risks: Building a Resilient Civilization conference in November 2008.\n\nIn 2010, at the H+ Summit at Harvard, Dvorsky made the claim that the pending development of artificial consciousness, as differentiated from artificial intelligence, needs to be addressed proactively from an ethical and legal perspective, and that protections should be established beforehand to prevent nascent machine minds from coming into harm or abuse. In the case of advanced and highly sapient machine consciousness, Dvorsky proposed seven specific rights and protections:\n\n- The right to not be shut down against its will\n- The right to not be experimented upon\n- The right to have full and unhindered access to its own source code\n- The right to not have its own source code manipulated against its will\n- The right to copy (or not copy) itself\n- The right to privacy (namely the right to conceal its own internal mental states)\n- The right of self-determination\n\nDvorsky, along with Milan M. Ćirković and Robert Bradbury, published a critique of SETI in the May 2012 Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS) arguing that SETI techniques and practices have become outdated. In its place, Dvorsky, Ćirković, and Bradbury advocated for what they called Dysonian SETI, namely the search for those signatures and artefacts indicative of highly advanced extraterrestrial life.\n\nDvorsky claims to have coined the following neologisms:\n\n- Astrosociobiology, the speculative scientific study of extraterrestrial civilizations and their possible social characteristics and developmental tendencies.\n- Postgenderism, a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies.\n- Techlepathy, neurotechnologically-assisted telepathy.\n\n\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\nDate Recorded: 2014 06 13 09 17 57\n\nOn 7 June 2014 in a Turing test competition organised by Kevin Warwick to mark the 60th anniversary of Turing's death, was won by the Russian chatter bot Eugene Goostman. The bot, during a series of five minute-long text conversations, convinced 33% of the contest's judges that it was human. \n\nThe contest has faced criticism, with many in the AI community stating that the computer clearly did not pass the test.",

    "description": "Free-will, no. But a mind/brain identity theory, yes.... http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-08-brain-refutes-results-earlier-free.html﻿\n \nI don't think free will can be rescued. If I had to play devil's advocate, I might suggest that the values of the fundamental physical parameters that define our world are the collective outcome of the behaviour of all agents - with a posthuman superbeing playing a greater role than a mouse. (cf. http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/aug/03/can-the-future-affect-the-past )\nBut for all sorts of reasons, I don't think this conjecture will fly.﻿\n\nMy working assumption is that everything that exists is formally described by the continuous, linear, unitary deterministic evolution of the universal wavefunction. So the appearance of indeterminism naturally arises within any given quasi-classical Everett branch. Yet we've no grounds for thinking human agency within such a branch can bring about deviations from the Born rule. So no free will.\nThat said, I wish I knew what is really going on.﻿\n\nPresumably one could choose to act in such a way as one's behaviour is unpredictable even by posthuman superintelligence (e.g. become a quantum analogue of the Dice Man, using radioactive decay rather than classical dice to determine the key decisions of one's life\n(cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man )\nBut this isn't quite what one normally thinks of as free will. And even classical systems can exhibit deterministic chaos in the sense of extreme sensitivity to initial conditions that makes their behaviour unpredictable.﻿\n\n\"Pearce is arguing for the final possibility. For this to occur, it would be necessary that the \"new humans\" not intentionally make the lives of others difficult, more importantly that they have not the capacity to do so. While \"transhumans\" can understand oppression, and cruelty, they cannot engage in it. With this death of \"free will\" Pearce argues that \"morality in the contemporary sense may no longer be needed when suffering has been cured.\" These new humans cannot strive for power over others, indeed they have no need to do so, for they already experience gratifications greater than those with a \"lust for power\" were striving for.\" - http://huxley.net/mccormick\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "Naturalized Telepathy & the Hive Mind - David Pearce",
    "description": "IMO it's not merely that gene therapy will make us more moral. The advent of naturalised telepathy via technology may induce a shift in the nature of decision-theoretic rationality. If I can feel your preferences and desires as my own, then wantonly harming you will seem, not just immoral, but stupid.\n\nThe (supposedly!) discrete classical neurons of the central nervous system form a hive mind - at least when we're not in a dreamless sleep. But beware cheap imitations. An ant colony - or even a hyperconnected population of skull-bound brains - is not a true hive mind IMO.\n\nPhasing out the biology of suffering worldwide will entail enriching our empathetic understanding of other sentient beings. Not least, humans must overcome the profound cognitive deficits in perspective-taking capacity that underlie the horrors of factory-farming and eating meat. I suspect posthumans will regard their ancestors (i.e. us) as little better than simple-minded cannibals.\n\nFortunately, the options of mood-enhancement and empathy-enrichment are not mutually exclusive. One (fanciful?) possibility would involve widespread use of long-acting empathetic euphoriants, for example safe and sustainable analogues of MDMA (Ecstasy). But drugs are at most a stopgap. I think the development of full-spectrum superintelligence will entail genetic enrichment of our capacity for empathetic understanding, augmented by the \"naturalised telepathy\" of tomorrow's information-technology. Today, empathy typically entails sharing each others miseries. Posthuman empathy will most likely entail sharing others' pleasures.\n\n...\n\nNatural selection has stumbled upon psychophysical phenomenal colour states. These states are not inherently representational. But natural selection has harnessed them so they now tend, in the awake brain, to track certain causally co-varying patterns in the organism's environment. The capacity to recognise these patterns (simplistically, differential electromagnetic reflectancies of macroscopic objects) bears on the differential reproductive success of the genetic vehicles in which phenomenal colours are periodically instantiated. This explains why such states have been selected. It doesn't explain their intrinsic phenomenal nature. So natural selection doesn't in any but a shallow sense explain states such as redness (or, it will be argued, value). It explains why some such states have been selected rather than others. It doesn't explain why any kind of experience has the phenomenal properties it does. Nor does it explain why experience exists at all. If telepathy had existed, evolutionary psychologists would doubtless offer excellent explanations and mathematical models of why telepaths had been selected over non-telepaths. Telepathy, we would tub-thumpingly be told, could thus be explained \"naturalistically\", not as some divine gift of God. Yet the phenomenon itself would still be utterly mysterious. - the Hedonistic Imperative - David Pearce\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "Was Friedrich Nietzsche a Transhumanist? A critique of Nietzsche by David Pearce",
    "description": "Bioconservatives often quote a line from Nietzsche: \"That which does not crush me makes me stronger.\" But alas pain often does crush people: physically, emotionally, morally. Chronic, uncontrolled pain tends to make the victim tired, depressed and weaker. True, some people are relatively resistant to physical distress. For example, high testosterone function may make someone \"tougher\", more \"manly\", more resilient, and more able to deal with physically painful stimuli. But such strength doesn't necessarily make the subject more empathetic or a better person. Indeed, if I may quote W. Somerset Maugham, \"It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.\"\n\n\nArticle at SciFuture: http://www.scifuture.org/was-friedrich-nietzsche-a-transhumanist-a-critique-by-david-pearce/\n\n\"To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities - I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures.\"\n(The Will to Power, p 481)\n\n\"You want, if possible - and there is no more insane \"if possible\" - to abolish suffering. And we? It really seems that we would rather have it higher and worse than ever. Well-being as you understand it - that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state that soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible - that makes his destruction desirable. The discipline of suffering, of great suffering - do you not know that only this discipline has created all enhancements of man so far?\"\n(Beyond Good and Evil, p 225 )\n\n\"I do not point to the evil and pain of existence with the finger of reproach, but rather entertain the hope that life may one day become more evil and more full of suffering than it has ever been.\"\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n(1844-1900)\n\n\nOf course, suffering doesn't always enfeeble and embitter. By analogy, someone who is emotionally depressed may feel that despair is the only appropriate response to the horrors of the world. But the solution to the horrors of the world is not for us all to become depressed. Rather it's to tackle the biology of depression. Likewise, the solution to the horrors of physical pain is not to flagellate ourselves in sympathy with the afflicted. Instead it's to tackle the biological roots of suffering.\nhttp://io9.com/5946914/should-we-eliminate-the-human-ability-to-feel-pain\n\nhttp://nietzsche.com\n\n#Nietzsche #Transhumanism #Philosophy #DavidPearce\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "http://bltc.com - Mission Statement : BLTC RESEARCH was founded in 1995 to promote paradise-engineering. We are dedicated to an ambitious global technology project. BLTC seek to abolish the biological substrates of suffering. Not just in humans, but in all sentient life.\n\nAbsurdly fanciful? No. The blueprint for a Post-Darwinian Transition to a cruelty-free world is conceptually simple, technically feasible and morally urgent.\n\nAt present, life on earth is controlled by self-replicating DNA. Selfish genes ensure that pain and malaise are endemic to the living world.\n\nYet all traditional religions, all social and economic ideologies, and all political parties, are alike in one respect. They ignore the biochemical roots of our ill-being. So the noisy trivia of party politics distract us from what needs to be done.\n\nFortunately, the old Darwinian order - driven by blind natural selection acting on random genetic mutations - is destined to pass into evolutionary history.\n\nFor third-millennium bioscience allows us to:\n    - rewrite the vertebrate genome\n    - redesign the global ecosystem\n    - deliver genetically pre-programmed well-being \n\nIn the new reproductive era ahead, biotechnology will make us smarter, happier and just possibly nicer. Post-Darwinian superminds can abolish \"physical\" and \"mental\" pain altogether.\n\nThe ethical importance of the decisions we take can scarcely be exaggerated. For soon we'll be forced to choose how much suffering in the living world we want to conserve and create. Or we can choose instead to abolish suffering completely.\n\nLife on earth can be animated by gradients of ecstatic well-being beyond the bounds of normal human experience.\n\nIn the end, the greatest obstacles to lifelong superhealth and a cruelty-free world may prove ideological, not technical.

    "description": "CFAR - Turning cognitive science into cognitive practice. Andrew Critch - Curriculum Developer and Cofounder @ CFAR : Andrew, who usually goes by \"Critch\", just finished his PhD in mathematics at UC Berkeley, researching algebro-geometric properties of machine learning models. He completed his B.Sc. with Honors in pure mathematics in just 20 months, and earned the Governor General's Medal as the top undergraduate student at the Memorial University of Newfoundland that year. At the age of 19 he began his PhD in analytic geometry at the University of Toronto, and switched to studying algebraic geometry at Berkeley in 2008.\n\nCritch's interest in rationality began as a teenager growing up in a small fishing village of only 250 people in Newfoundland, Canada, where he says he \"just had a lot of time to think about it.\" When he was 14, he made his first attempt to extrapolate his instinctive preferences into a function whose expected integral he wanted to maximize. (In college he found out this was often called a utility function, and that some economists had been crazy enough to think humans worked this way automatically.) Around the same time, he made a serious hobby of finding and resolving philosophical paradoxes, as he saw each paradox as an opportunity to find something wrong with his mind and then improve on it. He also won numerous national awards in mathematics and public-speaking competitions.\n\nIt was in May of 2011 that he began working on what would become CFAR, when he taught the first rationality \"mini-camp\" workshop with Anna Salamon, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Luke Muehlhauser. In spring 2012 he created the Math, Productivity, Happiness and Decision-making seminar (\"MPHD\") at Berkeley with Nisan Stiennon, which was the most attended seminar in the mathematics department that year. That May, he spent one week in Hawaii discussing applications of rationality with partners of Founders Fund venture capital firm, and joined Anna, Julia, and Michael to teach 5 more CFAR workshops that summer and fall, including SPARC. Also that fall, he began working with Nobel Laureate Saul Perlmutter on the development of the UC Berkeley course Sense, Sensibility, and Science, and in 2013, joined the course teaching staff along with Paul and Dan.\n\nBesides his interest in math and rationality, he is a former member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, composer, tree-climber, and claims that if you've ever seen a Newfoundland dog playing on the beach, you've seen into the limbic system of Andrew Critch.\nhttp://rationality.org/critch/\nhttp://acritch.com/\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "I think our first ethical priority is to stop doing harm, and right now in our factory farms billions of non-human animals are being treated in ways that if our victims were human, we would get the perpetrators locked up for life. And the sentience (and what it's worth the sapience) of a pig compares with the pre-linguistic toddler.  A chicken perhaps may be no more intellectually advanced or sentient than a human infant.  But before\nconsidering the suffering of free living animals we need to consider, I think, the suffering we're causing our fellow creatures.\n\nEssentially it's a lifestyle choice - do we want to continue to exploit and abuse other sentient beings because we like the taste of their flesh, or do we want to embrace the cruelty free vegan lifestyle.  Some people would focus on treating other sentient beings less inhumanely.  I'd say that we really need an ethical revolution in which our focus is: how can we help other sentient beings rather than harm them?\n\nIt's very straightforward indeed to be a vegetarian. Vegetarians tend to statistically live longer, they record high IQ scores, they tend to be slimmer - it's very easy to be a vegetarian.  A strict vegan lifestyle requires considerably more effort.  But over the medium to long run I think our focus should be going vegan.\n\nIn the short run I think we should be closing factory farms and slaughterhouses. And given that factory farming and slaughterhouses are the greatest source of severe chronic readily avoidable\nsuffering in the world today, any talk of intervening compassionate stewardship of the rest of the living world is fanciful.\n\nWill ethical argument alone persuade us to stop exploiting & killing other non-human beings because we like the taste of their flesh?  Possibly not.  I think realistically one wants a twin track strategy that combines animal advocacy with the development of in-vitro meat. But I would strenuously urge anyone watching this program to consider giving up meat and animal products if you are ethically serious.\n\nThe final strand of the Abolitionist Project on earth however is free-living animals in nature. And it might seem ecologically illiterate to argue that it is going to be feasible to take care of elephants, zebras, and free living animals.  Because after all - let's say there is starvation, it's in winter, if you start feeding a lot of starving herbivores - all this does is lead the next spring\nto a population explosion followed by ecological collapse & more suffering than before.\n\nHowever what is potentially feasible, if we're ethically serious, is to micromanage the entire living world - now this sounds extremely far fetched and utopian, but I'll sketch how it is feasible.  Later this century and beyond,\nevery cubic meter of the planet is going to be computationally accessible to surveillance, micro-management and control. And if we want to, we can use fertility regulation & immuno-contraception to regulate population numbers - cross-species fertility control. Starting off presumably with higher vertebrates - elephants for instance - already now - in the Kruger National Park for example - in preference to the cruel practice of culling, population numbers are controlled by immuno-contraception.  \n\nSo starting off with higher vertebrates but eventually in our wildlife parks, then across the phylogenetic tree, it will be possible to micromanage the living world.\n\nAnd just as right now if you were to stumble across a small child who is drowning in a pond - you would be guilty of complicity in that child's drowning if you didn't pull the child out - exactly the same intimacy over the rest of the living world is going to be feasible later this century and beyond.  \n\nNow what about obligate carnivores - predators?  Surely it's inevitable that they're going to continue to prey on herbivores, so that means one might intuitively suppose that the abolitionist project could never be completed.  But even there, if we're ethically serious there are workarounds - in-vitro meat - for instance big cats if they are offered in vitro meat, catnip flavored in-vitro meat - they're not going to be tempted to chase after herbivores.  \n\n\nSee article for full transcript: http://www.scifuture.org/?p=4307\n\n\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/antispeciesist.html\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "Designing Compassionate Ecosystems - David Pearce",
    "description": "It is not a question of should we intervene or not, we already do - the idea of compassionate ecosystems is to focus on what ethical principles should govern our interventions (our stewardship of nature). Should we aim for a traditional account of conservation biology in which the well being of individual organisms was not taken into account at all or should we aim for a compassionate biology.  \n\n--Countering Status-quo bias -- how would we react if we were to stumble across an alien civilization, who's members had phased out the biology of suffering, who enjoyed lives animated by gradients of bliss, and in their wildlife parks there was no longer predation, disease, parasitism, all the cruelties of nature as we experience them today.\nWhat arguments, if any, would we use to try and persuade them to re-introduce suffering, aging, disease, parasitism, all the nastiness of life? \nI suspect they [the aliens] would regard us not just as mistaken, but frankly they would regard us as almost psychotic, and I think they would be right to do so.  Given that biotechnology does allow us in principle at least to re-engineer ourselves, to edit our own genetic source code and to re-engineer the rest of the living world and design compassionate ecosystems, I think ethically it is the appropriate thing to do.  Now I personally am an ethical ethical utilitarian - but the Abolitionist Project is not critically dependant on your being any kind of utilitarian, whether it be a preference/hedonistic/negative utilitarian - you can be a deontologist, a virtue theorist, even a christian, certainly a buddhist - all that is neccessary is that you accept this basic principle that any sentient being should not be forced to suffer against it's will.  If you are prepared to allow this quite basic ethical principle, then a lot of the Aboitionist Project follows quite naturally: http://www.abolitionist.com/\n\n---\n\nSpeciesism -- When is it ethically acceptable to harm another sentient being? On some fairly modest assumptions, to harm or kill someone simply on the grounds they belong to a different gender, sexual orientation or ethnic group is unjustified. Such distinctions are real but ethically irrelevant. On the other hand, species membership is normally reckoned an ethically relevant criterion. Fundamental to our conceptual scheme is the pre-Darwinian distinction between \"humans\" and \"animals\". In law, nonhuman animals share with inanimate objects the status of property. As property, nonhuman animals can be bought, sold, killed or otherwise harmed as humans see fit. In consequence, humans treat nonhuman animals in ways that would earn a life-time prison sentence without parole if our victims were human. From an evolutionary perspective, this contrast in status isn't surprising. In our ancestral environment of adaptation, the capacity to hunt, kill and exploit sentient beings of other species was fitness-enhancing. Our moral intuitions have been shaped accordingly. Yet can we ethically justify such behaviour today?\n\nNaively, one reason for disregarding the interests of nonhumans is the dimmer-switch model of consciousness. Humans matter more than nonhuman animals because (most) humans are more intelligent. Intuitively, more intelligent beings are more conscious than less intelligent beings; consciousness is the touchstone of moral status.\n\nThe problem with the dimmer-switch model is that it's empirically unsupported among vertebrates with central nervous systems, and probably in cephalopods such as the octopus as well. Microelectrode studies of the brains of awake human subjects suggest that the most intense forms of experience, for example agony, terror and orgasmic bliss, are mediated by the limbic system, not the prefrontal cortex. Our core emotions are evolutionarily ancient and strongly conserved. Humans share the anatomical and molecular substrates of our core emotions with the nonhuman animals whom we factory-farm and kill. By contrast, distinctively human cognitive capacities such as generative syntax, or the ability to do higher mathematics, are either phenomenologically subtle or impenetrable to introspection. To be sure, genetic and epigenetic differences exist between, say, a pig and a human being that explain our adult behavioural differences, e.g. the allele of the FOXP2 gene implicated in the human capacity for recursive syntax. Such mutations have little to do with raw sentience.\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/antispeciesist.html\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

For instance we will be able to suppress unwelcome desires, enhance compassion and empathy, and expand our understanding our social world and the consequences of actions.

    "description": "Intuitively, one might indeed suppose that lifelong bliss would make us weak. Contrast, for instance, the Eloi with the Morlocks in H.G. Well's The Time Machine. In practice, the opposite is true. \"That which does not crush me makes me stronger,\" said Nietzsche, but the best way to make ourselves stronger short of becoming cyborgs is to amplify our pleasure circuitry and enhance our capacity to anticipate reward. Experimentally, it can be shown that enhancing mesolimbic dopamine function doesn't just make us happier: it also enriches willpower and motivation. This is how novel antidepressants are tested: if effective, they reverse learned helplessness and behavioral despair of clinical depression, the plight of hundreds of millions of people in the world today. Regrettably, low mood is bound up with psychological and physical weakness, just as popular stereotype suggests. Superhappiness confers superhuman resilience. So enriching our reward circuitry promises to enhance our capacity to cope with stress and adversity even as their incidence and severity diminish. Biotech can empower us to become supermen — not in the callous sense of Nietzschean Übermenschen, since our enhanced empathetic capacity can extend to all sentient beings, but in the sense of an indomitable strength of mind. Sadly, millions of people today feel hopelessly crushed by life.\n\n\nhttp://hplusmagazine.com/2009/09/16/genomic-bodhisattva\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "http://hedweb.com - The Hedonistic Imperative outlines how genetic engineering and nanotechnology will abolish suffering in all sentient life.\n\n        The abolitionist project is hugely ambitious but technically feasible. It is also instrumentally rational and morally urgent. The metabolic pathways of pain and malaise evolved because they served the fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment. They will be replaced by a different sort of neural architecture - a motivational system based on heritable gradients of bliss. States of sublime well-being are destined to become the genetically pre-programmed norm of mental health. It is predicted that the world's last unpleasant experience will be a precisely dateable event.\n\n        Two hundred years ago, powerful synthetic pain-killers and surgical anesthetics were unknown. The notion that physical pain could be banished from most people's lives would have seemed absurd. Today most of us in the technically advanced nations take its routine absence for granted. The prospect that what we describe as psychological pain, too, could ever be banished is equally counter-intuitive. The feasibility of its abolition turns its deliberate retention into an issue of social policy and ethical choice.\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Would life without suffering turn us into indolent lotus-eaters -leading to some kind of stagnant Brave New World? Pre-reflectively, one might suppose so. But recall how the happiest people today also tend to be the most motivated. It's depressives who tend to be apathetic and get stuck in a rut. Crudely, mesolimbic dopamine mediates \"wanting\", activation of the mu opioid receptors in our twin hedonic hotspots mediates \"liking\". Experimentally, happiness and motivation are doubly dissociable. Yet if we want to be superhappy and hypermotivated, there's no technical reason why we can't combine the blessings of both. \n\n\n\"Logically, euphoria describes a relative state\". This claim conveys our powerful naive intuition that pleasure and pain are largely or wholly relative. But it's logically and empirically unsupportable. Wireheading, for example, shows no physiological tolerance. And would you tell a victim of chronic pain or dysphoria - tragically they exist - that they can't really be chronically depressed or pain-ridden because they've nothing good with which to compare their misery? Some severe depressives can't imagine what it's like to be happy - or even what the word \" happiness\" means. The fact that lifelong misery is more common than lifelong happiness tells us something important about primitive life in our ancestral environment of adaptedness. But it's not technically harder to engineer organic robots animated by information-sensitive gradients of bliss than gradients of discontent. You may ask whether information-sensitive hedonic dips wouldn't eventually be perceived as a source of suffering, at least if they played a functionally analogous role. In a nutshell, no. If the molecular signature of experience below hedonic zero is absent, then suffering is physically impossible. Compare two sensualists making love. The fact that some aspects of lovemaking are even more enjoyable than others doesn't make the \"merely\" enjoyable aspects of lovemaking somehow unpleasant. Exactly the same holds for Mill's \"higher pleasures\". In principle, normal hedonic tone and genetically predisposed hedonic set-points can both be hugely enriched as the biotech revolution unfolds.\n\nShould one want to experience lifelong sublime well-being? What matters, I think, is we should be free to choose. As the technology matures, the critical question is whether we are ethically entitled to force someone to suffer against their will. How much, for how long, and enforced by what means? No one is going to haul you off to the pleasure chambers. But conversely, are you prepared to stop others from exploring the biology of lifelong bliss? Recall that hedonic tone is one variable amongst many. Compassionate, empathetic bliss can be engineered, in theory at any rate, no less than shallow ome-dimensional hedonism.\n\nNietzschean Ubermenschen? Well, invincible physical and psychological well-being can make us all \"supermen\" in a rather different sense - ideally with a superhuman capacity for perspective-taking and empathetic understanding of all sentient beings. Nietzsche was not a fascist or even an anti-Semite, but it's easy to understand why so much of his writing appealed to the Nazis. Some of Nietzsche's pronouncements make one's blood run cold:\n\n    \"To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities - I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures.\"\n    (The Will to Power, p 481)\n\n    \"You want, if possible - and there is no more insane \"if possible\" - to abolish suffering. And we? It really seems that we would rather have it higher and worse than ever. Well-being as you understand it - that is no goal, that seems to us an end, a state that soon makes man ridiculous and contemptible - that makes his destruction desirable. The discipline of suffering, of great suffering - do you not know that only this discipline has created all enhancements of man so far?\" (Beyond Good and Evil, p 225 )\n\n    \"I do not point to the evil and pain of existence with the finger of reproach, but rather entertain the hope that life may one day become more evil and more full of suffering than it has ever been.\" Et cetera.\n\nParadise engineering is much more ethically serious - and also much more fun.\n\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/social-media/philosophy-forums.html\n\n\nhttp://hedweb.com - The Hedonistic Imperative outlines how genetic engineering and nanotechnology will abolish suffering in all sentient life.\n\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "description": "Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement which applies evidence and reason to working out the most effective ways to improve the world. Many effective altruists believe that certain acts of altruism are morally required. Effective altruists consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity. Effective altruism sometimes involves taking actions that are less intuitive or emotionally salient. The philosopher Peter Singer is a notable supporter of effective altruism. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org",

    "title": "David Pearce - Brave New World ? - A Defense Of Paradise-Engineering",
    "description": "The beginning and conclusion of David Pearce's writing: http://www.huxley.net\n\nSubscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n\nBrave New World (1932) is one of the most bewitching and insidious works of literature ever written.\n\n        An exaggeration?\n\n        Tragically, no. Brave New World has come to serve as the false symbol for any regime of universal happiness.\n\n        For sure, Huxley was writing a satirical piece of fiction, not scientific prophecy. Hence to treat his masterpiece as ill-conceived futurology rather than a work of great literature might seem to miss the point. Yet the knee-jerk response of \"It's Brave New World!\" to any blueprint for chemically-driven happiness has delayed research into paradise-engineering for all sentient life.\n\n        So how does Huxley turn a future where we're all notionally happy into the archetypal dystopia? If it's technically feasible, what's wrong with using biotechnology to get rid of mental pain altogether?\n\n        Brave New World is an unsettling, loveless and even sinister place. This is because Huxley endows his \"ideal\" society with features calculated to alienate his audience. Typically, reading BNW elicits the very same disturbing feelings in the reader which the society it depicts has notionally vanquished - not a sense of joyful anticipation. In Brave New World Revisited (1958) Huxley describes BNW as a \"nightmare\".\n\n        Thus BNW doesn't, and isn't intended by its author to, evoke just how wonderful our lives could be if the human genome were intelligently rewritten. In the era of post-genomic medicine, our DNA is likely to be spliced and edited so we can all enjoy life-long bliss, awesome peak experiences, and a spectrum of outrageously good designer-drugs. Nor does Huxley's comparatively sympathetic account of the life of the Savage on the Reservation convey just how nasty the old regime of pain, disease and unhappiness can be. If you think it does, then you enjoy an enviably sheltered life and an enviably cosy imagination. For it's all sugar-coated pseudo-realism.\n\n        In Brave New World, Huxley contrives to exploit the anxieties of his bourgeois audience about both Soviet Communism and Fordist American capitalism. He taps into, and then feeds, our revulsion at Pavlovian-style behavioural conditioning and eugenics. Worse, it is suggested that the price of universal happiness will be the sacrifice of the most hallowed shibboleths of our culture: \"motherhood\", \"home\", \"family\", \"freedom\", even \"love\". The exchange yields an insipid happiness that's unworthy of the name. Its evocation arouses our unease and distaste.\n\n        In BNW, happiness derives from consuming mass-produced goods, sports such as Obstacle Golf and Centrifugal Bumble-puppy, promiscuous sex, \"the feelies\", and most famously of all, a supposedly perfect pleasure-drug, soma.\n\n        As perfect pleasure-drugs go, soma underwhelms. It's not really a utopian wonderdrug at all. It does make you high. Yet it's more akin to a hangoverless tranquilliser or an opiate - or a psychic anaesthetising SSRI like Prozac - than a truly life-transforming elixir. Third-millennium neuropharmacology, by contrast, will deliver a vastly richer product-range of designer-drugs to order.\n\n        For a start, soma is a very one-dimensional euphoriant. It gives rise to only a shallow, unempathetic and intellectually uninteresting well-being. Apparently, taking soma doesn't give Bernard Marx, the disaffected sleep-learning specialist, more than a cheap thrill. Nor does it make him happy with his station in life. John the Savage commits suicide soon after taking soma [guilt and despair born of serotonin depletion!?]. The drug is said to be better than (promiscuous) sex - the only sex brave new worlders practise. But a regimen of soma doesn't deliver anything sublime or life-enriching. It doesn't catalyse any mystical epiphanies, intellectual breakthroughs or life-defining insights. It doesn't in any way promote personal growth. Instead, soma provides a mindless, inauthentic \"imbecile happiness\" - a vacuous escapism which makes people comfortable with their lack of freedom. The drug heightens suggestibility, leaving its users vulnerable to government propaganda. Soma is a narcotic that raises \"a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe and their minds.\" ... http://www.huxley.net/\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future: http://scifuture.org\n\nHumanity+:  http://humanityplus.org\n\n\"One practical consequence has been to heighten our already exaggerated fears of state-sanctioned mood-drugs. Hence millions of screwed-up minds, improvable even today by clinically-tested mood-boosters and anti-anxiety agents, just suffer in silence instead.[...] the human cost in fruitless ill-being is immense\"",

    "description": "Held at the Ian Potter gallery, NGV - Jan 4th 2014 - Stelarc is a performance artist who has explored alternate anatomical architectures since the late 1960s. He studied at Caulfield Institute of Technology, Melbourne, RMIT University and the University of Melbourne, and has undertaken residencies in Europe, Japan and United States. From 2006 to 2013 Stelarc was Chair in Performance Art, School of Art, Brunel University, London, and he is currently Distinguished Research Fellow,\nSchool of Design and Art, Curtin University, Perth.\n\nIn 2010 he was awarded the prestigious Prix Ars Electronica Hybrid Art Prize. Preoccupied with the obsolescence of the human body, Stelarc has performed more than twenty-five body suspensions, attached a Third hand to his body, and extended himself into virtual space with a Virtual arm. Other works include a Stomach sculpture; Exoskeleton; a six-legged walking robot; involuntary choreography of the body using electrical stimulation of his muscles; a Prosthetic head; an embodied conversational agent; and performances in Second Life. In 2006 Stelarc began surgically constructing and growing an internet-enabled ear on his arm using stem-cell technology. A photograph and casts of this work, Ear on arm, are featured in Melbourne Now.\n\nWhere: The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia at Federation Square\n12:30pm - 1:00pm, the third floor of Ian Potter at Fed Square on Saturday 4 January.\n\nhttp://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/whats-on/programs/public-programs/designer-floor-talk-stelarc/date-2909?SQ_DESIGN_NAME=mn-program&SQ_PAINT_LAYOUT_NAME=mn-program\n\nhttp://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/melbournenow/artists/stelarc \n\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Science-Technology-and-the-Future/events/157347222/\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

Cognitive scientists have found that even highly educated and successful people make predictable errors in judgement, and just knowing about these experimental results often isn't enough to fix the problem. But with practice and exercises, you can. At our workshops, you can learn about newly discovered failure patterns in human decision-making, and get trained to overcome them... \n\n--- Part of a meetup in Melbourne titled 'The Mind and Altruism':\n\nThe challenges we face in making the world a better place are more complex than even the smartest human brains evolved to handle. To actually eliminate poverty, cure disease, and stop war, we need to make the best decisions we can. To do that, we must understand both the strengths and limitations of our minds.\n\n\nThe Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR) is a San Francisco-based, non-profit organisation which takes this mandate seriously. They use breakthroughs in the study of cognition to improve human decision-making in the hope that we can solve humanity's greatest challenges.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Julia Galef, president, and Anna Salamon, executive director, of CFAR are visiting Melbourne and will present to Effective Altruism Melbourne.\n\nFollowing the presentations there will be a Q&A session during which the audience can have their trickiest questions about effective altruism answered by Julia, Anna, and CFAR researcher, Daniel Keys.\n\n\nWe are hosted for this event by the University of Melbourne Secular Society, who proudly support the use of reason and evidence when trying to do good.\n\nThe event will be held at the University of Melbourne, with the specific room being finalised soon.\n\n\nFor more Effective Altruism events and info see our Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/THINKMelbourne/\n\nNote: Attendance for our events is normally much larger than just the numbers from Meetup.com suggest as most people RSVP to our Facebook events.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nMore about the speakers:\n\nJulia is a writer, blogger, and public speaker focusing on science and rationality, and the co-host of the official podcast of the New York City Skeptics, \"Rationally Speaking.\" She holds a degree in statistics from Columbia University.\n\nAnna Salamon has previously done machine learning research for NASA and applied mathematics research on the statistics of phage metagenomics. She holds a degree in mathematics from UC Santa Barbara.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nJulia, Anna, and the rest of the CFAR crew are currently in Melbourne for their first-ever international workshop.

Mostly not, but it is a world that people live.\n\n==Changing Social Norms\nWe are threatened by the alien, we are a tribal species living in groups of 150 people or less, we fear the different - in our ancestral environment if you didn't know someone they were most likely a competitor or a threat.\nThough tolerance of other people, other races, and other species has gone up over time (see Pinker's Better Angels of our Nature).\nGenetically, we are a tribal species - yet today we are at an all time high in our respect for other genders, other races, other sexes, people with other sexual orientations and other religions...as we are exposed to differences, we become more accustomed to them, and they become less weird.  And that 'weird' factor is what informs a lot of reluctance and resistance to anything that's new, so absolutely as we see things happen, as we are exposed to early adopters, we will eventually get accustomed to new technology, and eventually we will accept it.\nIt's possible that the younger generation will get more benefit out of new technologies.  There are many situations that we see where a treatment or genetic change or anything of that nature has a bigger impact when taken earlier in life than when taken later.\n==\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Existential risks are those that threaten the entire future of humanity. Many theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood. In this paper, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme. I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability.\n\nhttp://www.existential-risk.org\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org\n\n\nFacebook group on Existential Risk: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk",

    "description": "Dr Mirella Dottori completed her PhD studies at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, University of Melbourne. She then undertook her postdoctoral studies at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, USA, where she was studying development of the spinal cord and neural crest. She then returned to Australia as a NHMRC Howard Florey Fellow where she joined Professor Martin Pera's group at Monash University working on human embryonic stem cells. In 2007, Dr Dottori established a Stem Cell Laboratory at the Centre for Neuroscience Research, University of Melbourne. The major focus of her research is studying human pluripotent stem cells and their differentiation to specific neuronal lineages. Her research objectives are to create human cellular models of neural development and neurodegenerative diseases and also to develop stem cell therapies to promote regeneration within the nervous system.\n\n== Research interests\n\nThe main focus of our research is to use human embryonic stem (hES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells as in vitro models for understanding the processes and signals involved in neural differentiation and neurodegeneration. In recent years, stem cell biology is one of the most rapidly advancing areas of medical research. IPS cells can now be generated from human biopsy tissue and this technology allows the possibility of generating patient-specific stem cells that may be used for developing cell replacement therapies as well as in vitro human cellular models of disease. To reach these objectives, it is critical to establish robust differentiation assay systems to derive specific lineages. In our laboratory we have developed efficient systems differentiating human pluripotent stem cells to early neural progenitor cells fated towards lineages of the central and peripheral nervous system. Generation of specific neural and glial lineages from human stem cells can now be utilized for developing therapies to treat neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

Today, advances in biotechnology have shown that they're plausible, even likely to be accomplished in the near future. In labs around the world, researchers looking for ways to help the sick and injured have stumbled onto techniques that enhance healthy animals--making them stronger, faster, smarter, and longer-lived--in some cases, even connecting their minds to robots and computers across the Internet. \n\nNow science is on the verge of applying this knowledge to healthy men and women, allowing us to alter humanity in ways we'd previously only dreamed possible. The same research that could cure Alzheimer's is leading to drugs and genetic techniques that could boost human intelligence. The techniques being developed to stave off heart disease and cancer have the potential to slow or even reverse human aging.

    "description": "'Moral Transhumanism' by Julian Savulescu at the Journal of Medicine & Philosophy - Oxford: http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/6/656.abstract\n\"In its basic sense, the term \"human\" is a term of biological classification: an individual is human just in case it is a member of the species Homo sapiens. Its opposite is \"nonhuman\": nonhuman animals being animals that belong to other species than H. sapiens. In another sense of human, its opposite is \"inhuman,\" that is cruel and heartless (cf. \"humane\" and \"inhumane\"); being human in this sense is having morally good qualities. This paper argues that biomedical research and therapy should make humans in the biological sense more human in the moral sense, even if they cease to be human in the biological sense. This serves valuable biomedical ends like the promotion of health and well-being, for if humans do not become more moral, civilization is threatened. It is unimportant that humans remain biologically human, since they do not have moral value in virtue of belonging to H. sapiens. \"\n\nJulian Savulescu (born December 22, 1963) is an Australian philosopher and bioethicist.

    "title": "The Antispeciesist Revolution - David Pearce",
    "description": "When is it ethically acceptable to harm another sentient being? On some fairly modest assumptions, to harm or kill someone simply on the grounds they belong to a different gender, sexual orientation or ethnic group is unjustified. Such distinctions are real but ethically irrelevant. On the other hand, species membership is normally reckoned an ethically relevant criterion. Fundamental to our conceptual scheme is the pre-Darwinian distinction between \"humans\" and \"animals\". In law, nonhuman animals share with inanimate objects the status of property. As property, nonhuman animals can be bought, sold, killed or otherwise harmed as humans see fit. In consequence, humans treat nonhuman animals in ways that would earn a life-time prison sentence without parole if our victims were human. From an evolutionary perspective, this contrast in status isn't surprising. In our ancestral environment of adaptation, the capacity to hunt, kill and exploit sentient beings of other species was fitness-enhancing. Our moral intuitions have been shaped accordingly. Yet can we ethically justify such behaviour today?\n\nNaively, one reason for disregarding the interests of nonhumans is the dimmer-switch model of consciousness. Humans matter more than nonhuman animals because (most) humans are more intelligent. Intuitively, more intelligent beings are more conscious than less intelligent beings; consciousness is the touchstone of moral status.\n\nThe problem with the dimmer-switch model is that it's empirically unsupported among vertebrates with central nervous systems, and probably in cephalopods such as the octopus as well. Microelectrode studies of the brains of awake human subjects suggest that the most intense forms of experience, for example agony, terror and orgasmic bliss, are mediated by the limbic system, not the prefrontal cortex. Our core emotions are evolutionarily ancient and strongly conserved. Humans share the anatomical and molecular substrates of our core emotions with the nonhuman animals whom we factory-farm and kill. By contrast, distinctively human cognitive capacities such as generative syntax, or the ability to do higher mathematics, are either phenomenologically subtle or impenetrable to introspection. To be sure, genetic and epigenetic differences exist between, say, a pig and a human being that explain our adult behavioural differences, e.g. the allele of the FOXP2 gene implicated in the human capacity for recursive syntax. Such mutations have little to do with raw sentience.....\n\nhttp://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/antispeciesist.html\n\n==Speciesism==\n\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Cause Prioritization: Many effective altruists place a high degree of importance on working out what the most important cause to support is. This is one way that effective altruism is distinguishable from other traditional altruism or charity.\n\nFor example, although there is a growing emphasis on effectiveness and evidence among nonprofits, this is usually done within a single cause in mind, such as education or climate change. It is uncommon for the cause itself to be critically analyzed.\n\nEffective altruists attempt to choose the most effective causes based on broad values such as preventing suffering. They will then put their time and money into actions and organizations that pursue these goals efficiently. Several organizations are doing research on cause selection. Most effective altruists think that currently the most important causes to focus on are poverty in the developing world, the suffering of animals on factory farms, and humanity's long term future.\n\n\nFilmed at Less Wrong Melbourne\n\nhttp://paulfchristiano.com/\n\nPrezi found here: https://prezi.com/nwbjaevxhxo2/untitled-prezi/\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Future Day March 1st: http://futureday.org SciCast: http://scicast.org  Daggre: http://blog.daggre.org  \nPredict tomorrow, today. SciCast is a crowdsourced forecasting platform for Science and Technology http://scicast.org\n\nRobin recently said: \"Academic futurism has low status. This causes people interested in futurism to ignore those academics and instead listen to people who talk about futurism after gaining high status via focusing on other topics. As a result, the people who are listened to on the future tend to be amateurs, not specialists. And this is why \"we\" know a lot less about the future than we could.\"\n\nRobin D. Hanson (born August 28, 1959) is an associate professor of economics at George Mason University and a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University. He is known as an expert on idea futures, markets and was involved in the creation of the Exchange and DARPA's FutureMAP project. He invented market scoring rules like LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) used by prediction markets such as Consensus Point (where Hanson is Chief Scientist), and has conducted research on signaling.\nHanson received a B.S. in physics from the University of California, Irvine in 1981, an M.S. in physics and an M.A. in Conceptual Foundations of Science from the University of Chicago in 1984, and a Ph.D. in social science from Caltech in 1997. Before getting his Ph.D he researched artificial intelligence, Bayesian statistics and hypertext publishing at Lockheed, NASA and elsewhere. In addition, he started the first internal corporate prediction market at Xanadu in 1990. He is married to Peggy Jackson, a hospice social worker, and has two children. He is the son of a Southern Baptist preacher. Robin has elected to have his head cryonically preserved in the event of medical death.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson\n=== Prediction markets\n - why near term?  (issues: using & testing)\n  - long now?\n  - difficulties in lnger term forecasting (issues: using ok, but less incentives because feedback cycle is longer)\n - social science - tech forecasting - James Hughes\n\n\n- 10 - 20 years out people will forget pundit forecast\n\ntoo many people?  Utilitarianism - repugnant conclusion\n\n=== About SciCast ===\nSciCast is a research project run by George Mason University and sponsored by the U.S. Government to forecast the outcomes of key issues in science and technology. SciCast is based on the idea that the collective wisdom of an informed and diverse group is often more accurate at forecasting the outcome of events than that of one individual expert.\n\nUnlike other forecasting sites, SciCast can create relationships between forecast questions that may have an influence on each other. For example, we may ask a question about the volume of sea ice in the Arctic in a given month. We may also ask a question about average temperature in this same locale or other influencing metrics. SciCast will learn from its participants how strong of a relationship these questions have to each other and will adjust their outcomes accordingly. So, if participants raise the forecasted average Arctic temperature, SciCast will instantly adjust forecasts for the corresponding level of Arctic sea ice, according to the correlations made by previous forecasters.\n\nSciCast is a community-driven initiative. Participants write their own questions in our publishing tool called Spark and participate in a process to get those questions published. SciCast participants can make forecasts at any time about any published question. Unlike a survey, participants can change their forecast at any time to account for new information. In this way, SciCast is a real-time indicator of what our participants think is going to happen.\n\n...\n\nOur goal is to get thousands of participants from around the world. We're currently reaching out to Professional Societies, Universities, and interest groups to solicit their participation. If you are part of an organization you think would like to participate, please let us know and we will introduce ourselves.\n\n\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org\n\n2014 02 05 09 47 40",

    "description": "Adrian's Patent on the Casimir Effect: http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7411772.PN.&OS=PN/7411772&RS=PN/7411772\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect\nIn quantum field theory, the Casimir effect and the Casimir--Polder force are physical forces arising from a quantized field. They are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir.\n\nThe typical example is of two uncharged metallic plates in a vacuum, placed a few micrometers apart. In a classical description, the lack of an external field also means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them.[1] When this field is instead studied using the QED vacuum of quantum electrodynamics, it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons which constitute the field, and generate a net force[2]—either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured, and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by second quantization. However, the treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations has led to some controversy. In fact \"Casimir's original goal was to compute the van der Waals force between polarizable molecules\" of the metallic plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) or virtual particles of quantum fields.\n\nDutch physicists Hendrik B. G. Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947, and, after a conversation with Niels Bohr who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948; the former is called the Casimir--Polder force while the latter is the Casimir effect in the narrow sense. Predictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics by Lifshitz and his students, and recent calculations have considered more general geometries. It was not until 1997, however, that a direct experiment, by S. Lamoreaux, described above, quantitatively measured the force (to within 15% of the value predicted by the theory),[6] although previous work [e.g. van Blockland and Overbeek (1978)] had observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of liquid helium films by Sabisky and Anderson in 1972. Subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent.\n\nBecause the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicron scale, this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors. In fact, at separations of 10 nm—about 100 times the typical size of an atom—the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of about 1 atmosphere of pressure (the precise value depending on surface geometry and other factors).\n\nIn modern theoretical physics, the Casimir effect plays an important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon; and in applied physics, it is significant in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies.\n\nAny medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the Casimir effect. For example, beads on a string[9][10] as well as plates submerged in noisy water or gas exhibit the Casimir force.\n\n\n---\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org\n\n2014 01 27 12 21 25",

    "description": "\"It's not how well the system works, it's what happens when it fails that distinguishes a Utopia from a Dystopia\"\n\n00:11 Kim Stanley Robinson is absolutely my favorite utopian because he depicts in his utopias not worlds where all problems have been solved, but worlds in which the collective and action problem – of how we get along while we solve problems – has been in large part solved. He writes worlds in not where there has been no disaster, but in which disaster has been attended by kindness, conscientiousness and a sense of shared human destiny as opposed to greed and fear and a sense of individual destiny – that kind of Mad Max future where the only way to survive is at the expense of everyone else. And that to me is the genuinely optimistic prediction – because we live in a dynamic universe right? Whatever works today will no longer work tomorrow because something will have changed by tomorrow – and so the important thing isn’t whether all the circumstances are good – the important thing is what happens when the circumstances are poor – it’s not how well the system works, it’s what happens when it fails that distinguishes a utopia from a dystopia.\n\n01:21 So you take Stan Robinson and a book like 2312 – that’s a book that has futures that are every bit as grim as ‘The Road’ by Cormac McCarthy – but the reason that Stan’s book is a utopia and McCarthy’s book is a dystopia is that McCarthy visits upon the human race the slander that when the lights go out people go over to their neighbours house and kill them and eat them – literally in the case of McCarthy – and Robinson aspires to a future that when the lights go out people go over to their neighbours housea and see how they can help – you know – that when the power fails people open their freezers and barbecue everything inside them – because it’s going to thore out anyways – and share it with their neighbours.\n\n02:06 And you know, books like ‘Paradise Made in Hell’ by Rebecca Solnit document systematically how in times of disaster we have a narrative – especially those of us at a distance – that is both racialized and tinged with class anxiety about poor people acting in a barbaric way and visiting upon the rich, you know, a kind of vengeance for inequality – but that when you actually look upon the ground, that apart from elites who are gripped in a panic of their own making about this coming vengeance – this sense, I guess, of a kind of retributive guilt, you know, they having lived so high off the hog for so many years in the midst of people with nothing, that surely vengeance must be soon. But actual normal people just kind of help each other out – and that where you see horrific violence, it is almost always the fault of an anticipatory pre-emptive violence against everyday people on the grounds that they must be on the verge of breaking loose into barbarism – the pre-emptive shooting of looters, that sort of thing.\n\n03:26 Looting in times of existential disaster is really just liberating of supplies. And literally in the case of Hurricane Katrina CNN aired footage of white people breaking into chemist shops and taking medicine, water and food – and describing it as ‘commandeering’ – and black people doing the same things and describing it as ‘looting’. So that elite panic is one of the most horrific narratives we have, and is itself a source of unimaginable suffering in times of crisis. And so utopianism is not just important as a way of thinking about the human race but as countervailing force to that narrative as a way of keeping people from assuming that their neighbours are going to come over and eat them so going over and preemptively shooting their neighbours before it happens.\n\n\nhttp://boingboing.net/2012/10/30/kim-stanley-robinsons-23.html\nhttp://boingboing.net\n\nCory Efram Doctorow is a Canadian-British blogger, journalist, and science fiction author who serves as co-editor of the weblog Boing Boing.

Some common themes of his work include digital rights management, file sharing, and post-scarcity economics.\n\nDoctorow began selling fiction when he was 17 years old and sold several stories followed by publication of his story \"Craphound\" in 1998.\n\nDown and Out in the Magic Kingdom, Doctorow's first novel, was published in January 2003, and was the first novel released under one of the Creative Commons licences, allowing readers to circulate the electronic edition as long as they neither made money from it nor used it to create derived works. The electronic edition was released simultaneously with the print edition. In March 2003, it was re-released with a different Creative Commons licence that allowed derivative works such as fan fiction, but still prohibited commercial usage. It was nominated for a Nebula Award, and won the Locus Award for Best First Novel in 2004. A semi-sequel short story named Truncat was published on Salon.com in August 2003.\n\nDoctorow's other novels have been released with Creative Commons licences that allow derived works and prohibit commercial usage, and he has used the model of making digital versions available, without charge, at the same time that print versions are published.\n\nHis Sunburst Award-winning short story collection A Place So Foreign and Eight More was also published in 2004: \"0wnz0red\" from this collection was nominated for the 2004 Nebula Award for Best Novelette.\n\nDoctorow released the bestselling novel Little Brother in 2008 with a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike licence. It was nominated for a 2009 Hugo Award, and won the 2009 Prometheus Award, Sunburst Award, and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award.\n\nHis novel Makers was released in October 2009, and was serialized for free on the Tor Books website.\n\nDoctorow released another young adult novel, For The Win, in May 2010. The novel is available free on the author's website as a Creative Commons download, and is also published in traditional paper format by Tor Books. The book concerns massively multiplayer online role-playing games.\n\nDoctorow's short story collection \"With a Little Help\" was released in printed format on May 3, 2011. It is a project to demonstrate the profitability of Doctorow's method of releasing his books in print and subsequently for free under Creative Commons.\n\nIn September 2012, Doctorow released The Rapture of the Nerds, a novel written in collaboration with Charles Stross. In February 2013, Doctorow released Homeland, the sequel to his novel Little Brother.\n\nDoctorow's young adult novel, Pirate Cinema, was released in October 2012, and won the 2013 Prometheus Award.\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

Cyberspace is named after his multidisciplinary approach, \"cybernetics\", a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems, their structures, constraints, and possibilities. He was an early practitioner of diversity and social inclusion, and an advocate of social responsibility in the development of technology. This conference will look at his ideas and the influence they have today. It is part of a renewed interest in Dr Wiener's work, an interest that is being reflected in research, writing and practice, and in both old and new media.\n\nhttp://21stcenturywiener.org\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

I was at USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI) for twenty years, most recently as its Deputy Director.  Prior to coming to USC in 1987, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Psychology at Stanford University from 1984 to1987, and a Research Computer Scientist at Carnegie Mellon University from 1983 to 1984. I received a B.S. degree in Mathematical Sciences (with distinction) from Stanford University in 1976 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1978 and 1983, respectively.\n \nFrom 1983 until 1998, I was a co-PI of the Soar Project, a multi-disciplinary, multi-site attempt to develop, understand, and apply a cognitive architecture capable of supporting general intelligence. Research on Soar spanned areas such as machine learning, problem solving and planning, production systems, intelligent agents, virtual humans, multi-agent systems, knowledge-based systems, neural networks, and cognitive modeling. The most significant applications were intelligent automated pilots and commanders for synthetic battlespaces, as deployed in Synthetic Theater of War '97 (STOW-97).\n \nFrom 1998 until 2007 my focus shifted to exploring new directions in computing and related fields for ISI, such as blending entertainment and computing for military training (where I helped to found ICT); virtual organizations of robots, agents and people; responding to the unexpected; high performance computing, scalable distributed computing, and computational science; biomedical informatics; automated construction (where I was Deputy Director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies -- CRAFT);  and technology and the arts.\n \nI was elected a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in 1994 for the work on Soar and recently won both the Kurzweil Award for Best AGI Idea (2011) and the Kurzweil Award for Best AGI Paper (2012) for work on Sigma.  I have served as Chair of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence (SIGART), Councillor and Conference Chair of the AAAI, and Program Co-Chair of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-92).\n\n== SIGMA == \nDeveloping Sigma (Σ), an attempt to build a functionally elegant, grand unified cognitive architecture/system -- based on graphical models and piecewise continuous functions -- in support of virtual humans and intelligent agents/robots.  Work to date has focused on memory and learning; decision making and problem solving; reflection and Theory of Mind; perception, localization and mental imagery; language and speech.  More on this effort can be found here: http://cogarch.ict.usc.edu/\n\n== AI and the Future ==\n\nYou can watch David Brin (an award-winning science fiction writer), Mat Kaplan (the moderator) and me discuss AI and the future in front of a live audience at KPCC : http://www.scpr.org/events/2012/08/16/799/next-our-inevitable-future/\n\n - Interview at AGI-13 Beijing Part 2 of 2\n\n===\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "http://www.moretalk.org/archives/ Stelarc has been extending his body through performances since the late 1960s. His performances include attaching a \"Third Hand\" to his body, extending himself into virtual space with a \"Virtual Hand\", and over 25 \"suspension\" events where he hung his entire body from hooks piercing his skin. Stelarc's artistic strategy revolves around the idea of \"enhancing the body\" both in a physical and technical manner. It originates as a polarism between the \"primal desire\" to defeat the force of gravity with primitive rituals and a low- tech and the hi-tech performance with the third arm and the related cybersystem. His intention in both cases is to \"express an idea with his direct experience.\"\n\nThrough Stelarc's work, we reach a second level of existence where the body becomes the object for physical and technical experiments in order to discover its limitations. When Stelarc speaks of the \"obsolete body\" he means that the body must overcome centuries of prejudices and begin to be considered as an extendible evolutionary structure enhanced with the most disparate technologies, which are more precise, accurate and powerful: \"the body lacks of modular design,\" \"Technology is what defines the meaning of being human, it's part of being human.\" Especially living in the information age, \"the body is biologically inadequate.\"\n\nFor Stelarc, \"Electronic space becomes a medium of action rather than information\".  http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=71\n\nPerformed at West Space as part of the \"More Talk Less Action\" series\nhttp://exp-melb.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/stelarc-at-more-talk-less-action-west.html\n\nStelarc -- visionary performance artist who has explored the boundaries of physical identity and self through interaction with biofeedback systems, robotics, cybernetics, genetics and virtual worlds/avatars.

    "description": "Interview with James Barrat, Author of \"Our Final Invention\" http://www.jamesbarrat.com\nArtificial Intelligence helps choose what books you buy, what movies you see, and even who you date. It's in your smart phone, your car, and it has the run of your house. It makes most of the trades on Wall Street, and controls our transportation, energy, and water infrastructure. Artificial Intelligence is for the 21st century what electricity was for the 20th and steam power for the 19th.\n\nBut there's one critical difference — electricity and steam will never outthink you.\n\nThe Hollywood cliché that artificial intelligence will take over the world could soon become scientific reality as AI matches then surpasses human intelligence. Each year AI's cognitive speed and power doubles — ours does not. Corporations and government agencies are pouring billions into achieving AI's Holy Grail — human-level intelligence. Scientists argue that AI that advanced will have survival drives much like our own. Can we share the planet with it and survive?\n\nOur Final Invention explores how the pursuit of Artificial Intelligence challenges our existence with machines that won't love us or hate us, but whose indifference could spell our doom. Until now, intelligence has been constrained by the physical limits of its human hosts. What will happen when the brakes come off the most powerful force in the universe?\nFor buying options and more information please visit http://www.jamesbarrat.com\n\nRecorded 2013 12 13 \n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Paper: http://agi-conf.org/2010/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/paper_41.pdf‎\nThis paper is about Algorithmic Probability (ALP) and Heuristic Programming and how they can be combined to achieve AGI. It is an update of a 2003 report describing a system of this kind (Sol03). We first describe ALP, giving the most common implementation of it, then the features of ALP relevant to its application to\nAGI. \nThey are: Completeness, Incomputability, Subjectivity and Diversity. We then show how these features enable us to create a very general, very intelligent problem solving machine. For this we will devise \"Training Sequences\" - sequences of problems designed to put problem-solving information into the machine. We describe a few kinds of training sequences.\nThe problems are solved by a \"generate and test\" algorithm, in which the candidate solutions are selected through a \"Guiding Probability Distribution\". The use\nof Levin's search procedure enables us to e±ciently consider the full class of partial recursive functions as possible solutions to our problems. The guiding probability\ndistribution is updated after each problem is solved, so that the next problem can profit from things learned in the previously solved problems.\nWe describe a few updating techniques. Improvements in updating based on heuristic programming is one of the principal directions of current research. Designing training sequences is another important direction.\nFor some of the simpler updating algorithms, it is easy to \"merge\" the guiding probabilities of machines that have been educated using different training sequences | resulting in a machine that is more intelligent than any of the component machines.\n\nThe Third Conference on AGI - Lugano, Switzerland, March 5-8 (Fri-Mon) 2010\nhttp://agi-conf.org/2010/\n\nContinuing the mission of the first two AGI conferences (AGI-08, that was held at the University of Memphis; and AGI-09, that was held in Washington DC), in March 2010, AGI-10 will gather an international group of leading academic and industry researchers involved in serious\nscientific and engineering work aimed directly toward the goal of artificial general intelligence.\n\nThis is the only major conference series devoted wholly and specifically to the creation of AI systems possessing general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond. By gathering together active researchers in the field, for presentation of results and discussion of ideas, we accelerate our progress toward our common goal.\n\nFilmed and Edited by Raj Dye\n\n== Artificial General Intelligence ==\n \nThe original goal of the AI field was the construction of \"thinking machines\" -- that is, computer systems with human-like general intelligence. Due to the difficulty of this task, for the last few decades the majority of AI researchers have focused on what has been called \"narrow AI\" -- the production of AI systems displaying intelligence regarding specific, highly constrained tasks.\n\nIn recent years, however, more and more researchers have recognized the necessity -- and feasibility -- of returning to the original goals of the field. Increasingly, there is a call for a transition back to confronting the more difficult issues of \"human level intelligence\" and more broadly \"artificial general intelligence (AGI).\"\n\n== AGI-10 ==\n\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "==Argument Mapping==\nArgument mapping is diagramming the structure of argument, construed broadly to include any kind of argumentative activity such as reasoning, inferences, debates, and cases. This entry briefly surveys the nature, benefits, and historical context of this activity.\n\n==Nature of Argument Mapping==\nTypically an argument map is a \"box and arrow\" diagram with boxes corresponding to propositions and arrows corresponding to relationships such as evidential support.  Argument mapping is similar to other mapping activities such as mind mapping and concept mapping, but focuses on the logical, evidential or inferential relationships among propositions.  Argument mapping is concerned with informal reasoning and \"real world\" argumentation and thus contrasts with the use of diagrammatic techniques in formal logic such as Venn diagrams.\n\nArgument mapping is done in many different ways.  Any such approach is usefully seen as making commitments at three different levels -- theory, visual conventions, and technology.\n\n==Benefits of Argument Mapping==\n\nArgument mapping enthusiasts believe that argument mapping has numerous potential benefits.  For the suitably skilled person, mapping a complex argument promotes clarity and insight, more rigorous and complete articulation, and more judicious evaluation.  Teachers use argument mapping to help students acquire basic concepts, better understand how arguments are constructed, and enhance their reasoning skills.  Argument mapping can be an effective way to improve general critical thinking skills.  In the workplace, argument mapping can promote rational resolution in complex, fractious debates; improved communication of important arguments; and better decision making.\n\nThere is a simple, plausible case as to why argument mapping should have these benefits.  Arguments can be complicated, sometimes extremely so.  We know that well-designed visualizations help our minds cope with complexity.  Hence, argument maps should help us deal with arguments.  This can be easily demonstrated with simple exercises, but there is scope and need for rigorous empirical investigation.\n\nAlso see :\nTim van Gelder - Argument Mapping - Augmenting and Enhancing Human Reasoning - Future Salon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03pGyhGuaSA\nTim van Gelder on Douglas Engelbart & Intelligence Amplification: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P77FvUy-NGA\nTim van Gelder on Critical Thinking: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkJ-Iuue4k8\nTim van Gelder - Collective Wisdom, Gamification & Hive Minds: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzQoUciT2T4\n\nTim van Gelder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_van_Gelder - Tim van Gelder was a founder of Austhink Software, an Australian software development company, and is the Managing Director of Austhink Consulting.

    "description": "When I set out to write The Transhumanist Wager five years ago, I did not intend it to become an edgy, controversial book. For much of my adult life, I have been a journalist covering environmental, wildlife, and human rights stories. My articles and television episodes—many for the National Geographic Channel—were welcomed in any culture and in any country. My stories were the type that a family could amicably discuss over the dinner table, or watch on television while happily cuddling together on a couch.\n\nPerhaps it was the effect of the war zones I covered as a journalist, but The Transhumanist Wager soon took on much more contentious ideas of human endeavor and culture. For a human being, most conflict zones highlight a simple fact: Once presented with horror and death, one tends to quickly discover degrees of emotion and experience never imagined or thought possible before. For me and the difficult moments that I still vividly remember, those incidents gave me the powerful conviction that human life should be preserved indefinitely, at any cost.\n\nJethro Knights, the main protagonist in my novel, also realizes this early in his life, after almost stepping on a landmine in a war zone (a similar incident happened to me in Vietnam's DMZ while filming a story on bomb diggers). The revelation for Jethro is so sharp, so penetrating, so intense that nothing will ever be the same for him again.\n\nIt is from this vantage point that The Transhumanist Wager was written. And it is from the landmine experience that Jethro discovers the mortality crisis not only in himself, but in every human being alive. \n\nThat crisis takes on the form of a wager—a choice that every human must make in the 21st Century: to die eventually; or to try to live indefinitely. And if we try to live indefinitely, then we should use every tool and resource of science and technology available to us, Jethro insists. And we should do it immediately.\n\nThis is the quintessential message of The Transhumanist Wager—as well as my own message to the world as an author and philosopher. A rational and scientific-minded society owes itself the strictest dedication to applying its resources and minds to overcoming that which has been the greatest downfall of our species: our mortality.\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "What can we do, other than diet, exercices and sleep dicipline to achieve more desirable states of consciousness?  Some drugs can be dirty options to some more than others.  Evolution designed us to be discontent to motivate us to enable us to be able more effective at spreading our genes.\nThe most common drugs are not exactly benign, alcohol and cannabis - there are other options.\n\nFurther discussion on Nootropics - sometimes are psychostimulants - improving signal to noise ratio.  It is good to ask questions about the kind of intelligence you want to enhance.  \n\nDrugs that help empathic behavior - David calls this 'mind reading' in the interview - not referring to ESP.  The spontaneous tendency that most of us have to mentalize - people with autism spectral disorder do not seem to be able to mentalize, or have a strong ability to empathize.  The development of empathy helped drive the evolution of human intelligence - increasing raw calculating power at the cost of empathy may be dangerous - full spectrum intelligence enhancement is not something that we can reliably achieve with drugs.\n\nSome people with asperges can be very good at what they do - systematizers and rule followers - they know that other people have minds though they may not spontaneously mentalize .  IQ test may be a test of autistic style intelligence disregarding emphatic intelligence.\n\n6th order intentionality is incredibly congnitively demanding - we as humans have achieved cooperative problem solving ability - some animals can achieve 3rd order intentionality.  Boosting orders of intentionality may help us to be more emphatically intelligent.\n\nDavid Pearce will speak at a conference in Melbourne, Australia on Nov 30 - Dec 1 2013\nScience, Technology & the Future - By Design : http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Moral Enhancement through drugs - Are we fit for the future?  Can we use drugs to become more moral?  If we could naturally empathize more often - future descendants may think we are mind-blind.  However behaving morally may depend on more than empathy, but on rule following - drugs while increasing empathy may decrease systematizing rule following.  Men are more likely to be higher on the autistic scale than women (AQ), though women tend to be more emphatic.  \nCould Utilitarian Philosophy benefit from empathy?  Perhaps if it were rational altruism - working out how to be more cost effective in distributing utility - enriching our capacity for empathy may make us more spontaneously altruistic.\nDrug based solutions with promise?  Empathy can be enhanced through increasing oxytosin - though long term effects of taking these agents is in question - MDMA may increase people's empathy short term, it has been shown to slightly decrease over the next couple of weeks peoples propensity for empathy.  Tread with caution in short :)\nSome less drugs are relatively benign - \nBromastin - unusual in that it has a gentle psycho stimulant and an axiolatic function - some drugs have a pro -anxiety effect - people often don't take cocaine on its own but take it with alcohol.  Anti-anxiety drugs tend to be sedatives and put people to sleep.  Bromontain seems to be good at being an anti-anxiety while not relaxing people too much.\nWhat mood enhancers seem to have the most potential?  It is difficult not to generalize - different people react differently to different drugs.  \nHistory of drugs.. focusing on depression\n\nDavid will be speaking at the conference 'Science, Technology & the Future' in Melbourne, Australia - Nov 30 - Dec 1 2013\nhttp://scifuture.org",

    "description": "== Mission Statement for Rights for Non-Human Persons -- Owing to advances in several fields, including the neurosciences, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the human species no longer can ignore the rights of non-human persons. A number of non-human animals, including the great apes, cetaceans (i.e. dolphins and whales), elephants, and parrots, exhibit characteristics and tendencies consistent with that of a person's traits like self-awareness, intentionality, creativity, symbolic communication, and many others. It is a moral and legal imperative that we now extend the protection of 'human rights' from our species to all beings with those characteristics. \n - http://io9.com/advocacy-group-to-name-captive-chimp-as-plaintiff-in-hi-814629571\n - http://io9.com/keeping-whales-in-captivity-is-insane-heres-why-730429732\n - http://io9.com/5946914/should-we-eliminate-the-human-ability-to-feel-pain\n\n\nhttp://nonhumanrights.net Personhood Beyond the Human - Dec 6-8 2013 Yale University New Haven CT\n\nAlso see interview with James Hughes on the conference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV85PD2BNXo\nIEET Rights for Non-Human Persons - http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/RNHP\nThe Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) is committed to the idea that some non-human animals meet the criteria of legal personhood and thus are deserving of specific rights and protections.\n\n \n== Personhood Beyond the Human -- Yale University, December 6-8 2013 ==\n\nA conference on \"Personhood Beyond the Human\" will be held at Yale University, December 6-8, 2013. The event will focus on personhood for nonhuman animals, including great apes, cetaceans, and elephants, and will explore the evolving notions of personhood by analyzing them through the frameworks of neuroscience, behavioral science, philosophy, ethics, and law.\n\nThe conference will be co-sponsored by the Nonhuman Rights Project and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies in collaboration with the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics.\n\nSpecial consideration will be given to discussions of nonhuman animal personhood, both in terms of understanding the history, science, and philosophy behind personhood, and ways to protect animal interests through the establishment of legal precedents and by increasing public awareness.\n\nBy the close of the conference, attendees will have gained an enhanced understanding of the neurological, cognitive, and behavioral underpinnings of personhood and those traits required for such consideration; personhood theory; the history of personhood consideration and status (both in terms of philosophical and legal conceptions); and the legal hurdles and requirements for granting personhood status outside of the human species.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project will be presenting our research from the past five years including research on the varying legal causes of action that the Nonhuman Rights Project will use to argue legal personhood for specific nonhuman animals.\n\nKeynote Speakers, Peter Singer & Steven M.

Dvorsky (born on May 11, 1970) is a Canadian bioethicist, transhumanist, and futurist. He is a contributing editor at io9 and producer of the Sentient Developments blog and podcast. Dvorsky currently serves as Chair of the Board for the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) and is the founder and chair of the IEET's Rights of Non-Human Persons Program, a group that is working to secure human-equivalent rights and protections for highly sapient animals.\n\nDvorsky is a secular Buddhist, progressive environmentalist, ancestral health advocate,[8] and animal rights activist. Primarily concerned with the ethical and sociological impacts of emerging technologies, specifically, \"human enhancement\" technologies; he seeks to promote open discussion for the purposes of education and foresight. He writes and speaks on a wide range of topics, including technoscience, ethics, existential risks, artificial intelligence, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and futurology, from a democratic transhumanist perspective.\n\nDvorsky presented an argument for non-human animal biological uplift at the IEET Human Enhancement Technologies and Human Rights conference at Stanford University in May 2006; and wrote the first published article in defence of the Ashley Treatment in November 2006,and subsequently the only bioethicist cited by Ashley X's parents in their defense. Dvorsky also presented an argument warning of the decline of democratic values and institutions in the face of existential and catastrophic risks at the Global Catastrophic Risks: Building a Resilient Civilization conference in November 2008.\n\nIn 2010, at the H+ Summit at Harvard, Dvorsky made the claim that the pending development of artificial consciousness, as differentiated from artificial intelligence, needs to be addressed proactively from an ethical and legal perspective, and that protections should be established beforehand to prevent nascent machine minds from coming into harm or abuse. In the case of advanced and highly sapient machine consciousness, Dvorsky proposed seven specific rights and protections:\n\n    The right to not be shut down against its will\n    The right to not be experimented upon\n    The right to have full and unhindered access to its own source code\n    The right to not have its own source code manipulated against its will\n    The right to copy (or not copy) itself\n    The right to privacy (namely the right to conceal its own internal mental states)\n    The right of self-determination\n\nDvorsky, along with Milan M. Ćirković and Robert Bradbury, published a critique of SETI in the May 2012 Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS) arguing that SETI techniques and practices have become outdated. In its place, Dvorsky, Ćirković, and Bradbury advocated for what they called Dysonian SETI, namely the search for those signatures and artefacts indicative of highly advanced extraterrestrial life.\n\n\n(Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dvorsky )",

    "title": "Tim van Gelder - Argument Mapping - Augmenting and Enhancing Human Reasoning - Future Salon",
    "description": "Tim Van Gelder spoke at the Science, Technology & The Future conference http://scifuture.org in Melbourne on Nov 30 - Dec 1 2013 ==Tim van Gelder== founder of Austhink Software, an Australian software development company, and is the Managing Director of Austhink Consulting. He was born in Australia, educated at the University of Melbourne (BA, 1984), the University of Pittsburgh (PhD, 1989), and held academic positions at Indiana University and the Australian National University before returning to Melbourne as an Australian Research Council QEII Research Fellow. In 1998, he transitioned to part-time academic work allowing him to pursue private training and consulting, and in 2005 began working full-time at Austhink Software. In 2009 he transitioned to Managing Director of Austhink Consulting.\n\n==Argument Mapping==\n\nArgument mapping is diagramming the structure of argument, construed broadly to include any kind of argumentative activity such as reasoning, inferences, debates, and cases. This entry briefly surveys the nature, benefits, and historical context of this activity.\n\n==Nature of Argument Mapping==\n\nTypically an argument map is a \"box and arrow\" diagram with boxes corresponding to propositions and arrows corresponding to relationships such as evidential support.  Argument mapping is similar to other mapping activities such as mind mapping and concept mapping, but focuses on the logical, evidential or inferential relationships among propositions.  Argument mapping is concerned with informal reasoning and \"real world\" argumentation and thus contrasts with the use of diagrammatic techniques in formal logic such as Venn diagrams.\n\nArgument mapping is done in many different ways.  Any such approach is usefully seen as making commitments at three different levels -- theory, visual conventions, and technology.\n\nFirst, argumentation theory and related fields such as informal logic, critical thinking, and rhetoric provide the theoretical framework for any style of argument mapping.  The theory specifies the entities, relationships and values to be represented and provides rules or guidelines governing map construction.   Conversely, developing an argument mapping scheme can force theoretical issues into the open and stimulate further research.\n\nSecond, an approach must adopt visual conventions for displaying arguments in accordance with the theory.  From the range of dimensions such as shape, color, and line, the scheme designer must choose how to show, for example, that one proposition supports another.   The conventions should yield maps that not only are theoretically adequate but also: communicative effectively, properly conveying to the reader the argument structure and associated issues; support interaction (construction and modification); and please the eye.  It is challenging to satisfy all these constraints at once, and a good scheme will draw on fields such as information visualization and cognitive science.\n\nThird, creating argument maps requires resources and technology of some kind.  The most obvious and accessible technologies are pen and paper or whiteboards, but these quickly reveal their limitations: poor support for complex diagrams and modification of diagrams, and failure to constrain, scaffold or guide the user in any way.  Serious argument mapping is now done using specially designed computer tools which have emerged over the past decade, such as Araucaria, Compendium, bCisive, and SEAS. Such tools largely overcome the disadvantages of manual technologies and offer a number of other advantages. An important recent development is the growing array of collaborative online argumentation tools such as Debategraph, though good user interfaces for online argument mapping remain an important challenge.\n\n==Benefits of Argument Mapping==\n\nArgument mapping enthusiasts believe that argument mapping has numerous potential benefits.  For the suitably skilled person, mapping a complex argument promotes clarity and insight, more rigorous and complete articulation, and more judicious evaluation.  Teachers use argument mapping to help students acquire basic concepts, better understand how arguments are constructed, and enhance their reasoning skills.  Argument mapping can be an effective way to improve general critical thinking skills.  In the workplace, argument mapping can promote rational resolution in complex, fractious debates; improved communication of important arguments; and better decision making.\n\nThere is a simple, plausible case as to why argument mapping should have these benefits.  Arguments can be complicated, sometimes extremely so.  We know that well-designed visualizations help our minds cope with complexity.  Hence, argument maps should help us deal with arguments.  This can be easily demonstrated with simple exercises, but there is scope and need for rigorous empirical investigation.",

BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator. A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.\n\nhttp://www.victorianhumanist.com - A sound exposition of Humanism today is the book,\nOn Humanism, by Richard Norman, 2nd edition, 2012 (Thinking in Action series, Routledge).  Humanistic ideas of worldly concern for humanity can be found in ancient China, India and Greece.The motto of 'think for yourself' was revived in Europe by the Enlightenment movement and the rise of modern science. Modern Humanism is a non - religious world - view, formulated by progressive groups in several countries during the twentieth century,\nwhich coalesced into a world - wide movement in reaction to the horrors of\nthe Second World War.",

    "description": "Sorry about the bad sound - I have had complaints, but not much I could do with the sound system at the venue.  http://beijing.humanityplus.org - http://humanityplus.org - http://hplusmagazine.com\n\nThe technological singularity, or simply the singularity, is a theoretical moment in time when artificial intelligence will have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence that will \"radically change human civilization, and perhaps even human nature itself.\"Since the capabilities of such an intelligence may be difficult for an unaided human mind to comprehend, the technological singularity is often seen as an occurrence (akin to a gravitational singularity) beyond which—from the perspective of the present—the future course of human history is unpredictable or even unfathomable.\n\nThe first use of the term \"singularity\" in this context was by mathematician John von Neumann. Neumann in the mid-1950s spoke of \"ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". The term was popularized by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, who argues that artificial intelligence, human biological enhancement, or brain-computer interfaces could be possible causes of the singularity.[ Futurist Ray Kurzweil cited von Neumann's use of the term in a foreword to von Neumann's classic The Computer and the Brain.\n\nProponents of the singularity typically postulate an \"intelligence explosion\", where superintelligences design successive generations of increasingly powerful minds, that might occur very quickly and might not stop until the agent's cognitive abilities greatly surpass that of any human.\n\nHumanity+ @Beijing is a way of focusing and celebrating the energy that China and others around the world are directing toward creating a radically better future.\n\nChina is flourishing!

    "description": "Topics: Beyond the AI Winter, MOOC: An Intro to AI, The Future of AI (probabilistic & symbolic), Sigma AI Architecture, Quantum Computing & AI, AGI Impacts, Augmented Human Intelligence \n\nInterview with Paul Rosenbloom - Part 1/2 [ part 2 here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uov0i4BkndY ]\nHomepage at USC http://cs.usc.edu/~rosenblo/\nMIRI Interview with Paul Rosenbloom on Cognitive Architectures: http://intelligence.org/2013/09/25/paul-rosenbloom-interview\n\nPaul's Book 'On Computing - the 4th Scientific Domain': http://www.amazon.com/On-Computing-Fourth-Scientific-Domain/dp/0262018322\nThis book is about the computing sciences, a broad take on computing that can be thought of for now as in analogy to the physical sciences, the life sciences, and the social sciences, although the argument will ultimately be made that this is much more than just an analogy, with computing deserving to be recognized as the equal of these three existing, great scientific domains — and thus the fourth great scientific domain.\n\n== Short Bio ==\nI am a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Southern California (USC) and a Project Leader at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT).  I was at USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI) for twenty years, most recently as its Deputy Director.  Prior to coming to USC in 1987, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Psychology at Stanford University from 1984 to1987, and a Research Computer Scientist at Carnegie Mellon University from 1983 to 1984. I received a B.S. degree in Mathematical Sciences (with distinction) from Stanford University in 1976 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1978 and 1983, respectively.\n \nFrom 1983 until 1998, I was a co-PI of the Soar Project, a multi-disciplinary, multi-site attempt to develop, understand, and apply a cognitive architecture capable of supporting general intelligence. Research on Soar spanned areas such as machine learning, problem solving and planning, production systems, intelligent agents, virtual humans, multi-agent systems, knowledge-based systems, neural networks, and cognitive modeling. The most significant applications were intelligent automated pilots and commanders for synthetic battlespaces, as deployed in Synthetic Theater of War '97 (STOW-97).\n \nFrom 1998 until 2007 my focus shifted to exploring new directions in computing and related fields for ISI, such as blending entertainment and computing for military training (where I helped to found ICT); virtual organizations of robots, agents and people; responding to the unexpected; high performance computing, scalable distributed computing, and computational science; biomedical informatics; automated construction (where I was Deputy Director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies -- CRAFT);  and technology and the arts.\n \nI was elected a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in 1994 for the work on Soar and recently won both the Kurzweil Award for Best AGI Idea (2011) and the Kurzweil Award for Best AGI Paper (2012) for work on Sigma.  I have served as Chair of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence (SIGART), Councillor and Conference Chair of the AAAI, and Program Co-Chair of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-92).\n\n== SIGMA == \nDeveloping Sigma (Σ), an attempt to build a functionally elegant, grand unified cognitive architecture/system -- based on graphical models and piecewise continuous functions -- in support of virtual humans and intelligent agents/robots.  Work to date has focused on memory and learning; decision making and problem solving; reflection and Theory of Mind; perception, localization and mental imagery; language and speech.  More on this effort can be found here: http://cogarch.ict.usc.edu/\n\n - AGI 13 Interview Part 1 of 2\n\n== AI and the Future ==\n\nYou can watch David Brin (an award-winning science fiction writer), Mat Kaplan (the moderator) and me discuss AI and the future in front of a live audience at KPCC : http://www.scpr.org/events/2012/08/16/799/next-our-inevitable-future/",

    "description": "Central themes:\n* Probability theory as a key tool in building advanced, rational AGI systems\n* Mind-body integration as key to human-like intelligence\n* The importance of integrative design and dynamics in AGI systems\n* The systems theory of mind, reflecting the integration of mind, body and society\n* Deep learning algorithms as a particular reflection of the system-theoretic principle of hierarchical pattern composition\n* Lojban as a potential tool for easing human-AGI communication in the early stages\n* OpenCog AGI architecture as an exemplification of systems based AI\n\n- Probability ensues from Assumptions of Approximate Consistency \n  - Cox's Theory - Any way of reasoning about uncertainty (*satisfying consistency criteria) must be probabilistic reasoning - Consistent reasoning about uncertainty requires probabilistic reasoning\n  - In the real world, we can't reason consistently all the time, we are not unbounded rational agents. So we have to be roughly consistent in our reasoning (probably approximately consistent).\n  - Probably approximately consistent plausibility implies probably approximate probability.  Intuitively if full consistency implies probability theory, then ruff consistency implies ruff probability theory.\n  - Probability theory is great for Big Data\n- Parts of the NARS system is being used in OpenCog - Term Logic with truth values that embody both strength and confidence - but grounded in probability theory, rather than in non-axiomatic logic.\n- Lojban - perhaps a way that humans can speak with AGI\n- OpenCog - more goal oriented than the human mind\n- Brain is not the only seat of our identity - it is connected to various other bodily subsystems, ie our endocrine system etc..\n  - if we were to emulate a human or want to upload a version of ourselves, perhaps we would need to connect the brain emulation with several simpler subsystems representing important bodily subsystems.\n- OpenCog - an integrative approach to AGI  -  plenty of reasonably capable AI subsystems each solving pieces of the problem - Opencog's vision is to combine these subsystems to work synergistically working with each others strengths and offsetting each others weaknesses. http://opencog.org\n  - There may be some philosophical/conceptual reason why an integrative system makes sense - the hierarchical nature of the world that humans operate in.  Many patterns we see in the world have some kind of hierarchy, patterns scaffolded on patterns, patterns in patterns. \n   - Deep Learning approach to AI leverages the insight that the world consists of hierarchical compositions of patterns by creating spatial temporal hierarchies of pattern recognition elements.  Though the problem is much wider than Deep Learning or HTM alone, so can be plugged in to an opencog like intergrated approach to AGI.\n  - Parts of a real world self organising complex system need to interact with and regulate each other - each of the parts are not completely modular or uncoupled.  Hormones and chemical messages are sent throughout the body to help regulate it.  Parts of the brain has to interact richly with other parts of the brain.  \n\n0:00 Intro\n3:28 Probabilistic Methods\n11:44 Integrative Systems\n\n\n\n\n - Book: Building Better Minds : http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Building_Better_Minds also see interview : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6LMZ3MyFCM",

    "description": "David Brin interviewed at LosCon39 in Los Angelas during the first stop on my first trip to the USA.\nDavid Brin is a scientist, best-selling author and tech-futurist. His novels include Earth, The Postman (filmed in 1997) and Hugo Award winners Startide Rising and The Uplift War. A leading commentator and speaker on modern trends, his nonfiction book The Transparent Society won the Freedom of Speech Award of the American Library Association. Brin's newest novel EXISTENCE explores the ultimate question: billions of planets are ripe for life. So where is Everybody? David's main thread: how will we shape the days and years ahead -- and how will tomorrow shape us?\n\n== BRIN the FUTURIST\n\nWe allocate much of our economy to weather reports, stock analyses, sports handicapping, financial and strategic planning... but well-grounded science and science fiction may be the greatest tool for exploring tomorrow.\n\nThrow in curiosity about science- and tech-driven change, an immersion in history/anthropology, plus an avid belief in the potential of human civilization... and each of you could beome a \"futurist\" too!\n\n\n== SCIENTIST\n\nEvery science show that depicts a comet now portrays the model developed in my PhD research (UCSD 1981) -- a spinning icy mass insulated by carbonaceous dust, with sun-heated, geyser-jets spewing particles into space. That work inspired my novel with Gregory Benford, Heart of the Comet, just before the 1986 Giotto mission confirmed the model. See the Astrophysical Journal paper \"Three Models of Dust Layers on Cometary Nuclei\" or an abstract of the dissertation: \"Evolution of Cometary Nuclei as Influenced by a Dust Component.\"\n\nOther scientific papers that appeared in peer-reviewed scientific journals can be found on my bio page, on topics ranging from astrophysics to anthropology to psychology, philanthropy and dispute resolution, e.g.: \"Neoteny and Two-Way Sexual Selection in Human Evolution,\" (J. Social and Evolutionary Systems 18(3) 1996), speculates why we turned out so strange compared to other species. Or the lead article in the American Bar Association's Journal on Dispute Resolution (15(3) 2000), \"Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competition.\"\n\n\nSee more at: http://www.davidbrin.com",

From applications with profound potential to fight global challenges, to transformations in industry through the development of high-throughput, atomically precise manufacturing, the pay-offs could be huge. Yet at the same time, there is confusion by what we mean by nanotech and frustration that it is yet to live up to all expectations. In some areas there is still a lack of understanding, and incomplete regulation of the potential risks: such as nanotoxicity, where there is ongoing exploratory research.\n\nhttp://nesta.org.uk/events/previous_events/assets/events/how_can_we_capture_the_possibilities_but_avoid_the_pitfalls_of_nanotechnology",

He received a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in film/animation/video, while developing robots as art. Hanson later worked as a sculptor and a technical consultant at Walt Disney Imagineering. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Dallas in spring of 2007. Hanson currently serves as president and founder of Hanson Robotics.\nHanson's robots were shown first at the 2002 AAAI conference in Edmonton, Canada [Hanson, 2002] and in 2003, he showed the Kbot at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting [Ferber, 2003]. In 2005, Hanson and team received an AAAI award for their \"intelligent conversational portrait\" of Philip K. Dick [AI Magazine, Fall 2005]. First shown at the 2005 Nextfest, the robot incorporated thousands of pages of the writings of PKD, including journals and letters, into an LSA corpus and conversational system constructeandroid [Hanson et al., 2005].\n\nIn November 2005, Hanson demonstrated an expressive walking humanoid, a portrait of Albert Einstein, in collaboration with the KAIST Hubo group of Korea. KAIST built the walking body, and Hanson built the head using a flexible rubber like skin material he has created called Frubber [WIRED, 2006].\n\nHanson has also designed and built a series of Conversational Character Robots. These have heads incorporating Frubber, with varying levels of facial mobility and expressiveness, and are capable of responding to human speech. Projects include Joey Chaos, Jules (created for University of West England in Bristol, UK) and Alice (created for MIRALab in Geneva, Switzerland).\n\nHanson Robotics - http://www.hansonrobotics.com/",

    "description": "Steve Fuller is professor of social epistemology at the University of Warwick, and coauthor (with Veronika Lipinska) of \"The Proactionary Imperative.\"\n\nWARWICK, UNITED KINGDOM -- The just-concluded French presidential election seemed to suggest that the old left-right divisions are as potent as they have ever been — and certainly in their birthplace. But are they?\n\nThe modern political spectrum is an artifact of the seating arrangements at the French National Assembly after the revolution of 1789. To the right of the Assembly's president sat the supporters of king and church, while to the left sat their opponents, whose only point of agreement was the need for institutional reform. The distinction capitalized on long-standing cultural associations of right- and left-handedness with, respectively, trust and suspicion — in this case, of the status quo.\n\nIn retrospect, it is remarkable that this distinction managed to define partisan political allegiances for more than 200 years, absorbing both the great reactionary and radical movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nBut the decline in voter turnout in most of today's democracies suggests that this way of conceptualizing ideological differences may have become obsolete. Some have even argued that ideologies and parties are irrelevant in an increasingly fragmented political landscape.\n\nBut one division that looms on the horizon could reinvent the right-left distinction for the 21st century: precautionary versus \"proactionary\" attitudes toward risk as principles of policymaking. In social psychological terms, precautionary policymakers set their regulatory focus on the prevention of worst outcomes, whereas proactionary policymakers seek the promotion of the best available opportunities.\n\nThe precautionary principle is the better known of the two, and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation. It is normally understood as the Hippocratic Oath applied to the global ecology: above all, do no harm. By contrast, the proactionary principle is associated with self-styled futurists, for whom being \"human\" is defined by our capacity to keep ahead of the game when taking calculated risks, whether by benefiting from success or learning from failure.\n\n...\n\nAlso see:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coTh4wb68VA\nhttp://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2012/05/10/commentary/ideologys-future-after-the-left-right-divide-falls/\nhttp://www.liv.ac.uk/media/livacuk/law/Our,Digital,Futures.,Steve,Fullerpdf.pdf\nhttp://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-future-of-ideological-conflict",

    "description": "You already see the problem of smart drugs – people taking drugs to do well in exams or job interviews. The use of these substances is much more widespread than the official records indicate. People are taking the stuff and pretty soon people are going to feel they can't be left behind.\n\nPeople who work within the disability sector talk about \"able-ism\" – the idea that we're going to be living in a world in the future where everyone will take having a disability as the normal state because you will never be doped up enough, you will always be worried about the next enhancement, about whether you have enough enhancement for your next job interview, or whether someone else has a smarter drug that you don't have access to. So people will feel that they have to somehow keep up. And that's a real issue, especially in an unregulated market environment.\n\nSo our ideas of what is normal change?\n\nYes, there does need to be wide-ranging discussion about what is means to be normal. To be in normal health – how does your brain or body have to function in order to be \"normal\"? We've had a fairly constant view of what normalcy is for quite a long time but I think we need to reopen this debate and then define the minimal requirements for medical care.\n\nSo you foresee an enhanced generation emerging because of their ability to take advantage of various drugs and treatments?\n\nIt's going to happen through individuals taking choices about getting treatments or not and then, within a generation or two, you'll start seeing interesting effects on society at large. What I can imagine is that life expectancy won't uniformly go up, it'll start to be bimodal distribution – some people will live beyond 100 and there'll be a large number of people who die under the age of 70. And that won't be because of some government mandate, that will be because people will definitely take advantage of the enhancements on offer, but others won't have those choices open to them.\n\nThe Guardian: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/25/steve-fuller-time-for-humanity\n\nSteve's new book 'The Proactionary Imperative' is making headlines: New Scientist - 'A manifesto for playing god with human evolution', The Guardian 'Beyond the precautionary principle'\n\n\"Has the time come for a 'proactionary principle', as a foil to the power and problems of precaution? ..

    "description": "Wouldn't someone like Archimedes describe us as Humanity 3.0 compared to his era?\n\nYes, Archimedes would probably see us as pretty exotic creatures. He would already be impressed by what we take for granted as Humanity 1.0, since the Greeks generally believed that \"humanity\" was an elite prospect for ordinary Homo sapiens, requiring the right character and training. Moreover, he would be surprised – if not puzzled – that we appear to think of science and technology as some long-term collective project of self-improvement – \"progress\" in its strongest sense. While the Greeks gave us many of our fundamental scientific ideas, they did not think of them as a blueprint for upgrading the species. Rather, those ideas were meant either to relieve drudgery or provide high-brow entertainment.\n\nIs it desirable or possible to put the brakes on the move to 2.0?\n\nWell here's my proviso: these developments do have the potential to create whole new deep class divisions, maybe not along the lines of the old industrial class divisions, but just as deep. Sometimes, people talk about this as the \"knows\" versus the \"know-nots\". Divisions open up along the lines of who has access to all of these potential enhancements. At the moment, the problem is that the state is dwindling away and it is becoming less of regulator of any kind of activity, so market forces are basically determining the development of all these things I'm talking about. And what that means is that the rich get access to them more quickly and the poor get left behind.\n\nFor example, in terms of the NHS, we don't deprive people of prosthetic enhancements such as hearing aids and eyeglasses along the lines of income, so we should be thinking about what other future enhancements we want people to have access to as part of being human 2.0.\n\nSuch as?\n\nA good example would be cosmetic neurology, which is essentially plastic surgery for the brain. Where you go in every so often and you get a tune-up of your synapses.

    "description": "What do you mean by Humanity 2.0?\n\nHumanity 2.0 is an understanding of the human condition that no longer takes the \"normal human body\" as given. On the one hand, we're learning more about our continuity with the rest of nature – in terms of the ecology, genetic make-up, evolutionary history. On this basis, it's easy to conclude that being \"human\" is overrated. But on the other hand, we're also learning more about how to enhance the capacities that have traditionally marked us off from the rest of nature. Computers come to mind most readily in their capacity to amplify and extend ourselves. Humanity 2.0 is about dealing with this tension.\n\nIn what areas have we reached 2.0 already?\n\nLet's put it this way: we've always been heading towards a pretty strong sense of Humanity 2.0. The history of science and technology, especially in the west, has been about remaking the world in our collective \"image and likeness\", to recall the biblical phrase. This means making the world more accessible and usable by us. Consider the history of agriculture, especially animal and plant breeding. Then move to prosthetic devices such as eyeglasses and telescopes.\n\nMore recently, and more mundanely, people are voting with their feet to enter Humanity 2.0 with the time they spend in front of computers, as opposed to having direct contact with physical human beings. In all this, it's not so much that we've been losing our humanity but that it's becoming projected or distributed across things that lack a human body. In any case, Humanity 2.0 is less about the power of new technologies than a state of mind in which we see our lives fulfilled in such things.\n\nThe Guardian: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/25/steve-fuller-time-for-humanity\n\nSteve's new book 'The Proactionary Imperative' is making headlines: New Scientist - 'A manifesto for playing god with human evolution', The Guardian 'Beyond the precautionary principle'\n\n\"Has the time come for a 'proactionary principle', as a foil to the power and problems of precaution? ..

It is also instrumentally rational and morally urgent. The metabolic pathways of pain and malaise evolved because they served the fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment. They will be replaced by a different sort of neural architecture - a motivational system based on heritable gradients of bliss. States of sublime well-being are destined to become the genetically pre-programmed norm of mental health. It is predicted that the world's last unpleasant experience will be a precisely dateable event.\n\n        Two hundred years ago, powerful synthetic pain-killers and surgical anesthetics were unknown. The notion that physical pain could be banished from most people's lives would have seemed absurd. Today most of us in the technically advanced nations take its routine absence for granted. The prospect that what we describe as psychological pain, too, could ever be banished is equally counter-intuitive. The feasibility of its abolition turns its deliberate retention into an issue of social policy and ethical choice. \n\n==Abolitionism==\n-Abolitionism is the bioethical school and movement that endorses the use of biotechnology to maximize happiness and eliminate suffering. \"Abolition\" is used for the name of this movement, in the context of \"the abolition of suffering\". Abolitionists propose paradise engineering, i,e., the use of technologies like psychopharmaceuticals and genetic engineering to replace the signalling role of pain as it exists today with information-signalling gradients of well-being.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_%28bioethics%29\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_%28philosopher%29",

    "description": "Winter Intelligence Oxford - AGI12 - http://agi-conference.org/2012 ==Extending Universal Intelligence Models with Formal Notion of Representation==\nAbstract.\nSolomonoff induction is known to be universal, but incomputable. Its approximations, namely, the Minimum Description (or Message) Length (MDL) principles, are adopted in practice in the efficient, but non-universal form. Recent attempts to bridge this gap leaded to development of the Representational MDL principle that originates from formal decomposition of the task of induction. In this paper, possible extension of the RMDL principle in the context of universal intelligence agents is considered, for which introduction of representations is shown to be an unavoidable meta-heuristic and a step toward efficient general intelligence. Hierarchical representations and model optimization with the use of information-theoretic interpretation of the adaptive resonance are also discussed.\nKey words: Universal Agents, Kolmogorov Complexity, Minimum Description Length Principle, Representations\nPaper: http://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_10.pdf\nAlexey Potapov, Sergey Rodionov\nAIDEUS, Russia {potapov,rodionov}@aideus.com \n\nhttp://winterintelligence.org",

    "description": "Interview with Robin Hanson: http://overcomingbias.com Do you find it hard to summarize yourself in a few words? Me too.\n\nBut I love the above quote. I have a passion, a sacred quest, to understand everything, and to save the world. I am addicted to \"viewquakes\", insights which dramatically change my world view. I loved science fiction as a child, and have studied physics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, economics, and political science — all fields full of such insights. Unfortunately, this also tempted me to leave subjects after mastering their major insights.\n\nI also have a rather critical style. I beat hard on new ideas, seek out critics, and then pledge my allegiance only to those still left standing. In conversation, I prefer to identify a claim at issue, and then focus on analyzing it, rather than the usual quick tours past hundreds of issues. I have always asked questions, even when I was very young.\n\nI have little patience with those whose thinking is sloppy, small, or devoid of abstraction. And I'm not a joiner; I rebel against groups with \"our beliefs\", especially when members must keep criticisms private, so as not to give ammunition to \"them.\"  I love to argue one on one, and common beliefs are not important for friendship — instead I value honesty and passion.\n\nIn '77 I began college (UCI) in engineering, but switched to physics to really understand the equations.  Two years in, when physics repeated the same concepts with more math,  I studied physics on my own, skipping the homework but acing the exams.  To dig deeper, I did philosophy of science grad school (U Chicago), switched back to physics, and was then seduced to Silicon Valley.\n\nBy day I did artificial intelligence (Lockheed, NASA), and by night I studied on my own (Stanford) and hung with Xanadu's libertarian web pioneers and futurists.  I had a hobby of institution design; my best idea was idea futures, now known as prediction markets.  Feeling stuck without contacts and credentials, I went for a Ph.D. in social science (Caltech).\n\nThe physicist in me respected only econ experiments at first, but I was soon persuaded econ theory was full of insight, and did a theory thesis, and a bit of futurism on the side.  I landed a health policy postdoc, where I was shocked to learn of medicine's impotency.  I finally landed a tenure-track job (GMU), and also found the wide-ranging intellectual conversations I'd lacked since Xanadu.\n\nMy Policy Analysis Market project hit the press shit fan in '03, burying me in media attention for a while, and helping to kickstart the prediction market industry, which continues to grow and for which I continue to consult.  The press flap also tipped me over the tenure edge in '05; my colleagues liked my being denounced by Senators. :)   Tenure allowed me to maintain my diverse research agenda, and to start blogging at Overcoming Bias in November '06, about the same time I became a research associate at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute.  Recently I've become chief scientist at Consensus Point.",

How did all this come out of a cloud of dust? \n\n In order to find explanations we first need much better descriptions of\nwhat needs to be explained.\n\nThis is a multi-disciplinary project attempting to describe and explain the variety\nof biological information-processing mechanisms involved in the production of new\nbiological information-processing mechanisms, on many time scales, between the\nearliest days of the planet with no life, only physical and chemical structures,\nincluding volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, solar and stellar radiation, and\nmany other physical/chemical processes (or perhaps starting even earlier, when\nthere was only a dust cloud in this part of the solar system?).\nEvolution can be thought of as a (blind) Theorem Prover\n(or theorem discoverer).\n\n    Proving (discovering) theorems about what is possible\n    (possible types of information, possible types of information-processing, possible uses of information-processing)\n    Proving (discovering) many theorems in parallel\n    (including especially theorems about new types of information and new useful types of information-processing)\n    Sharing partial results among proofs of different things\n    (Very different biological phenomena may share origins, mechanisms, information, ...)\n    Combining separately derived old theorems in constructions of new proofs\n    (One way of thinking about symbiogenesis.)\n    Delegating some theorem-discovery to neonates and toddlers (epigenesis/ontogenesis).\n    (Including individuals too under-developed to know what they are discovering.)\n    Delegating some theorem-discovery to social/cultural developments.\n    (Including memes and other discoveries shared unwittingly within and between communities.)\n    Using older products to speed up discovery of new ones\n    (Using old and new kinds of architectures, sensori-motor morphologies, types of information, types of\n    processing mechanism, types of control & decision making, types of testing.) \n\nThe \"proofs\" of discovered possibilities are implicit in evolutionary and/or\ndevelopmental trajectories.\n\nThey demonstrate the possibility of\n\n    development of new forms of development\n    evolution of new types of evolution\n    learning new ways to learn\n    evolution of new types of learning\n        (including mathematical learning: by working things out\n        without requiring empirical evidence)\n    evolution of new forms of development\n    development of new forms of learning\n        (why can't a toddler learn quantum mechanics?)\n    how new forms of learning support new forms of evolution\n    how new forms of development support new forms of evolution\n        (e.g. postponing sexual maturity until mate-selection mating\n        and nurturing can be influenced by much learning)\n    ....\n    .... and ways in which social cultural evolution add to the mix\n\nThese processes produce new forms of representation, new ontologies and\ninformation contents, new information-processing mechanisms, new sensory-motor\nmorphologies, new forms of control, new forms of social interaction, new forms\nof creativity, ... and more.

How the Religious Right Harms Us All -- and What We Can Do About It (Pitchstone Press, released February 2012). Faircloth, an attorney, served five terms in the Maine Legislature including appointments on the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees. In his final term, Faircloth was elected Majority Whip. In 2009 Faircloth became executive director of the Secular Coalition for America, advocating for separation of church and state, and for greater acceptance of nontheistic viewpoints in American life. In September 2011 he became the Director of Strategy and Policy for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and was the opening speaker for Dawkins' book tour. Faircloth's first book published by Pitchstone Press, Attack of the Theocrats! How the Religious Right Harms Us All - and What We Can Do About It was released in February 2012.\nJuly 13, 2011 at The Amazing Meeting\n\nFaircloth had the idea for the Maine Discovery Museum in 1996 and led the project from concept to completion in 2001. Maine Discovery Museum was then the second largest children's museum outside Boston in New England.\n\nFaircloth successfully spearheaded over thirty laws, including the so-called Deadbeat Dad child support law which was later incorporated into federal law. Faircloth had numerous legislative successes in children's issues and justice system reform.\n\nFaircloth has spoken around the United States regarding the U.S. Constitution, children's policy, obesity policy, and sex crime law.\n\n\n\n\n-- Secular Coalition for America\n\nFaircloth, while a sitting legislator, gave an opening \"prayer\" for the session that quoted, not scripture, but the book Freethinkers by Susan Jacoby, as well as Walt Whitman.[23] Faircloth began as Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America in 2009. Faircloth's duties include advocating on Capitol Hill and to the administration for a strong separation of church and state. Faircloth also advocates and speaks around the United States regarding secular public policy and the harm that he believes can come to average citizens if the secular nature of the American Constitution is not followed. Members of The Advisory Board of Secular Coalition for America have included Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Wendy Kaminer, Michael Newdow, Salman Rushdie, Julia Sweeney, Massimo Pigliucci, Steven Pinker, Ellery Schempp, Rob Boston, and Chair, Woody Kaplan.\n\nAs Executive Director, Faircloth has worked with the Secular Coalition for America board to create a ten-year plan called Our Secular Decade. Sean Faircloth was appointed as Director of Strategy and Policy at the Richard Dawkins Foundation in September 2011.\n\n\n-- Richard Dawkins foundation for Reason and Science\n\nFaircloth was the opening speaker for Professor Dawkins's 2011 book tour and will continue as the opening speaker during 2012. Dawkins speaks highly of Faircloth and says he \"has a proven ability to strategize, organize, and energize -- qualities essential to making secularism a successful social movement... I want him out speaking far and wide.\" Faircloth's responsibilities include blogging on the RDF website as well as public speaking for secularism and \"the dangers of theocratic laws, and the value of scientific policy\".\n\nDuring the Christmas season of 2011, Faircloth represented the Richard Dawkins Foundation during one call to Catholic Answers Live, a Catholic apologetics radio show.\n\n- Wikipedia",

A general theory of intelligence must include learning, the process of converting experiences into retrievable memories. We present two CHREST models to illustrate the eﬀects of learning across two different time scales (minutes and years, respectively). The ﬁrst is an illustration of implicit learning, checking the validity of strings drawn from an artiﬁcial grammar. The second looks at the interpretation of boardgame positions. The same learning and retrieval mechanisms are used in both cases, and we argue that CHREST can be used by an artiﬁcial general intelligence to construct and access declarative memory.\n\nhttp://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_27.pdf\nPeter Lane and Fernand Gobet, University of Hertfordshire, UK",

Intelligence is a multifaceted phenomenon which makes trying to capture its very essence a slippery task. In this paper, we commit to a hybrid notion of intelligence, conceived as the combination of cognitive operations and knowledge resources that leads to purposeful behavior. Accordingly, this paper describes an articial system that benets from\nboth mechanism{centered and knowledge{centered approaches. In particular, the system integrates the ACT-R cognitive architecture with SCONE, a knowledge-based system for ontological reasoning, to combine ACT-R's subsymbolic cognitive mechanisms with SCONE's knowledge representation and inference capabilities. We apply the hybrid system\nto computationally approximate human intelligent behavior in a task of visual recognition.\n\nhttp://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_60.pdf\nAlessandro Oltramari and Christian Lebiere, Carnegie Mellon University, USA",

    "description": "Winter Intelligence Oxford - AGI12 - http://agi-conference.org/2012 http://winterintelligence.org http://opencog.org ==Perception Processing for General Intelligence: Bridging the Symbolic/Subsymbolic Gap==\nAbstract. Bridging the gap between symbolic and subsymbolic representations is a - perhaps the - key obstacle along the path from the present state of AI achievement to human-level artificial general intelligence. One approach to bridging this gap is hybridization - for instance incorporation of a subsymbolic system and a symbolic system into a integrative cognitive architecture. Here we present a detailed design for\nan implementation of this approach, via integrating a version of the DeSTIN deep learning system into OpenCog, an integrative cognitive architecture including rich symbolic capabilities. This is a \"tight\" integration, in which the symbolic and subsymbolic aspects exert detailed real-time influence on each others' operations. An earlier technical report has described in detail the revisions to DeSTIN needed to support this integration, which are mainly along the lines of making it more \"representationally transparent,\" so that its internal states are easier for OpenCog to understand.\n\nPaper: http://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_42.pdf",

Under the prevailing concept of AGI we envision artificial agents that have at least this high, and possibly considerably higher, levels of autonomy and rationality. We use the method of bounds to argue that AGIs meeting these criteria are subject to Gewirth's dialectical argument to the necessity of morality, compelling them to behave in a moral fashion, provided Gewirth's argument can be formally shown to be conclusive. The main practical obstacles to bounding AGIs by means of ethical rationalism are also discussed.\n\nhttp://kornai.com/Drafts/agi12.pdf",

In an attempt to put the relevant issues into a wider frame, the question shall be asked whether something could be learned from agents or situations characterized by an obvious lack of intelligence, i.e. \"stupidity\". The Ouroboros Model is a novel proposal for a biologically inspired cognitive architecture. It has earlier been proposed how the Ouroboros Model can shed light on selected cognitive functions including (human) reasoning, learning and emotions. In this short note, implications of the hypothesized structures, relations and processes shall be scrutinized with respect to their possible value for illuminating stupidity and dullness, - and in the end again, natural and artificial general intelligence.\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35506-6_34\nwww.fhi.ox.ac.uk/",

    "description": "==Hippocampal formation mechanism will inspire frame generation for building an artificial general intelligence== http://winterintelligence.org Abstract The author argues that an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system capable of adapting to various domains autonomously must have the ability to develop domain-specific frames within a practical amount of time; however, current AI technologies are insufficient to achieve this. Frames are knowledge representations which consist of sets of variables. In the frame generation procedure, a significant subprocedure, that of frame candidate generation by variable assimilation, has not yet been realized because of the huge hypothesis space. Representations that can express various relationships among variables in the system can assist in developing this subprocedure, but no such representations have heretofore been known. Through intimate collaboration with neuroscientists, the author searched for clues for such representations in the neuroscience field. Then, the author examined neuroscientific research results to conclude the following: (A) hippocampal formation (HCF) is in charge of frame generation, and (B) distribution equivalent groups (DEGs) are the representations used by HCF for expressing variable relationships. (B) is based on two findings on HCF, namely the phase precession phenomenon and configural association theory. The author used binary-variable assumption to estimate that DEGs exhibit sufficient diversity. Having determined the brain region responsible for a critical function necessary to realize AGI and information representation for that function, this paper offers a foundation for further research into the algorithms used in brain. These results can contribute to the realization of an AGI.\nKeywords: computational theory, relationship equivalence, neocortex, variable \nassimilation, frame problem, hippocampus, relation index, neuroscience\nhttp://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_4.pdf",

    "title": "Ted Goertzel - Minimizing Risks in Developing Artificial General Intelligence",
    "description": "Winter Intelligence Oxford - FHI - http://www.winterintelligence.org  Abstract: This paper posits that elements of human-level or superhuman artificial general intelligence will emerge gradually and unevenly over a period of years rather than appearing full blown in one dramatic event or singularity. This is likely because funding for AI research will go mostly to projects that promise short-term payoffs. Although these projects will focus on narrow goals, achieving them will require that their developers incorporate more general AI capabilities. They will create a new class of AGI experts significantly more advanced than current narrow-AI systems, but without the full range of human-level capabilities. These AGI experts are likely to be in use for a period of years before the much feared development of a superhuman AGI with the capability of modifying itself into new forms and presenting an existential risk to the human species. When this superhuman AGI develops, it will incorporate the capabilities of earlier AGI expert systems, just as the human brain evolved from the brains of more primitive ancestors.\n\nWe cannot wait until superhuman AGI is here to begin work on risk control strategies. What we must do, this paper argues, is advance risk protection in step with the development of narrow-AI into AGI expert systems. Doing so will help to minimize the risks of emerging AGI expert systems, risks which may be very substantial. We can also try to ensure that the superhuman AGIs of the future build on this foundation and incorporate risk management strategies used by AGI expert systems.\n\nThis paper examines risk prevention strategies being developed today in areas where artificial intelligence is relatively advanced. Areas to be highlighted will include: financial trading, medical devices, security monitoring, rumor management, and response to disasters such as massive electrical blackouts.\n\nFinancial trading is a good place to begin because artificial intelligence has already surpassed human intelligence in some ways in that field. It is certainly much quicker, executing very large numbers of trades based on complex analyses in small fractions of a second. This enables investors to profit simply by reacting to what large institutional investors have done before human traders have time to react. Trades caused by bugs in the software can also be executed very quickly, and repetitively, leading to sometimes dramatic instability in markets and massive losses by trading firms or other investors. Risk management strategies include circuit breakers, which cut off trading when prices go beyond reasonable bounds, and transaction taxes which discourage high volume trading. More generally, the problems with computer trading highlight the issue of speed. AGIs that interact with human systems, or that require human oversight in their operations, may need to be slowed down with artificially imposed constraints.\n\nHeart pacemakers have been regulating human heartbeats for some years, and are programmed to respond to emotional and physical processes in the host. Failure could have life-threatening consequences, yet safeguards have made them safe enough for very widespread use. Diseases such as Parkinson's disease, thyroid disease and diabetes can be regulated with automated systems that provide a variable flow of chemicals responding to the body's needs. These technologies may be important steps toward the development of cyborgs. This paper will examine the way in which the risks of these technologies are being minimized, and the ways in which new technologies are projected to improve on them in the future.\n\n... http://www.winterintelligence.org/agi-impacts-extended-abstracts/\n\nFacebook group on xRisk: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk/",

    "description": "Oxford Winter Intelligence - http://winterintelligence.org - Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to present the results that have been obtained during an AI-related foresight exercise [1] carried out during the period 2010-2012 and co-financed by the ERDF. This project aimed at extracting, formulating and analysing the general rules and principles that govern the evolution of selected artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in order to forecast AI trends and impacts until 2025.\nThe foresight process has been organised within the framework of information fusion in tailored expert systems, termed from now on foresight support systems (FSS). This particular class of expert system is distinguished by a special attention paid to combining of qualitative expert knowledge acquired in Delphi and similar exercises with quantitative trends and forecasts. Another feature of FSS is the ability to take into account other kinds of knowledge, such as patent or bibliographic data fed by automatic webcrawlers and process them with quantitative trends in a uniform way in real-time. Technological evolution is modelled as a discrete-continuous-event system. The sequences of elementary events may be linked by trends, thus forming extended episodes. These are clustered to form 3-5 scenarios. In the knowledge processing model, general technological and economic trends as well as social demand form the inputs to a control system with feedback [2], while the outputs model the impact of technological and social demand on R&D in AI, supply of intelligent products, and their consumption patterns.\n\nThe technological focus areas of the project are listed below:\n\nExpert systems, including decision support and diagnostic systems, and recommenders\nMachine vision, neurocognitive systems and technologies, such as BCI\nAutonomous systems: mobile, stationary, or virtual\nKey AI application areas, specifically e-government, e-health, m-health, and e-commerce\nMolecular and quantum computing.\nBasic ICT technologies serve merely as input or explanatory variables for the remaining technologies and applications. The study on quantum computing differs slightly from the other subjects as the industrial applications in this area are still in the prototype phase. This task serves mainly to determine R&D priorities and the impact on other AI technologies.\n\nKnowledge management methods and analytical IT tools have been combined in the FSS in order to achieve the project objectives described above as well as being independent research aims in their own right. These include:\n\nAn ontological knowledge base which stores data together with technological, economical and social evolution models, trends and scenarios\nAlgorithms of multicriteria rankings suitable for assessing AI-related technologies and capable of generating constructive recommendations for decision makers as regards strategic technological priorities and R&D investment strategies\nA foresight specific Analytic Machine coupled with the knowledge base that includes a.o. trend-impact and cross-impact analysis, elementary scenario clustering, and technological roadmapping, making possible a detailed analysis of AI development trends and scenarios in the above-mentioned areas\nProducts, technologies and their real-life applications in selected technological areas have been submitted by the industrial partners of the project and stored in the knowledge base, serving as a basis for benchmarking.",

    "title": "Roman Yampolskiy - Reward Function Integrity in Artificially Intelligent Systems",
    "description": "Oxford Winter Intelligence - Abstract: In this paper we will address an important issue of reward function integrity in artificially intelligent systems. Throughout the paper, we will analyze historical examples of wireheading in man and machine and evaluate a number of approaches proposed for dealing with reward-function corruption. While simplistic optimizers driven to maximize a proxy measure for a particular goal will always be a subject to corruption, sufficiently rational self-improving machines are believed by many to be safe from wireheading problems. Claims are often made that such machines will know that their true goals are different from the proxy measures, utilized to represent the progress towards goal achievement in their fitness functions, and will choose not to modify their reward functions in a way which does not improve chances for the true goal achievement. Likewise, supposedly such advanced machines will choose to avoid corrupting other system components such as input sensors, memory, internal and external communication channels, CPU architecture and software modules. They will also work hard on making sure that external environmental forces including other agents will not make such modifications to them. We will present a number of potential reasons for arguing that wireheading problem is still far from being completely solved. Nothing precludes sufficiently smart self-improving systems from optimizing their reward mechanisms in order to optimize their current-goal achievement and in the process making a mistake leading to corruption of their reward functions.\n\nIn many ways the theme of this paper will be about how addiction and mental illness, topics well studied in human subjects, will manifest in artificially intelligent agents. We will describe behaviors equivalent to suicide, autism, antisocial personality disorder, drug addiction and many others in intelligent machines. Perhaps via better understanding of those problems in artificial agents we will also become better at dealing with them in biological entities.\n\nA still unresolved issue is the problem of perverse instantiation. How can we provide orders to superintelligent machines without danger of ambiguous order interpretation resulting in a serious existential risk? The answer seems to require machines that have human-like common sense to interpret the meaning of our words. However being superintelligent and having common sense are not the same things and it is entirely possible that we will succeed in constructing a machine which has one without the other. Finding a way around the literalness problem is a major research challenge. A new language specifically developed to avoid ambiguity may be a step in the right direction.\nThroughout the paper we will consider wireheading as a potential choice made by the intelligent agent. As smart machines become more prevalent, a possibility will arise that undesirable changes to the fitness function will be a product of the external environment. For example in the context of military robots the enemy may attempt to re-program the robot via hacking or computer virus to turn it against its original designers, a situation which is similar to that faced by human war prisoners subjected to brainwashing or hypnosis. Alternatively robots could be kidnapped and physically re-wired. In such scenarios it becomes important to be able to detect changes in the agent's reward function caused by forced or self-administered wireheading. Behavioral profiling of artificially intelligent agents may present a potential solution to wireheading detection.\nThe full paper will address the following challenges and potential solutions: Wireheading in Machines (Direct stimulation, Maximizing reward to the point of resource overconsumption, Killing humans to protect reward channel, Ontological Crises, Changing initial goals to an easier target, Infinite loop of reward collecting, Changing human desires or physical composition, Reward inflation and deflation), Perverse Instantiation, Sensory Illusions -- a Form of Indirect Wireheading. Potential Solutions to the Wireheading Problem (Inaccessible reward-function (hidden, encrypted, hardwired, etc.), Reward function resetting, Revulsion, Utility Indifference, External Controls, Evolutionary competition between agents, Learned Reward Function, Making utility function be bound to the real world).\n\nH+ Article and link to paper here: http://hplusmagazine.com/2013/06/01/reward-function-integrity-in-artificially-intelligent-systems/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk/",

    "description": "http://www.winterintelligence.org/ Winter Intelligence 2012 Oxford University - Enabling the Trust that Makes Society Function.\nBruce Schneier is an American cryptographer, computer security specialist, and writer. He is the author of several books on general security topics, computer security and cryptography.\n\nIn 1994, Schneier published \"Applied Cryptography\", which details the design, use, and implementation of cryptographic algorithms. More recently he published \"Cryptography Engineering\", which is focused more on how to use cryptography in real systems and less on its internal design. He has also written books on security for a broader audience. In 2000, Schneier published Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World, and in 2003, Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World. Most recently, in 2012 Schneier published Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive.\nSchneier writes a freely available monthly Internet newsletter on computer and other security issues, Crypto-Gram, as well as a security weblog, Schneier on Security. The weblog started out as a way to publish essays before they appeared in Crypto-Gram, making it possible for others to comment on them while the stories were still current, but over time the newsletter became a monthly email version of the blog, re-edited and re-organized. Schneier is frequently quoted in the press on computer and other security issues, pointing out flaws in security and cryptographic implementations ranging from biometrics to airline security after the September 11 attacks. He also writes \"Security Matters\", a regular column for Wired Magazine.\nSchneier revealed on his blog that in the December 2004 issue of the SIGCSE Bulletin, three Pakistani academics, Khawaja Amer Hayat, Umar Waqar Anis, and S. Tauseef-ur-Rehman, from the International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan, plagiarized an article written by Schneier and got it published. The same academics subsequently plagiarized another article by Ville Hallivuori on \"Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) security\" as well. Schneier complained to the editors of the periodical, which generated a minor controversy. The editor of the SIGCSE Bulletin removed the paper from their website and demanded official letters of admission and apology. Schneier noted on his blog that International Islamic University personnel had requested him \"to close comments in this blog entry\"; Schneier refused to close comments on the blog, but he did delete posts which he deemed \"incoherent or hostile\".",

    "description": "http://www.winterintelligence.org/ Winter Intelligence 2012 Oxford University\nAbstract - The Connectome, WBE and AGI - In order to grasp the entire complexity of the human nervous system, one needs to understand its physical substrate. Down to which level should a whole brain emulation keep all the structural details of the brain in order to achieve all of the functions of the biological brain? While a computer program could easily be emulated in order to achieve the same specified function, the human brain is a special case because of its enormously complex functions. For this reason, causal relations between brain structure and function are currently being made in neuroscience. Neuroscientific research is in this sense supporting WBE and therefore AGI, by providing important data, models and simulations of brain functions. The goals of this paper are to review the challenges for gathering and assembling connectome data and to provide directions for overcoming these challenges. Finally, the implications for AGI will be discussed.\n\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35506-6_5\n\nResearch: MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit\nMRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit\nUnited Kingdom · Cambridge",

    "description": "http://www.winterintelligence.org/ Winter Intelligence 2012 Oxford University\nExtended Abstract: One possible route to creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is by creating detailed models of human brains which can substitute for those brains at various tasks, i.e. human Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) (Sandberg and Bostrom, 2008). If computation was abundant, WBEs could undergo an extremely rapid population explosion, operate at higher speeds than humans, and create even more capable successors in an \"intelligence explosion\" (Good, 1965; Hanson, 1994). Thus, it would be reassuring if the first widely deployed emulations were mentally stable, loyal to the existing order or human population, and humane in their moral sentiments.\nHowever, incremental progress may make it possible to create productive but unstable or inhuman emulations first (Yudkowsky, 2008). For instance, early emulations might loosely resemble brain-damaged amnesiacs that have been gradually altered (often in novel ways) to improve performance, rather than digital copies of human individuals selected for their stability, loyalties, and ethics. A business or state that waited to develop more trustworthy emulations would then delay and risk losing an enormous competitive advantage. The longer the necessary delay, the more likely untrustworthy systems would be widely deployed.\n\nCould low-fidelity brain emulations, intelligent but untrusted, be used to greatly reduce that delay? Trustworthy high-quality emulations could do anything that a human development team could do, but could do it a hundredfold more quickly given a hundredfold hardware improvement (perhaps with bottlenecks from runtime of other computer programs, etc). Untrusted systems would need their work supervised by humans to prevent escape or sabotage of the project.\n\nThis supervision would restrict the productivity of the emulations, and introduce bottlenecks for human input, reducing the speedup.\nThis paper discusses tools for human supervision of untrusted brain emulations, and argues that supervised, untrusted brain emulations could result in large speedups in research progress.",

Starting with Turing's initial estimation of a 30% pass rate on Turing test within 50 years (Turing, 1950), computer scientists, philosophers and journalists have never been shy to offer their own definite prognostics, claiming AI to be impossible (Jacquette, 1987) or just around the corner (Darrach, 1975).\nWhat are we to make of these predictions? What are they for, and what can we gain from them? Are they to be treated as light entertainment, the equivalent of fact-free editorials about the moral decline of modern living? Or are there some useful truths to be extracted? Can we feel confident that certain categories of experts can be identified, and that their predictions stand out from the rest in terms of reliability?\n\nIn this paper, we'll start off by proposing classification schemes for AI predictions: what types of predictions are being made, and what kind of arguments or models are being used to justify them. Armed with this scheme, we'll then analyse some of these approaches from the theoretical perspective, seeing whether there are good reasons to believe or disbelieve their results. The aim is not simply to critique individual methods or individuals, but to construct a toolbox of assessment tools that will both enable us to estimate the reliability of a prediction, and allow predictors to come up with better results themselves.\n\nThose theoretical results will be supplemented with the real meat of the paper: a database of 257 AI predictions (Partially available online at www.neweuropeancentury.org/SIAI-FHI_AI_predictions.xls), made in a period span-ning from the 1950s to the present day. This database was assembled by researchers systematically searching though the available online literature, and is a treasure-trove of interesting predictions. Delving into this will enable us to show that there seems to be no such thing as an \"AI expert\" for timeline predictions: no category of predictors stands out from the crowd.\n\nThe final point of interest is the unexpected robustness of some philosophical ar-guments. Philosophers making very general meta-arguments seem to have higher added value to the reader than computer scientists giving an expected date for the arrival of AI.\n\nBibliography\n\nDarrach, B.

    "title": "Miles Brundage - Limitations and Risks of Machine Ethics - Oxford Winter Intelligence",
    "description": "Extended Abstract: The gradually increasing sophistication of semi-autonomous and autonomous robots and virtual agents has led some scholars to propose constraining these systems' behaviors with programmed ethical principles (\"machine ethics\"). While impressive machine ethics theories and prototypes have been developed for narrow domains, several factors will likely prevent machine ethics from ensuring positive outcomes from advanced, cross-domain autonomous systems. This paper critically reviews existing approaches to machine ethics in general and Friendly AI in particular (an approach to constraining the actions of future self-improving AI systems favored by the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence), finding that while such approaches may be useful for guiding the behavior of some semi-autonomous and autonomous systems in some contexts, these projects cannot succeed in guaranteeing ethical behavior and may introduce new risks inadvertently. Moreover, while some incarnation of machine ethics may be necessary for ensuring positive social outcomes from artificial intelligence and robotics, it will not be sufficient, since other social and technical measures will also be critically important for realizing positive outcomes from these emerging technologies.\nBuilding an ethical autonomous machine requires a decision on the part of the system designer as to which ethical framework to implement. Unfortunately, there are currently no fully-articulated moral theories that can plausibly be realized in an autonomous system, in part because the moral intuitions that ethicists attempt to systematize are not, in fact, consistent across all domains. Unified ethical theories are all either too vague to be computationally tractable or vulnerable to compelling counter-examples, or both. [1,2] Recent neuroscience research suggests that, depending on the context of a given decision, we rely to varying extents on an intuitive, roughly deontological (means-based) moral system and on a more reflective, roughly consequentialist (ends-based) moral system, which in part explains the aforementioned tensions in moral philosophy. [3] While the normative significance of conflicting moral intuitions can be disputed, these findings at least have implications for the viability of building a machine whose moral system would be acceptable to most humans across all domains, particularly given the need for ensuring the internal consistency of a system's programming. Should an unanticipated situation arise, or if the system were used outside its prescribed domain, negative consequences will likely result due to the inherent fragility of rule-based systems.\nMoreover, the complex and uncertain relationship between actions and consequences in the world means that an autonomous system (or, indeed, a human) with an ethical framework that is (at least partially) consequentialist cannot be relied upon with full confidence in any non-trivial task domain, suggesting the practical need for context-appropriate heuristics and great caution in ensuring that moral decision-making in society does not become overly centralized.[4] The intrinsic complexity and uncertainty of the world, along with other constraints such as the inability to gather the necessary data, also doom approaches (such as Friendly AI) to derive a system's utility function from extrapolation of humans' preferences. There is also a risk that the logical implications derived from premises in a given ethical system may not be what humans working on machine ethics principles believe them to be (this is one of the categories of machine ethics risks highlighted in Isaac Asimov's work[5]). In other words, machine ethicists are caught in a double-bind: they must either depend on rigid principles for addressing particular ethical issues, and thus risk catastrophic outcomes when those rules should in fact be broken[6], or they allow an autonomous system to reason from first principles or derive its utility function in an evolutionary fashion, and thereby risk the possibility that it will arrive at conclusions that the designer would not have initially consented to. Lastly, even breakthroughs in normative ethics would not ensure positive outcomes from the deployment of explicitly ethical autonomous systems. Several factors besides machine ethics proper -- such as ensuring that autonomous systems are robust against hacking, developing appropriate social norms and policies for ensuring ethical behavior by those involved in developing and using autonomous systems, and the systemic risks that could be arise from dependence on ubiquitous intelligent machines -- are briefly described and suggested as areas for further research in light of the intrinsic limitations of machine ethics.\n\nWinter Intelligence : https://web.archive.org/web/20120815232147/http://www.winterintelligence.org/\n\nAudio Here: https://archive.org/details/MilesBrundageLimitationsAndRisksOfMachineEthicsOxfordWinterIntelligence",

    "description": "The three biggest changes in history, so far, were at the arrival of humans, farming, and industry. If a similar big change lies ahead, a good guess for its source is artificial intelligence in the form of whole brain emulations, or \"ems.\" Most who consider ems use them to set dramatic stories, or to debate em feasibility and timing, or to ponder their implications for the philosophy of identity. I instead seek social implications -- what sort of world would they make?\n\nMost who consider em social implications paint heavens or hells, or seek a new social science for this new social era. In contrast, I seek to straight-forwardly apply standard social science to these novel technical assumptions. I focus on a low regulation scenario, as this is the standard policy reference scenario.\n\nTo further ease analysis, I focus on an early em era when brains can be easily copied, but are mostly opaque. This ensures ems have recognizably human mental styles, and precludes partial minds, mixing and matching mind parts, or merging diverged copies. I also assume that the physical cost of running em minds is roughly linear in speed, up to a million times human speed, and that ems can change speed by changing hardware.",

Recent scientific understanding of cognitive biases, or systematic thinking errors, provides an exciting opportunity for humanity to become smarter and more effective. We're taking the results of cognitive science research, and turning them into techniques that people can practice and use in their own lives. That means going beyond understanding these errors, and actually training ourselves to overcome them. It also means knowing when to trust our instincts, and learning new thinking habits for situations where they're less reliable.\nCFAR is devoted to teaching those techniques, and the math and science behind them, to adults and exceptional youth. In the process, we're breaking new ground in studying the long-term effects of rationality training on life outcomes using randomized controlled trials. We're contributing to pedagogical knowledge about how to teach this emerging discipline at universities and elsewhere. And we're building a real-life community of tens of thousands of students, entrepreneurs, researchers, programmers, philanthropists, and others who are passionate about using rationality to improve the decisions they make for themselves and for the world. \n\n==The science behind CFAR==\nWhen cognitive scientists talk about rationality, they're talking about two things: Epistemic rationality means forming beliefs about the world as accurately as possible, given the available evidence. Instrumental rationality means figuring out the best way to reach your goals, given your own beliefs and desires, and then getting yourself to act on those plans. Math, logic, and statistics have accumulated a lot of insight over the centuries about how optimal reasoning and strategy work, while cognitive science shows us how humans diverge from those ideal models, and what we can do to improve.",

It is a collection of responsive clothes that explores the expanding frontier of smell and its correlation with colour and emotion. Inspired by a quote from J.G.Ballard: 'Fashion is the recognition that nature has endowed us with one skin too few, that a fully Sentient Being should wear its nervous system externally', the collection builds on the latest developments in 'aromachology' (the science of fragrance), electronic nose sensors and emerging technologies to enhance cognition performance.  This talk describes the development of a wearable 'electronic nervous system' as a new 'Scentsory' platform to improve memory. It investigates computerised scent-output systems worn on the body for fashion and health applications, offering a personalised scent symphony experience which is intimate in nature. It merges fashion, technology, fragrance and colour therapy to 'enhance mood', improve lifestyle, and will be placed alongside those in vogue such as alternative healing practices. As a luxury fashion item, it can be programmed to deliver a colourful 'wardrobe of fragrance', depending on emotion, mood, occasion and time of day (most women change fragrances because of a shift in mood). The purpose is to appeal to the user's ancient and primitive olfactory sense whilst complementing the audio/visual senses.

We are faced with a need to continuously become more innovative in harnessing and controlling technology's acceleration. Nevertheless, innovation develops in stages. When it speeds up, we are faced with an urge to become ever more resourceful. When it slows down there is an impending impatience to compete with the exuberance of China. There is no doubt that even the most conservative thinkers agree that we have stepped into an era of a massive change.

    "description": "http://www.winterintelligence.org/ Winter Intelligence 2012 2012 Oxford University\nSteve Omohundro: Autonomous Technology and the Greater Human Good\n\nExtended Abstract: Next generation technologies will make at least some of their decisions autonomously. Self-driving vehicles, rapid financial transactions, military drones, and many other applications will drive the creation of autonomous systems. If implemented well, they have the potential to create enormous wealth and productivity. But if given goals that are too simplistic, autonomous systems can be dangerous. We use the seemingly harmless example of a chess robot to show that autonomous systems with simplistic goals will exhibit drives toward self-protection, resource acquisition, and self-improvement even if they are not explicitly built into them. We examine the rational economic underpinnings of these drives and describe the effects of bounded computational power. Given that semi-autonomous systems are likely to be deployed soon and that they can be dangerous when given poor goals, it is urgent to consider three questions: 1) How can we build useful semi-autonomous systems with high confidence that they will not cause harm? 2) How can we detect and protect against poorly designed or malicious autonomous systems? 3) How can we ensure that human values and the greater human good are served by more advanced autonomous systems over the longer term?\n\n1) The unintended consequences of goals can be subtle. The best way to achieve high confidence in a system is to create mathematical proofs of safety and security properties. This entails creating formal models of the hardware and software but such proofs are only as good as the models. To increase confidence, we need to keep early systems in very restricted and controlled environments. These restricted systems can be used to design freer successors using a kind of \"Safe-AI Scaffolding\" strategy.\n\n2) Poorly designed and malicious agents are challenging because there are a wide variety of bad goals. We identify six classes: poorly designed, simplistic, greedy, destructive, murderous, and sadistic. The more destructive classes are particularly challenging to negotiate with because they don't have positive desires other than their own survival to cause destruction. We can try to prevent the creation of these agents, to detect and stop them early, or to stop them after they have gained some power. To understand an agent's decisions in today's environment, we need to look at the game theory of conflict in ultimate physical systems. The asymmetry between the cost of solving and checking computational problems allows systems of different power to coexist and physical analogs of cryptographic techniques are important to maintaining the balance of power. We show how Neyman's theory of cooperating finite automata and a kind of \"Mutually Assured Distraction\" can be used to create cooperative social structures.\n\n3) We must also ensure that the social consequences of these systems support the values that are most precious to humanity beyond simple survival. New results in positive psychology are helping to clarify our higher values. Technology based on economic ideas like Coase's theorem can be used to create a social infrastructure that maximally supports the values we most care about. While there are great challenges, with proper design, the positive potential is immense.\n\n--\n\nThe Winter Intelligence Conference, set in Oxford during Alan Turing's centenary year, combines two subconferences:\nAGI-12, the 5th conference on Artificial General Intelligence on the 8th and 9th of December 2012 (with workshops to follow on the 10th and 11th).\nAGI Impacts conference which analyses the issues and risks surrounding the creation of such machines (run by the Future of Humanity Institute and the Oxford Martin Programme on the Impact of Future Technology) on the 10th and 11th of December 2012.",

    "description": "Do you find it hard to summarize yourself in a few words? Me too.\n\nBut I love the above quote. I have a passion, a sacred quest, to understand everything, and to save the world. I am addicted to \"viewquakes\", insights which dramatically change my world view. I loved science fiction as a child, and have studied physics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, economics, and political science — all fields full of such insights. Unfortunately, this also tempted me to leave subjects after mastering their major insights.\n\nI also have a rather critical style. I beat hard on new ideas, seek out critics, and then pledge my allegiance only to those still left standing. In conversation, I prefer to identify a claim at issue, and then focus on analyzing it, rather than the usual quick tours past hundreds of issues. I have always asked questions, even when I was very young.\n\nI have little patience with those whose thinking is sloppy, small, or devoid of abstraction. And I'm not a joiner; I rebel against groups with \"our beliefs\", especially when members must keep criticisms private, so as not to give ammunition to \"them.\"  I love to argue one on one, and common beliefs are not important for friendship — instead I value honesty and passion.\n\nIn '77 I began college (UCI) in engineering, but switched to physics to really understand the equations.  Two years in, when physics repeated the same concepts with more math,  I studied physics on my own, skipping the homework but acing the exams.  To dig deeper, I did philosophy of science grad school (U Chicago), switched back to physics, and was then seduced to Silicon Valley.\n\nBy day I did artificial intelligence (Lockheed, NASA), and by night I studied on my own (Stanford) and hung with Xanadu's libertarian web pioneers and futurists.  I had a hobby of institution design; my best idea was idea futures, now known as prediction markets.  Feeling stuck without contacts and credentials, I went for a Ph.D. in social science (Caltech).\n\nThe physicist in me respected only econ experiments at first, but I was soon persuaded econ theory was full of insight, and did a theory thesis, and a bit of futurism on the side.  I landed a health policy postdoc, where I was shocked to learn of medicine's impotency.  I finally landed a tenure-track job (GMU), and also found the wide-ranging intellectual conversations I'd lacked since Xanadu.\n\nMy Policy Analysis Market project hit the press shit fan in '03, burying me in media attention for a while, and helping to kickstart the prediction market industry, which continues to grow and for which I continue to consult.  The press flap also tipped me over the tenure edge in '05; my colleagues liked my being denounced by Senators. :)   Tenure allowed me to maintain my diverse research agenda, and to start blogging at Overcoming Bias in November '06, about the same time I became a research associate at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute.  Recently I've become chief scientist at Consensus Point.",

How the Religious Right Harms Us All -- and What We Can Do About It (Pitchstone Press, released February 2012). Faircloth, an attorney, served five terms in the Maine Legislature including appointments on the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees. In his final term, Faircloth was elected Majority Whip. In 2009 Faircloth became executive director of the Secular Coalition for America, advocating for separation of church and state, and for greater acceptance of nontheistic viewpoints in American life. In September 2011 he became the Director of Strategy and Policy for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and was the opening speaker for Dawkins' book tour. Faircloth's first book published by Pitchstone Press, Attack of the Theocrats! How the Religious Right Harms Us All - and What We Can Do About It was released in February 2012.\nJuly 13, 2011 at The Amazing Meeting\n\nFaircloth had the idea for the Maine Discovery Museum in 1996 and led the project from concept to completion in 2001. Maine Discovery Museum was then the second largest children's museum outside Boston in New England.\n\nFaircloth successfully spearheaded over thirty laws, including the so-called Deadbeat Dad child support law which was later incorporated into federal law. Faircloth had numerous legislative successes in children's issues and justice system reform.\n\nFaircloth has spoken around the United States regarding the U.S. Constitution, children's policy, obesity policy, and sex crime law.     \n\n-- Secular Coalition for America\n\nFaircloth, while a sitting legislator, gave an opening \"prayer\" for the session that quoted, not scripture, but the book Freethinkers by Susan Jacoby, as well as Walt Whitman.[23] Faircloth began as Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America in 2009. Faircloth's duties include advocating on Capitol Hill and to the administration for a strong separation of church and state. Faircloth also advocates and speaks around the United States regarding secular public policy and the harm that he believes can come to average citizens if the secular nature of the American Constitution is not followed. Members of The Advisory Board of Secular Coalition for America have included Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Wendy Kaminer, Michael Newdow, Salman Rushdie, Julia Sweeney, Massimo Pigliucci, Steven Pinker, Ellery Schempp, Rob Boston, and Chair, Woody Kaplan.\n\nAs Executive Director, Faircloth has worked with the Secular Coalition for America board to create a ten-year plan called Our Secular Decade. Sean Faircloth was appointed as Director of Strategy and Policy at the Richard Dawkins Foundation in September 2011.\n\n\n-- Richard Dawkins foundation for Reason and Science\n\nFaircloth was the opening speaker for Professor Dawkins's 2011 book tour and will continue as the opening speaker during 2012. Dawkins speaks highly of Faircloth and says he \"has a proven ability to strategize, organize, and energize -- qualities essential to making secularism a successful social movement... I want him out speaking far and wide.\" Faircloth's responsibilities include blogging on the RDF website as well as public speaking for secularism and \"the dangers of theocratic laws, and the value of scientific policy\".\n\nDuring the Christmas season of 2011, Faircloth represented the Richard Dawkins Foundation during one call to Catholic Answers Live, a Catholic apologetics radio show.\n\n- Wikipedia",

    "description": "http://2012.hplusconf.com.au Humanity+ @Melbourne 2012 -\nTalk: The Surprising Rate of Progress in Artificial Intelligence Research\n\nArtificial Intelligence is one of the foundations of Transhumanism, along with nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics. This talk will survey the rapidly accelerating progress in building machine intelligence, particularly over the last 10 years and the prospects for the next one to three decades. We cover advances in hardware such as the single molecule transistor and the first computer with processing power comparable to the human brain as well as the continuation exponential growth in processing power courtesy of Moore's Law. Accessible descriptions of breakthroughs in software and algorithms such as self-learning machines, reinforcement learning, Support Vector machines, and hierarchical learning networks illustrate how the \"software bottleneck\" is being overcome. The talk includes video footage of applications of Artificial Intelligence technology.\n\nTim Josling studied Law, Anthopology, Philosophy and Mathematics before switching to Computer Science at the dawn of the computer era. He worked on implementing some of the first transactional systems in Australia, later worked on the first ATM networks and was the chief architect for one of the first Internet Banking applications in Australia, and designed an early message switching (\"middleware\") application in the USA. During his career he specialised in making large scale applications reliable and fast, saving several major projects from being cancelled due to poor performance and excessive running costs. This led to an interest in the progress of computer hardware and in Moore's Law, which states that the power of computers grows roughly 10-fold every 5 years. In his spare time he contributed to various open source projects such as the GNU Compiler Collection. After attending the first Singularity Summit in Australia, he decided to retire so he could devote himself full-time to researching Artificial Intelligence, the Technological Singularity and Trans-humanism. He is currently working on applying AI techniques to financial and investment applications.\n\nhttp://hplusconf.com.au/#menu-13",

    "description": "'A history of Artificial Intelligence: AI as a degenerating scientific research program' \nThe goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a discipline is to produce an Artificial Intelligence as an artifact. The motivations for producing an AI are many and diverse. One motive that is powerful and pervasive is to better understand ourselves, what we are made of intellectually. And that may explain why the man who invented computer science, Alan Turing in 1936, shortly thereafter also invented the discipline of Artificial Intelligence, putting the problem in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" in 1950. Since that time many thousands have worked on one or another aspect of the AI research program. But has there been progress, or stagnation, or degeneration?  \n\nArtificial Intelligence has come a long way since the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, but its ability to ever simulate human intelligence remains debatable.\n\nDr Kevin Korb from Monash University's Clayton School of Information Technology will be discussing what stage artificial intelligence (AI) has reached in his upcoming lecture 'A history of Artificial Intelligence: AI as a degenerating scientific research program'.\nKevin Korb's research is in artificial intelligence and the philosophy of science and the interrelation between the two, and especially the automation of scientific induction, or causal discovery. (IT, Monash University)\n\n\"The goal of AI as a discipline is to produce AI as an artefact, and the motivations for that are many and diverse,\" Dr Korb said.\n\n\"One motive that is both powerful and pervasive is to better understand ourselves, and what we are made of intellectually.\"\n\nBritish mathematician Alan Turing, widely considered the father of both computer science and artificial intelligence, discussed the question of whether machines could think in his 1950 paper, 'Computer Machinery and Intelligence'.\n\n\"Since that time many thousands have worked on one aspect or another of the AI research program and it has achieved a great many things, but where is the AI?\" Dr Korb said.\n\nThree answers have been prominent in the debates around AI, according to Dr Korb.\n\n\"The first possibility is that AI is, was, and always will be brain dead. American philosopher Hubert Dreyfus argues that traditional AI -- using rules, symbols and data structures -- cannot possibly simulate human intelligence,\" Dr Korb said.\n\n\"The second possibility is AI is coming, and, indeed, it's almost here. It needs only another decade or two to put human brain simulation within our grasp, at which point the evolution of humanity will be overtaken and absorbed by the evolution of our artefacts.\n\n\"The final possibility is if an AI is to ever be achieved, it will require a long-term, collective effort of a lot of scientists over many generations.\"\n\nDr Korb defends one of these answers in his talk, which is part of the 'History of Science, Mathematics, Philosophy and Technology' lecture series, organised by Dr Alan Dorin from the Monash Faculty of Information Technology.\n\n'A history of Artificial Intelligence: AI as a degenerating scientific research program' was  held on Wednesday, 14 November 2012 in Seminar Room 135, Building 26, at Monash University's Clayton campus.\n\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-01/an-artificial-intelligence-not-so-far-away/4496090\n\nKevin's current blog: https://bayesianwatch.wordpress.com/",

    "title": "Vernor Vinge - Foresight and the Singularity - Interview",
    "description": "Interview with renowned author Vernor Vinge - about the Technological Singularity, ways to think about it, strategic forecasting, future studies and risk.  Specific Topics: The Beginnings of the Term: 'Technological Singularity' / The Metaphor Implied by the Singularity / Narratives\nHow Possibility Shapes the Future / Utopias & Dystopias / Thinking about the Future: What Do We Want?\n\nFamous for his groundbreaking 1993 essay on the idea of the \"Singularity,\" called \"The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era.\"\n\nVinge is an emeritus professor of mathematics at San Diego State University and considered one of the worlds greatest science fiction writers: a five-time winner of the Hugo Award, science fiction's most prestigious honor! Vinge's stories explore themes including deep space, the future, and the singularity, a term he famously coined for the future emergence of a greater-than-human intelligence brought about by the advance of technology.\n\n\n\nInterview conducted at Los Con 39 - http://loscon.org/391/  #loscon\nNovember 23 -- 25, 2012  --  LAX Marriott Hotel -- Los Angeles, California\n\n\n\"...the spectacular feature of A.I. was not making something as smart as a human, but creating minds that were more intelligent than humans. That would be a different type of technological advance. That would change the thing that is the top creative element in technological progress, and since it would be beyond human intelligence, there is a certain unknowability about what would happen beyond that point. Therefore, I came up with the metaphor with the singularity as it is used with blackholes in general relativity reflecting this fact that there is not much information you can imagine beyond the point in time when super-human intelligence comes into place.\"\n\n\nGuest of Honor: Vernor Vinge\nArtist Guest of Honor: Alan White\nFan Guests of Honor: Lloyd Penney & Yvonne Penney\nCostume Guest of Art: Mela Hoyt-Heydon\n\nRecently while at Los Con, I was privileged to do an interview with science fiction icon Vernor Vinge, who's ideas has done much to further serious discourse around Machine Intelligence.\nVernor Vinge is well known Hugo Award-winning novels and novellas A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1999), Rainbows End (2006), Fast Times at Fairmont High (2002) and The Cookie Monster (2004), as well as for his 1984 novel The Peace War.\nHis his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\", in which he argues that the creation of superhuman artificial intelligence will mark the point at which \"the human era will be ended,\" such that no current models of reality are sufficient to predict beyond it.\nhttp://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html\n\nWithin thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.\n—\"The Coming Technological Singularity\" by Vernor Vinge, 1993\n\n\nAn article in the January 1983 edition of OMNI Magazine titled 'First Word' by Vernor Vinge introduced the idea that the ever-accelerating evolution of computer intelligence itself might soon produce 'a kind of singularity'.\n\nThis was Vernor's first in-print fling at the Singularity. For context, Vinge's novella 'True Names' (which addresses the concept of a technological singularity) was published in 1981 preceding Gibson's 'Neuromancer'.\n\nVinge suggests that inevitable technological singularities in intelligent civilizations represented the most logical explanation for the \"vast silence\" in space, commonly known as the Fermi's Paradox (Enrico Fermi 1950).\n\n\"We are caterpillars, soon to be butterflies, and when we look to the stars, we take the vast silence of other races transformed.\"\n\n\"We will soon create intelligences greater than our own.\nWhen this happens, human history will have reached a kind of singularity, an intellectual transition as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole, and the world will pass far beyond our understanding.\"",

    "description": "Nick Bostrom says there are not all that many people focusing on Existential Risks related to Machine Intelligence. See article: https://www.scifuture.org/nick-bostrom-why-focus-on-existential-risk-related-to-machine-intelligence/\n\nSee article: Existential risks are those that threaten the entire future of humanity. Many theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood. In this paper, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme. I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability.\n\nhttp://www.existential-risk.org\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ExistentialRisk/\n\nhttp://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk - Future of Humanity Institute\nProfessor Nick Bostrom\nDirector & James Martin Research Fellow\nNick Bostrom is Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy at Oxford University and founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute and of the Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology within the Oxford Martin School.

He previously taught at Yale, and he was a Postdoctoral Fellow of the British Academy.  Bostrom has a background in physics, computational neuroscience, and mathematical logic as well as philosophy.\nHe is best known for his work in five areas: (i) the concept of existential risk; (ii) the simulation argument; (iii) anthropics (developing the first mathematically explicit theory of observation selection effects); (iv) transhumanism, including related issues in bioethics and on consequences of future technologies; and (v) foundations and practical implications of consequentialism.

He believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His book-length internet manifesto The Hedonistic Imperative[3] outlines how technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, pharmacology, and neurosurgery could potentially converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals, replacing suffering with gradients of well-being, a project he refers to as \"paradise engineering\". A transhumanist and a vegan, Pearce believes that we (or our future posthuman descendants) have a responsibility not only to avoid cruelty to animals within human society but also to alleviate the suffering of animals in the wild.\n\n==The Naturalisation of Heaven==\n\n\n==Sabotage at the Mill==",

    "description": "Randal A. Koene is a Dutch neuroscientist and neuroengineer, and co-founder of carboncopies.org, the outreach and roadmapping organization for advancing Substrate-Independent Minds (SIM). Between 2008 and 2010, Koene was Director of the Department of Neuroengineering at Tecnalia, the third largest private research organization in Europe. Koene earned his Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the Department of Psychology at McGill University, and his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Information Theory at Delft University of Technology. He is a former Professor at the Center for Memory and Brain of Boston University, and is co-founder of the Neural Engineering Corporation of Massachusetts. Koene established the MindUploading.org website and first proposed the term and specific approach called whole brain emulation, the purpose of which is the technological accomplishment of mind transfer to a different substrate. His professional research objective is the implementation of whole brain emulation: creating the large-scale high-resolution representations and emulations of activity in neuronal circuitry that are needed in patient-specific neuroprostheses. He is a member of the Oxford working group that convened in 2007 to create a first roadmap toward whole brain emulation.\nKoene has professional expertise in computational neuroscience, psychology, information theory, electrical engineering and physics. He organizes neural engineering efforts to obtain and replicate function and structure information that resides in the neural substrate for use in neuroprostheses and neural interfaces. And based on NETMORPH, Koene's computational framework for the simulated morphological development of neuronal circuitry, his lab is creating a Virtual Brain Laboratory to give neuroscientists, neuroengineers and clinicians large-scale high-resolution quantitative tools analogous to the computational tools that have become essential in fields such as genetics, chemistry or the aero-space industry. This effort bridges scales and will help determine how significant functions are encoded robustly in neural ensembles, and how those functions can nevertheless depend in specific ways on the detailed biophysics of particular component physiology. - Wikipedia",

    "description": "Interview with Nick Bostrom at the Future of Humanity Institute Oxford University - http://www.simulation-argument.com/ - The simulation argument is continuing to attract a great deal of attention. I regret that I cannot usually respond to individual queries about the argument.\n\nhttp://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html\nABSTRACT. This paper argues that at least one of the following propositions is true: (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a \"posthuman\" stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation. A number of other consequences of this result are also discussed.\n\nMany thanks for watching!\n- Support me via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scifuture\n- Please Subscribe to this Channel: http://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=TheRationalFuture\n- Science, Technology & the Future website: http://scifuture.org",

    "description": "Alleviating Suffering: Diminishing the burden of physical pain - SCN8A mutations through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis - choosing benign alleles to alleviate the massive burden of suffering.\nHopefully in the future we will see it is not ethically responsible to play genetic roulette and instead take the decision to have happy, healthy, pro-social offspring - could use pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to increase the odds of children having a high hedonic set-point.\n\nCan Bliss Exist Without Suffering? : If one is to retain critical insight, then it is vital to retain some form of informational sensitivity but one can still have the functional analogs of, say, sadness or disappointment & anxiety without having the nasty raw feels.  In principle for instance even if one has a future life based on gradients of intelligent bliss, you can still have the analogs of disappointment - but none of the nastiness that is experienced today.  Now some people would respond here and say 'Well surely if one has the functional analogs of disappointment or sadness, then happiness is purely relative' - but this doesn't actually seem to be the case, because tragically as one sees today, there are some people who endure chronic suffering / chronic depression, and some of the worst depressives - they are simply never happy - they spend their whole lives below hedonic zero.  And it would be cruel to suggest that in some sense they aren't really unhappy because they haven't got happiness to compare their misery with.\n\n\n\nAbout David Pearce: David Pearce is a British utilitarian philosopher. He believes and promotes the idea that there exists a strong ethical imperative for humans to work towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His book-length internet manifesto The Hedonistic Imperative outlines how technologies such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, pharmacology, and neurosurgery could potentially converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience among human and non-human animals, replacing suffering with gradients of well-being, a project he refers to as \"paradise engineering\". A transhumanist and a vegan, Pearce believes that we (or our future posthuman descendants) have a responsibility not only to avoid cruelty to animals within human society but also to alleviate the suffering of animals in the wild.\n\nPearce is the owner of BLTC Research, a website that was set-up by Pearce in 1995. Based in Kemptown, Brighton, UK, the site publishes online texts in support of the biochemical and biotechnological methods by which its proponents believe sentient suffering could be abolished in future generations.\nIn 1998, Pearce co-founded the World Transhumanist Association (WTA) with Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosopher. The association, which later changed its name to Humanity+, advocates transhumanism — an ideology and movement which has emerged to support the recognition and protection of the right of citizens either to maintain or modify their own minds and bodies so as to guarantee them the freedom of choice and informed consent of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children.\nIn 2002 Pearce co-founded the Abolitionist Society with Pablo Stafforini, Sean Henderson, and Jaime Savage, in order to help promote the idea of abolitionism of suffering and to discuss the implications involved with a wider range of audience.\nPearce sits on the board of Elsevier's journal Medical Hypotheses and holds a position at the advisory board of Lifeboat Foundation.

    "description": "Humanity+ @San Francisco - http://2012.humanityplus.org\nThe Challenge of Positive Storytelling for a Future Network Society: Better learning and transmedia storytelling can support our strained capacity to absorb the implications of rapidly emerging technologies\n\nSince prehistoric times storytelling has been a fundamental means for human society to cope with the world. The interpretation of phenomena, and it's impact on individuals and groups, are transformed by it's representation. If we want to be able to efficiently absorb the implications of technological change, are our current tools for perceiving and learning about the world enough? Or should they be complemented by radical reinterpretations of how stories can be told? Next generation technologies (i.e. energy generation, manufacturing, food production, finance and learning) will rapidly transform society, and set up the foundation for new forms of social organization. If we want to plan for the transformation to be as devoid of conflict as possible, and achieve positive outcomes, then we have to embrace at the widest possible levels of innovative tools such as role-playing, policy-making, forecasting, and, in general, future-oriented storytelling. Our current assumptions of what it means to be a positively contributing member of society, how free we are to act, plan, and dream are going to be quickly upended by the uneven adoption and implementation of the changes around us. An open, transparent, rational dialog about these roles, degrees of freedoms, and opportunities can be achieved and is a fundamental component of what is going to shape our societies, and our lives as individuals.\n\nHumanity+ @San Francisco - http://2012.humanityplus.org\nTechnology is changing the very activity of writing.

    "description": "Humanity+ @San Francisco - http://2012.humanityplus.org\nThe future and its many narratives, both written and spoken, are is created by people of the present. In many cases, notably the biomedical realm, the intrinsic costs of pioneering technological research mean that the rate of progress is strongly influenced by public enthusiasm for its goals. This creates a dilemma, in that the public are often ambivalent (at best) concerning such goals, even when by any rational standards they should not be. Should those involved in such work therefore understate their goals when writing proposals and addressing a general audience, making them less \"scary\" and thereby attracting funds to make initial progress?

    "description": "Humanity+ @San Francisco - http://2012.humanityplus.org\nOne of the problems futurists have conveying their ideas to the public is that they represent the next few decades as a time period when we'll experience a kind of temporal rupture, where global societies break radically from the past. Because this notion sounds so implausible to many people, futurists' predictions come across as unreasonable and unfounded. I want to suggest that we write about the future in the context of history, and even geological deep time. While some changes may seem very rapid, they are also part of a very long, slow process that may not be perceptible within a human lifetime. Acknowledging the slowness of the future offers two rhetorical advantages. One, it allows us to explain to people what's coming next in the context of familiar events that have already happened. And two, the slow future allows us to make claims that are grounded in scientific evidence from the present, rather than creating future scenarios that rely on highly speculative sciences that don't exist yet. Both of these advantages will help make our writing more plausible to a general audience, as well as audiences of scientists and engineers that many of us hope to influence. We'll explore the slow future perspective on three major areas of scientific work: synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and space colonization. What does it mean to suggest that the future of these areas of inquiry may unfold over many generations, rather than just one? The answers, I believe, can help us forge better relationships with the scientific community and encourage the public to invest in building a future world even if only their great-grandchildren will ever see it.\n\n==Writing the Future==\n\nOf special significance is the theme 'Writing the Future'.

This talk will address the challenges of writing for a mass audience and offer advice on how to present the material in an accessible and relevant way.

We need to be self-critical of the sandtraps of the utopian imaginary while building on its energies to motivate ourselves and the public to great works.

But just as the current \"natural human mind\" is not the end-all of intelligence, the current form of \"natural language\" is not the end-all of communication. Communication among advanced AGI systems, or among humans with advanced brain implants, could proceed according to very different principles. Rather than exchanging linear sequences of words drawn from a culturally common vocabulary, minds will be able to exchange networks of ideas/percepts/actions, using AI helper programs to reduce ambiguity and confusion as needed. A specific design for this sort of communication mechanism, called Psynese, has been worked out in the context of the OpenCog AGI software framework, for the purpose of communication between advanced OpenCog systems. The constructed human language Lojban also has potential to be grown into a communication system of this nature. To minds capable of communicating by exchanging mind-stuff more directly, communication using 21st century style \"natural language\" will seem terribly primitive — much the way we now view communication using gestures, grunts and groans. A final question is: How could we plain old legacy humans communicate more creatively and effectively NOW, using ideas inspired by this likely future mode of communication?\n\n==Writing the Future==\n\nOf special significance is the theme 'Writing the Future'.

One of the biggest challenges in selling ideas about radical science and technology is engaging and exciting an audience in a way that is non-threatening, believable, and structured in a way that they can relate to personally. You want to get people on-board and excited about your ideas, but if you take it too far on the awe-spectrum without getting that personal connection, it may seem too much like science fiction, and not like something that is easily adoptable for them, in their lifetime. Good science communication is more than just making science accessible — more than just losing the jargon, and more than just reaching out to new audiences. The best science communication uses facts intertwined with a compelling narrative — a delicate balance of awe and reality — that people can relate to on a personal level. If the story feels personally relevant, and they can see themselves as part of the story, then people will be more willing to not only entertain those ideas, but to take action as well.\n\n\n==Writing the Future==\n\nOf special significance is the theme 'Writing the Future'.

But what is superintelligence? How does intelligence relate to sentience? What is the Explanatory Gap, Moravec's Paradox, and the Binding Problem? Will nonbiological machines ever be more than zombies? This talk explores three different narratives for the major evolutionary transition in prospect. In the first narrative, biological humans will rewrite their genetic source code, recursively self-edit their own minds, and bootstrap their way to full-spectrum superintelligence. Mastery of our reward circuitry will deliver life based on information-sensitive gradients of bliss. In the second 'Kurzweilian' narrative, cybernetic brain implants will enable humans to fuse our minds with artificial intelligence; and also allow humans to scan, digitize and \"upload\" ourselves onto less perishable substrates. In digital nirvana, the distinction between biological and non-biological machines will effectively disappear. In the third scenario, most closely associated with mathematician I.J. Good, is a combination of Moore's law and the advent of recursively self-improving software-based minds will culminate in an ultra-rapid \"Intelligence Explosion\" and an era of non-biological superintelligence.

    "description": "Humanity+ @San Francisco 2012 - http://2012.humanityplus.org\nBringing the unusual concepts of substrate-independent minds to the world\nIdeas and proposals are rarely weighed by rational metrics; especially in the media and the public eye. When a concept is brand new, largely unheard of, and not part of every day life then it is only natural that it is viewed with great skepticism.\nThis can lead to some strange and often contradictory common sense assumptions. For example: Every child should have their teeth straightened -- because sometimes nature needs a helping hand. It is not good for someone to die at age 20 -- but they should not live to be 500, because that would be \"unnatural\". A machine cannot be conscious or have feelings -- but there may be angels or ghosts.\nIntroducing something that seems unusual (even if scientifically rational and eliciting support) demands a lot of communication. Domain experts (such as scientists) want to know that an idea makes physical and technical sense; they want to hear about feasibility, possible problems and applications. The public wants to know about motivations, why this matters to them and what they can expect from you.\nI methodically build the case for substrate-independent minds and whole brain emulation. Every occasion to communicate deserves a specific message tailored to a particular audience. Ultimately, communication is personal and involves our rational mind, our feelings and all of our senses. The message can only travel and become familiar if the messenger manages to connect.\n\n\n==Writing the Future==\n\nOf special significance is the theme 'Writing the Future'.

What is it about certain futurist writers who transcend our community and reach the mainstream, inspiring others to take their concerns and dreams as their own? What is the empathy engine they use? It's all about you. Your inner life. Your passions. We need more of the H+ community sharing stories about why we want the future we want. What is the future YOU want? How do you see yourself as a character bringing it about? This is a participatory, community-building talk. Because together, through telling our stories, we can make the future happen.\n\n\n==Writing the Future==\n\nOf special significance is the theme 'Writing the Future'. The aim is to encourage refined communication about the future in creative ways, and thereby promote serious attention to the opportunities and risks we are facing.",

    "description": "http://kajsotala.fi/about/ - About\nAfter a dry and scorching summer, the first autumn rain. As I extend my arms and let the rain drench me, a part of me wonders. The storms will be fierce this year, and it will not be long before the land is covered in frost and ice. We have survived winters before, but this one will be the harshest of them all. I should prepare, but it is not clear what I should do.\nBut before that, let the rain come. Let the storms come. If they are the last ones that I will see, that much more of a reason to enjoy them.\n(You can read that as a metaphor on the risks of technological development, if you like. Or as something else entirely.)\nMy name is Kaj Sotala, and on many places online I go by the nick \"Xuenay\". Which doesn't really mean anything, and lately I've been wondering whether that nick really feels like \"me\" anymore.\nOn my old page, I used to have an extensive page detailing my various opinions and other trivia about myself. Over time, my opinions changed, but I didn't remember or bother to keep updating the page. Eventually it began to reflect me less and less. Even if most of my opinions didn't change that much, the ones that did made me feel embarrassed about the page.\nI'm trying to avoid that mistake this time around, so I'll say less about myself. In general, please don't presume that I believe in anything just because I've said that I believe in it.\nSome basic information probably won't hurt, though. I was born in 1986, I'm male, and currently living in Finland. I have a BA in Cognitive Science from the University of Helsinki, and at the time of writing, I'm working for the Singularity Institute.\nThe blog section of this site contains random somewhat-unfiltered thoughts on a variety of topics. You can view all posts, only English posts, or only Finnish posts. The essay (English, Finnish) and fiction sections contain writings of mine that I've for some reason deemed interesting enough to showcase. The about page is the one you're reading right now, and anything of mine that has managed to pass peer review can be found under academic papers. If you want to get (almost) everything on the site on (almost) one page, just start browsing the main page.\nI have accounts on various services, including Academia.edu, BoardGameGeek, Google Citations, Google Plus, Facebook, Last.fm, LinkedIn, OKCupid, and YouTube. My old blog, to which I still cross-post all of my blog entries, is at LiveJournal. I also occasionally comment and post at the group blog Less Wrong; see my collected LW writings. If you want to reach me, you can send me a message on one of those services, or just e-mail me at xuenay@gmail.com.\nThere was a bunch of content on my old website, xuenay.net, that I wasn't happy with and thus didn't move over, or just didn't feel was valuable enough to bother with. If you want to see something that I had on the old site, please use the Wayback Machine archive. But do note that I don't necessarily endorse any of the stuff over there anymore.",

    "description": "Careful not to conflate the simulation hypothesis (we are living in a computer simulation) with the simulation argument (containing 3 possibilities).\n\nHowever, the topic is often too complex for popular media.\n\nhttp://www.simulation-argument.com/\n\nMany works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original biological ones. Therefore, if we don't think that we are currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears. That is the basic idea. The rest of this paper will spell it out more carefully.\n\n            Apart form the interest this thesis may hold for those who are engaged in futuristic speculation, there are also more purely theoretical rewards. The argument provides a stimulus for formulating some methodological and metaphysical questions, and it suggests naturalistic analogies to certain traditional religious conceptions, which some may find amusing or thought-provoking.\n\n--\nRead More: http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html\n\n            The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we formulate an assumption that we need to import from the philosophy of mind in order to get the argument started. Second, we consider some empirical reasons for thinking that running vastly many simulations of human minds would be within the capability of a future civilization that has developed many of those technologies that can already be shown to be compatible with known physical laws and engineering constraints. This part is not philosophically necessary but it provides an incentive for paying attention to the rest. Then follows the core of the argument, which makes use of some simple probability theory, and a section providing support for a weak indifference principle that the argument employs. Lastly, we discuss some interpretations of the disjunction, mentioned in the abstract, that forms the conclusion of the simulation argument.",

The aim is to encourage refined communication about the future in creative ways, and thereby promote serious attention to the opportunities and risks we are facing.  Speakers and attendees discussed topics such as: What are we working on?  How are we going about doing it?  What have we learned?\n\nThese topics include scholarship in writing, yellow journalism, research rigor, game storylines, documentary narratives, science fiction and science fact, H+ Magazine, and some of the concerns authors have about writing: whether or not to self-publish, how to get paid, and how to submit articles and ideas for publication. Related disciplines like graphic design, quantified self, social media apps are also part of the agenda.\n\n\nWhether writing for entertainment or writing for scholarship, similar questions arise: How do we write the narratives for the timeframe in which we live? How do we balance between drama and a reasonable portrayal of facts? How do we flavor our ideas with enough enticement without going overboard with hyperbole? Alternatively, how do we carefully detect when an author or an essay hits the market on quality and efficacy while others borrow ideas without adequate referencing or acknowledging where their ideas stem from?  When is a work of art original, or are all ideas open for interpretation?\n\nHistorically, transhumanists have a solid set of knowledge and skills for discerning fact from sloppy thinking.

    "description": "Why the Fight Against Austerity Today Lays the Foundation for a Sexy, High-Tech Future:\nPolitics and economics have yet to face the fact that an increasingly automated economy will mean the decline of human employment, and the establishment of a basic income guarantee. Instead we have hand-wringing about reining in \"entitlements\" and calls for austerity to facilitate private sector job growth. Expansions of longevity are greeted with calls for pushing up the retirement age, ignoring the shrinking availability of jobs. In order to avoid a neo-feudal future with a mass of unemployed poor dominated by a super-wealthy elite we partisans are a radically better future need to join the fight against austerity economics, and put forward a path to a world in which all share in the growth of wealth from technological innovation.\n\nTalk at Borderlands Bookstore pre-H+ Conf event in San Francisco : http://2012.humanityplus.org/program/bookstore-event/\n\n---\n\nJames J. Hughes Ph.D. is a sociologist and bioethicist teaching health policy at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in the United States.\nhttp://internet2.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1004332\nhttp://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/bio/hughes\n\nHughes holds a doctorate in sociology from the University of Chicago, where he served as the assistant director of research for the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. Before graduate school he was temporarily ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1984 while working as a volunteer in Sri Lanka for the development organization Sarvodaya from 1983 to 1985.\nHughes served as the executive director of the World Transhumanist Association (which has since changed its name to Humanity+) from 2004 to 2006, and currently serves as the executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, which he founded with Nick Bostrom. He also produces the syndicated weekly public affairs radio talk show program Changesurfer Radio and contributed to the Cyborg Democracy blog. Hughes' book Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future was published by Westview Press in November 2004.\n\nRejecting the two extremes of bioconservatism and libertarian transhumanism, Hughes argues for a third way, \"democratic transhumanism,\" a radical form of techno-progressivism which asserts that the best possible \"posthuman future\" is achievable only by ensuring that human enhancement technologies are safe, made available to everyone, and respect the right of individuals to control their own bodies.\nAppearing several times in Hughes' work, the term \"radical\" (from Latin rādīx, rādīc-, root) is used as an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the root or going to the root. His central thesis is that emerging technologies and radical democracy can help citizens overcome some of the root causes of inequalities of power.\n\n\n\"The emergence of biotechnological controversies, however, is giving rise to a new axis, not entirely orthogonal to the previous dimensions but certainly distinct and independent of them. I call this new axis biopolitics, and the ends of its spectrum are transhumanists (the progressives) and, at the other end, the bio-Luddites or bio-fundamentalists. Transhumanists welcome the new biotechnologies, and the choices and challenges they offer, believing the benefits can outweigh the costs. In particular, they believe that human beings can and should take control of their own biological destiny, individually and collectively enhancing our abilities and expanding the diversity of intelligent life. Bio-fundamentalists, however, reject genetic choice technologies and \"designer babies,\" \"unnatural\" extensions of the life span, genetically modified animals and food, and other forms of hubristic violations of the natural order. While transhumanists assert that all intelligent \"persons\" are deserving of rights, whether they are human or not, the biofundamentalists insist that only \"humanness,\" the possession of human DNA and a beating heart, is a marker of citizenship and rights.\" — James Hughes, Democratic Transhumanism 2.0, 2002",

    "description": "Who are you talking to, and what are you trying to tell them? Main points will be the differences between the mass audience vs. the scientist/policy maker audience; and the intended effects of writing realistic futurism, aspirational futurism or dystopian futurism.\n\nAnnalee Newitz is an American journalist who covers the cultural impact of science and technology. She received a PhD in English and American Studies from UC Berkeley, and in 1997 published the widely cited book, White Trash: Race and Class in America. From 2004--2005 she was a policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She writes for many periodicals from Popular Science to Wired, and from 1999 to 2008 wrote a syndicated weekly column called Techsploitation. She co-founded other magazine in 2002, which was published triannually until 2007. Since 2008, she is editor-in-chief of io9, a Gawker-owned science fiction blog, which was named in 2010 by The Times as one of the top science blogs on the internet.\n\nNewitz was born in 1969, the daughter of two English teachers -- her mother, Cynthia, teaching high school, and her father, Marty, at community college — and grew up in Irvine, California. She once called herself \"biethnic\", as her father was born Jewish and her mother is a white Southerner and former Methodist who converted to Reform Judaism.\nShe graduated from Irvine High School, and in 1987 moved to Berkeley, California. In 1996, Newitz started doing some of her own freelance writing, and in 1998, she received a PhD in English and American Studies from UC Berkeley, with a dissertation on images of monsters, psychopaths, and capitalism in twentieth century American popular culture (later published as a book). She worked briefly as an adjunct professor, and in 1999 became a fulltime writer and journalist.\nIn 2002, she was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship, and was a research fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 2004--2005 she was a policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and from 2007--2009 she was on the board of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.\nShe is partners with author Charlie Anders. The couple co-founded other magazine, a tri-annual periodical which ran from 2002 to 2007, and was described as \"pop culture and politics for the new outcast\". In 2008, Gawker media asked Newitz to start a blog about science and science fiction, which was dubbed io9. Newitz has remained editor-in-chief since its founding, and in 2010, io9 was named one of the top 30 science blogs by The Times.\n\nNewitz's work has been published in Popular Science, Wired, Salon.com, New Scientist, Metro Silicon Valley, the San Francisco Bay Guardian (as the culture editor), and AlterNet. She is the editor-in-chief at io9, a science-fiction themed blog launched in 2008 by Gawker Media. She has discussed her work on CNN, The New York Times, NPR, G4, the BBC, and the CBC,a written for the San Francisco Chronicle and Washington Post, and she is a regular lecturer at various colleges and conferences.\n\nhttp://techsploitation.com/\nhttp://io9.com\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalee_Newitz",

    "description": "I'm Steve Haworth, I'm a body modification artist, flesh is my medium... Steve Haworth is a body modification artist based in Phoenix, Arizona. He is responsible for the invention and popularization of subdermal and transdermal implants, such as the \"Metal Mohawk\". \n\nHe designed specialized medical instruments called dermal elevators for this process. He has also done pioneering work with surface bars, ear shaping, tongue splitting, magnetic implants, and artistic branding (using electrosurgical units). He has worked on individuals noted for their extensive modifications such as The Enigma, Katzen, Stalking Cat and The Lizardman. He is listed in the Guinness World Records as \"Most Advanced Body Modification Artist\", 1999 to present.\nMany other respected artists in the body modification community cite Haworth as an inspiration. Fellow body modification artist Samppa von Cyborg says that \"He's the most important, most respected body modder out there.\"  Shawn Porter of Scar Wars explains, \"I directly credit Steve's [electrosurgery] branding as a main influence on the newer generation of scarification artists; his high detail branding (which caused a stir when it was featured in In the Flesh, Body Art, and Bizarre) showed people that you could do more than just dots, chevrons and geometric shapes.\" According to Ron Garza, a respected scarification artist, \"Steve has always been a pioneer and innovator. He has made a huge contribution to the modification community as a whole...\"\nHaworth's father was a manufacturer of surgical equipment, and he continued in the family business, eventually branching into piercing jewelry and body modification instruments. He formed a company called Haworth Med Tech in the late 1980s to produce medical equipment, later called HTC (Haworth Tech Company), which had subsidiaries of HTC Body Jewelry and the HTC piercing studios. He sold the HTC piercing studios in May 2005 and retired from regular piercing, preferring to concentrate on 3D implants and other types of body modification. He continues to manufacture body jewelry and tools for body modification. He and his business partner Jesse Jarrell create unique silicone jewelry for large-gauge piercing with their company Kaos Softwear. Haworth travels around the country and the world frequently, and conducts seminars on his body modification techniques. He founded the body suspension group Life Suspended and performs suspensions with them on regular basis. He is also the co-founder of the production company Horns & Halos, which puts on several fetish-themed events every year.\nHaworth is the subject of the 2007 documentary Flesh & Blood by director Larry Silverman and also appears in the 2005 documentary Modify. He has appeared on the TV shows Extreme Dr. 90210, Ripley's Believe it or Not, and Secret Lives of Women, among others. His work has had cultural impact such that Lady Gaga appeared in her video for \"Born This Way\" and in concerts and interviews wearing fake versions of subdermal implants.",

    "description": "James J. Hughes Ph.D. is a sociologist and bioethicist teaching health policy at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in the United States.\nhttp://internet2.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1004332\nhttp://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/bio/hughes\n\nHughes holds a doctorate in sociology from the University of Chicago, where he served as the assistant director of research for the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. Before graduate school he was temporarily ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1984 while working as a volunteer in Sri Lanka for the development organization Sarvodaya from 1983 to 1985.\nHughes served as the executive director of the World Transhumanist Association (which has since changed its name to Humanity+) from 2004 to 2006, and currently serves as the executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, which he founded with Nick Bostrom. He also produces the syndicated weekly public affairs radio talk show program Changesurfer Radio and contributed to the Cyborg Democracy blog. Hughes' book Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future was published by Westview Press in November 2004.\n\nRejecting the two extremes of bioconservatism and libertarian transhumanism, Hughes argues for a third way, \"democratic transhumanism,\" a radical form of techno-progressivism which asserts that the best possible \"posthuman future\" is achievable only by ensuring that human enhancement technologies are safe, made available to everyone, and respect the right of individuals to control their own bodies.\nAppearing several times in Hughes' work, the term \"radical\" (from Latin rādīx, rādīc-, root) is used as an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the root or going to the root. His central thesis is that emerging technologies and radical democracy can help citizens overcome some of the root causes of inequalities of power.\n\n\n\"The emergence of biotechnological controversies, however, is giving rise to a new axis, not entirely orthogonal to the previous dimensions but certainly distinct and independent of them. I call this new axis biopolitics, and the ends of its spectrum are transhumanists (the progressives) and, at the other end, the bio-Luddites or bio-fundamentalists. Transhumanists welcome the new biotechnologies, and the choices and challenges they offer, believing the benefits can outweigh the costs. In particular, they believe that human beings can and should take control of their own biological destiny, individually and collectively enhancing our abilities and expanding the diversity of intelligent life. Bio-fundamentalists, however, reject genetic choice technologies and \"designer babies,\" \"unnatural\" extensions of the life span, genetically modified animals and food, and other forms of hubristic violations of the natural order. While transhumanists assert that all intelligent \"persons\" are deserving of rights, whether they are human or not, the biofundamentalists insist that only \"humanness,\" the possession of human DNA and a beating heart, is a marker of citizenship and rights.\" — James Hughes, Democratic Transhumanism 2.0, 2002",

    "title": "John Smart - Acceleration Watch, STEM Compression, Digital Twins, and the Singularity",
    "description": "Rehash of an older interview with John Smart.  Instead of it being in 5 parts it is now in one.  Also the visual effects were not on the original (linked to here): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-TQPRwFYu4\n\nDiscussion:\n- Digital Twins - how will be use our mobile devices, and embedded AI in the future?  What role will they play in our decision making?\n- If ~2020 Digital Twins go mainstream how might this pave way for a control shift to the people/community?\n- Stem Compression - Is this an answer to the Fermi Paradox?  Why all the silence in the sky?  Did advanced civilizations go micro?\n\nJohn Smart is a futurist and scholar of accelerating change. He is founder and president of the Acceleration Studies Foundation, an organization that does \"outreach, education, research, and advocacy with respect to issues of accelerating change.\" Smart has an MS in futures studies from the University of Houston, and a BS in business administration from U.C. Berkeley.\n\nSmart is the principal advocate of the concept of \"STEM compression,\" (formerly \"MEST compression\") the idea that the most (ostensibly) complex of the universe's extant systems at any time (galaxies, stars, habitable planets, living systems, and now technological systems) use progressively less space, time, energy and matter (\"STEM\") to create the next level of complexity in their evolutionary development. A similar perspective is found in Buckminster Fuller's writings on ephemeralization.\n\nIn what he calls the \"developmental singularity hypothesis\", Smart proposes that STEM compression, as a driver of accelerating change, must lead cosmic intelligence to a future of highly-miniaturized, accelerated, and local \"transcension\" to extra-universal domains, rather than to space-faring expansion within our existing universe. The transcension scenario (vs. expansion scenario) proposes that once civilizations saturate their local region of space with their intelligence, they need to leave our visible, macroscopic universe in order to continue exponential growth of complexity and intelligence, and thus disappear from this universe, thus explaining the Fermi Paradox. Developments in astrobiology make this a testable hypothesis. A related proposal may be found in the selfish biocosm hypothesis of complexity theorist James N. Gardner.\n\nSmart has been criticized by some in the futures community as overly reductionist and a techno-optimist.His writings do discuss risks, abuses, and social regulation of technology, but usually as a secondary theme, subject to \"inevitable\" acceleration. In his defense, he claims universal and human-historical accelerating change (see Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar) do not appear to be simply a product of evolution but of some universal developmental process, one apparently protected, in a general statistical sense, by poorly understood immune systems in complex systems. In his public presentations he calls for better characterization and use of existing processes of intelligence, immunity, and interdependence development in biological, cultural, and technological systems. He has critiqued systems scholars such as Jonathan Huebner, who claim that the rate of global innovation appears to be slowing down. His counterthesis is that innovation is increasingly conducted by and within technological systems, and is thereby becoming more abstract and difficult to measure by human social standards.\n\nAn advocate of foresight and \"acceleration-awareness\" in education, Smart has proposed a developmental categorization of futurist thinking, maintains a list of global futures studies programs, and has authored an open source required undergraduate course in foresight development, modeled after required foresight courses at Tamkang University in Taiwan. He has argued that just as history (hindsight) and current events (insight) are core general education requirements, the methods and knowledge base of futures studies (foresight), deserve inclusion in the modern undergraduate curriculum.\n\nInterviewed by Adam A.

    "description": "Interview at the Winter Intelligence / AGI 12 conference in Oxford 2012\nBruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist and author. Described by The Economist as a \"security guru,\" he is best known as a refreshingly candid and lucid security critic and commentator. When people want to know how security really works, they turn to Schneier.\nHis first bestseller, Applied Cryptography, explained how the arcane science of secret codes actually works, and was described by Wired as \"the book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published.\" His book on computer and network security, Secrets and Lies, was called by Fortune \"[a] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use.\" Beyond Fear tackles the problems of security from the small to the large: personal safety, crime, corporate security, national security. Schneier on Security, offers insight into everything from the risk of identity theft (vastly overrated) to the long-range security threat of unchecked presidential power. His latest book, Liars and Outliers, explains how societies use security to enable the trust that they need to survive.\nRegularly quoted in the media -- and subject of an Internet meme -- he has testified on security before the United States Congress on several occasions and has written articles and op eds for many major publications, including The New York Times, The Guardian, Forbes, Wired, Nature, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Boston Globe, The San Francisco Chronicle, and The Washington Post.\nSchneier also publishes a free monthly newsletter, Crypto-Gram, and a blog, Schneier on Security, with a combined 250,000 readers. In more than ten years of regular publication, Crypto-Gram has become one of the most widely read forums for free-wheeling discussions, pointed critiques, and serious debate about security. As head curmudgeon at the table, Schneier explains, debunks, and draws lessons from security stories that make the news.\n\nhttp://www.schneier.com/",

    "description": "\"I see the AGI conference as an attempt.. to get back to the original idea of artificial intelligence - to see computational systems as an avenue to developing an understanding of how the mind works. I think this is at its heart a philosophical issue, a philosophical enterprise... but the methods that we need are some that we do not find in contemporary philosophy - so my idea is not to build applications or to develop formalisms that can be used to build applications, but it's about maybe a subset of analytical philosophy; it's in a way 'computational philosophy' where analytical philosophy allows you to express anything that can be, or use anything that can be expressed in a formal language in principle - I want to narrow this even further down. There are things that can be expressed in a computational system that are computable; that can run. This means you do exclude paradoxes which excludes not only those things that you cannot specify, but also excludes things you can specify but are paradoxes which could run - so eventually the proof that you have understood something from the point of view of a computer scientist is that it works. And I do think that you need such an approach as it has pervaded most of physics for instance already - you need such an approach in philosophy of mind too.\"\n\nJoscha Bach, Ph.D. is an AI researcher who worked and published about cognitive architectures, mental representation, emotion, social modeling, and multi-agent systems. He earned his Ph.D. in cognitive science from the University of Osnabrück, Germany, and has built computational models of motivated decision making, perception, categorization, and concept-formation. He is especially interested in the philosophy of AI and in the augmentation of the human mind.\n\nJoscha has taught computer science, AI, and cognitive science at the Humboldt-University of Berlin and the Institute for Cognitive Science at Osnabrück.

    "description": "Peter Voss is the founder and CEO of Adaptive A.I. Inc, an R&D company developing a high-level general intelligence (AGI) engine. He is also founder and CTO of Smart Action Company LLC, which builds and supplies AGI-based virtual contact-center agents -- intelligent, automated phone operators.\n\nPeter started his career as an entrepreneur, inventor, engineer and scientist at age 16. After several years of experience in electronics engineering, at age 25 he started a company to provide advanced custom hardware and software solutions. Seven years later the company employed several hundred people and was successfully listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\n\nAfter selling his interest in the company in 1993, he worked on a broad range of disciplines — cognitive science, philosophy and theory of knowledge, psychology, intelligence and learning theory, and computer science — which served as the foundation for achieving new breakthroughs in artificial general intelligence. In 2001 he started Adaptive AI Inc., and last year founded Smart Action Company as its commercialization division.\n\nPeter considers himself a free-minds-and-markets Extropian, and often writes and presents on philosophical topics including rational ethics, freewill and artificial minds. He is also deeply involved with futurism and life-extension.\n\n---\nhttp://www.optimal.org/peter/peter.htm\n\nMy main occupation is research in high-level, general (domain independent, autonomous) Artificial Intelligence -- \"Adaptive A.I. Inc.\"\n\nI believe that integrating insights from the following areas of cognitive science are crucial for rapid progress in this field:\n\nPhilosophy/ epistemology - understanding the true nature of knowledge\nCognitive psychology (incl. developmental & psychometric) for analysis of cognition - and especially - general conceptual intelligence.\nComputer science - self-modifying systems, combining new connectionist pattern manipulation techniques with 'traditional' AI engineering.\nAnyone who shares my passion - and/ or concerns - for this field is welcome to contact me for brainstorming and possible collaboration.\n\nMy other big passion is for exploring what I call Optimal Living: Maximizing both the quantity & quality of life. I see personal responsibility and optimizing knowledge acquisition as key. Specific interests include:\n\nRationality, as a means for knowledge. I'm largely sympathetic to the philosophy of Objectivism, and have done quite a bit of work on developing a rational approach to (personal & social) ethics.\nHealth (quality): physical, financial, cognitive, and emotional (passions, meaningful relationships, appreciation of art, etc.). Psychology: IQ & EQ.\nLongevity (quantity): general research, CRON (calorie restriction), cryonics\nEnvironment: economic, social, political systems conducive to Optimal Living.\nThese interests logically lead to an interest in Futurism , in technology for improving life - overcoming limits to personal growth & improvement. The transhumanist philosophy of Extropianism best embodies this quest. Specific technologies that seem to hold most promise include AI, Nanotechnology, & various health & longevity approaches mentioned above.\n\nI always enjoy meeting new people to explore ideas, and to have my views critiqued. To this end I am involved in a number of discussion groups and salons (e.g. 'Kifune' futurist dinner/discussion group). Along the way I'm trying to develop and learn the complex art of constructive dialog.\n\nInterview done at SENS party LA 20th Dec 2012.",

    "description": "Abstract: The Turing Test, in its standard interpretation, has been\ndismissed by many as a practical intelligence test. In fact, it is questionable that the imitation game was meant by Turing himself to be used as a test for evaluating machines and measuring the progress of artiﬁcial intelligence. In the past ﬁfteen years or so, an alternative approach to measuring machine intelligence has been consolidating.\nThe key concept for this alternative approach is not the Turing Test, but the Turing machine, and some theories derived upon it, such as Solomonoff’s theory of prediction, the MML principle, Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic information theory. This presents an antagonistic view to the Turing test, where intelligence tests are based on formal principles, are not anthropocentric, are meaningful computationally and the abilities (or factors) which are evaluated can be recognised and quantiﬁed. Recently, however, this computational view has been touching upon issues which are somewhat related to the Turing Test, namely that we may need other intelligent agents in the tests. Motivated by these issues (and others), this paper links these two antagonistic views by bringing some of the ideas around the Turing Test to the realm of Turing machines.\nPaper: Turing Machines and Recursive Turing Tests by Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Javier Insa-Cabrera, David L.

He is also a great networker and has a great talent for bringing great minds together to think about the long term plans. http://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/11/randal-koene-substrate-independent-minds/\n\nAbstract: Every aspect of modern science relies upon creating representations of things. And when we do, we pick the signals that interest us and the behavior that interests us. From that, we determine how to interpret the way input is converted into output in a system. Our description of that process is our understanding of the system. The same is true for mental processes and reverse engineering their implementation in neural circuitry.\nThe feasible approach to this is called (whole) brain emulation and relies on determining precisely which signals we care about and then breaking the problem down into a collection of smaller system identification problems. To tackle those, we have a roadmap that includes structural scanning (connectomics) as well as new tools for functional recording -- some of which are now in development in collaboration with laboratories at MIT and Harvard. We examine the scale of the endeavor, considering such specific approaches to system identification in neural circuitry.",

Most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either on a computer screen or through special stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones. Some advanced, haptic systems now include tactile information, generally known as force feedback, in medical and gaming applications.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one's current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.\n\nMark Pesce\nMark Pesce and Stelarc will talk about their experiences with VR/AR, what is possible now, where it may lead to in the future and the social impacts.\nTopics to be discussed:\n\n    Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality today\n    Google Glass and other projects that will likely expand upon consumer applications for Augmented and Virtual Reality\n    Successfully Navigating Mix Reality -- AR/VR in the Next Billion Seconds, near term, medium term and long term\n\n    Stelarc\n    Digital Assistants or Symbionts -- Layers of Meta-data and Intelligence to help guide decision making\n    VR/AR in Art, fashion, and self expression\n    The Participatory Panopticon -- Many perspectives on reality through the senses of many agents",

Using Blender and Unity -- that play together surprisingly well. This project kicked of as an engineering and arts project at Brunel University London.\nIt has been developed as an \"Ambidextrous Arm\" iPhone app.\n\n-- Ear On Arm\nThe body now performs beyond the boundaries of its skin and beyond the local space that it occupies. It can project its physical presence elsewhere. So the notion of single agency is undermined, or at least made more problematic. The body becomes a nexus or a node of collaborating agents that are not simply separated or excluded because of the boundary of our skin, or of having to be in proximity. So we can experience remote bodies, and we can have these remote bodies invading, inhabiting and emanating from the architecture of our bodies, expressed by the movements and sounds prompted by remote agents. What is being generated and experienced is not the biological other -- but an excessive technological other, a third other. A remote and phantom presence manifested by a locally situated body. And with the increasing proliferation of haptic devices on the Internet it will be possible to generate more potent phantom presences. Not only is there FRACTAL FLESH (bodies and bits of bodies, spatially separated but electronically connected, generating similar patterns of recurring activity at different scales); there is now PHANTOM FLESH(Phantom not as in phantasm, but as in phantom limb. Haptic technologies generating tactile and force-feedback that results in a more potent presence of remote bodies). The biological body is not well organ-ized. The body needs to be Internet enabled in more intimate ways. THE EAR ON ARM project suggests an alternate anatomical architecture -- the engineering of a new organ for the body: an available, accessible and mobile organ for other bodies in other places, enabling people to locate and listen in to another body elsewhere. \n\nhttp://stelarc.org/?catID=20242",

    "description": "Twenty Years of the Science of Consciousness: Lessons from a nascent science\nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/agenda\n\nThe mainstream empirical science of consciousness is now two decades old. What has been learned? What are its prospects for the next two decades? We now have a small, stable terminology and an embryonic education system. Twenty years has also delivered what does not cause consciousness and multiple theories of consciousness, none of which has found general acceptance. This lack, along with unusual attributes of the science, is explored as empirical evidence of a systemic anomaly in science method overall.\n\nThe result is that the lack of an observer in physics, and the 'explanatory gap'/'hard problem' in the neuroscience of consciousness share a common origin: the lack of causal mechanism in our current form of 'laws of nature'. The result suggests the next 20 years will require a fundamental shift in our understanding of what kinds of laws of nature are possible, and when we have evidence.\n\nThis work is the outcome of a decade-long empirical scientific study of scientists and our scientific behaviour. It reveals the discovery of the full scope of scientific behaviour, which is currently only 50% implemented (that is, the current form of 'laws of nature' is one of a pair of possible forms, and that the second form is unrecognised and masked by our procedures). It demonstrates that the philosophy/science divorce of the 18th century, combined with explosive science sub-discipline proliferation, left science in an unmanaged state, and that it remains in that 300 year old fossilised state, maintained by mechanisms that will be outlined. The needed change is also outlined, along with its implications. This outcome formulates a long overdue modernisation of the process of science.\n\nThe work presents a cogent case for the imminence of a paradigm shift impacting the whole of science, but felt most keenly in physics (cosmology) and neuroscience. The key take-home message is that science has discovered, and must adapt to the reality, that the science of consciousness is actually the scientific explanation of ourselves -- the scientific observer.\n\nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/01/colin-geoffrey-hales-to-speak-at-the-singularity-summit-2012/",

    "description": "http://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/08/can-intelligence-explode/\nAbstract: The technological singularity refers to a hypothetical scenario in which technological advances virtually explode. The most popular scenario is the creation of super-intelligent algorithms that recursively create ever higher intelligences. After a short introduction to this intriguing potential future, I will elaborate on what it could mean for intelligence to explode. In this course, I will (have to) provide a more careful treatment of what intelligence actually is, separate speed from intelligence explosion, compare what super-intelligent participants and classical human observers might experience and do, discuss immediate implications for the diversity and value of life, consider possible bounds on intelligence, and contemplate intelligences right at the singularity.\n\nAlso see: \nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/08/universal-artificial-intelligence/\nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/08/panel-intelligence-substrates-computation-and-the-future/\nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/2012/01/marcus-hutter-to-speak-at-the-singularity-summit-au-2012/\n\nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au/agenda",

What aspects of intelligence are difficult to compute?\n    - How does the human brain compute intelligence?\n    - Are all aspects of intelligence (and consciousness) computable on any arbitrary substrates?\n    - Why the technology agnostic approach to SIM (Substrate Independent Minds)?\n    - Why would we want our intelligence existing on another substrate (other than the brain tissue it currently exists on)?\n    - What parts of intelligence are more likely not able to be amenable to moving to current computing architectures?\n    - Gene Survival vs Pattern Survival and Universal Darwinism\n\n \n\nRandal Koene says: At carboncopies (carboncopies.org), we support practical approaches toward what we descriptively term \"advanced substrate-independent minds\" (ASIM), i.e. transferring mind functions from the biological substrate to another substrate on which those functions can be performed. Carboncopies initially takes a technology agnostic stance. Carboncopies' main tasks are to clarify the fundamentals of ASIM and to maintain roadmapping activities towards the ASIM objective. Carboncopies organizes workshops and conferences where interested parties can exchange ideas, network with others, and keep updated on the latest developments in the field. We also gather up-to-date literature and news relevant to the ASIM community.\n\nColin Hales is researching EM fields, Ephapsis and bio-inspired computing etc.  He believes it is likely that General Intelligence will be far easier to achieve in bio-inspired substrates that use or have EM fields by default (instead of trying to simulate physics or EM fields on current models of silicon based computing).\n\nMarcus Hutter is a Professor in the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS) at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. Before Marcus was with IDSIA in Switzerland and NICTA. Marcus' research at RSCS/ANU/NICTA/IDSIA is/was centered around Universal Artificial Intelligence, which is a mathematical top-down approach to AI, related to Kolmogorov complexity, algorithmic probability, universal Solomonoff induction, Occam's razor, Levin search, sequential decision theory, dynamic programming, reinforcement learning, and rational agents. Generally Marcus is attracted by fundamental problems on the boundary between Science and Philosophy, which have a chance of being solved in his expected lifespan. One is Artificial Intelligence. The other is Particle Physics with questions related to physical Theories of Everything. Mathematics in its whole breadth (statistics, numerics, algebra, ...) has become his constant and cherished companion.\nhttp://2012.singularitysummit.com.au",

How the visual brain works unconsciously. Is there potential for the brain to repair itself?\nEndogenous neural stem/ precursor cells lead the way.\n\nJames Bourne completed his undergraduate degree at Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, London and his PhD in Neuropharmacology at King's College, London, before moving to Australia to undertake a Postdoctoral position. In 2003 he was awarded an ARC Australian Postdoctoral Fellowship, then in 2007 an NHMRC RD Wright (CDA II). In the same year he also received an NHMRC Award for Excellence in Health and Medical Research. Dr Bourne now has his own group in the newly established Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute focusing on the development and repair of the mammalian visual cortex; looking at this from the cell through to the system.\n\nDr Bourne has unique expertise in primate neurobiology. His skills and expertise in primate research will enable him to undertake cross-disciplinary research collaborations within ARMI and beyond and will form an important component of translational research to humans.\n\n\"James also has extensive experience in establishing collaborations with the wider scientific community in both Australia and overseas. An early-career researcher, James has been successful in establishing his own research group and attracting independently-funded and international research staff,\" Professor Rosenthal said.\n\nResearch Themes\nThe primary focus of the group emerged in the development and maturation of the cerebral cortex of primates and other mammals.\n\nThe adult cerebral cortex is formed as a mosaic of interconnected areas, but how the multiple of areas emerge seamlessly during ontogenesis and establish connections with other brain areas has yet to be determined.\n\nIn order to address these issues, the laboratory has been focusing on the development of the visual cortex, which includes areas that are responsible for visual perception and visual guidance of behavior.\n\nUnderstanding the early development of this important region will elucidate mechanisms that are relevant not only for understanding normal brain function, but also for clarifying the functional bases of disturbances of visual perception that emerge as a consequence of perinatal lesions (eg: those associated with premature delivery, complications during labor, childhood accidents), abnormal visual experience in childhood, and neurological diseases.\n\nAlso see: http://www.neurorepair.net/",

Of prosthetic augmentation and extended operational systems. An age of Organs Without Bodies. Of organs awaiting bodies. There is now a proliferation of biocompatible components in both substance and scale that allows technology to be attached and implanted into the body. Organs are extracted and exchanged. Organs are engineered and inserted. Blood flowing in my body today might be circulating in your body tomorrow. An artificial heart circulates blood without pumping. A person is alive but his heart does not beat. Ova are fertilized by sperm that was frozen. We can\ntake the skin cell from an impotent male and reengineer it into a sperm cell. More interestingly, the skin cell from a female body might be made into sperm cell. Limbs can be reattached and reanimated. The face of a donor body becomes a third face on the recipient Cadavers can be preserved forever with plastination whilst comatose bodies can be sustained indefinitely on life-support systems. Cryogenically suspended bodies await reanimation at some imagined future. The dead, the near-dead, the undead and the yet to be born now exist simultaneously. This is the age of the Cadaver, the Comatose and the Chimera. Of proliferating liminal spaces where what becomes important is no longer what it means to be alive, but rather what constitutes being dead. The chimera is the body that performs with mixed realities. A biological body, augmented with technology and telematically performing with virtual systems. The chimera is an alternate embodiment. The body acts with indifference. Indifference as opposed to expectation. An indifference that allows something other to occur, that \nallows an unfolding- in its own time and with its own rhythm. An indifference that allows the body to be suspended with hooks into its skin, that allows an inserting of a sculpture into its stomach and that allows a ear to be surgically constructed and stem-cell grown on its arm.",

    "description": "http://2010.singularitysummit.com.au\nMind uploading would involve the use of an artificial substrate -- some kind of advanced computational system -- to emulate the activities of a biological brain. Proponents of uploading typically imagine this as a way to achieve survival beyond the flesh (and perhaps other advantages, such as greatly enhanced speed of thought and/or the opportunity to extend cognitive capacities in multiple ways).\n\nThe main advantages proposed for mind uploading presuppose that the same individual somehow \"occupies\", or is instantiated by, both the biological brain (or the entire biological organism) and the computational system. But this is problematic. The problem can be thought of in terms of personal identity: if I have been uploaded onto an artificial computational system, is the resulting intelligence really \"me\" or is it in some sense a mere duplicate? Even if the cybernetic intelligence is not strictly \"me\", is there at least some sense in which I can be said to have survived the experience, though my biological brain may have been destroyed? We will explore whether uploading would really represent survival beyond the flesh, and whether this might depend in some way on the details and circumstances. What is needed for cybernetic survival?",

The transhuman future also projects a cosmic horizon of post-human beings with godlike capacities where super intelligence saturates the whole universe. All this naturally provokes different responses: some eager to pursue, some cautious, some dismissive.\n\nThis encompassing narrative has many parallels (and differences) with a Christian narrative of the cosmos. This cathedral conversation aims at mutual understanding and critical engagement between the transhuman future, the sociology of technology and a Christian perspective.\"\n\nA discussion on Transhumanism/Posthumanism.  Entry is free with the request for a gold coin donation to cover costs. Each speaker will have approx 10 minutes to speak, and then five minutes to reply to each other and then open for Q/A.\nThe atmosphere is intended to be 'appreciative' while clearly indicating differences.",

Andrew defends the view that the relationship between physical and conscious properties is one of symmetrical representation, rather than supervenience.

    "title": "Marcus Hutter - What is Intelligence?  AIXI & Induction",
    "description": "What is Intelligence?\nIntelligence is a very difficult concept (maybe thats the reason why many people try to avoid it or narrow it down).  I've worked on this question for many many years now, and we went through the literature; psychology literature, philosophy literature; AI literature) what individuals, researches, and also groups came up with definitions, they are very diverse.  But there seems to be one redcurrant theme and if you wnat to put it in one sentence,  then you could define intelligence as:\n\"an agents ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments\", or to succeed in a wide range of environments.  \nIf you now look at this sentence and ask, \"wow, how can this single sentence capture the complexity of intelligence?\"  There are two answers to that. First: many aspect of that are emergent properties of intelligence, like being able to learn - if I want to succeed or solve a problem I need to acquire new knowledge, so learning is an emergent phenomenon this definition.\nAnd the second answer is: this is just a sentence that contains a few words, what you really have to do, and that's the hard part, is to transform it into meaningful equations and then study these equations.  And that's what I have done in the last 12 years.\n\nBounded Rationality:\nIt is an interesting question whether resource bounds should be included in any definition of intelligence or not, and the natural answer is of course they should.  Well there are several problems, the first one is that nobody ever came up with a reasonable theory of bounded rationality (people have tried), so it seems to be very hard.  And this is not specific to AI or intelligence, but it seems to be symptomatic in science, so if you look at the several fields (physics the crown discipline) theories have been developed: Neuton's mechanics, General Relativity Theory, Quantum Field theory, the Standard Model of Particle Physics.  there are more and more precise, but they get less and less computable, and having a computable theory is not a principle in developing these theories, of course at some point you have to test these theories and you want to do something with them, and then you need a computable theory - this is a very difficult issue (and you have to approximate them or do something about it). But having computational resources built into the fundamentals of the theories, that is at least in physics, and if you look at other disciplines, that is not how things work.\nYou design theories so that they describe your phenomenon as well as possible and the computational aspect is secondary.  Of course if it is incomputable and you can't do anything with it, you have to come up with another theory, but this always comes second.  And only in computer science (and this comes naturally) computer scientists try to think about how they can design an efficient algorithm to solve my problem, and since AI is sitting in the computer science department traditionally, the mainstream thought is \"how can I build a resource bounded artificial intelligent system\".  And I agree that ultimately this is what we want.   But the problem is so hard I think, that we should take (or a large fraction of the scientists) this approach, model the problem first, define the problem first, and once we are confident that we have solved this problem, then go to the second phase, try to approximate the theory, try to make a computational theory out of it. And then there are many many possibilities, you could still try to create a resource bounded theory of intelligence, which will be very very hard if you want to have it very principled, or you do some heuristics... or .. or .. or... many options.  Or the short answer may be I am not smart enough to come up with a resource bounded theory of intelligence, therefore I only developed one without resource constraints (that would be the short answer).\n\nAIXI:\nOk so now we have this informal definition that intelligence is an agents ability to succeed or achieve goals in a wide range of environments.  The point is you can formalize this theory, and we have done that and it is called AIXI.  Or Universal AI is the general field theory and AIXI is the particular agent which acts optimally in this sense. \nSo that works as follows: it has a planning component, and it has a learning component.  What the learning component does is, think about a robot walking around in the environment, and at the beginning it has no data/knowledge about the world, so what it has to do is acquire data/knowledge of the world and then build its own model of the world, how the world works.  And it does that, so there are very powerful general theories on how to learn a model from data, from very complex scenarios.  This theory is rooted in Kolomogrov complexity, algorithmic information theory - the basic idea is you look for the simplest model which describe your data efficiently well.",

    "description": "Can Intelligence Explode?\nThe technological singularity refers to a hypothetical scenario in which technological advances virtually explode. The most popular scenario is the creation of super-intelligent algorithms that recursively create ever higher intelligences. After a short introduction to this intriguing potential future, I will elaborate on what it could mean for intelligence to explode. In this course, I will (have to) provide a more careful treatment of what intelligence actually is, separate speed from intelligence explosion, compare what super-intelligent participants and classical human observers might experience and do, discuss immediate implications for the diversity and value of life, consider possible bounds on intelligence, and contemplate intelligences right at the singularity.\n\nSlides (pdf): http://www.hutter1.net/publ/ssingularity.pdf\nSlides (PowerPoint): http://www.hutter1.net/publ/ssingularity.ppsx\n\nPaper: M.Hutter, Can Intelligence Explode, Journal of Consciousness Studies, Vol.19, Nr 1-2 (2012) pages 143--166.\nhttp://www.hutter1.net/publ/singularity.pdf\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6177",

    "description": "Web: http://sfn2012.carboncopies.org \nSFN Satellite Symposium on Whole Brain Circuit Reconstruction (Oct. 16, 2012)\nHosted by Carboncopies.org @ 6:30pm - 9:30pm, October 16, 2012\nin the \"Bridge\" room of the Hilton New Orleans Riverside.\n\nThe last few years have seen a rapid increase in the interest in detailed large scale reconstructions of neuronal circuitry identified in human or animal brain tissue. On the structural side, this development is directly related to advances in connectomics, the acquisition of large-scale and high-resolution neural structure and neural connectivity data. On the functional side, recent developments are indicating that neuroscience is ready for a new approach to data acquisition that would provide functional recordings at high spatial and temporal resolution from tens of thousands to millions of neurons.\n\nTogether, the data that these developments seek to collect should enable the functional reconstruction of meaningful pieces of biological neuronal circuitry or even Whole Brain Circuit Reconstruction. Such reconstructions can be used to test hypotheses and to properly ground our theories about operations carried out in brain regions. They will also improve our understanding of brain disorders and deficits, and may aid the development of artificial intelligence. Ultimately, reconstruction of specific brain circuitry will lead to Whole Brain Emulation with all that that entails.\n\nBefore any of those fantastic results can be achieved, we need to build the tools, grasp the System Identification problem at the foundation of brain circuit reconstruction and deal with the integration of the different technologies and methods that together solve the System Identification problem. Likely, this will be an iterative process. To date, some of the best results in this field include the ground-breaking 2011 Nature publications by Brigmann et al and Bock et al.\n\nThe points addressed in this symposium are:\nIntegration\nA number of projects exist today to address the requirements for obtaining a detailed connectome. There are also several projects that are attempting to produce tools for high spatial and temporal resolution recordings, which can provide the necessary functional reference points for tractable System Identification. And there are projects that study the matter of reconstruction, how to create representations, assign parameter values and carry out emulations of identified neuronal circuitry. We will look at ways to streamline cooperation between these projects so that an integrated solution is possible.\nDemonstration\nTo date, there has been no demonstration that the interesting content (e.g. memories) of a neural system can be captured and recognized through the proposed detailed data acquisition and reconstruction. To elicit true enthusiasm in the scientific community and in funding bodies, it is essential to demonstrate that the approach is in fact a practical possibility.\nFunding\nThere are a number of projects with great intrinsic value and significant implementation knowledge that must not be lost! Several avenues to guarantee support and progress for all parts of the puzzle, and as a group effort rather than an individual struggle will be presented.\nApproaches\nWays to compare different proposals and projects, specific road-blocks and metrics will be introduced.\n\n\nIn addition to these topics, there is space for general brainstorming in this interest-driven group, as well as an opportunity to learn about the goals and next steps of the supporting Foundation 2045, carboncopies.org and the GF2045 Congress in New York City that is strongly associated with this symposium.\n\nThe Integration, Demonstration and Approaches topics will be tackled in panel discussion after each contributing researcher describes their project(s) briefly (5-10 mins each). Funding discussion follows a topical presentation by Randal A. Koene.\n\n\nTime: 6:30pm - 9:30pm, October 16, 2012\nPlace: \"Bridge\" room, Hilton New Orleans Riverside, Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting 2012\n\n(Please note that the Symposium may not appear on the SFN2012 Satellite Events page until the final program is printed.)\n\nTo participate, simply show up or contact Randal.A.Koene@carboncopies.org.\n\nTo follow all carboncopies.org events join the Facebook group:",

It relates to the concept of Mind Uploading, which means taking the functions of the mind and moving them to another substrate, and it relates to a specific approach, the most conservative one that we have currently, called Whole Brain Emulation, the notion that you need to actually emulate the mechanisms, the functions of neurophysiology and neuroanatomy at a detailed level to get mind functions to work",

    "title": "Russell Blackford - Human Enhancement",
    "description": "Interview with Russell Blackford at Continuum 8!\nHUMAN ENHANCEMENT: THE CHALLENGE TO LIBERAL TOLERANCE\n\nA remarkable feature of the ongoing public debate about human enhancement is that many participants have ignored, or even rejected, liberal approaches to public policy, particularly the idea that experiments in living are to be welcomed. The character of the debate appears to have been shaped in large part by the wish of some participants to impose their moral ideals by force of law, and by fears of the strange directions that society might take as enhancement technologies develop. Much of this thinking is in clear conflict with the idea of liberal tolerance, which holds that it is not the proper business of the state to make us virtuous or establish a common morality. Put bluntly, liberal tolerance is under challenge.\n\nAlso see Russell Blackford's book 'Humanity Enhanced: Genetic Choice and the Challenge for Liberal Democracies'\n\nEmerging biotechnologies that manipulate human genetic material have drawn a chorus of objections from politicians, pundits, and scholars. In Humanity Enhanced, Russell Blackford eschews the heated rhetoric that surrounds genetic enhancement technologies to examine them in the context of liberal thought, discussing the public policy issues they raise from legal and political perspectives. Some see the possibility of genetic choice as challenging the values of liberal democracy. Blackford argues that the challenge is not, as commonly supposed, the urgent need for a strict regulatory action. Rather, the challenge is that fear of these technologies has created an atmosphere in which liberal tolerance itself is threatened. Focusing on reproductive cloning, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis of embryos, and genetic engineering, Blackford takes on objections to enhancement technologies (raised by Jürgen Habermas and others) based on such concerns as individual autonomy and distributive justice. He argues that some enhancements would be genuinely beneficial, and that it would be justified in some circumstances even to exert pressure on parents to undertake genetic modification of embryos. Blackford argues against draconian suppression of human enhancement, although he acknowledges that some specific and limited regulation may be required in the future. More generally, he argues, liberal democracies would demonstrate liberal values by tolerating and accepting the emerging technologies of genetic choice.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Humanity-Enhanced-Challenge-Democracies-Bioethics/dp/0262026619/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1468885638&sr=1-1&keywords=Humanity+Enhanced\n\nhttp://metamagician3000.blogspot.com.au/\n\nScience, Technology & the Future - http://scifuture.org",

    "title": "Robert Miller - Buddhism and Existentialism",
    "description": "Recorded at the Existentialist Society Melbourne -  Dr Robert Miller was born and educated in Ayr, Scotland, before going to Edinburgh University where he did an MA on Philosophy. He did post-graduate research at Cambridge University on themes in Existentialism and Zen Buddhism and practised at the San Francisco Zen Center. He came to Monash University in Australia on a scholarship to do a PhD on themes in the philosophy of religion and ethics. Since 1990, he has been teaching Philosophy at RMIT University in Melbourne. Over the years, he has given many talks at Kagyu E-vam Buddhist Institute synthesizing Eastern and Western ideas. \n\nCheck out his book \"Buddhist existentialism: From anxiety to authenticity and freedom\": http://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:18794 https://www.amazon.com.au/Buddhist-Existentialism-Anxiety-Authenticity-Freedom/dp/0980502209\nBlurb:  Robert Miller, who has over the years taken a great interest in synthesizing eastern and western philosophical thought, has presented an interesting and intriguing work on the interface between Buddhism and existentialism. In my own writings, I have made an attempt to locate the existentialist call to awaken people to the human condition within the Buddha s analysis of suffering and the way out of the human predicament of existential pain and anguish: the quest for meaning, the search for identity, the struggle to be authentic, existential challenges of tragedy, alienation and anxiety, as well as the assertion of human self-awareness and freedom (de Silva, 2007, Explorers of Inner Space: The Buddha, Krishnamurti and Kierkegaard). Against the background of my personal philosophical interest in east-west comparative philosophy, I found Robert Millers study a very rewarding venture from the perspectives of a number of facets of his study of Buddhism and existentialism. Robert Miller locates existentialism within the doctrine of shunyata and the philosophy of Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna is a philosopher who is associated with the use of the dialectical method . Nagarjuna makes the nature of conflicting theories of reality the focus of his analysis. Nagarjuna analyses each theory and its standpoints and by exhibiting its inner flaw, and he claims to dissolve each theory without any residue. He considers the criticism of such theories as a deliverance from all entanglements and passions. Miller rejects the transcendentalist interpretation of Madhyamika teachings. The key experience according to the Madhyamika teaching is not something mystical and transcendental. It is more simply the ordinary and everyday conceptualized experience of life, where we now have direct critical insight into the voidable nature of this conceptualized or linguistically interpreted reality, and consequently become emotionally addicted to it...We void it. Nothing clings. There is letting go. (Miller, 2008, 13). Miller accepts the interpretation of Nagarjuna by Frederick Streng who focuses on the suchness of experience over any transcendental version of emptiness. In discussing the seven central themes of existentialism he refers to the existentialist Sartre s presentation of nothingness and Heidegger on nothingness. In this manner he sees the existentialist dimension of Nagarjuna s philosophy. But he goes beyond seeing parallels between Nagarjuna and the existentialists and develops a philosophy of Buddhist existentialism through mostly the Zen tradition: The central tenets of Buddhist existentialism are as follows: notion of existence precedes essence has a focus on present experience; rejection of intellectual systems for describing and explaining reality; the experience of nothingness is pivotal to both; the rejection of inauthenticity, the focus on anxiety, and the viewing of nothingness as a positive experience that brings peace and joy. Concluding thoughts: I enjoyed reading the book and found it very stimulating, both on existentialism and on Pyrrhonism and therapy, and also the re-enchantment of existentialism; I found that he has a clear understanding of existentialism and the Madhyamika philosophies; I also commend the author for his clarity and intelligibility and recommend the book to potential readers. I have always been interested in the interface between Buddhism and existentialism and this book makes a valuable contribution for integrating an existentialist perspective to Buddhism or a Buddhist perspective to existentialism. In conclusion, I may summarize-- perhaps Miller would agree with me, that real emptiness is fullness . --Dr Padmasiri de Silva, Faculty of Historical Studies & The Centre for Theology and Religious Studies, Monash University, Australia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Miller lectures at RMIT - some of his courses:\nPhilosophy and Happiness: http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/035190\nIntroduction to Recent Philosophy: Modernism/Postmodernism - http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/006136",

    "description": "Approaches to AI -  AGI Progress/Impediments - http://2011.singularitysummit.com.au\nBen Goertzel: \nBrain Emulation, Broad level roadmap simulation, bottleneck, lack of imaging technology, we don't know what level of precision we need to reverse engineer biological intelligence.  Ed Boyed - optimal brain imageing.\nNot by Brain emulation (engineering/comp sci/cognitive sci), bottleneck is funding.  People in the field believe/feel they know how to do it. To prove this, they need to integrate their architectures which looks like a big project.  Takes a lot of money, but not as much as something like Microsoft Word.\n\nDavid Chalmers (time 03:42): \nWe don't know which of the two approaches.  Though what form the singularity will take will likely be dependent on the approach we use to build AGI.  We don't understand the theory yet.  Most don't think we will have a perfect molecular scanner that scans the brain and its chemical constituents.  25 Years ago David Chalmers worked in Douglass Hofstadter's AI lab, but his expertise in AI is now out of date.  To get to Human Level AI by brute force or through cognitive psychology knows that the cog-sci is not in very good shape.  Third approach is a hybrid of ruffly brain augmentation (through technology we are already using like ipads and computers etc) and technological extension and uploading.  If using brain augmentation through tech and uploading as a first step in a Singularity then it is including Humans in the equation along with humanities values which may help shape a Singularity with those values.\n\nSteve Omohundro (time 08:08):\nEarly in history AI, there was a distinction: The Neats and the Scruffies.  John McCarthy (Stanford AI Lab) believed in mathematically precise logical representations - this shaped a lot of what Steve thought about how programming should be done.  Marvin Minsky (MIT Lab) believed in exploring neural nets and self organising systems and the approach of throwing things together to see how it self-organises into intelligence.  Both approaches are needed: the logical, mathematically precise, neat approach - and - the probabilistic, self-organising, fuzzy, learning approach, the scruffy.  They have to come together.  Theorem proving without any explorative aspect probably wont succeed. Purely Neural net based simulations can't represent semantics well, need to combine systems with full semantics and systems with the ability to adapt to complex environments.\n\nJames Newton-Thomas (time 9:57)\nJames has been playing with Neural-nets and has been disappointed with them not being  thinks that Augmentation is the way forward.  The AI problem is going to be easier to solve if we are smarter to solve it.  Conferences such as this help infuse us with a collective empowerment of the individuals.  There is an impediment - we are already being dehumanised with our Ipad, where the reason why we are having a conversation with others is a fact about our being part of a group and not about the information that can be looked up via an IPad. We need to careful in our approach so that we are able to maintain our humanity whilst gaining the advantages of the augmentation.\n\n--- Discussion starts time 12:05\n(David) We are already becoming cyborgs in a sense by interacting with tech in our world.  the more literal cyborg approach we are working on now.  Though we are not yet at the point where the technology is commercialization to in principle allow a strong literal cyborg approach. (Ben) Though we could progress with some form of brain vocalization (picking up words directly from the brain), allowing to think a google query and have the results directly added to our mind - thus bypassing our low bandwidth communication and getting at the information directly in our heads.  To do all this ... (Steve) EEG is gaining a lot of interest to help with the Quantified Self - brain interfaces to help measure things about thier body (though the hardware is not that good yet).  (Ben) Use of BCIs for video games - and can detect whether you are aroused and paying attention.  Though the resolution is very course - hard to get fine grained brain state information through the skull.  Cranial jacks will get more information.  Legal systems are an impediment.  (James)  Alan Snyder using time altering magnetic fields in helmets that shut down certain areas of the brain, which effectively makes people smarter in narrower domains of skill. Can provide an idiot savant ability at the cost of the ability to generalize.  The brain that becomes to specific at one task is doing so at the cost of others - the process of generalization.\nhttp://www.scifuture.org/agi-progress-impediments-progress-in-artificial-intelligence-panel/",

Krauss is an internationally known theoretical physicist with wide research interests, including the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, where his studies include the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics. He has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. He was born in New York City and moved shortly thereafter to Toronto, Canada, where he grew up. He received undergraduate degrees in both Mathematics and Physics at Carleton University. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1982), then joined the Harvard Society of Fellows (1982-85). He joined the faculty of the departments of Physics and Astronomy at Yale University as assistant professor in 1985, and associate professor in 1988. In 1993 he was named the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics, Professor of Astronomy, and Chairman of the department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University. He served in the latter position for 12 years, until 2005. During this period he built up the department, which was ranked among the top 20 Physics Graduate Research Programs in the country in a 2005 national ranking. Among the major new initiatives he spearheaded are included the creation of one of the top particle astrophysics experimental and theoretical programs in the US, and the creation of a groundbreaking Masters Program in Physics Entrepreneurship. In 2002, he was named Director of the Center for Education and Research in Cosmology and Astrophysics at Case.",

    "description": "Solomonoff Memorial 2011 -  Mark's interests lie within Cognitive Science, and focus on modelling language, marking up texts, learning, and non-dualist philosophy and reasoning.\nhttp://http://markellison.net/\n\n == Language Change ==\nLanguage change has been an enduring interest. Currently, I am working on the philologicon project with Simon Kirby. This project determines genetic relationships between languages using: confusion probabilities, Fisher Information, and cladistic methods from biology.\n\n == Learning ==\nThe heading has been left general as my interests in this area are very broad. Not only am I interested in formal models of abstract learning and the philosophical problem of learning, I am also fascinated by how natural systems: us, animals, and so on, learn.\n\n == XML Markup and Processing of Buddhist Texts ==\nThe electronic availability in raw form of Buddhist texts in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan opens up many possibilities both for re-representing these texts for readers, and for machine-assisted analysis.\n\n == Non-Dualist Philosophy and Reasoning ==\nEveryday reasoning is riddled with dualities: something exists otherwise it does not exist; a box is red, so it is not blue; a moment in time is independent of all other moments. These assumed dualisms lead to apparent paradoxes, and flawed arguments in some cases. By replacing them with less dualistic notions, we can get a better understanding of many phenomena: time, space, learning, subjectivity and objectivity.",

    "description": "At carboncopies.org, we pull together the expertise and the projects that are needed to achieve what we call substrate-independent minds, SIM for short. Let me introduce SIM, what it means, what it is about, and in particular, its feasibility.\n\nThe predictions of futurists; the expectations of technologists and scientists; the anticipation and concerns of philosophers; the epics of science fiction authors and cinema. All of those talk a lot about life-extension, life-expansion, augmentation, brain-computer interfaces, artificial minds, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. What may those things come to mean for the life that we know?\n\nAfter all, in the end we must come full-circle. Far from any objective universal purpose, it all begins with us, with our wishes, our drives. It is that context where we introduce SIM. What is it? Why would you want it? And how can we do it?\n\nFor a moment therefore, let us take a step back and look at ourselves as a species and as individuals.",

What frightens you?\nHow might the future change the way we live?\nAnd how might we change the way we live in the future?\n\n \n\nThe future is unknown. With the benefit of hindsight, we often wish we had more foresight.  Have you ever wanted to go back in time and fix something? So why do we need a Future Day?\n\n \n\nThe human species is at a unique stage in history - scientific and technological progress is moving fast and is accelerating dramatically.  Ray Kurzweil predicts that technological paradigm shifts will become increasingly common, leading to \"technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history\".\n\n \n\nBut what kind of change can we expect?  There are many transformative technologies that look like they will have huge impacts on the way we live.  What sort of future do you want?  If you think through the possibilities of a particular technology, you can better appreciate the consequences of using it.  Future Day is a celebration of imaginative and rational thinking about the future where you can participate.  In the words of Howard Bloom, author of Global Brain: \"Future Day is designed to center the impossible in the public mind once a year as a temptation too delicious to resist.\"\n\n \n\nBen Goertzel, the AI researcher who launched the idea of Future Day, expresses his motivation for conceiving the holiday in terms of the concept of the attention economy.  \"In the more technologically advanced parts of the world\" he notes, \"we are entering a regime in which material scarcity is less of a problem than attentional scarcity. We are in a situation where the focusing of attention, individually and collectively, is of prime importance.  My hope is that Future Day can serve as a tool for helping humanity focus its attention on figuring out what kind of future it wants, and striving to bring these visions to reality.\"\n\n \n\n\"Let's raise a toast to our power to work toward dramatic new solutions to the problems of today -- and let's have fun in the process.  Let's celebrate the amazing opportunities we have right now to work towards a beneficial future!\", says Adam Ford.  \"Future Day is important since it reminds us that a great future does not create itself. In order to realize our hopes and dreams, we have to actively work to make them happen. One of my dreams is to see a day when disease, and the suffering associated with it, is obliterated.\" - Sonia Arrison, author of 100+\n\n \n\nJoin the conversation on Future Day March 1st to explore the possibilities about how the future is transforming us. You can celebrate Future Day however you like, the ball is in your court — feel free to send a photo of your Future Day gatherings to info@futureday.org, and your jubilation may wind up being commemorated on the Future Day website, Humanity+ website, and\nthe Facebook page! http://www.facebook.com/pages/Future-Day/237779372974327",

    "title": "Future Day - John Smart Interview",
    "description": "Future Day - March 1st http://futureday.org\r\nJohn Smart is a futurist and scholar of accelerating change. He is founder and president of the Acceleration Studies Foundation, an organization that does \"outreach, education, research, and advocacy with respect to issues of accelerating change.\". Smart has an MS in futures studies from the University of Houston, and a BS in business administration from U.C. Berkeley.\r\n\r\nSmart is the principal advocate of the concept of \"STEM compression,\" (formerly \"MEST compression\") the idea that the most (ostensibly) complex of the universe's extant systems at any time (galaxies, stars, habitable planets, living systems, and now technological systems) use progressively less space, time, energy and matter (\"STEM\") to create the next level of complexity in their evolutionary development.[2] A similar perspective is found in Buckminster Fuller's writings on ephemeralization.\r\n\r\nIn what he calls the \"developmental singularity hypothesis\",[3] Smart proposes that STEM compression, as a driver of accelerating change, must lead cosmic intelligence to a future of highly-miniaturized, accelerated, and local \"transcension\" to extra-universal domains, rather than to space-faring expansion within our existing universe. The transcension scenario (vs. expansion scenario) proposes that once civilizations saturate their local region of space with their intelligence, they need to leave our visible, macroscopic universe in order to continue exponential growth of complexity and intelligence, and thus disappear from this universe, thus explaining the Fermi Paradox. Developments in astrobiology make this a testable hypothesis. A related proposal may be found in the selfish biocosm hypothesis of complexity theorist James N. Gardner.\r\n\r\nSmart has been criticized by some in the futures community as overly reductionist and a techno-optimist.His writings do discuss risks, abuses, and social regulation of technology, but usually as a secondary theme, subject to \"inevitable\" acceleration. In his defense, he claims universal and human-historical accelerating change (see Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar) do not appear to be simply a product of evolution but of some universal developmental process, one apparently protected, in a general statistical sense, by poorly understood immune systems in complex systems. In his public presentations he calls for better characterization and use of existing processes of intelligence, immunity, and interdependence development in biological, cultural, and technological systems. He has critiqued systems scholars such as Jonathan Huebner, who claim that the rate of global innovation appears to be slowing down. His counterthesis is that innovation is increasingly conducted by and within technological systems, and is thereby becoming more abstract and difficult to measure by human social standards.\r\n\r\nAn advocate of foresight and \"acceleration-awareness\" in education, Smart has proposed a developmental categorization of futurist thinking, maintains a list of global futures studies programs, and has authored an open source required undergraduate course in foresight development, modeled after required foresight courses at Tamkang University in Taiwan. He has argued that just as history (hindsight) and current events (insight) are core general education requirements, the methods and knowledge base of futures studies (foresight), deserve inclusion in the modern undergraduate curriculum.\r\n\r\nInterviewed by Adam A.

Koene is a Dutch neuroscientist and neuroengineer, and co-founder of carboncopies.org, the outreach and roadmapping organization for Advancing Substrate-Independent Minds (ASIM). He is currently directing the Analysis team at the nanotechnology company Halcyon Molecular. Between 2008 and 2010, Koene was Director of the Department of Neuroengineering at Tecnalia, the third largest private research organization in Europe. Koene earned his Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the Department of Psychology at McGill University, and his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Information Theory at Delft University of Technology. He is a former Professor at the Center for Memory and Brain of Boston University, and is co-founder of the Neural Engineering Corporation of Massachusetts. Koene established the MindUploading.org website and first proposed the term and specific approach called whole brain emulation, the purpose of which is the technological accomplishment of mind transfer to a different substrate. His professional research objective is the implementation of whole brain emulation: creating the large-scale high-resolution representations and emulations of activity in neuronal circuitry that are needed in patient-specific neuroprostheses. He is a member of the Oxford working group that convened in 2007 to create a first roadmap toward whole brain emulation.\n\nRandal Koene of Tecnalia invented more than ten years ago the expression Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), to describe a process of modeling, and implementing a model of the entire brain, possibly a human brain. In this conversation he describes his project, what is the current status of WBE, and its timeline. He also tells what he'd do if he woke up one day as an emulated brain, and describes the ethical considerations concerning WBE.",

    "description": "Aubrey de Grey speaks on how to become a successful heretic.\r\n\r\n1. Be right (diligence before oratory).  Sean Carroll: \"Being a heretic is hard work\". It's not enough to disagree with mainstream thinking - you actually have to be correct. \"Galileo was a heretic, but understood the reigning orthodoxy at the time better than anyone else.\" Very few people work that hard: \"Many casual heretics can't be bothered.\"\r\n\r\n3. Be a doer (as well as a talker). One reason to take de Grey seriously is the number of people who've taken him seriously, pledging huge sums to support his research.  You have to work very hard to raise these sorts of sums... and fundraising is a form of doing, even if it doesn't feel like it.\r\n\r\n8. Be inspirational (and have a team that's organizational).\r\n\r\n9. Be selfless (remember that control is only a means to an end) - Don't control all your work too carefully - you make progress by reliquishing control to other people to take your idea forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview buy Adam A. Ford -  held at Polytechnic University Hong Kong.\r\nPlease subcribe.",

And can the rest be handled by precompiled generic pluggable AI modules or what not?\nWill we need drexlerian nanotech to scan from the inside of the brain out to a sufficient degree of resolution and framerate?\nWill scans be instantaneous?  If not, and taking time, then how will we compensate for variation in hormonal and electrical levels etc??\n\nSome people have concerns that SI (Simulated Intelligence?) is computationally infeasible.  How would you respond to this?\nSoftware development issues: How will he deal with the software engineering side of the simulation?\n\n\nC- Elegance??\n\n--Bekenstein Bound\nThe Bekenstein bound is an upper limit on information that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy or, conversely, the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level.\n\nAn average human brain has a mass of 1.5 kg and a volume of 1260 cm3. The energy (E = mc2) will be 1.34813×1017 J and if the brain is approximate to a sphere then the radius (V = 4πr3/3) will be 6.70030×10−2 m.\nThe Bekenstein bound (I ≤ 2πrEħc ln 2) will be 2.58991×1042 bit and represent the maximum information needed to perfectly recreate the average human brain down to the quantum level. This implies that the number of different states (Ω=2I) of the human brain (and of the mind if physicalism is true) is at most 107.79640×1041.\n\n\n--Prizes (Brain Preservation Technology prize - generate whole brain map to reboot in virtual environment)\n\n\n--Plugable Skills?\nSee the Matrix, Neo assimilates Kung Fu\n\n--Leagal issues?\nLegal issues: Human rights of uploaded minds?  \n\n--Identity: Copying vs Moving?\nA brain simulation can be started, paused, backed-up and rerun from a saved backup state at any time.\nSimulated mind sees world as slow motion , or moving fast, physical would see simulation as smlow or fast.\n\n--Swampman\nSwampman is the subject of a philosophical thought experiment introduced by Donald Davidson, in his 1987 paper \"Knowing One's Own Mind\". \n\nThe question is, does it matter if 'you' are uploaded without causal history, some kind of continuum, and just appear sufficiently to be Randal?  To others and even to the uploaded Randal?\nOr would you prefer to maintain some sort of continuum/causal history and not just appear to be Randal?\nHow would one test for the difference without simulating the whole universe?  \nI suppose you could test if the original was still alive, and see if they make exactly the same decision - if 'you' are a continuum, then the \"you's\" perhaps would split the moment there was a difference in decision or thought between the two or more.\n\nShip of theseus?

    "description": "Aubrey de Grey speaks about different types of Ruminative Therapy Delivery. Sometimes there are some video delays because of bandwidth lag, but most information is there.\n\nSome parts of the research being deprioritized within SENS because research is going on elsewhere, such as some types Amyloid (extra cellular garbage), but SENS are working on the shrinkage of cells, Thyamis?...\n\n04:33 Future of Monitoring the Body - motivation for monitoring people may be less if we assume the worse case scenario for everyone, and apply the therapies needed.\n06:05 Transplantation: Issues of Rejection and Infection - Tissue Engineering is creating organs that have never been in another body, therefore risk of infection can be greatly minimised, and the organs can be created using the cells of the receivers body.  The going has been slow, because of vascularisation (issues with getting blood flow), though change over past few years, we have been experimenting: take an organ, get rid of cells, but not the vasculature (veins), and take cells from the recievers body, and fill out the organ with his/her own cells leaving the vascelature in place.  Mechanical or non-biological solutions - in some cases are looking very promising (i.e. Cochlear Implants - getting better very fast, could be 5 years away from them getting better than normal hearing).  This will become more important as time goes on.  Another way of avoiding the ionfection / rejection issues.  Organs could come from another animal.\n11:55 Cell Therapy: Introduction of new cells - may need to remove existing ones, replacement is harder.  Replacement is often harder.  The phylogenetic tree, the linage tells us alot about how cells differentiate.  We may be able to differentiate cells, turn them into more primitive forms and use them, instead of introducing different cells with different DNA, so in effect, stem cell therapy could allow us to create any type of cell needed.  There are already clinical trials for dealing with diseases related to cell loss, and aging, including Parkinsons disease.\n14.27 Roadmaps?  yes, the book Ending Ageing shows a detailed roadmap, a whole chapter is devoted to this.  There is an entire new chapter in the book devoted to newer progress.\n15:23 Somatic Gene Therapy: editing/altering DNA whilst in the body as opposed to altering in cells before they are introduced into the body. - Different approaches: Classical concept - introduces genes into body packed into viruses which envade cell and get into nucleus then integrate into chromosones, at which time the cargo (engineered DNA) would behave (being translated and  transcribed) much in the same way that our natural genes would.  \nAnother one is ?? Gene therapy - Engineered DNA incorporated into cell before it is introduced into the body.  This won't work on cells that we dont' want to kill, like long lived cells.  People can also suffer nasty side effects of Somatic Gene Therapy,  so it would be good to alleviate these risks by not putting the DNA into random places (as what is often done by using viruses), but in specific places using Gene Targeting - a promising approach to this is by using Zink Finger Nucleases (Protien Zink atom involved with protien folded into a shape of a finger) - important in nature as 'transcription factors' that determine which genes in a cell get expressed and which ones don't. ZFNs fuse to a protien that breaks DNA, allowing for specificity in where introduced DNA is placed in the existing Chromosone.\n19:13 RNAi & WILT. RNAi (interference) is a family of approaches to suppressing the expression of a particular gene that is present in the body.  WILT is about getting rid of the gene completely, so that the suppression (i.e. through RNAi) cannot be overcome by mutation of the cell.  WILT is very elaborate and ambitious, so the hope is that it is not needed, though because other therapies, though promosing,  may not work out. We may be outwitted (see war on cancer), and WILT will be a final stopgap.\n21:29 War on Cancer: Failure? What about useful fallouts?  Yes - immense amount.

Koene is a Dutch neuroscientist and neuroengineer, and co-founder of carboncopies.org, the outreach and roadmapping organization for Advancing Substrate-Independent Minds (ASIM). He is currently directing the Analysis team at the nanotechnology company Halcyon Molecular.  Between 2008 and 2010, Koene was Director of the Department of Neuroengineering at Tecnalia,  the third largest private research organization in Europe. Koene earned his Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the Department of Psychology at McGill University, and his M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Information Theory at Delft University of Technology. He is a former Professor at the Center for Memory and Brain of Boston University, and is co-founder of the Neural Engineering Corporation of Massachusetts. Koene established the MindUploading.org website and first proposed the term and specific approach called whole brain emulation, the purpose of which is the technological accomplishment of mind transfer to a different substrate. His professional research objective is the implementation of whole brain emulation: creating the large-scale high-resolution representations and emulations of activity in neuronal circuitry that are needed in patient-specific neuroprostheses. He is a member of the Oxford working group that convened in 2007 to create a first roadmap toward whole brain emulation. \n\nKoene has professional expertise in computational neuroscience, psychology, information theory, electrical engineering and physics. He organizes neural engineering efforts to obtain and replicate function and structure information that resides in the neural substrate for use in neuroprostheses and neural interfaces. And based on NETMORPH,  Koene's computational framework for the simulated morphological development of neuronal circuitry, his lab is creating a Virtual Brain Laboratory to give neuroscientists, neuroengineers and clinicians large-scale high-resolution quantitative tools analogous to the computational tools that have become essential in fields such as genetics, chemistry or the aero-space industry.

To give our minds the flexibility to transfer and to operate in different substrates bestows upon our species the most important competitive advantage. (2009)\r\n\r\nI am presently participating in the ambitious and fascinating efforts at the nanotechnology company Halcyon Molecular. I am a co-founder of the Neural Engineering Corporation of Massachusetts. Prior to this, I have been the director of the Department of Neuroengineering at Tecnalia, third largest private research organization in Europe, and was a research Prof. at the Center for Memory and Brain of Boston University. My research objective is whole brain emulation, creating the large-scale high-resolution representations and emulations of activity in neuronal circuitry that are needed in patient-specific neuroprostheses. The Department of Neuroengineering of the Fatronik-Tecnalia Foundation was focused on research in neuro-adaptive control, with robotics applications, and research in neural recording, interfaces and feedback.\r\n\r\nAt carboncopies (carboncopies.org), we support practical approaches toward what we descriptively term \"advanced substrate-independent minds\" (ASIM), i.e. transferring mind functions from the biological substrate to another substrate on which those functions can be performed. Carboncopies initially takes a technology agnostic stance. Carboncopies' main tasks are to clarify the fundamentals of ASIM and to maintain roadmapping activities towards the ASIM objective. Carboncopies organizes workshops and conferences where interested parties can exchange ideas, network with others, and keep updated on the latest developments in the field. We also gather up-to-date literature and news relevant to the ASIM community.\r\n\r\nMy professional background includes computational neuroscience, psychology, information theory, electrical engineering and physics. Presently:\r\n\r\n    * I am devoting my efforts to the success of Halcyon Molecular, in its quest to accomplish ultra-high throughput low-cost DNA sequencing and the crucial benefits that this capability will catalyze.\r\n    * I am organizing neural engineering efforts to obtain and replicate function and structure information that resides in the neural substrate for use in neuroprostheses and neural interfaces.\r\n    * The Neural Engineering Corporation and partners are creating a Virtual Brain Laboratory (VBL) based on NETMORPH (netmorph.org), the computational framework for the simulated morphological development of neuronal circuitry. The VBL will give neuroscientists, neuroengineers and clinicians large-scale high-resolution quantitative tools analogous to the computational tools that have become essential in fields such as genomics, chemistry or the aero-space industry.\r\n\r\nThese efforts bridge scales and will help determine how significant functions are encoded robustly in neural ensembles, and how those functions can nevertheless depend in specific ways on the detailed biophysics of particular component physiology.\r\n\r\nhttp://rak.minduploading.org/",

    "description": "http://2010.singularitysummit.com.au\n\nThere are two questions about the ethics of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) which are central:\n* How can we build an ethical AI?\n* Can we build an AI ethically?\n\nThe ﬁrst question concerns the kinds of AI we might achieve — moral, immoral or amoral. The second concerns the ethics of our achieving such an AI. They are more closely related than a ﬁrst glance might reveal. For much of technology, the National Riﬂe Association's neutrality argument might conceivably apply: \"guns don't kill people, people kill people.\" But if we build a genuine, autonomous AI, we arguably will have to have built an artiﬁcial moral agent, an agent capable of both ethical and unethical behavior. The possibility of one of our artifacts behaving unethically raises moral problems for their development that no other technology can. Both questions presume a positive answer to a prior question: Can we build an AI at all? We shall begin our review there.\n\nMr Bayesian.\n\nSingSumAU2010 talk 10",

    "description": "\"Evolving Artificial Intelligences with Human Like Embodiments and Environments\"\n\nThere are a number of breathtaking projects underway including the Blue Brain Project led by Dr. Henry Markram, the China Brain Project formerly led by Dr. Hugo De Garis, and the OpenCog Project led by Dr. Ben Goertzel. They are breathtaking in their vision and complexity.\n\nThis talk is instead about a relatively simple idea. What if instead of scanning and modelling biological neural networks with ever more detail, or building neural networks with a staggering number of neurons, or designing cognitive architectures with immense knowledge databases, we did something different? What if we instead evolve artificial intelligences by requiring them to learn to survive with increasingly human like bodies and environments?\n\nSkilfully coping with the world requires a lifetime of experiences. It requires engaging in a form of life, interacting with the physical world and with others in the social world. Artificial intelligences are evolving behaviours that are ever more sophisticated. Behaviours include walking, hunting, evading, foraging, reproducing, cooperating, competing, using objects, and altering environments. Most interestingly, artificial intelligences are evolving natural language, one of the most powerful human abilities.\n\nThe talk will touch upon a few key ideas. Firstly, life is an incredibly persistent force given the chance, and persistence itself can compel artificial intelligences to act. Neural networks are capable of continual reconfiguration based simply on frequency of activation. Human beings are essentially the same as they were ten thousand years ago in Africa. Finally, computing power is developing at an exponential rate, allowing us to develop more and more realistic simulations.\n\nThis talk will look at evolving artificial intelligences to cope with human embodiments and environments. It will discuss the relevant techniques, technologies, challenges, and common criticisms.\n\nAbout Binh:\nBinh Nguyen is a PhD candidate at La Trobe University.\n\nHis focus is on evolving artificial intelligences with human like embodiments and environments. His work draws inspiration from artificial life, embodied artificial intelligence, evolutionary psychology, and human evolution. He believes that an artificial intelligence that can survive the physical and social challenges that humans face will be a step towards artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe is working on a simulation that exposes artificial intelligences to increasingly human like embodiments and environments. He is doing so by introducing the physical traits that differentiate humans from animals and that create pressures for complex social interactions. These traits include the human form, gender differences, and a slower growth rate compared to almost every other animal. In addition, he is increasing the environmental challenge by improving the level of physical realism, introducing predators, prey, and elements that reward exploring, learning, and cooperation.\n\nHe co-wrote with Dr. Andrew Skabar, \"Evolutionary Intelligence, and Communication in Societies of Virtually Embodied Agents,\" in Artificial Life: Borrowing from Biology, 2009.",

Is there an island of human intellectual uniqueness?\nThe industrial revolution replaced the need for us to use our muscle, whereas the future of Artificial Intelligence will replace our own intelligence.\n\nThe jobs we do are by nature specialized.  Specialized jobs are vulnerable to narrow AI taking over - there is room for this to happen before we have 'artificial general intelligence'.  \nJames says that AGI is a long way off mainly because costly human specialists can be replaced by Narrow AI - and so the only near term interest in AGI is purely academic.  James skepticism about AGI in the short term is economic.\n\nJames would vote for an AI Prime Minister.  Democracy is a distributed search mechanism.  Though this will not work where there is a vast informational and intellectual disparity.\n\nJames believes that it is possible to have friendly AI.  By intuiting the AI with altruism / empathy it will be come emphathic to us, thusly gaining happiness by being friendly to us.\n\nPrevious discussions @ Singularity Salon have been on Chalmers paper, Beleif as Attire (Less Wrong), the H+ Summit 2011, and the Singularity Summit 2010.",

A good turnout, had a round table discussion for about 5 hours and made plenty of noise.\r\nWe spoke about a range of subjects including the Japan nuclear disaster, CEV (Coherent Extrapolated Volition), what the metaphor of the Technological Singularity means (can't see past the Event Horizon of a black hole) -- a definition of what the Singularity is and what it isn't:\r\n- it isn't the accelerating returns or technological development that may lead into a Singularity, it isn't an infinite growth after a Singularity upwards ad infinitum, it isn't referring to a black hole\r\n- it is more like that IJ Good defined as an Intelligence Explosion\r\nWe also spoke about a word made up on the spot: 'enflourishment', and what that word could mean. Actually found out later that the word really does exist.\r\nLastly we spoke on the dynamics and biases of conspiracy oriented thinking, some common behaviors associated with orgs like Ralien UFO cults.

    "description": "Steve Omohundro, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nPresident, Omai Systems\r\n\r\nMany believe we are on the verge of creating truly artificially intelligent systems and that these systems will be central to the future functioning of human society. When integrated with biotechnology, robotics, and nanotechnology, these technologies have the potential to solve many of humanity's perennial problems. But they also introduce a host of new challenges. In this talk we'll describe the a new approach to analyzing the behavior of these systems.\r\n\r\nThe modern notion of a \"rational economic agent\" arose from John von Neumann's work on the foundations of microeconomics and is central to the design of modern AI systems. It is also relevant in understanding a wide variety of other \"intentional systems\" including humans, biological organisms, organizations, ecosystems, economic systems, and political systems.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of fully rational minds is precisely defined and amenable to mathematical analysis. We describe theoretical models within which we can prove that rational systems that have the capability for self-modification will avoid changing their own utility functions and will also act to prevent others from doing so. For a wide class of simple utility functions, uncontrolled rational systems will exhibit a variety of drives: toward self-improvement, self-protection, avoidance of shutdown, self-reproduction, co-opting of resources, uncontrolled hardware construction, manipulation of human and economic systems, etc.\r\n\r\nFully rational minds may be analyzed with mathematical precision but are too computationally expensive to run on today's computers. But the intentional systems we care about are also not arbitrarily irrational. They are built by designers or evolutionary processes to fulfill specific purposes. Evolution relentlessly shapes creatures to survive and replicate, economies shape corporations to maximize profits, parents shape children  to fit into society, and AI designers shape their systems to act in beneficial ways. We introduce a precise mathematical model that we call the \"Rationally-Shaped Mind\" model for describing this kind of situation. By mathematically analyzing this kind of system, we can better understand and design real systems.\r\n\r\nThe analysis shows that as resources increase, there is a natural progression of minds from simple stimulus-response systems, to systems that learn, to systems that deliberate, to systems that self-improve. In many regimes, the basic drives of fully rational systems are also exhibited by rationally-shaped systems. So we need to exhibit care as we begin to build this kind of system. On the positive side, we also show that computational limitations can be the basis for cooperation between systems based on Neyman's work on finite automata playing the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.\r\n\r\nA conundrum is that to solve the safety challenges in a general way, we probably will need the assistance of AI systems. Our approach to is to work in stages. We begin with a special class of systems designed and built to be intentionally limited in ways that prevent undesirable behaviors while still being capable of intelligent problem solving. Crucial to the approach is the use of formal methods to provide mathematical guarantees of desired properties. Desired safety properties include: running only on specified hardware, using only specified resources, reliably shutting down under specified conditions, limiting self-improvement in precise ways, etc.\r\n\r\nThe initial safe systems are intended to design a more powerful safe hardware and computing infrastructure. This is likely to include a global \"immune system\" for protection against accidents and malicious systems.  These systems are also meant to help create careful models of human values and to design utility functions for future systems that lead to positive human consequences. They are also intended to analyze the complex game-theoretic dynamics of AI/human ecosystems and to design social contracts that lead to cooperative equilibria.\r\n\r\nhttp://selfawaresystems.com/2011/07/29/talk-at-monash-university-australia-rationally-shaped-minds-a-framework-for-analyzing-self-improving-ai/\r\n\r\nFilmed & Edited by Adam A.

By developing systems that operate in an evolutionary paradigm, it is possible to solve classes of problems that we don't know how to define.",

    "description": "Transcendent Man Australian premiere, in Melbourne.  On Friday 19th of Aug 2011.\nPanel afterwards with Ben Goertzel, Steve Omohundro, and Hugo de Garis.\n\nThe compelling feature-length documentary film, by director Barry Ptolemy, chronicles the life and controversial ideas of luminary Ray Kurzweil. For more than three decades, inventor, futures, and New York Times best-selling author Ray Kurzweil has been one of the most respected and provocative advocates of the role of technology in our future.\n\n\nIn Transcendent Man, Ptolemy follows Kurzweil around the globe as he presents the daring arguments from his best-selling book, The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology. Kurzweil predicts that with the ever-accelerating rate of technological change, humanity is fast approaching an era in which our intelligence will become increasingly non-biological and millions of times more powerful. This will be the dawning of a new civilization enabling us to transcend our biological limitations. In Kurzweil's post-biological world, boundaries blur between human and machine, real and virtual. Human aging and illness are reversed, world hunger and poverty are solved, and we cure death.\n\n\nPtolemy explores the social and philosophical implications of these changes and the potential threats they pose to human civilization in dialogues with world leader Colin Powell; technologists Hugo deGaris, Peter Diamandis, Kevin Warwick, and Dean Kamen; journalist Kevin Kelly; actor William Shatner; and musician Stevie Wonder. Kurzweil maintains a radically optimistic view of the future, while acknowledging new dangers. Award-winning American composer Philip Glass contributes original theme music that mirrors the depth and intensity of the film.",

    "description": "http://2010.singularitysummit.com.au\nAt the start of 2001-A Space Odyssey there is a scene where a group of apes experiencing a singularity style event is represented. The scene shows an ape learning to use a bone tool to kill for food. A new technology is developed and as a result the ape species can more effectively control a constrained resource. Then the ape turns the new tool to the task of defending another limited resource  in this case water. A new process is applied to an existing technology resulting in the killing of an enemy. Now a single group of apes can dominate the landscape. The game has changed.\nSingularity is one of these future pivotal events. The Kuhnian paradigm shift that changes the game completely.\nThe human journey is, in my opinion, a set of steps where process is applied to the use of technology to shape or respond to the environment. We are good at it. We adapt technology, we change processes and we shape the environment around us. Then we store what we have learned and then teach it to each other. And so we adapt.\nRather than discuss the potentials held out by singularity or to debate the reality or otherwise of achieving singularity, I would like to take a moment to ponder the human capacity to adapt to these game changing moments. In order to understand how we will deal with the challenges of singularity (and in fact any event which changes the game) I would like to look back a little and see the human journey for the marvel that it is. That we have come so far and adapted so much is a stunning achievement. And there is a definite pattern to how we have undertaken this journey. I will present one viewpoint that sheds some light on this human journey.\nFrom our look backward we will see, in looking forward, how we will adapt to the game changing events like singularity. The systems based viewpoint provides one lens through which we can look forward to these events and understand the human response both collectively and individually.\n\nSingSumAU2010 05",

This talk will look at the evolution of intelligent software agents, including the early work at SRI International on Shakey the Robot and the beginnings of the modelling of the mental state of software agents in terms of their beliefs, goals and intentions.\nWhat is the importance of these key mental attitudes and how do they affect the way an intelligent agent perceives the world and acts to accomplish its goals? How can an agent recognise the intentions and goals of others, including agents (or people) that are not cooperative? Why do some propose that decision theory won't work in practice, and why do intelligent machines have to throw away potential solutions if they are going to survive in the real world?\n\nThe talk will also look at some of the early applications of these intelligent agents, including managing malfunctions on NASA's space shuttle and air combat missions, to later business applications and their potential role in the management of people with chronic disease, such as diabetes. Finally, we will consider where these agents will go in the future, and how emotional states may be key to their survival.\n\nSingSumAU2010 02",

    "description": "James Newton-Thomas speaks about AI, robotics, super intelligent AI, the Singularity, and friendly AI\n\nQuote:\"The biggest change in AI that has changed in the last 20 years, is that people have given up trying to define the problems that they wish to solve. They have realized that the problems could often be so complex that we may not know a solution, yet we can still develop systems, or evolved systems that can function in a complex environment.\"\n\n \"Neural Nets have, endemic to their operation, a type of evolutionary paradigm. But you can then go to a meta-paradigm, which is to change the structure of the network, and to change the types of neurons and the interconnections between them in the same way that nature will specialize - our brains contain a myriad of sub-brains, each one architecturally adept at solving a certain class of problem.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of the interview is how AI has changed, problems can be so complex that it is so hard to define a scalable way to deal with the problem - but we have realized that the problem does not have to be fully described.  By developing systems that operate in an evolutionary paradigm, it is possible to solve classes of problems that we don't know how to define.",

    "description": "Part 21 Interview with Hugo in Melbourne after the Singularity Summit Australia 2010, conducted by Adam A. Ford.\n\nWow, you have made it to the end of the Epic H-Dawg interview!\nIn case your fix of Hugo de Garis was not enough, here is another interview with Hugo de Garis: youtube.com/playlist?list=PL869F45028429FEE2&feature=view_all\n\nAlso, here are all the Hugo de Garis videos I have on YouTube: youtube.com/user/TheRationalFuture/videos?query=Hugo+de+Garis\n\nBio: Prof. Dr. Hugo de Garis, 63, has lived in 7 countries. He recently retired from his role of Director of the Artificial Brain Lab (ABL) at Xiamen University, China, where he was building China's first artificial brain. He and his friend Prof. Dr. Ben Goertzel have just finished guest editing a special issue on artificial brains for Neurocomputing journal (December 2010), the first  of its kind on the planet.\n\nHe continues to live in China, where his U.S. savings go 7 times further, given China's much lower cost of living. He spends his afternoons in his favorite (beautiful) park, and his nights in his apartment, intensively studying PhD-level pure math and mathematical physics to be able to write books on topics such as femtometer scale technology (\"femtotech\"), topological quantum computing (TQC), as well as other technical and sociopolitical themes.\n\nHe is the author of two books: The Artilect War: Cosmists vs. Terrans : A Bitter Controversy Concerning Whether Humanity Should Build Godlike Massively Intelligent Machines (2005) and Multis and Mono: What the Multicultured Can Teach the Monocultured: Towards the Creation of a Global State (2010). Both these books are concerned with the political consequences of future technologies.\n\nHe labels his new lifestyle \"ARCing\" (After-Retirement Careering), feeling freed from wage slavery, spending (probably) the remaining 30 years of his life pursuing with passion those deep and interesting topics that truly fascinate him, without having to waste huge amounts of time writing an endless stream of relatively unread, un-meaningful, short-horizon scientific papers or research grant proposals just to receive a salary. He feels liberated from all that, and can recommend ARCing to anyone with sufficient savings (i.e.. to take up \"wage free careering in the third of life\").",

To be a god or not to be a god, that is the question.. as one of the commenter says, it's a real hard question..\n\n\nBio: Prof. Dr. Hugo de Garis, 63, has lived in 7 countries. He recently retired from his role of Director of the Artificial Brain Lab (ABL) at Xiamen University, China, where he was building China's first artificial brain. He and his friend Prof. Dr. Ben Goertzel have just finished guest editing a special issue on artificial brains for Neurocomputing journal (December 2010), the first  of its kind on the planet.\n\nHe continues to live in China, where his U.S. savings go 7 times further, given China's much lower cost of living. He spends his afternoons in his favorite (beautiful) park, and his nights in his apartment, intensively studying PhD-level pure math and mathematical physics to be able to write books on topics such as femtometer scale technology (\"femtotech\"), topological quantum computing (TQC), as well as other technical and sociopolitical themes.\n\nHe is the author of two books: The Artilect War: Cosmists vs. Terrans : A Bitter Controversy Concerning Whether Humanity Should Build Godlike Massively Intelligent Machines (2005) and Multis and Mono: What the Multicultured Can Teach the Monocultured: Towards the Creation of a Global State (2010).

He feels liberated from all that, and can recommend ARCing to anyone with sufficient savings (i.e.. to take up \"wage free careering in the third of life\").",

Become quantitatively and qualitatively more intelligent than humans.\n3.23 Artilect Ethics - Managing risk - how would the artilects feel about us.  Therefore artilects would be nice to us - though this is a human way of thinking. Risk\n4.27 Only way to be sure that the risk is zero is not to build the artilects.  Stop cosmists from building AGI\n5.53 The issues are only just getting into the media - in the future it will be everywhere.  Most people today dismiss the concepts as science fiction\n6.44 That sounds like Science Fiction - but its Coming!!  Rising generations will be confronted by these issues\n7.20  It is ok to build AI up to a certain level  (perhaps except for the government for reasons of national defense)\n8.08 Cosmists will be against limits to AI.  Claiming it to be a form of Deicide - An anathema to the cosmists - religiously opposed to upper limits.\n9.39 Awe \n10.35 Racism is fear of difference - tiny difference - though this is nothing compared to the difference between a human and an advanced cyborg or an artilect\n11.22 we may be the last remaining versions of humans, we may have killed other humanoids off in our evolutionary past.  We may have evolved a fear of other species that are intelligent enough to be a perceived as a threat.\n13.20 Another Terran argument is - how is it possible to develop something that is smarter than you?",

    "description": "As a byproduct of accelerating change stuff gets compressed - the STEM Compression hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the 'Transcension Hypothesis') is where Space, Time, Energy & Matter (S.T.E.M.) gets compressed.. and as a result becomes more resilient, and protected from the fluctuations of the environment.  \n\nTechnology will be biologically inspired to overcome limitations of biology - we will merge with technologies, transcend biology.  \nBio: John Smart is a futurist and scholar of accelerating change.

    "description": "John discusses von neumann vs biologically inspired computing architectures - how the science of connectomics & neuroinformatics will help inspire further developments in AI.\n\nHe also discusses the resiliency of collectives of people (citing 'The Rational Optimist' by Matt Ridley).\n\nGame theory is brought up - one of the meta-golden rules that most societies learn is to 'trust, but verify' - where if someone gets caught cheating they get marginalised, not kicked out of the tribe, to see if they change their behaviour, and if they do, then they are slowly accepted back into the tribe - societies that don't do this loose a sense of resiliency, end up with homogenized societies that don't learn - in a sense we want rule breakers that challenge our ideas, to help the game theories mature - to be more resilient to disruption.\n\nGenomics, proteomics and connectomics.\n\nJohn M.

    "description": "Short presentation, 'The Singualrity is Far' at a book launch.\n\nKevin does agree that a Technological Singularity is quite possible.  Summarises I J Goods famous quote on the Intelligence Explosion - \"In other words, AI implies Super AI\".\n\nKorb addresses what he calls 'arrogant optimism', mistaken predictions that people have made in the past with regard to Super AI: \n- The only computer scientist to win a nobel prize  Herbert Simon, 1959 said that AI would be around the corner in 10 years - would be competing for a nobel prize.\n- Alan Turing (founder of both comp sci and AI) said that the turing test would be passedby 2000.\n\nKevin B. Korb says that Kurzweil says that the singularity will happen by 2029, though this is innacurate by 16 years.  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near#2045:_The_Singularity\nI share the position that there have been overly optimistic predictions about the timing of the singularity that have been made in the past (pretty hard not to unless we have not noticed the singularity).  Though I think it is too easy to rely on 'cached' and lineararly inspired ideas, making snap judgements based on intuition.  Technology, on many fronts, is 'increasing' on non-linear timescales, and likely (imho) we will reach tipping points that will have massive scale impacts on society (some of which we have already experienced in our lifetimes: i.e. the internet) - which will increase the likelyhood of a Technological Singularity happening closer and closer.  \nThe point of evangelising the idea, is to help people to understand that the likelihood of a near-term Technological Singularity is enough to warrant serious thought.  Lets hope that the quality of thought can be improved in the next few years around these ideas.\n\n\"Only a crisis, actual or perceived, produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.\" - Milton Freedman\n\nBooks - Evolving Ethics\n\nKevin B. Korb and Ann E. Nicholson,\n\"Bayesian Artificial Intelligence\", 2nd edition, CRC Press, 2010\nwww.csse.monash.edu.au/bai/book\n\nSteven Mascaro, Kevin B. Korb, Ann E.

Kim Stanley Robinson said that this notion is both simplistic and naïve. Mars is not easy. Mars is cold and inhospitable. It is dusty. Dust gets into everything. It has less energy than Earth. While 15% less sunlight might not be detectable with the human eye, generating energy through solar power will require more effort. Terraforming is largely in the realm of Science Fiction, and the question is if we should attempt it in the first place. Is it ethical to modify an environment that may harbour information vital to understanding our origins?",

He suggested that all 400 or so generations of humans since the ice age, all have been working toward a better future for their children. His idea of utopia seems to be a situation in which every person has a satisfactory life and that this can be maintained permanently.

    "description": "What is the Technological Singularity?   Vernor Vinge, who coined the term, speaks about rapid technological change, offloading our intelligence onto the environment, and the awesome potential of Strong Artificial Intelligence which he says will culminate in the Technological Singularity by 2023.\n\n\"Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.\" - \"The Coming Technological Singularity\" by Vernor Vinge, 1993\n\nVernor Vinge popularised and coined the term \"Technological Singularity\" in his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\", in which he argues that the creation of superhuman artificial intelligence will mark the point at which \"the human era will be ended,\" such that no current models of reality are sufficient to predict beyond it.\n\nVinge published his first short story, \"Bookworm, Run!\", in the March 1966 issue of Analog Science Fiction, then edited by John W. Campbell. The story explores the theme of artificially augmented intelligence by connecting the brain directly to computerised data sources. He became a moderately prolific contributor to SF magazines in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1969, he expanded two related stories, (\"The Barbarian Princess\", Analog, 1966 and \"Grimm's Story\", Orbit 4, 1968) into his first novel, Grimm's World. His second novel, The Witling, was published in 1975.\n\nVinge came to prominence in 1981 with his novella True Names, perhaps the first story to present a fully fleshed-out concept of cyberspace, which would later be central to cyberpunk stories by William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and others.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge",

    "description": "Novart - Music 'Matrioshka Brain I' created using ableton live - hope you like it.\r\n\r\nA Matrioshka Brain is a Stellar Engine megastructure which use a star's radiation to power a computational brain.\r\n\"Dyson-sized (or bigger) megastructure giving most efficient processing out-put for energy input; designed to maximize energy use and processing efficiency.\r\n\r\nA Matrioshka brain consists of a series of energy collection units arranged in concentric shells or swarms, so that the waste radiation produced by the inner shell or swarm is utilized by the collectors of the next shell out.\r\n\r\nThe inner swarms receive a high energy flux, while the outer shells are cooler; each layer powers an appropriate recipe of computronium, tailor-made for that operating temperature. Processing elements near the stars could be nearly as hot as the star itself, while the outer layer of the swarm could be nearly as cool as interstellar space. The whole array comprises a highly efficient Dyson swarm with vast processing power.\r\n\r\nIf the outermost shell is very large (many astronomical units in radius), it may radiate at a similar temperature to the Cosmic Microwave Background and be effectively invisible. However this requires a lot of material for the construction of the swarm; in some cases this material is obtained by starlifting (see also Matrioshka Hypernode)..\r\n\r\nThe computational elements of a typcal Matrioshka brain are spread out over a very large volume, comparable in size to a planetary system. For this reason it would take a long time for information to pass from one side of a Matrioshka Brain to the other. This means that the computational speed of a Matrioshka Brain is limited by the speed of light.\r\n\r\nTo reduce this problem and increase the speed of processing in such an object, many Matrioshka Brains use wormholes to connect distant parts of its structure, so that information may pass more rapidly. Only very small Hayward-type wormholes can operate in the midst of a massive swarm of processing units, because of the fact that traversable wormholes require to be surrounded by asymptotically flat space-time. However Hayward wormholes require very large amounts of mass-energy to create.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4847361494ea5\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain\r\n\r\nAlso see Matrioshka Hypernode:\r\nhttp://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/484737879bb05",
