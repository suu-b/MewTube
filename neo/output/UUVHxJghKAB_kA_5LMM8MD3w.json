(ps: i like some of the ideas of a romanticized life, just not all of them :))\n\n**CORRECTION: Bartolomé de Las Casas is Spanish so he is European, making him a bad example of a non-Eurocentric writer and I apologize. He was a Spanish colonist but he actually became famous for his defense of the rights of the Indigenous people of the Americas and called out a lot of the awful atrocities that came from colonialization and slavery. Nonetheless, he was a Spanish colonist and indeed European so I am completely in the wrong for including him in the video and I'm truly sorry.
