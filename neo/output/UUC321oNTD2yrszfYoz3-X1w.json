Gary Habermas is one of the world's leading experts on the Resurrection of Jesus. In this video, we do a deep dive on the common evidences given for reincarnation (e.g., child memories, birthmarks) and offer some additional critiques. We discuss the work of Ian Stevenson, leading researcher and pioneer for scientific reincarnation studies. While there is some interesting evidence for reincarnation, there is another supernatural explanation that accounts for the data, which must be considered.\n\nREAD:  Beyond Death, by Gary Habermas and JP Moreland (https://amzn.to/4bdNDeO)\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [smdcertdisc] for 25% off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://x.com/Sean_McDowell\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sean_mcdowell?lang=en\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: https://seanmcdowell.org",

Just like David, Jesus expresses the deep feeling of abandonment, yet knows the Father is still at work. This isn't a breakdown in the Trinity. It's a fulfillment of prophecy, a window into the emotional and spiritual weight Jesus carried on the cross—for us.\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for 25% off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://x.com/Sean_McDowell\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sean_mcdowell?lang=en\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: @\n\n#JesusOnTheCross\n#Psalm22\n#Trinity\n#SeanMcDowell\n#WhyHaveYouForsakenMe\n#GoodFriday\n#ChristianApologetics\n#BibleTheology\n#Crucifixion\n#JesusQuotesScripture",

Outside the Bible, sources like Tacitus and Pliny the Younger confirm that Christians were targeted—especially in Rome under Nero. They were mocked, hated, even blamed for disasters.

Today, I have fellow Biola professor Dr. Tim Muehlhoff, a communications expert, to explore whether modern Christians are becoming so empathetic that they begin to compromise biblical truth. Are Christians afraid to speak truth for fear of offending others? And how can we balance compassion with conviction? We hope this conversation helps you if you've ever wondered how to love well without losing your grounding. Our goal in this conversation is to work through the debate today so you can have clarity on what is at stake.

All four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, highlight His miracles as a core part of His ministry.\n\nEven Jesus’ opponents didn’t deny the miracles; they only debated their source. For example, in Mark 3, they suggested Satan was behind it, not that the miracles didn’t happen.\n\nSome miracle stories are unlikely inventions, like Jesus spitting and rubbing mud in a blind man’s eyes. If someone was making this up, why choose such an awkward detail?\n\nFinally, Jesus’ miracles fit perfectly with His teaching and life.

It allows you to notice patterns, themes, and repeated ideas, which helps you really own the book.\n\nAfter a month, move on to another book. Read about four chapters a day, or maybe eight.

Hell in the Bible isn’t God setting people on fire, it’s described using metaphors like fire and darkness to represent loss, judgment, and separation from God. The truth is, God’s justice doesn't cancel out His love, it flows from His holiness. These are tough questions, but we can't build theology on emotional analogies.

    "description": "I’ve had a lot of conversations with Christians who hold to either an old earth or young earth view. Personally, I see these as important in-house discussions that shape how we interpret both science and Scripture. What matters most to me is holding to the core truths of the Christian faith.\n\nOld earth and young earth believers often differ on how they understand things like death before the fall—many old earthers, for example, see it as human death that entered after the fall. These views influence how we engage with modern science, but they’re not issues I believe we should divide over. We need grace and clarity as we walk through this together.\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for 25% off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://x.com/Sean_McDowell\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sean_mcdowell?lang=en\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: @\n\n#ChristianWorldview #FaithAndScience\n#TheisticEvolution #CreationDebate\n#BiblicalTruth",

Nowhere does the Bible promise health and wealth just because we ask for it.\n\nGod never promised a life without struggle, but He did promise to be with us in our suffering. The true gospel is about following Christ, even when it means hardship, because we know He is enough.\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for 25% off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://x.com/Sean_McDowell\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sean_mcdowell?lang=en\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: @\n\n#TrueGospel #ProsperityGospel #ChristianFaith #SufferingForChrist #GodsWord #BibleTruth #FaithInAction #ChristianLiving #JesusIsEnough #ChristianHope #falseteaching   #SufferingInChrist #GodsPromises #BibleStudy",

Even though he was the pastor of a thriving church, it seemed as if his entire belief structure was dismantling.

Seeking proof of God’s existence, he found himself in a world of uncertainty, faced with plenty of reasons for both faith and doubt. While Tom never found absolute proof of God or Christianity, he ultimately concluded that the existing evidence for both is compelling and compatible with science. \n\nChasing Proof, Finding Faith (by Tom Rudelius): https://a.co/d/57jyBLd\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for $100 off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sean_McDowell \nTikTok: @sean_mcdowell \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: https://seanmcdowell.org",

There's lots of concise answers to objections about equal rights, discrimination, being born a certain way, and the charge that people who disagree are homophobic or transphobic. Dr. Turek’s message is direct but respectful—correct, not politically correct. It is a message we must not ignore.\n\nREAD: Correct, Not Politically Correct: About Same-Sex Marriage and Transgenderism: https://a.co/d/0u9Dhj9\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for $100 off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sean_McDowell \nTikTok: @sean_mcdowell \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: https://seanmcdowell.org",

    "description": "Tom Rudelius was immersed in his physics studies at Cornell and never thought much about God until his brother, a new convert to Christianity, challenged him to explore faith. He had science and an Ivy League pedigree—why did he need God? He reluctantly began exploring the Bible and the life of Jesus. Seeking proof of God’s existence, he found himself in a world of uncertainty, faced with plenty of reasons for both faith and doubt. While Tom never found absolute proof of God or Christianity, he ultimately concluded that the existing evidence for both is compelling and compatible with science. \n\nChasing Proof, Finding Faith (by Tom Rudelius): https://a.co/d/57jyBLd\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for $100 off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sean_McDowell \nTikTok: @sean_mcdowell \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/\nWebsite: https://seanmcdowell.org",

    "description": "\"Who touched me?\" If Jesus is God, why does He ask questions? Couple things to note:\n\n1. Asking a question doesn't imply you don't know the answer.\n\nAs a teacher and a parent, I ask my kids and students a lot of questions not because I don't know the answer but because I want them to learn something. \n\n2. Jesus often asks questions to draw out the faith of others. \n\nSo what was Jesus maybe doing in the circumstance of the bleeding woman (Luke 8:43-48)? \n\nHe was drawing out her faith: \n47 And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. 48 And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.”\n\nThen when healed, she could be an example to others of the goodness and identity of Jesus. \n\n⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️\n\nMake sure to subscribe and check out some of my other videos for more on Christianity, Theology and other aspects of culture! \n\nREAD: A Rebel's Manifesto, by Sean McDowell (https://amzn.to/3QYgpml)\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for $100 off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sean_McDowell \nTikTok: @sean_mcdowell \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/",

However, Jesus is not just a human being. He is the eternal, perfect, all-knowing, self-existing God who took on human flesh!\n\nWhen we see a mountain, we should be in awe of its beauty. Likewise, when we see the eternal God in human flesh, we should prioritize this relationship. \n\nThe amazing thing is when we love God first through the Person of Jesus, we are actually in a better position to love other people around us because we won’t idolize them. \n\n⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️\n\nMake sure to subscribe and check out some of my other videos for more on Christianity, Theology and other aspects of culture! \n\nREAD: A Rebel's Manifesto, by Sean McDowell (https://amzn.to/3QYgpml)\n\n*Get a MASTERS IN APOLOGETICS or SCIENCE AND RELIGION at BIOLA (https://bit.ly/3LdNqKf)\n\n*USE Discount Code [SMDCERTDISC] for $100 off the BIOLA APOLOGETICS CERTIFICATE program (https://bit.ly/3AzfPFM)\n\n*See our fully online UNDERGRAD DEGREE in Bible, Theology, and Apologetics: (https://bit.ly/448STKK)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sean_McDowell \nTikTok: @sean_mcdowell \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/seanmcdowell/",

I'm joined by Doug Groothuis who is a Christian theologian, philosopher, and author who has a Ph.D. in philosophy. He has taught at Denver Seminary in Colorado and has written extensively on topics related to apologetics, theology, and philosophy. Some of his books include \"Unmasking the New Age,\" \"Christian Apologetics: A Comprehensive Case for Biblical Faith,\" and \"On Jesus.\" He is also a speaker and has spoken at conferences and events on topics related to faith and apologetics. We discuss topics from the problem of evil and suffering, to the death and resurrection of Jesus, I'll be addressing these objections head on and offering some helpful responses and perspective.
