It's a pattern you'll find in most non-fiction books. In my master's thesis (social history), I would start every chapter with a little historical anecdote or focus on one person's daily activities, switching from the micro and the macro really makes the essay coherent and engaging. \n-I'll say it again but structure/narrative is everything. Reading a good essay should feel like someone is holding your hand from start to finish. What I think is challenging is to find a balance between being technical, making complex points and remaining accessible and fun/not condescending. That's why we all love Contrapoints. \n-Don't just read for information. Pay attention at the way the essayist, author articulates ideas. Get used to recognize the rhetorical tools mobilized, how ideas are structured, how people write in your field of study. Copy the masters and add your own twist to it :)\n-In video essays (it's not very common in traditional essays), I find that open questions can be useful both as transitions (end part 1 with question, suspens, answer in beginning of part 2) but also as a way to subtly share your opinion or nuance the opinion of others.\n\nRessources on Ukraine 🇺🇦\nMapping the invasion: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/24/maps-ukraine-russia-attack/\nWhat You Need to Know: https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2022/01/20/russia-ukraine-tensions-what-you-need-know/\nhttps://kyivindependent.com\nJohnny Harris' take on the war: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ4hvLqNfqo\nAfrican students are stuck in Ukraine: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/more-racism-at-ukrainian-borders\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-protest-information-new-york\nYou can quickly find the protests organized in your country through a Google search.\nWhere to Help: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/27/how-to-help-ukraine/\n(a lot of washington post but at least it's a trustworthy source, there've been way too many scams, way too much money put into the wrong hands)\n\nMUSIC 🎶\n\nBrooks - Chlorine '83 - https://thmatc.co/?l=C8AAB78C\nMark Generous - Traces - https://thmatc.co/?l=6C1B9932\nSingto Conley - Leave Me Be - https://thmatc.co/?l=39A90C25\nGil Wanders - Lately - https://thmatc.co/?l=00EA8C63\nRyan Little - eye flows. - https://thmatc.co/?l=5BA5FFA0\n\nSOCIALS 👩‍💻\nStorygraph: @alicecappelle\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/aliceoverall/\nEnquiries: alice.cappelleyt@gmail.com",
