    "description": "❗Watch the previous entry in this saga here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTGIO9_QqGg\n\nWhite Fragility is the most popular representation of critical race theory. Written by PhD Robin Diangelo, the book acts as a manual by white people for white people; outlining methods and personal anecdotes about combatting racism.\n\nDiangelo delivers talks to audiences predominantly consisting of white people, and her book is read by, again, predominantly white people. However, did anybody stop and think what an actual black person thought?\nHi, I'm actual black person, embarked on an adventure investigating this cultural phenomenon that has now enjoyed over 100 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nIs White Fragility a museum - filled with interesting, invigorating artefacts wall to wall? Or is it a sausage?

    "description": "❗ Watch The Final Part Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU0fwYr_gME\n\nThough originally published in 2018, Robin Diangelo’s White Fragility is currently experiencing a - het-hem - second spike.. From being number 1 on Amazon, to its author appearing on Jimmy Fallon (which is about as mainstream as you can get) it’s self evidently a viral cultural phenomenon… amongst white people. Which, self admitted by Diangelo, is the book’s target demographic...\n\nBUT did anybody consider what actual black people thought? Hi, I’m actual black people, and today we’ll be continuing our investigation into the world of White Fragility.\n\nToday we’re well and truly in there like swimwear, covering Chapters 1 - 3. We cover Robin’s presuppositions on race, including the idea of it merely being a social construct, racism being an omnipresent force and the credence of “race science.\" We also shed light on what White Fragility gets right, because grey is an under-utilised colour.\n\nCall this a review of sorts; a critique, a commentary, a response, a discussion, a debunk, SYNONYMS. Does White Fragility stand up to scrutiny, or is it postmodern critical race theory bla bla? Well, unlike the cover of white Fragility, perhaps it’s not so… black and white. “Wow, I love a good pun,” says the crowd.\n\nHere is… White Fragility: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:10 The Bad\n22:56 The Good/Interesting\n\n🔎  Watch my preliminary thoughts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sFdi5iZJ5Q\n\nWatch the next episode in the series: [TBD]\n\n❗ Subscribe! http://youtube.com/laytonontoast?sub_confirmation=1\n\n----------------------\n\n🐦 Twitter: @Laytonicles www.twitter.com/laytonicles\n📸 Instagram: @laytonicles_  www.instagram.com/laytonchronicles\n☕ Ko-Fi: www.ko-fi.com/laytonicles\n👐🏾 Cash App: £Laytonicles\n\n🎬 Other videos:\n\nyoutuber loses mind for 4 minutes straight but in 4K: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q1Mqs0Ss20\n\nMANDY - a film about unrequited love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxOZIs_p9Ds\n\nWhat They Don't Tell You About L O V E | Misconceptions About Love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhjDR2PZEWk\n\nLaytonChronicles and LaytononToast Era Videos (playlist always available) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmY6uKqMZl5Ab2wQD_OLT1JYHFjlJ3PI7\n\n----------------------\n\n#laytonicles #whitefragility",

The book's author, Robin Diangelo, has been invited to join Jimmy Fallon, as well as countless others, to discuss her book, which, self admittedly, is aimed at a white audience. HOWEVER, did anybody stop to consider what actual black people thought?\nHi, I'm actual black people, and today we'll be beginning our investigation into the ideas, themes and convictions of White Fragility, hopefully in a light and humourous (cringe) way. Call it a review of sorts; a critique, a commentary, a reaction, a discussion. Are all white people racist? Or is white fragility a kafta-trap? How can you (YOU) be less racist?
