    "description": "I discuss a new kind of fine-tuning argument for God's existence with Dr. Robin Collins, professor of philosophy at Messiah University, one centered on the remarkable ability of human beings to discover the universe around us. Were the constants of physics altered in the smallest way, our capacity to understand the universe, our very ability to do science in the first place, would be remarkable diminished, if not irradicated entirely. Why, then, do the laws of physics take on these delicately balanced values that allow us to discover scientific truths? With Collins as my interlocutor, I take the chance to press objections that Neil Manson raised in our previous interview - philosophy in real time!\n\nFor more information about Robin, as well as a list of his publications, please see: https://www.messiah.edu/homepage/1662/robin_collins",

    "title": "Debating a Professor on the Fine-Tuning Argument for God | #1 Dr. Neil Manson",
    "description": "In my first ever interview for this channel, I discuss and debate the fine-tuning argument with philosopher Neil Manson, a professor at the University of Mississippi. We discuss several lesser examined issues with the fine-tuning argument: how we could ever know what kind of universe God would likely create, theistic versus naturalistic multiverses, and whether, in the end, fine-tuning gives us any reason to think that God exists.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n\nAn online repository of Neil Manson's publications: https://philosophy.olemiss.edu/neil-a-manson/.",

    "title": "Is God the Ultimate Fictional Character?",
    "description": "In this (very loosely connected) response to one interpretation of Jordan Peterson's views about religion, I examine the reasons for and against religious fictionalism, the proposal that religious discourse, far from being about an objective reality 'out there,' is actually just an exercise in fiction - but that doesn't mean we should abandon religion, because partaking in the fiction yields great benefits for our lives. So says fictionalism, anyway. I ultimately reject this view in favor of religious realism.

    "title": "Cosmic Fine-Tuning: God or a Multiverse?",
    "description": "The fine-tuning argument is the claim that various features of the laws of physics are best explained by the hypothesis of a cosmic designer. I, first, explain what physicists mean by \"fine-tuning\" in this context, and second, explore four possible explanations for this remarkable scientific discovery: appeal to chance, a multiverse, an underlying theory of future physics, and a cosmic designer. Rather than arguing for any particular answer, I survey of few problems and prospects for each.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT PAPER EVER WRITTEN ON FINE-TUNING\n\n\"Divine Psychology and Cosmic Fine-tuning,\" available for free at https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/religious-studies/article/divine-psychology-and-cosmic-finetuning/B137A39544971A6D275F48F52C2D2918\n\nCREDITS\n\nRadio b-roll video by Anthony from https://www.pexels.com/video/an-old-component-sound-system-2000539/\n\nPop 1 sound by theplax from https://freesound.org/s/545201/ License: Attribution 4.0\n\nExplosion video b-roll by Luis Humanoide from https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=video&utm_content=159088\n\nBell sound effect by floraphonic from https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=211683\n\nMultiverse b-roll video by Maksym Vystoropskyi from https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=video&utm_content=187285\n\nBrain b-roll video by Tiago Levi from https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=video&utm_content=206173\n\nCosmic scene b-roll video Tomislav Jakupec from https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=video&utm_content=6044\n\nOutro music by Khanal from https://pixabay.com/music//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=110235",
