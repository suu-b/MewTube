    "description": "Get Viggo's top 10 language-learning tips here  👉🏼 https://l.storylearning.com/viggos-language-tips\n\nViggo Mortensen is so good at languages, he once scared people half to death at a London pub  when they thought he was a notorious Russian mobster. He’s done at least eight languages in movies, But he never just learns his lines. He throws himself in head-first until he becomes Russian, or Spanish, or Arabic. But what’s really crazy is how fluent he is off-camera, too. He switches between languages like it’s nothing. And the reason he sounds so real is because he takes risks most learners wouldn’t dare to. If you’ve ever felt shy about speaking another language, Viggo’s story will show you why being fearless matters way more than talent.\n\nGet a 7-day FREE trial to one of my story-based language courses 👉🏼 https://storylearning.com/language-courses\n\nCheck out my all-inclusive VIP language program with guaranteed results 👉🏼 https://storylearning.com/vip\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/vD8P9dprGww?si=vgRSokovGHdZcCmr\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/AcgdHC4t1kg?si=K_m54FeTJwf3c4XM\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/GRNCW-3jhnA?si=3thevurbXTCUqA9P\nhttps://youtu.be/OGXDXB9qses?si=duAjkGCFIZYa6v7r&t=155\nhttps://youtu.be/_nxRvt5Rjx8?si=ninc18FndFiNQ1SW&t=294\nhttps://youtu.be/hyKWsGDn_EU?si=3CigE2oDDU5Ht_2Q\nhttps://youtu.be/2icBVH56mQg?si=gs9mK-TsDVq7Pq16&t=4\nhttps://youtu.be/QpsyW1Dq37Q?si=cC7KtEiy_Str6umb&t=17\nhttps://youtu.be/sIwXCoMtq3c?si=eoOvjX6H8l0EZBmc\nhttps://youtu.be/U70pvItmdc4?si=D7piLkyGGOdwwWto&t=39\nhttps://youtu.be/SwhnYp7Ua3U?si=vdj9QGAaxgc3G_UO&t=76\nhttps://youtu.be/kMUCXQigvUc?si=C8cbcOpJ81pQnp_X&t=22\nhttps://youtu.be/BTGISI_Z0-c?si=O3rDV-fYGXZKpQIG\nhttps://youtu.be/CaW2Zd4C_QA?si=YomQVIAEdBmTyBiF&t=85\nhttps://youtu.be/cRBQptIW1ww?si=ZncI0R76p7Ef7nu9&t=6\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/Vl7co1S1uRo?si=l6m1S9eahiluvTTW\nhttps://youtu.be/dMQJ2o46i88?si=7dDrtv8FAwUB5htd&t=76\nhttps://youtu.be/Wn0PPjf5caU?si=nU-BIHGx_jebvm_j&t=98\nhttps://youtu.be/GE3Ux2on5B0?si=buEx2CXeB9BRg34o&t=767\nhttps://youtu.be/TQra-kMeXPQ?si=TvcXBmEPc1iRgS0z&t=26\nhttps://youtu.be/GE3Ux2on5B0?si=drQEG-Be5KSpT-zi&t=696\nhttps://youtu.be/h2oyRIDF02k?si=dUfD1_vBeetMZKqR&t=49\nhttps://youtu.be/TQra-kMeXPQ?si=_FmFjbb5kfM3XaPZ&t=76\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@diariara/video/7498686748482997526\nhttps://youtu.be/IG8AxHEU0nQ?si=ACsja9IMit7UdsMW&t=155\nhttps://youtu.be/y56uDVzdtPo?si=HKpBmjA1aTbluJWN&t=57\nhttps://youtu.be/gAhz9OnL8Ps?si=SDuFbHyvgjUMB7Is&t=90\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/CNpqBtsZx2Y?si=SnY0usy3McC4SIs3\nhttps://youtu.be/yUppcg0Auxg?si=0Yv3shW4WstEN_oo&t=54\nhttps://youtu.be/6FITl--41fY?si=v52Pw7AjlYF_5cZy&t=147\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/K05uUvycErc?si=B1E4M5pwaKcF-AWI\nhttps://youtu.be/218su1JOC-Q?si=dfoQZv9__a0ixpHb&t=53\n\n#StoryLearning #LearnThroughStories",

    "description": "Get my exact blueprint for learning ANY language faster https://bit.ly/freeSLblueprint_angry\n\nClose your eyes and picture a movie villain. What language or accent are they speaking? Well, I have news for you. Hollywood’s been playing the same trick on all of us for decades! They didn’t just give us bad guys. They gave them a sound.

    "description": "https://bit.ly/freeslkit_fflfast 🇫🇷 📯 🪓 Each year, thousands of men from all over the world join the French Foreign Legion (Légion étrangère). Most come for adventure. Some for a better life. Many to earn a French passport.\n\nBut no matter their reason for enroling, ALL candidates must accomplish one key thing by the end of basic training if they want to receive any of the Légionnaire perks: learning enough French to function as a soldier!\n\nIt turns out that most of these men arrive at the recruitment center in France unable to speak a lick of French, and yet manage to get fluent enough in mere months to understand orders, describe the workings of their HK416F service rifle, and have conversations with fellow Légionnaires.\n\nSo how do they learn so fast? And what can we non-Légionnaires learn from their method?

    "description": "Learn a language faster with my FREE StoryLearning Fluency Blueprint 👉🏼 https://l.storylearning.com/free_SL_fluency-blueprint\n\nUnited States Military Linguists are known for being among the fastest language learners in the world. But speed is certainly not the only goal. From gathering critical intelligence to supporting troops on the frontlines, a lot rests on the language skills of linguists in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nSo how do linguists in the U.S. Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and Navy learn the language skills they need to do their jobs? That is precisely what I wanted to find out, so I reached out to two graduates of the Defense Language Institute (DLI) in Monterey, California: Elle and Jack.\n\nThis video details the incredibly intense programmes these service members complete, including interesting techniques like “iso-immersion” and “scream & scribble”. While only a select few can attend DLI, there are some powerful principles in this video that ALL language learners can apply. Hooah!\n\n📖 LEARN A LANGUAGE THROUGH THE POWER OF STORY\nIf training at DLI isn't in the cards for you, don't despair!

    "title": "How Can I Prepare To Travel Abroad In 1 Month?",
    "description": "In this LIVE recording of the I Will Teach You A Language podcast, I answer @Kay Koopmans' question about how to prepare for moving abroad when you only have a month and don't yet speak any of the local language!\n\nIt's important to note that there's a big difference between learning enough language to survive in a short period of time, and developing high levels of fluency in the long-term. In today's video, I am focusing on the former (but understand that my advice differs significantly for the latter, as covered extensively in my other videos).\n\n❓HAVE A QUESTION?\n\nHave a question you'd like answered on YouTube or the podcast? Leave me a voice message here:\nhttp://iwillteachyoualanguage.com/ask\n\n💡 MY TIPS:\n\nSo if you are an absolute beginner, have only 1 month to prepare, and want to hit the ground running when you arrive abroad, here are the 4 things I recommend doing:\n\n① Get a good travel-focused textbook.\n\nTextbooks get a bad rap in the polyglot world, but they can be useful for absolute beginners since someone has already gone to the trouble of putting together the most useful words, grammar, etc.\nGet one focused on travel and daily situations and that has dialogues with audio recordings.\n\n② Focus on listening skills.\n\nDon’t just memorize things to say. You need to be able to actually understand things said back to you. So practice listening to the dialogues in your textbook over and over until you understand them easily.\n\n③ Memorize useful words and phrases.\n\nPick out the most useful words and phrases from your textbook, and commit them to memory. Use whatever method works for you, may it be Anki, paper flashcards, etc.\n\n④ Get daily speaking practice.\n\nGo on iTalki (https://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/italkidirect) or a similar tutoring site and schedule DAILY speaking practice. Do role plays for daily situations. Send your tutor the page or chapter from your textbook on that topic ahead of time.\n\n📚 RESOURCES MENTIONED:\n\niTalki:\nhttps://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/italkidirect)\n\nAnki spaced repetition flashcards:\nhttps://apps.ankiweb.net\n\nMy StoryLearning® courses:\nhttps://iwillteachyoualanguage.com/language-courses-select-your-language\n\n⏱TIMESTAMPS:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:26 - Tip #1: Get a good travel-focused textbook\n3:55 - Tip #2: Focus on listening skills\n5:24 - Tip #3: Memorize useful words and phrases\n6:44 - Tip #4: Get daily speaking practice\n8:54 - Recap of the 4 steps\n13:40 - Live Q & A",

Sergi is the creator of the popular SergiMartinSpanish YouTube channel, which has over 150 videos and 122,000 subscribers!

Here's what she said:\n\n\"I know this is a challenging subject to broach, since Spanish is deeply gendered, but might Olly make a video or conduct a live talk addressing the invisiblization of non-binary transgendered folks by these binary-gendered pronouns and endings, and the movement to make Spanish more inclusive?\"\n\nAs Liana says, one of the features of romance languages is that every single noun and verb is either based on, or changes with, gender, and that makes these languages rather inflexible when it comes to a fast-developing society around it!\n\nIt's a vital subject, but I'll also admit that it's outside my area of expertise, so I needed to do some brushing up myself!\n\nSo, I decided to ask my friend, Sofía, a native Spanish-speaking writer and journalist to help me out. And she did just that!\n\nSofía has created this fantastic video all about lenguaje inclusivo in Spanish. I hope you'll find it both enlightening and enjoyable!\n\nIn the video you'll learn:\n- What lenguaje inclusivo is\n- How to use it when you speak Spanish\n\nMy name is Olly Richards, and on this channel I document my experiments in foreign language acquisition:\n\n• Rapid language learning\n• Writing Chinese characters\n• Languages and travel...on location!\n• Daily study routines\n• Advanced level tactics\n\nTo see some of my previous experiments, why not try...\n\n• Learn Thai in 14 Days:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQJscr8iS4eEA0CRSgEhNJ6sM0p-Y2Im2\n\n• Learn To Write Chinese (Traditional Characters)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQJscr8iS4eHCMT-LknqViItNhH80tKTV\n\n• Daily Study Routines and Schedules\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZVhhQM5M0E\n\nIf you're interested in becoming a better language learner, and discovering the secrets to learning languages quickly, be sure to check out my podcast:\nhttps://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/podcast-home/",

It was amazing to finally find others who shared a passion for languages like me. \n\nOver the years though, I watched less and less of this stuff. I guess there comes a point where you’ve heard it all before. \n\nRecently, though, there’s a guy who I’ve been paying close attention to. He’s young, but very articulate, and has developed an impressively complete view of language learning:\n\nMatt vs Japan is all about Japanese, but I wanted to talk to him about language learning in general, and so I sat him down and plied him with questions. \n\nThis is one of the best interviews I’ve done for a while, so I hope you enjoy.

    "description": "https://bit.ly/freeslkit_learn-language-fast ⬇️ GET MY FREE STORYLEARNING® KIT:\nDiscover how to learn any foreign language faster through the power of story with my free StoryLearning® Kit 👉🏼 https://bit.ly/freeslkit_learn-language-fast \n\nCharlotte asks: “What’s your opinion on removing English from flashcards altogether?\n\nFull Transcript: (http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/monolingual-flashcards/)\n\nEpisode Summary:\n - Arguments for having flashcards entirely in the target language:\n - Avoid translation\n - Learn to think in the target language\n - Increased exposure to target language\n - “Learn like a child”\n\nArguments for having pictures on your flashcards:\n - Visual memory is stronger than auditory memory\n - Wyner: “It’s much easier to learn a word off of a picture card you’ve made yourself than off of a translation card you downloaded in someone else’s deck.” = false equivalence\n\nMy response to this:\n - Translation is inevitable, and also very useful! (The more languages I acquire, the more I use contrastive analysis to learn faster.)\n - Parallels with learning like children are misguided – we’re not children, we have study skills\n - Flashcards entirely in the target language are soon “learnt”, thereby negating the benefit of any increased exposure.\n - Visuals are helpful, but are so time consuming as to make the creation of flashcards a burden.\n - Elaborate systems for flashcards misunderstand the purpose of SRS as a learning tool. Setting up flashcards with pictures and peripheral info in the target language, in an attempt to make them a kind of learning tool is not only highly inefficient, but also deprives you of time spent with the whole language\n\nMy thoughts on a smart approach to using flashcards:\n - Flashcards are for practising output, not input\nIn other words, flashcards are for practising the recall of stuff you’ve already learnt\n - The role of English in the flashcards is as a prompt – your task is then to recall the word or phrase in the target language.\n - Images are indeed powerful, but are best created in your mind (i.e. mnemonics)\n - It’s vital for flashcards not to become burdensome – Keep it simple!\n - The potential for memory exists firmly within your mind – the extent to which you employ your brainpower and imagination when you attempt to learn new vocabulary determines how well you remember it.\n - To that extent – the spaced repetition build into flashcards offers you an opportunity to reinforce the associations you have already made, rather than the source of learning itself.\n\nResources Mentioned In Today’s Episode:\n\nYour FREE Bulletproof Memory email course\n(http://iwillteachyoualanguage.com/freememorycourse)\n\nRelated episodes:\nIWTYAL 082: The truth about flashcards \n(http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/flashcards-for-language-learning/)\nIWTYAL 090: Audio with flashcards\n(http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/audio-with-flashcards/)\n\nStart Speaking Today:\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

Compare: Good Morning / おはようございます\n - There’s no shortcut to doing this – it’s a long, gradual process\n - If you want to express yourself like a Russian, you need to spend a lot of time with Russian – listening, reading, speaking\n - The process you need to practise is how to take an idea, and construct a sentence the way a Russian would. In order to achieve this, any exercise that helps you slow down the process and get feedback on your efforts can be helpful.\n\nTry:\n1. Reverse translation (see below)\n2. Your teacher can ask you: “How do you say ___ in Russian?” and then correct you\n3. Talk to yourself in Russian as you walk around the house\n4. But ultimately, a lot of listening and reading is the best policy!\n\nResources Mentioned In Today’s Episode:\n\nRussian Short Stories for Beginners – Olly Richards & Alex Rawlings\n(http://amzn.to/2p7lP4H)\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VXmDiBfzwA)\n\nStart Speaking Today:\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

How can I stop this?”\n\nFull Transcript: (http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/pretend-to-understand/)\n\nEpisode Summary:\n - Is it normal to pretend you understand?\n - Every language learning journey starts like this\n - Persistence is the name of the game\n\nIn terms of stages, here’s how I see it:\n - Lower level: You still have a lot to learn, so don’t be surprised if you don’t understand. Keep studying. Have conversations with sympathetic listeners.\n\n - Higher level: This is the stage where you need to get used to the vocabulary of everyday life, especially if you’ve been in “study mode” for a long time. Speak as much as possible, and focus on the situation/conversation, not the language. Record your conversations and analyse them later.\n\nRemember:\n - You don’t need to understand everything\n - Keeping the conversation going is key\n - Make general points\n - Tell stories\n - Ask questions\n \nResources Mentioned In Today’s Episode:\n - Core Study Sequences: Listening Comprehension\n(http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/core-study-sequences-listening-comprehension/)\n\nStart Speaking Today:\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

A rough total is around 5 hours study + 3 hours speaking\n3. Add on top of that watching TV, reading books, going out etc\n4.

Sometimes, I’ll come across a sentence that’s grammatically different and I’ll need to translate it in my head in order to make sense of it. This dies away over time, as I improve.\n\nKey points:\n - Spend more time listening and reading\n - Grow your vocabulary\n - Start using monolingual dictionaries\n - Do more of your daily activities in French\n\nSome deeper approaches to studying:\n - When you learn new grammar, focus on grammar patterns, not individual verbs\n - With these new grammar patterns, try to get into the head of a native speaker, and feel the way an idea is being expressed – the attitude or feeling – rather than focus on the English translation\n - Work with full sentences in your study, not single words\n\nToday’s Quote:\n“You don’t learn a language, you get used to it.” – Katsumoto\n\nStart speaking today:\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

There’s no such thing as the ideal, or best, language learning environment\n\n2. Learning to speak a language is heavily linked to affective factors – your feelings and how you react to the environment around you\n\n3. You can be very analytical, and conclude that complete immersion after a minimum of study is the “most efficient way”… but only if you’re happy in that environment\n\n4. When I look back on my language learning story, my success has been heavily linked to my environment (e.g. Spanish friends in London vs isolation in Japan)\n\n5. The question I ask myself most when I learn languages now is: “How does this language make sense in the context of the lifestyle that I enjoy?” (e.g. In Hong Kong I didn’t have great working conditions, so my language learning suffered as a result)\n\n6. If your French is still low-level, you still have a lot of work to do. You can do this naturally through speaking with people, or you can do it through formal study (or some combination of the two)\n\n7. Isolating yourself in rural France is a big gamble, where you and your personality will determine whether you succeed or not\n\n8. The question is not: “Is this the best way?” The question should be: “Is this the best way for me?“\n\n9. I don’t know what your commitment to staying in France is, but don’t be afraid to follow the path that makes you happier – life is about more than language learning\n\n10. In your specific situation, I would accept the reality that interacting socially is hard, and seek out a language partner or tutor (e.g. iTalki) who can help you get dedicated practice and build up your confidence\n\n11. It might seem perverse to pay someone to help you while you’re in France, but it might be a smart move.\n\nToday’s Quote:\n\"I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.\"\n– Hermann Hesse\n\nStart speaking today!\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

Every language has it’s convention as to when and where you should speak formally or informally\n2. I’ve found myself resisting speaking formally in other languages, and I’ve always been curious why that is\n3. What I’ve learnt is that my “default” is informal, because that’s the way we speak English\n4. Once you understand the cultural significance of formal and informal speech in the language you’re learning, it will make your decision much easier\n\nJapanese:\n - Ultra polite: omeshi-agari ni narimasen ka\n - Polite: meshi-agarimasen ka OR taberaremasen ka\n - Normal: tabemasu ka\n - Informal: taberu?\n\nSpanish:\n - Tú is standard in most places for speaking to someone your age or below\n - But in Colombia, Usted is used within the family, as a cultural mark of respect and affection\n\nFrench:\n - “Je peux vous tutoyer?”\n \nThe problem in your case may be that you’re not using Turkish enough to develop a gut feel for what is appropriate…\n - Once you’re using the language regularly, you’ll get it!\n - Remember that speaking politely, but with a warm smile, can be extremely endearing and doesn’t have to be stiff\n - Watch TV and movies and pay attention just to that\n - A good rule of thumb is to use the polite form\n - But it never really matters… you get a free pass as a foreigner!\n\nQuote Of The Day:\n\n\"Be polite; write diplomatically; even in a declaration of war one observes the rules of politeness.\"\n-Otto von Bismarck\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show.\n iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

How can I grow my vocabulary?”\n\nIn this episode:\n1. There’s no quick solution – you have a large amount of vocabulary to learn, and that takes time\n2. Firstly, make sure you can read Russian. It’s not too hard, and not being able to read is a handicap\n3. “I can’t read books or read articles” – maybe not, but you can find material that’s graded\n\nTools that can help you read…\n1. LingQ\n2. ReadLang\n3. My book of short stories in Russian \n(http://amzn.to/2jeDLrF)\n\nAlso…\n - Find speaking partners and use Russian socially – in Japan, speaking with others as much as possible was how I grappled upward to fluency\n - Don’t ignore the option of taking classes – it can be a good, systematic way to improve\n - Avoid using prepared lists or flashcard decks\n\nOverall:\n - The principle is to grow your vocabulary using material you enjoy. Why? Because by staying motivated, you’ll ultimately get more exposure.\n - Try to enjoy the “struggle” — it’s your best friend!\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n1. LingQ.com \n(http://iwillteachyoualanguage.com/lingq)\n2. ReadLang.com \n(http://readlang.com/)\n3.

Speaking on a regular basis\n2. Flashcard review of vocabulary\n3. Study time\n\nIn my study time, I tend to do one thing over and over, until I get bored.\n\n - I wonder why you’re asking this question?\n - You should know deep down if the activity you’re doing is productive or not\n - If you feel it’s productive, keep going!\n - You will certainly lose motivation to do it sooner or later… wait till that time! (For me it’s usually 3 weeks)\n - If you feel it’s not productive, stop immediately and try something else\n - Try to avoid FOMO – providing you’re speaking, learning vocabulary, and doing other holistic activities, you won’t be missing out on anything!\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n“Sprints” – My 3-week approach to studying language material\n(http://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/how-to-get-s-done/)\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

However, this is an indictment of the education system more than anything\n - It is possible to teach children many languages at the same time\n - It’s always good to follow the child’s interests, but since children change their tastes so frequently, I would pick the language you want him/her to learn, and focus on that over the long-term\n\nThe ideal scenario is as follows:\n - Set aside one hour a day for the language\n - If possible, bring in an au-pair or nanny to interact with the child for that time (“One Person One Language”)\n - If that is not possible, learn the language yourself, and teach him/her as you go\n - Use the same teaching methods you would use in your mother tongue – songs, games, cartoons\n - Be VERY patient, and don’t expect quick results\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n - Tetsu Yung on the Actual Fluency Podcast – raising multilingual children (http://actualfluency.com/afp-s3e15-tetsu-yung-raising-multilingual-children/0\n\n - Olly Richards’ Fluency Mastermind – join the FREE Facebook group!

Talking to people on the street is neither easy nor productive. Create dedicated opportunities to speak: \nConversationExchange.com, MyLanguageExchange.com\n\n2.  Learning local vocabulary for daily life is the biggest benefit to living abroad: Use flashcards to store what you learn\n\n3. Keep an ongoing record of phrases you want to use, and ask someone later (again, I use flashcards for this)\n\n4. You only need a couple of good friends to create a perfect learning environment – go out as much as possible\n\n5. Use commuting time for study\n\n6. Use all dead time for revision\n\n7. Don’t stop studying!\n\n8. Look for ways to involve yourself in the language – I’m creating my own materials\n\nResources Mentioned in This Episode:\n - ConversationExchange.com\n(http://conversationexchange.com/MyLanguageExchange.com)\n - MyLanguageExchange.com\n(http://mylanguageexchange.com/)\n\nToday’s quote:\n\"A wise man will create more opportunities than he finds\"\n - Francis Bacon\n\nStart speaking today\n\nI’d like to thank iTalki for supporting the show. iTalki is the best place online to connect with affordable and effective native speakers teachers and tutors.

My last two languages were Japanese and Cantonese, both of which were equally challenging.\n\nThe one genuinely difficult area of Arabic, though, is grammar. Learning Arabic grammar is a huge task, and one that takes many years to perfect, proving too much even for native speakers.\n\nHowever, I don't let this problem hold me back, because *speaking* is my main priority, and I'm able to communicate perfectly well even with occasionally inaccurate grammar. \n\nOlly speaking Japanese:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv09DoKrJPQ\n\nOlly speaking Cantonese:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QRVpNbNzK8\n\nCheck out this interview with me filmed in the streets of Cairo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5slVHy2JmcQ\n\nHow to learn the Arabic alphabet in 28 minutes:\nhttps://youtu.be/uDXQztbFx-4?list=PLQJscr8iS4eHs416LKWnBBMknvEdsLYss\n\nArabic resource page:\nhttp://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/resources/arabic-language-resource-page/\n\nVisit the blog:\nhttp://iwillteachyoualanguage.com",

Do you always find it hard to make time to study? \n\nMe too. \n\nIn this video I'm going to lift the lid on a typical day, and let you look over my shoulder as I study languages in all kinds of different places over the course of 24 hours. \n\nThere are eight \"techniques\" in the video. The point here is not to show you any groundbreaking new language learning techniques - in fact you'll notice that all of these are pretty simple!\n\nThe point is to demonstrate just what's possible if you use a variety of techniques and mediums.\n\nIf you're busy (and who isn't!), you probably find it hard to sit down and study for a whole hour in the evening. \n\nStudying regularly throughout the day is the solution for this. Use the 5, 10 or 15-minute blocks that inevitably crop up during the course of a day to get a short \"language fix\"!\n\n15 minutes might not sound like a lot, but they really start to add up over the course of a week, month and year. Also, many language learners find that studying regularly is more effective than studying in a single block, because your brain gets used to jumping back into gear at short notice!\n\nTechniques and resources mentioned in this video:\n\n1. Listening to music\nSpotify - http://spotify.com\nYoutube - http://youtube.com\n\n2. Flashcard apps\nFlashcards Deluxe - http://flashcardsdeluxe.com\n\n3. Listening to dialogues\nGlossika Mass Sentences - http://iwillteachyoualanguage.com/glossika\n\n4. Self-talk\nOnly need yourself!\n\n5. Instant messaging\nhttp://lang-8.com\nhttp://hellotalk.com\n\n6. Speaking sessions with a tutor or language partner\nhttp://iwillteachyoualanguage.com/italki\n\n7. Foreign language TV!\nhttp://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/watching-movies-for-language-learning/\n\n8.

But do you have a proper system for actually learning all the stuff you put in your notebooks?\n\nThis video shows you my system for dealing with large amounts of vocabulary that you simply can't learn.\n\nIt's all about taking control of your learning. You don't need to learn every word that you ever hear. In fact, learning a small number of genuinely useful words in your target language can make a huge difference to your ability to speak it.\n\nHowever, we typically end up sabotaging our learning by trying to take on too much...and not learning anything as a result! \n\nFor more on using flashcards to memorise vocabulary, see this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkddc5gubf4\n\nWant to learn to memorise more words?

This has made finding people to communicated with a top priority, and quite hard to do.\n\nAlso, the fact that Cantonese is a spoken language has made the learning process a strange one. What do you do when you hardly even see your language written down?\n\nI'm pretty pleased with my level after 1 year, especially given the fact that I've only really studied for around 15 minutes a day on average. I think I've got a good command of the 6 tones of Cantonese, which is good because it was a priority for me. I've also got used to speaking with people and can hold really interesting conversations, providing they're on reasonably familiar topics. (No politics yet!)\n\nAreas to work on in the future include building my vocabulary way beyond where it's at now, and learning written Chinese. \n\nMoving forward, I'm going to prioritise speaking over other things. This means arranging regular language exchanges or tutor sessions, and trying hard to keep it consistent. \n\nIf you'd like to watch the other progress videos from this year of learning Cantonese, here they are:\n\n1-month:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C0i-_MR64Y&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\nHow I learnt Cantonese (the first month):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Z09WEBcCM&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\nSinging in Cantonese:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Z20Bg8Ppg&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\n2-months:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pwu5Jg7Uvw&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\n3-months:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM50pgWlHsE&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\n4-months:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAA-_RfvV24&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\n6-months:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbm085X6eps&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg\n \nHere are the resources I used to learn Cantonese:\nhttp://www.iwillteachyoualanguage.com/resources/cantonese-resource-page/\n\nAlso check out this interesting article from Brian Kwong on why Cantonese is an easy language to learn:\nhttp://www.fluentin3months.com/cantonese/",

Forget the boring textbooks and time-wasting apps! Learn Portuguese the natural, effective way with my Portuguese Uncovered course.\n👉🏼 https://bit.ly/portugueseuncoveredl1\n\nHow can you get a great accent when speaking a foreign language? \n\nThere are two parts to consider if you want to have a good accent that helps you communicate effectively with native speakers.\n\nRead the full post here: http://www.thepolyglotdream.com/developing-an-awesome-accent/\n\nFirstly, you need a good understanding of the phonetics of the language you're learning. Take the time to learn to produce the basic sounds of the language correctly, and get help from a native speaker to make sure you're on the right track.\n\nBut after that, the only way to really develop an effective accent is to get out there and interact with people. I was lucky when I went to Brazil in that I already had a group of friends who I could hang out with. \n\nBy spending lots of time with them, I had was able to observe how they spoke, and closely imitate everything they did. I would copy not only their way of speaking, but their body language too, because this is all part of effective communication.\n\nTime spent with people, and imitating what they do, is the secret. \n\nSo, if developing an effective accent is your goal, getting out of the house and interacting with people that you enjoy spending time with, becoming part of a community and using your language for a real purpose, should be something you prioritise.  \n\nHere's another video in Portuguese:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-FEVHpCbKg\n\nAnd one in Japanese when I talk about the importance of expressive yourself in authentic ways:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv09DoKrJPQ\n\nLearning songs can really help perfect your pronunciation:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sReTCr-WPxc\n\nWatch Richard Simcott use accents to describe his language journey:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1rGavKbJn0\n\nIn this video, Luca talks about how he chose his American accent in English:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9Tgko8cxA8",

    "description": "https://bit.ly/freeslkit_learn-language-fast ⬇️ GET MY FREE STORYLEARNING® KIT:\nDiscover how to learn any foreign language faster through the power of story with my free StoryLearning® Kit 👉🏼  https://bit.ly/freeslkit_learn-language-fast  \n\nThis is me (and my lovely assistant) speaking Cantonese after 6 months. As you can see, completely unprepared, and with the added complication of having to navigate the roads of Doha in my Jeep!\n\nThis video, for me, demonstrates what's possible by studying a language from scratch for 15-30 minutes a day. There were some days at the beginning where I did more, maybe 1 hour, but after the 2nd month, I've not been doing more than 30 mins a day, and often much less. I've also never spent any time in Hong Kong, until last week when I visited for a week. \n\nCantonese is such a wonderful language! Obviously I'm not really doing it justice here with my ramblings, but it's full of expression, rich vocabulary, and lots of fun. I'm having more fun learning Cantonese than any other language since Brazilian Portuguese (and for very different reasons!).\n\nHowever, easy it isn't. According to the US Foreign Service Institute, it's a Category V language (that's the highest, by the way!) - \"Languages which are exceptionally difficult for native English speakers\". As you can see, I'm still struggling with more complex sentences, and with my vocabulary which is fairly limited.\n\nMy learning strategy so far has involved a lot of input from listening (textbook audio and TV dramas), finding texts with audio (e.g. Complete Cantonese) and focusing primarily on building my vocabulary with the help of an SRS app. \n\nI began speaking fairly soon after starting, and I focused heavily on getting the tones right. (Any native speakers out there will be able to tell me if my tones are actually any good or not!). However, I didn't dive into having extended conversations with native speakers until the second or third month.\n\nI also decided not to spend any time learning Chinese characters. This was a difficult, but conscious choice. I feel that if you've got limited time, and if you're motivated by speaking primarily, that there are more advantages to ditching Chinese characters at the beginning. The risk of diving right into Chinese characters, is that it occupies so much of your time that it is at the expense of progress in your speaking. That may not be a problem for you, but for me, it's the ability to speak which is the primary motivator for me, and I know that by progressing with my speaking, I'll start to build up a head of steam which will start a snowball effect in terms of motivation.\n\nI discussed this very topic in a video interview recently, which you can find here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V_JwzI1zjU&feature=share&list=UUSSLq4KYuztsj6ch2RbqoIg&index=1\n\nWere I to go to live in Hong Kong (or China), I would probably start to need to learn Chinese characters quickly, but I would probably tackle it as a substantial project in its own right. [Note: I do actually already have a reasonably good knowledge of Chinese characters from Japanese, but it's nowhere near enough, so I feel the approach would still be valid for someone starting from zero; I basically haven't been reading or writing at all.] \n\nWhat's next? \n\nWell, there's a long way to go, and what I really need to do now is to continue building my vocabulary. That's priority number one. I plan to do that by a lot of listening and reading, and by having regular conversations with native speakers to keep improving my ability to put sentences together and express myself.\n\nThere are few good resources for Cantonese, but recently in Hong Kong I just found a really great book called \"Living Cantonese for Intermediate Learners\", which is comprised of an entire RTHK radio drama series, with transcriptions, vocab lists and explanations of grammar patterns included. So I'll be hitting that hard!\n\nTo follow my progress into the next 6 months don't forget to hit SUBSCRIBE, and visit my blog: http://iwillteachyoualanguage.com",

For me, Brazilian Portuguese has a number of interesting characteristics which make it a very approachable language, and one that isn't too difficult to learn. \n\nFor example, the grammar is fairly straightforward for someone with English or a Romance language as their mother tongue. Brazilian culture is also very attractive to lots of people so once you get to know about Brazil and it's people, it's very easy to get absorbed into the Brazilian fold! \n\nIn Brazil itself, I've met an unusually high number of native English speakers who learn to speak Portuguese to a pretty high level, which suggests that it really shouldn't been seen as a language that can't be learnt. \n\nAll of this mean, for me, that there are lots of reasons to start speaking as soon as possible. I don't always recommend that - sometimes it's worth studying on your own for some time before starting to speak - however in the case of Brazilian Portuguese I think it's worth it, because it's relatively easy to pick up. \n\nHowever, there are some things to be wary of, not least the difference between Portuguese from Portugal and from Brazil, which are very different from one another. The accent, grammar and vocabulary in daily use, for example, are very different. I suggest making sure that any resources you have for learning are especially for Brazilian Portuguese, if that's what you want to learn.",
