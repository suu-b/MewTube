Today he describes himself as a gay/ same sex-attracted celibate Christian, someone living between two tribes often assumed to be incompatible.\n\nIn this deep and tender conversation, theologian David speaks with Elizabeth Oldfield about his long wrestle with desire, queer identity and Scripture; why he believes celibacy can be liberating rather than repressive; and how he hopes to build bridges across an increasingly polarised landscape.\n\nThey explore what happens when your story becomes symbolic in the culture wars, how to refuse weaponisation from both left and right, and what it means to live as a pilgrim - someone always on the way, always becoming.\n\n---\n🎙️ Follow The Sacred: linktr.ee/sacredpodcast \n\n📖 Follow Elizabeth Oldfield: www.elizabetholdfield.com/ \n\n💡 Produced by the ‪@thinktanktheos‬ www.theosthinktank.co.uk/ \n\n👉 Follow David: https://www.instagram.com/davidacbennett/?hl=en\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Intro \n00:48 - What is Sacred to you?

    "description": "I’m getting back on my skates - even though I’m nervous, even though I had a pretty bad fall last time. Even though a tall clumsy woman in her 40s should maybe find another hobby. \n\nWhy? Partly because skating is brilliant. It makes me feel amazing. \n\nBut also because it’s become a kind of exposure therapy. A way of reminding my body that fear and discomfort aren’t the same as danger. \n\nThrough helping my child with a phobia of dogs, I’ve learnt this key truth: When we withdraw every time something makes us feel tense, when we move away or unfollow or ghost… we teach our bodies that difference is danger. That disagreement is something to run away from. It is the opposite of building resilience. \n\nSometimes we do need to protect ourselves, but often we can practice staying. Feeling the fear and doing it anyway. Being around or even listening to people who are not like us. It sends a message to our bodies that we can tolerate this, actually. We are braver than we think. \n\nAnd as our instinctive threat reaction ebbs, we might find ourselves somewhere really interesting. \n\nThis ability is the only way we can hold together any kind of common life.\n\nWhat’s something you’re trying to stay with even though it’s hard?

Because when I’m in that reactive space, I can’t be curious. I can’t be empathetic. I am not open to learn.\n\nThere might be something in that email I need to hear… but not now, maybe later.\n\nThis, to me, is what the line “turn the other cheek” sometimes means.

But when he publicly opposed Donald Trump in 2016, everything changed. His church turned on him, his family received threats, and he became controversial figure in political and religious debates.\n\nIn this conversation, David reflects on the cost of choosing virtue over political loyalty, why free speech still matters even when it's painful, and what it’s like to be exiled by your tribe.\n\nWe talk about moral courage, the state of American evangelicalism, and what it means to stay principled in a world that rewards tribalism.\n\n-\n\n🎙️ Follow The Sacred: linktr.ee/sacredpodcast \n\n📖 Follow Elizabeth Oldfield: www.elizabetholdfield.com/ \n\n💡 Produced by the ‪@thinktanktheos‬ www.theosthinktank.co.uk/ \n\n✍️ Follow David French: https://x.com/davidafrench?lang=en\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:07 What is Sacred to you?

In this episode, he shares how refusing to support Donald Trump led to being “cancelled” by his church, receiving threats, and becoming a controversial figure in conservative Christian circles. We explore free speech, religious freedom, evangelical politics, cancel culture, moral courage, integrity, and the crisis of virtue in public life. David speaks about his military service in Iraq, his time defending civil liberties, and why he believes principles should come before political parties. This conversation is for anyone wrestling with faith and politics, Christian identity, the culture wars, the evangelical church, or what it means to live with integrity in polarised times. Topics include: Christian conservatism, Never Trump, leaving church, freedom of speech, spiritual exile, republican, political pressure, and how to remain faithful under fire.",

    "description": "If you actually care about changing someone’s mind, you have to do the work…\n\nI want to be the kind of person who can cross tribal lines. Someone who can listen to people I disagree with and talk about our differences without things immediately getting tense. \n\nOn some topics, I also really care about changing people’s minds!\n\nI loved what Caitlin Moran said about choosing to write for The Times, rather than a paper she might be more politically at home on, so that she could be communicating with people who might disagree with her. She opens her columns with storytelling as a way of gently disarming those who might otherwise be put off. She finds ways to invite people in, not push them away. She creates a hospitable place for difference, rather than a hostile one.\n\nPreaching to the choir, performing to our “own side” by slamming our opponents is MUCH more immediately satisfying. We get a dopamine hit from the affirmation and a high from the self-righteousness (or at least I do). Sadly, while we can pretend we are virtuous for displaying the “correct” views, it usually actually makes this worse, hardening people who might disagree with us into their positions.\n\nCaitlin and others who are trying to build a bigger tent, a more expansive sense of “us” have to forgo those rewards for the sake of the long slow work of building bridges. I think we should celebrate them. What do you think?\n\n- Elizabeth",

Every charity and campaign groups targeted adverts were all I could see. I was informed before (I don’t tend to use this platform for hard news issues, generally) but suddenly it was at the front of my consciousness in a whole new way.\n\nI had seen the reality of our algorithmic bubbles. The topics that we care about most, which seem obvious because they are everywhere we look, are not being seen by everyone.\n\nBefore I label it apathy or ignorance when others seem to care less about an issue than I do, I need to remember: we are not all seeing the same worlds.\n\nHave you noticed this too?\n\n- Elizabeth",

    "description": "Bestselling author Caitlin Moran made waves with her 2011 feminist classic How to Be a Woman. Now, she’s calling for an urgent conversation about the crisis of modern masculinity.\n\nIn this special live episode of The Sacred, Elizabeth Oldfield and Daniel Turner sit down with Caitlin for a hilarious, moving, and deeply honest conversation that challenges what we think we know about men, women, gender roles, and society today.\n\nTogether, they explore:\n✖️ The masculinity crisis and the rise of the manosphere\n📖 The cultural impact of 'How to Be a Woman'\n😡 The intense backlash Caitlin received for writing about boys and men\n♂️ Why men struggle with health, identity, and emotional development\n🔄 The differences in how society handles midlife crises in men vs women\n🧠 How we can move beyond stereotypes toward a healthier, more compassionate vision of masculinity\n\n🎥 Recorded at our Sacred Live event\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Exploring Gender: The Unasked Questions\n01:54 The Sacred Values: Making People Feel Better\n04:53 Childhood Influences: A Unique Upbringing\n09:51 The Journey of a Writer: From Music Journalism to Feminism\n18:00 The Impact of 'How to Be a Woman' and Public Perception\n27:01 The Responsibility of Influence: Navigating Public Opinion\n28:49 The Art of Persuasion in Writing\n30:42 Hospitality in Communication\n31:36 The Importance of Awareness\n33:13 Navigating Tone and Authenticity\n34:54 The Journey to the Times\n36:49 Exploring Feminism and Masculinity\n37:47 Cultural Shifts in Gender Perception\n39:41 Addressing the Crisis of Masculinity\n41:31 Feminism's Role in Men's Issues\n43:16 The Backlash Against Men's Conversations\n45:18 The Lack of Resources for Men\n47:09 Expanding the Conversation\n49:21 Finding Purpose in Modern Society\n50:55 The Quest for Meaning\n52:45 Cinematic Narratives for Boys and Heroic Archetypes\n56:51 The Stiff Upper Lip Mentality\n58:34 The Importance of Vulnerability\nAudience Q+A\n01:02:35 Are there unique differences between men and women?\n01:07:21 The Interior Lives of Men\n01:10:58 Why are kids terrified of their interior lives?\n01:16:41 What is the role of men in modern society?\n01:23:11 Navigating anxiety and self care\n01:28:40 Elizabeth Oldfield's reflection\n\nKeywords\n\nWhy are teenage boys struggling today? What does it mean to be a man in 2025? Is masculinity in crisis, or just changing? What happened to male role models — and why are so many young men turning to figures like Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson for guidance? How is red pill culture shaping boys' self-image? What does feminism have to say about men, and how can we raise emotionally intelligent boys in a world full of conflicting messages? Are boys being left behind in conversations about gender? What do they need that they’re not getting — from parents, schools, or culture? How is social media — especially TikTok — influencing masculinity, and what impact is it having on mental health? Why do boys struggle to express their emotions, and how can we help them develop emotional resilience? Should we parent boys differently than girls? And what can we learn from shows like Adolescence on Netflix about what it really means to grow up as a boy today?",

    "description": "*EPISODE DISCLAIMER*\nThis episode was recorded before brand allegations emerged. It feels very timely but also potentially a difficult time for us to be releasing it. In the end, we wanted to leave as is because Thordis and her story is about more than sexual violence, and because the topic of sexual violence itself is about more than one person and their story. But we're also very aware there are a lot of complex and conflicting thoughts following the allegations emerging. So as ever please do get in touch and let us know your thoughts.\n\nThis is a clip from Elizabeth Oldfield's conversation with Thordis Elva on The Sacred podcast.\n\nThordis Elva is a writer and speaker best known for her powerful story of forgiving and reconciling with her rapist, Tom. Her Ted Talk, given alongside Tom, has been viewed over six million times.\n\nThordis spoke about her story of sexual assault and journey to forgiveness, the challenge of recognising the human nature of those who hurt you, and the uniting force that is hope.\n\nWatch Thordis' Ted talk here: https://www.ted.com/talks/thordis_elva_and_tom_stranger_our_story_of_rape_and_reconciliation\n\nBuy a copy of Thordis' book, South of Forgiveness, here: https://www.waterstones.com/book/south-of-forgiveness/thordis-elva/tom-stranger/9781911344056\n\n*****\n\nThe Sacred is a podcast produced by the think tank Theos.

    "description": "*EPISODE DISCLAIMER*\nThis episode was recorded before brand allegations emerged. It feels very timely but also potentially a difficult time for us to be releasing it. In the end, we wanted to leave as is because Thordis and her story is about more than sexual violence, and because the topic of sexual violence itself is about more than one person and their story. But we're also very aware there are a lot of complex and conflicting thoughts following the allegations emerging. So as ever please do get in touch and let us know your thoughts.\n\nThis is a clip from Elizabeth Oldfield's conversation with Thordis Elva on The Sacred podcast.\n\nThordis Elva is a writer and speaker best known for her powerful story of forgiving and reconciling with her rapist, Tom. Her Ted Talk, given alongside Tom, has been viewed over six million times.\n\nThordis spoke about her story of sexual assault and journey to forgiveness, the challenge of recognising the human nature of those who hurt you, and the uniting force that is hope.\n\nWatch Thordis' Ted talk here: https://www.ted.com/talks/thordis_elva_and_tom_stranger_our_story_of_rape_and_reconciliation\n\nBuy a copy of Thordis' book, South of Forgiveness, here: https://www.waterstones.com/book/south-of-forgiveness/thordis-elva/tom-stranger/9781911344056\n\n*****\n\nThe Sacred is a podcast produced by the think tank Theos.
