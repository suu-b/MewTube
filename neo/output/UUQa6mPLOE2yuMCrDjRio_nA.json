    "description": "This episode is part interview and part dialogue between Justin Schieber and Christian YouTuber Kyle Alander about Kyle's preferred approach to the problem of evil. Alander adopts a defeat-based approach along the lines of Marilyn McCord Adams, Trent Dougherty, and John Schneider. In this almost four hour long episode, they discuss how defeat is understood in the dialectic surrounding the problem of evil. We also unpack Kyle’s preferred defeat-based theodicy before exploring at some length multiple objections to it in an effort to clarify details. However, one topic we avoid here is whether adding such rich detail to one’s core theory in response to the data of evil and suffering should come at some epistemic cost for the theist. That topic will hopefully be explored in future videos.\n\nThis episode is not only ridiculously long, it is also unique in its format. Rather than being a live recording, this is instead composed of video clips recorded with our cell phones in response to each other as time permitted - in most cases, this meant every other day. Those clips were then edited together into what you’re about to watch.\n\nBecause this is a complicated topic, the conversation does include some misinterpretation but ultimately I think you’ll see that it tends toward clarity and understanding.\n\nKyle's channel (Christian Idealism):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@christianidealism7868\n\nSOCIALS:\nBe sure to follow the RA crew at the social media links below:\nWebsite: https://realatheology.com/\ntiktok: https://tiktok.com/RealAtheology\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RealAtheology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealAtheology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/realatheology/\n\nHOW CAN YOU HELP?\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/RealAtheology",

Two claims of Van Til are challenged using the resources of objective idealism:\n\nThose two claims are (i) Christianity is a necessary condition to know anything at all and (ii) the Christian and the non-Christian have no neutral ground to resolve their disagreements.\n\nIn addition to challenging these claims by appeal to a form of objective idealism, Ben also gives a brief exposition of the argument from divine hiddenness. Contrary to Van Til and other presuppositional apologetics, it is not the case everyone believes God exists. In fact, there are some people who do not believe God exists, and this fact is evidence for atheism over theism.\n\nTIME STAMPS:\n00:24 Introduction\n00:37 Presuppositional Apologetics\n06:06 Objective Idealism Explained\n07:32 Subjective Idealism Contrasted\n09:09 The Autonomy of Reason Explained\n17:11 The Argument from Divine Hiddenness\n\nTHE ARGUMENT FROM DIVINE HIDDENNESS (OUR PLAYLIST):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ru4PSw7gsLuIEkwnyl0DWxdCgnYoFJj\n\nSOCIALS:\nBe sure to follow the RA crew at the social media links below:\nWebsite: https://realatheology.com/\ntiktok: https://tiktok.com/RealAtheology\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RealAtheology\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealAtheology\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/realatheology/\n\nHOW CAN YOU HELP?\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/RealAtheology",

    "description": "In this episode, Ben Watkins sits down with Professor Paul Russell to discuss David Hume, philosophy of religion, and Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. \n\nProfessor Russell is a leading Hume scholar and author of “The Riddle of Hume’s Treatise” which argues irreligion is central to understanding the naturalism and skepticism at the heart of Hume’s philosophy, specially, that expressed in his “A Treatise of Human Nature.” These irreligious themes culminate in Hume’s masterpiece: “Dialogues of concerning Natural Religion.” \n\nProfessor Russell walks us through different models of god, the argument for design, the argument from evil, and what has been called “Hume’s strange inversion” at the end of the Dialogues.\n\nPaul Russell's Website:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/paulrussellubc/paul-russell\n\nPhilpapers:\nhttps://philpeople.org/profiles/paul-russell\n\nHume’s Skepticism and the Problem of Atheism:\nhttps://philarchive.org/archive/RUSHSA-4#:~:text=theist%20nor%20an%20atheist%20but,%2F%20186%E2%80%93%2087%3B%20cp.\n\n📱SOCIALS📱\nBe sure to follow the RA crew at the social media links below:\n\nWebsite: https://realatheology.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RealAtheology\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealAtheology\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/realatheology/\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/RealAtheology",

    "description": "The Hiddenness Series returns. Richard Swinburne's responsibility argument aims to show it's good for God to stay hidden. That way we can investigate God's existence together. Assisting others in this endeavor, says Swinburne, is a very good deed—one we should be thankful to have the opportunity to do. In this video I discuss Swinburne's argument, Schellenberg's response, and Travis Dumsday's reformulation. I then share some of my own objections to the responsibility argument.

    "description": "Welcome back to the Hiddenness Series. In the last episode, we looked at Schellenberg's concept of a nonresistant nonbeliever which plays a central role in his argument from Divine Hiddenness. To refresh, somebody is a nonresistant nonbeliever if they (1)  fail to believe that God exists and (2) that failure is not the result of their resistance to God. We also looked at the concept of resistance at play here and we saw that it included a desire component in conjunction with actions or omissions driven by that desire. Certain desire/action/omission combinations, if expressed by a person could conceivably cause that person to fail to believe that God exists even though they did believe to begin with. Some form of Self-deception would have to be at play here. Schellenberg calls such persons resistant nonbelievers and, according to the Hiddenness argument, if a perfectly loving God exists, resisters are the only type of nonbeliever that could exist. However, Schellenberg claims resistant nonbelievers are not the only type of nonbelievers that exist. According to him, some nonbelievers are nonresistant. His argument requires this. But is he correct?

    "description": "According to Schellenberg’s argument from Divine Hiddenness, a nonresistant nonbeliever is, simply put, somebody who fails to believe in God in such a way that the failure is not itself the result of resistant self-deception. A key premise of the  divine hiddenness argument just is the claim that such persons exist and/or have existed in the past. For most people, this premise will appear obvious and this appearance likely the result of their connections and communications with other people. People they know and understand. People they trust and respect. On the other hand, some people claim to be skeptical about this premise. Can we really know that these nonbelievers aren’t resisting? To answer these questions, we’ve got to take a closer look at Schellenberg’s concept of the nonresistant nonbeliever.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.realatheology.com\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/RealAtheology\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=real%20atheology%20-%20a%20philosophy%20of%20religion%20podcast\n\nTimecodes\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:04 - The Tent of Nonbelief\n01:45 - Reflective Nonbelievers\n02:40 - Unreflective Nonbelievers\n04:02 - Resistance / Nonresistance\n05:46 - Some Additional Considerations\n06:27 - What Resistance Requires\n07:59 - Former Believers\n09:54 - Lifelong Seekers\n10:29 - Converts to Nontheistic Religions\n11:03 - Isolated Nontheists\n11:40 - Summary\n12:11 - Closing",

    "description": "In this episode, Ben Watkins sits down with Matthew Adelstein to discuss utilitarianism and theism. Utilitarianism, in its classical forms, claims that what we morally ought to do is act in ways that would maximize happiness and minimize suffering. This simple moral calculus is open to several important objections, but if true, has important consequences for theism as traditionally conceived. If God morally should create a world that maximizes happiness and minimize suffering, as would be the case if hedonistic act utilitarianism were true, then we are clearly not talking about the actual world. There could be much more happiness and much less suffering, therefore, there is no God as traditionally conceived in the actual world.\n\n\n\nMatthew's blog: https://benthams.substack.com/",

Lorkowski on his new book Atheism Considered: A Survey of the Rational Rejection of Religious Belief (2020).\n\nThis book is a systematic presentation of challenges to the existence of a higher power. Rather than engaging in a polemic against a religious worldview, Lorkowski charitably refutes the classical arguments for the existence of God, pointing out flaws in their underlying reasoning and highlighting difficulties inherent to revealed sources. In place of a theistic worldview, he argues for adopting a naturalistic one, highlighting naturalism’s capacity to explain world phenomena and contribute to the sciences. Lorkowski demonstrates that replacing theism with naturalism, contra popular assumptions sacrifices nothing in terms of ethics or meaning. A charitable and philosophical introduction to a more rigorous philosophical Atheism.\n\nIn this interview, we take a tour of some of the major themes of the books with Dr. Lorkowski and discuss many topics including his background, the various arguments of Natural Theology, Apologetics vs. Philosophy, David Hume, and a whole host of other topics.

    "description": "** Allow me to remove your puzzlement: the clip from 23:37 to 24:21 and the one from 24:21 to 24:40 were supposed to appear in the opposite order.\n\nYou'll have to forgive the fan's blowing full blast at the beginning. It was frickin' hot. I just remembered I have access to editing software that I may get around to using to fix this. Still getting used to this new recording setup, too.\n\nFor those who would like to see the formal presentation of Stage 1 of Feser's neo-Platonic proof, here it is, taken from p. 80 of Five Proofs of the Existence of God:\n\n\"1. The things of our experience are composite.\n2. A composite exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment.\n3. This composition of parts requires a concurrent cause.\n4. So, any composite has a cause of its existence at any moment at which it exists.\n5. So, each of the things of our experience has a cause at any moment at which it exists.\n6. If the cause of a composite thing’s existence at any moment is itself composite, then it will in turn require a cause of its own existence at that moment.\n7. The regress of causes this entails is hierarchical in nature, and such a regress must have a first member.\n8. Only something absolutely simple or noncomposite could be the first member of such a series.\n9. So, the existence of each of the things of our experience presupposes an absolutely simple or noncomposite cause.\"\n\nThe section on pp. 73-4 regarding the essence-existence explanatory circle:\n\n\"Other metaphysical parts too might be identified. For example, Thomist philosophers hold that we can distinguish between the essence of a thing and its existence—that is, between what the thing is and the fact that it is. There is, for example, the essence or nature of a triangle—being a closed plane figure with three straight sides—and the existence of some particular triangle, which differs from the existence of some other particular triangle. Now, a thing exists at all only as a thing of some kind or other, so that there is no such thing as the existence of a triangle (to stick with that example) apart from the essence of the triangle. But the essence of a triangle all by itself and apart from any actual triangle which has that essence is a mere abstraction rather than a concrete object. So, some particular concrete triangle’s essence has no reality apart from the triangle’s existence. As with matter and form, then, the essence and existence of a thing depend on one another in such a way that if there were no cause outside of the thing that accounts for how the essence and existence are conjoined, we would have an explanatory vicious circle.\"",

This is most of the talk; unfortunately, the first few minutes weren't recorded. Ben discusses the problem of evil and metaethics. Ben's back-and-forth with the youth is all in there, toward the end.\n\nFor more about MAVEN, click this link: https://crossexamined.org/the-maven-experience/\n\nPhoto credit goes to Tim Stratton of FreeThinking Ministries.",

    "description": "We're back with a new episode! This time we tackle the Argument from Motion as presented in Ed Feser's book \"Five Proofs of the Existence of God\".\n\n**Correction: it's not quite right that one key difference between classical theists and theistic personalists (or Anselmian perfect being theists) is that the former don't believe God to be personal but the latter do. Feser explains why this is incorrect on pp. 190-1 of Five Proofs of the Existence of God:\n\n\"The view is called 'theistic personalism' because it essentially treats God as the unique member of a species falling under the genus person, alongside other species of persons like human beings and angels, and differing from them in lacking their limitations on power, knowledge, goodness, and so forth. (Note that what distinguishes neo-theism or theistic personalism from classical theism is not that it regards God as personal as opposed to impersonal. Since most classical theists attribute intellect and will to God, they too generally regard God as personal. Rather, what sets the views apart is that theistic personalists regard God’s being personal as entailing that he falls under a genus, and that in this and other ways he is not simple or noncomposite.)\"\n\nGaven Kerr also tries to show that the Thomistic God can be personal, pace Plantinga, in the chapter of Aquinas's Way to God entitled \"Esse Tantum\" (http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/…/acprof-9780190224806-cha…). I do wonder, though, whether attributing certain attributes to God that are analogical to ordinary personal attributes counts as attributing personal attributes to God. Maybe it counts in an analogical sense. :) At any rate, we can still differentiate between classical theists and theistic personalists by noting that the former don't take God to be *a person* univocally whereas the latter do.",

    "description": "*Looks like I left out an important clip. In that clip, I admitted that I have no idea whether the hypothetical actualizers with potential for action but not for existence would be things in space or time, so you might question whether they could be accurately represented as graphs in a 3D coordinate system. But if, as Feser suggests, these actualizers could have parts, I don't see why they couldn't have regions. Parts seem about as essentially spatial as regions.\n\nIn this video, I address a couple replies to my objection that Feser's argument from motion at best gets us to the conclusion that there's an actualizer without any potential *for existence*. I'd like to thank Anonymous Person for bringing these direct replies from Feser's Five Proofs book to my attention in their comments at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5vIbFs_ICY.\n\nAnd yes, I know I'm probably mispronouncing \"agere sequitur esse.\"",

    "title": "Stage 1 of Feser's Argument from Motion",
    "description": "Here's the formal presentation of the first stage of Edward Feser's Aristotelian proof, from pp. 35-6 of Five Proofs of the Existence of God:\n\n\"1. Change is a real feature of the world.\n2. But change is the actualization of a potential.\n3. So, the actualization of potential is a real feature of the world.\n4. No potential can be actualized unless something already actual actualizes it (the principle of causality).\n5. So, any change is caused by something already actual.\n6. The occurrence of any change C presupposes some thing or substance S which changes.\n7. The existence of S at any given moment itself presupposes the concurrent actualization of S’s potential for existence.\n8. So, any substance S has at any moment some actualizer A of its existence.\n9. A’s own existence at the moment it actualizes S itself presupposes either (a) the concurrent actualization of its own potential for existence or (b) A’s being purely actual.\n10. If A’s existence at the moment it actualizes S presupposes the concurrent actualization of its own potential for existence, then there exists a regress of concurrent actualizers that is either infinite or terminates in a purely actual actualizer.\n11. But such a regress of concurrent actualizers would constitute a hierarchical causal series, and such a series cannot regress infinitely.\n12. So, either A itself is a purely actual actualizer or there is a purely actual actualizer which terminates the regress that begins with the actualization of A.\n13. So, the occurrence of C and thus the existence of S at any given moment presupposes the existence of a purely actual actualizer.\n14. So, there is a purely actual actualizer.\"\n\nAlso, I probably shouldn't have used \"the potential to cause things\" as an example of a potential other than the potential for existence, because Thomists are speaking of passive potency when they say \"potential.\" My understanding is, passive potency is an ability to be affected, not to affect things or to cause things. Causal powers are active potencies, which are contrasted with passive potencies (and by extension with potentials).",

Many apologists put forward moral arguments for the existence of God which claim that atheism implies some form of moral nihilism. While both Ben and Cory do not find these arguments persuasive, Cory is not so sure about the view that is often called “moral realism.” This view states that there are mind independent moral truths about what actions are good and bad, right and wrong, and virtuous and vicious. Ben, on the other hand, is a moral realist, because he accepts a realist view about normativity in general. In an effort to convince Cory of moral realism, Ben defends the view that some things matter in the sense that we have reasons to care about things for their own sake. Such truths are ‘irreducibly normative.’ Ben holds that there are some irreducibly normative truths about what we have reason to believe, to desire, and to do, and that some of these truths are moral truths.",
