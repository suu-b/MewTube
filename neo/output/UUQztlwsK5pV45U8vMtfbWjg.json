    "description": "This video is a response to a video from @GospelSimplicity on Protestant departures from Thomistic approaches to the world. In this talk, I discuss how common portrayals of Protestant intellectual history completely misrepresent the theology and philosophy of the Age of Orthodoxy following the Reformation. These narratives are popularly shared on social media by Roman Catholic apologists, and are also present in more scholarly material, such as in the work of Brad Gregory.\n\nYou can find Austin's original video here: https://youtu.be/wZDB_jMqn4s?si=RLdtQBpnwtqkAW4U\n\nDr. Jordan B.

    "title": "Is Justification by Faith Alone a Legal Fiction? Defending the Reformation View of Salvation",
    "description": "Gavin Ortlund, Dr. Jordan Cooper, and Dr. Michael Horton discuss the Reformation doctrine of justification through faith alone, the question of medieval nominalism, nature and grace, the donum superadditum, the accusation that justification is a \"legal fiction,\" and various other topics.\n\nThis is part 3 of a 6 part series.\n\nDEFENDING THE REFORMATION is a 6 part series bringing together Gavin Ortlund, Jordan Cooper, and Michael Horton to address some of the most prominent criticisms of the Reformation and key Protestant doctrines. Were the Reformers true reformers or radical revolutionaries? Does Sola Scriptura undermine church tradition? Is Sola Fide merely a product of nominalism? Together, these Protestant theologians examine the historical context, theological depth, and biblical fidelity of the Reformation.

    "description": "Virtue and Flourishing in the Catholic and Lutheran Traditions: A Moral Ecology Trust Conference\n\nFor millennia, the formation of good character was the primary aim of education in the home, school, congregation, and community. Two historic communities—the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions—offer rich resources that have fed institutions for centuries with the theory, teaching, and habits to form good people, virtuous citizens, and wise leaders. But this aim has all but disappeared from our institutions and societies. To address this, three leading philosophers and theologians from each of these two traditions will speak about the theory, the teaching, and the practical work that can be recovered in late modernity to form character and virtue for the flourishing of all.\n\nThis first session features talks from Dr. Jordan B. Cooper and Fr. Ezra Sullivan.\n\nJordan Cooper is an ordained Lutheran pastor, the Executive Director of Just & Sinner, Fellow of Systematic Theology at the Weidner Institute, and the Chair of Lutheran Dogmatics at the American Lutheran Theological Seminary.\n\nEzra Sullivan, OP, is a professor of moral theology and psychology at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome (Angelicum).",

    "description": "Virtue and Flourishing in the Catholic and Lutheran Traditions: A Moral Ecology Trust Conference\n\nFor millennia, the formation of good character was the primary aim of education in the home, school, congregation, and community. Two historic communities—the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions—offer rich resources that have fed institutions for centuries with the theory, teaching, and habits to form good people, virtuous citizens, and wise leaders. But this aim has all but disappeared from our institutions and societies. To address this, three leading philosophers and theologians from each of these two traditions will speak about the theory, the teaching, and the practical work that can be recovered in late modernity to form character and virtue for the flourishing of all.\n\nThis first session features talks from Dr. Jordan B. Cooper and Fr. Ezra Sullivan.\n\nJordan Cooper is an ordained Lutheran pastor, the Executive Director of Just & Sinner, Fellow of Systematic Theology at the Weidner Institute, and the Chair of Lutheran Dogmatics at the American Lutheran Theological Seminary.\n\nEzra Sullivan, OP, is a professor of moral theology and psychology at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome (Angelicum).",

    "title": "Virtue in Roman Catholic and Lutheran Traditions with Dr. Jordan B. Cooper and Fr. Ezra Sullivan",
    "description": "Virtue and Flourishing in the Catholic and Lutheran Traditions: A Moral Ecology Trust Conference\n\nFor millennia, the formation of good character was the primary aim of education in the home, school, congregation, and community. Two historic communities—the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions—offer rich resources that have fed institutions for centuries with the theory, teaching, and habits to form good people, virtuous citizens, and wise leaders. But this aim has all but disappeared from our institutions and societies. To address this, three leading philosophers and theologians from each of these two traditions will speak about the theory, the teaching, and the practical work that can be recovered in late modernity to form character and virtue for the flourishing of all.\n\nThis first session features talks from Dr. Jordan B. Cooper and Fr. Ezra Sullivan.\n\nJordan Cooper is an ordained Lutheran pastor, the Executive Director of Just & Sinner, Fellow of Systematic Theology at the Weidner Institute, and the Chair of Lutheran Dogmatics at the American Lutheran Theological Seminary.\n\nEzra Sullivan, OP, is a professor of moral theology and psychology at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome (Angelicum).",
