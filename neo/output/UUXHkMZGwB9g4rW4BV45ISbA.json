Sadly, the book has been widely hailed by indiscriminating readers. \n\nRillera’s objection is not, like most critiques, aimed at the “penal” aspect of penal substitutionary atonement, but at the “substitutionary” and “atonement” aspects of the theory. He denies not only that Jesus died in our place but, remarkably, that his death atoned for our sins!\n\nDr. Craig takes the mistaken views espoused by Rillera head on in this critique.\n\nSpecial thanks to @SeanMcDowell  for this interview and footage.\n\nREAD: Atonement and the Death of Christ, by W.L.

    "description": "Can God be all-powerful and limited at the same time? What is a \"limited' version of theism? In this lively and thought-provoking debate, Dr. William Lane Craig engages philosopher Philip Goff on the nature of God, divine power, and what it means to believe in a God who is both transcendent and personal. Hosted by Justin Brierley, this wide-ranging discussion explores Goff’s evolving views on Christianity, panpsychism, panentheism, the fine-tuning of the universe, and how we confront the problem of evil.\n\nDr. Craig challenges Goff’s “mildly heretical” take on Christian belief, offering a classical theistic defense grounded in rigorous philosophical theology. Along the way, they wrestle with deep questions:\n– Is the resurrection identical to the ascension?\n– Can God be meaningfully described without limiting Him?\n– Is suffering better explained by traditional or revisionist theologies?\n\nWhether you're a theist, skeptic, or somewhere in between, this dialogue offers a fascinating look at two very different approaches to God, reason, and reality.\n\n🙏Special thanks to Justin Brierley for this dialogue and footage.

    "description": "Defenders LIVE! // Evolution & Creation Part 22: The Central Truths Expressed in Genesis 1-11 //\n\n\nIn our lessons together we have argued that the figurative and metaphorical language of the primeval narratives as well as certain inconsistencies within narratives in Genesis 1 and 2 make it plausible that these narratives are not to be read literally. The author has given to us stories of the creation of the world and of mankind's origin and rebellion against God which embody certain important truths expressed in a highly figurative language. Since the Pentateuchal author has an interest in history he intends for his narrative to be taken at some level as historical – to concern people who actually lived and events that really occurred. But those persons and events have been clothed in the metaphorical and figurative language of myth.\n\n\nIt's probably futile to try to discern to what extent the narratives are to be taken literally – to identify which parts are figurative and which parts are historical. Therefore, I think that the objections of someone like Kenton Sparks, who regards the narratives as completely unhistorical, to be a combination of history and theology I think is unfair.",

He said, Wait a minute! I can prove that there is a feasible world available to God in which everyone always freely does the right thing and doesn’t have overriding disadvantages; namely, heaven!

The first step will be establishing the facts which will serve as the evidence that any adequate historical hypothesis must explain. The second step is to assess the competing hypotheses to see which one does provide the best explanation of the facts. This morning let's begin with stage one: an examination of those facts which must be explained by any adequate historical account of the fate of Jesus of Nazareth.\nIt seems to me that these facts can all be summed up under three broad headings: the empty tomb of Jesus, his postmortem appearances, and finally the very origin of the Christian faith itself.",

Paul said, If Christ has not been raised then your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. But as we saw many modern theologians think that the resurrection can still be a meaningful religious concept even if it did not occur historically. So we want to look at not only the fact of the resurrection but the meaning of the resurrection.",

The division between these two would come at the cross of Christ. Jesus said at his Last Supper that he was inaugurating a new covenant in his blood. This was the covenant prophesied by the prophet Jeremiah. So the transition between the old and new covenants occurs with the death of Christ. But the effects of that transition are not immediate. There is a transitional period following the cross which is described in the book of Acts in which we have a transition from the old to the new.",

    "description": "📺🤺 Defenders LIVE! // Doctrine of the Trinity pt: 10: Father, Son, & Holy Spirit 📺🤺\n\n\nAs we are drawing to a close our discussion of the Trinity I have focused on a feature of the model that I think is of some interest, and that is that the model I've offered of the Trinity – of God as a tri-personal soul – does not feature (though it does not preclude) the derivation of one person of the Trinity from another. It does not include the notion of the Son's being eternally begotten from the Father. I suggested last time that I think it's good that the model leaves this an open question because the doctrine of the begetting of the Son from the Father in his divine (as opposed to human) nature is not biblically attested. It also seems to introduce an inevitable element of subordinationism into the Godhead which would seem to make the Son inferior to the Father because only the Father is unbegotten who exists in a self-existent way and the Son has the ground of his being in the Father and therefore has a kind of derivative existence which, to me at least, seems to make the Son arguably inferior to the Father.",

I was interviewed in the morning services by the pastor, Eric Huffman. He is a remarkable man—in fact, I’ve never met anyone like him. He shared with us that for over a dozen years he was a pastor in a liberal church. He said that during that time, he was really an atheist. He didn’t believe anything of Christianity. All he preached on Sunday morning was social justice. Then he began to watch videos on YouTube about the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection. He encountered my debates with secular scholars and was astonished at what he saw. Gradually, his mind began to change, and he finally came to place his faith in Christ as Savior and Lord. Now he is a transformed man, so zealous for apologetics, especially the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus that changed his life.\n\nSpecial thanks to Eric Huffman for this interview.

    "description": "📺🤺 Defenders LIVE!  //  The Existence of God part 28: The Presumption of Atheism 📺🤺\n\nAtheism traditionally is the view that God does not exist. Atheism is a position that there is no God. But very often atheists today (at least on a popular level) will put a different spin on atheism. They will say something like this: no one can prove a universal negative like “there is no God.” They think that because atheism is a universal negative that somehow excuses them from needing any evidence for God’s non-existence. Since it is a universal negative that there is no God and universal negatives cannot be proved, it is impossible to prove that God does not exist. Therefore, as atheists, they don’t need to prove such a thing.",

    "description": "For more resources visit: http://www.reasonablefaith.org\n\nThis debate took place on April 1, 2000 at Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Atheist philosopher Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, professor at Duke University and author of numerous books on ethics and morality, argues in the affirmative on the question, \"Does evil and suffering disprove God?\" William Lane Craig, a well-known Christian philosopher and apologist who also has a lengthy list of books in his name, argues the negative. Prior to this, Bill and Walter had debated in 1999 at Dartmouth, and following this second round, the speakers worked some of their arguments from both debates into a book entitled, \"God? A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist\" which has received generally stellar reviews on Amazon.\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nAdd Reasonable Faith On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg/",

They lay out some of the different perspectives on Adam & Eve and also some of the problems that come along with each perspective, bringing in science where it’s appropriate but also finding that science won’t lead us to definitive answers on many of the questions that arise. \n\nBecause this is a complex topic with many different perspectives, we asked several experts to join us in this episode and to respond to some of the different viewpoints on Adam and Eve. You’ll hear William Lane Craig, Ken Keathley, Anjeanette Roberts, Andrew Torrance and Dennis Venema who each provide their own take on some of these different Adam and Eve perspectives.\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttps://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short-length clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nAdd Reasonable Faith on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

Howe, Southern Evangelical Seminary: Antecedents to Aquinas' Doctrine of Simplicity\nStephen T. Davis, Claremont McKenna College: Why Simplicity is Unnecessary\nWilliam Lane Craig, Biola University, Houston Baptist University: Objections to Divine Simplicity\nJ. Brian Huffling, Southern Evangelical Seminary: Responding to Objections to Divine Simplicity.\n\nThe doctrine of divine simplicity has enjoyed much interest as of late, both from supporters and detractors. This panel discussion offers an opportunity for scholars on both sides of the issue to present their cases.

Craig is one of the world’s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the “new atheism” movement. \n\nIn front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christ’s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nAdd Reasonable Faith On Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

    "description": "For more resources visit: http://www.reasonablefaith.org\n\nBelievers have considered apologetics essential to defending the Christian faith in a scientific and pluralistic society.  But, as society has become increasingly post-modern, some say apologetics has become outdated...and even harmful. In April 2016, Up For Debate with Julie Roys explored the current controversy over apologetics with author Myron Penner, who says apologetics may be the \"single biggest threat to genuine Christian faith\" today.  Challenging his perspective is eminent apologist and author, William Lane Craig, who believes apologetics are as relevant today as ever!  Listen and discern this important issue, on this episode of Up For Debate on Moody Radio!\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

Do these models in fact have the implications which Hawking attributes to them, and will cosmology play successfully the role of a surrogate religion? In the dialogue between science and theology, philosophy plays a crucial role.

    "description": "For more resources visit: http://www.reasonablefaith.org \n\nIn the film The Theory Of Everything, Stephen Hawking (portrayed by Eddie Redmayne) claims that cosmology is \"a religion for intelligent atheists\". The question haunts the film as it haunts Hawking's books.\n\nDr William Lane Craig examines this claim - critiquing both dialogue from the film, and Prof. Hawking's own publications. Does a beginning to the universe entail a creator? Does Hawking's latest \"no boundary\" Big Bang model eliminate the need for God? What hope is there, in a Godless universe? And is philosophy \"dead\" as Stephen Hawking claims?\n\nDr William Lane Craig's Kalam Cosmological Argument is the most widely discussed argument for the existence of God in contemporary western philosophy. He is Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and Houston Baptist University. He's published over 40 books and over 150 articles in peer-reviewed journals. He is most known online for his lectures and debates with leading atheists and skeptics.\n\nThis lecture was delivered at Highfield Church, Southampton, in the UK. Still images from The Theory Of Everything (Universal Studios and Focus Features) have been included under and constitute Fair use for Academic Purposes.\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

This ministry holds outreach events in this large, dark Dallas bar on a regular basis. Apparently, the bar is only too happy to do so because of the large crowds the events attract. There were several hundred who came out to hear Dr Craig give a talk on the resurrection of Jesus as an event of history. It was a delightful time defending the heart of the Gospel, and Dr Craig really liked the way the BBC is taking the Gospel to where the people really are. \n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

In the early ’80s, as a young philosopher, Dr Craig heard Plantinga deliver a lecture entitled “Two Dozen (or so) Arguments for God’s Existence” at a Wheaton College philosophy conference. Now some 30 years later, this Baylor conference was dedicated to the extrapolation of the arguments Plantinga had surveyed. \n\nThe kalam cosmological argument was not one of the two dozen listed by Plantinga. But he had included in his survey a generic category called “other arguments.” So Dr. Trent Dougherty, the conference organizer, decided to include the kalam argument as one of the unnamed other arguments and invited Dr Craig to lecture on it at the conference.\n\nThe event was organized by Dr. Trent Dougherty and sponsored by the Program for Philosophical Studies of Religion. The rest of the conference can be viewed here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JmtbsEea3g4mJIgIAInrqqNcBuZqiID\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

    "description": "For more resources visit: http://www.reasonablefaith.org\n\nIn January 2015 Dr William Lane Craig spoke at Ventura Baptist Church in California. As a creative evangelistic outreach, they had set aside their regular morning services for two talks aimed at unbelievers, the first on God’s existence and the second on the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection. The first talk, entitled “Three Reasons God Exists and Three Reasons It Makes a Difference,” gave Dr Craig the chance to use for the first time all three of the animated videos on the cosmological, fine-tuning, and moral arguments for God’s existence. He then took live questions from the floor at the end of the first session and closed out the second session with a prayer of commitment for anyone wanting to place his faith in Christ. Attendance was almost double their normal church attendance. What a wonderful use of a Sunday morning! \n\nThis video is the second lecture given by Dr Craig at Ventura Baptist Church entitled, \"Did Jesus from the Dead?\"\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

    "description": "For more resources visit: http://www.reasonablefaith.org\n\nIn January 2015 Dr William Lane Craig spoke at Ventura Baptist Church in California. As a creative evangelistic outreach, they had set aside their regular morning services for two talks aimed at unbelievers, the first on God’s existence and the second on the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection. The first talk, entitled “Three Reasons God Exists and Three Reasons It Makes a Difference,” gave Dr Craig the chance to use for the first time all three of the animated videos on the cosmological, fine-tuning, and moral arguments for God’s existence. He then took live questions from the floor at the end of the first session and closed out the second session with a prayer of commitment for anyone wanting to place his faith in Christ. Attendance was almost double their normal church attendance. What a wonderful use of a Sunday morning! \n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

    "description": "For more resources visit: http://www.reasonablefaith.org\n\nIn November 2013 Dr William Lane Craig traveled to the United Kingdom to be a part of the C. S. Lewis Memorial Conference and Service. In this video, world class apologist and philosopher, William Lane Craig is interviewed by UCCF Director, Richard Cunningham, on the life and work of Oxford Scholar CS Lewis.  The interview broadens from C.S. Lewis into discussion of various topics, including:\n\n• the Kalam Cosmological Argument;\n• the Trilemma argument and the addition of 'Legend' to the question of whether Jesus is 'Lord, Liar or Lunatic' -- see also 'The Trilemma: Lord, liar or lunatic?';\n• what the titles of Son of God and Son of Man tell us about Jesus;\n• Lewis' encounter with Elizabeth Anscombe at the Socratic Club debate in 1948 and its consequences (including philosopher Alvin Plantinga's own treatment of the issue under debate -- see Plantinga's talk 'An Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism');\n• the use of imagination in apologetics and the role in apologetics of the human longing for something 'more' or 'beyond';\n• Lewis' responses to logical positivism and to postmodernism.\n\nDr Craig also states that in his own ministry he has argued that the existence of God and God's self-revelation in Jesus as shown by his resurrection from the dead are \"the twin pillars on which Christianity rests\".\n\nUCCF: The Christian Unions is made up of over 200 Christian Unions representing 20,000 Christian students from all sorts of church backgrounds and denominations. We want to give every student in Great Britain an opportunity to hear about Jesus and experience his love and kindness.\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/\n\nBe sure to also visit Reasonable Faith's other channel which contains short clips: http://www.youtube.com/drcraigvideos\n\nFollow Reasonable Faith On Twitter: http://twitter.com/rfupdates\n\nLike the Reasonable Faith Facebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/reasonablefaithorg",

Here we see a couple of brief excerpts outlining the differences between the views held by Christian William Lane Craig and atheist Shelly Kagan. Dr. Craig holds the view that objective morality can only exist if God exists; whereas Prof. Kagan asserts that rationality alone forms such a basis. For a further analysis of their exchange, and many other contemporary moral arguments, check out Dr. Craig's response to this Question of the Week: http://www.reasonablefaith.org/contemporary-moral-arguments\n\nWe welcome your comments in the Reasonable Faith forums:\nhttp://www.reasonablefaith.org/forums/",

What are some of the best arguments for God's existence? What is the Cosmological Argument? What is Leibniz's argument for God's existence? Does the contingency argument depend on a universe having a beginning? What is the Teleological Argument? What is meant by Fine-Tuning and Intelligent Design? Can the universe be \"\"designed\"\" by chance? What is the moral argument for God? Is the moral argument just an assumption? What is the difference between an assumption and intuition? Do all cultures really have different morals? What is meant by \"\"objective morality\"\"? How does Jesus' resurrection demonstrate God's existence? What are some of the evidences of Jesus' death that the majority of historical scholars agree with? What is the ontological argument? What is meant by necessary existence? What is meant by possible worlds? Are religious experiences philosophically valid? Does everything must have evidence (and arguments) prior to acceptance?
