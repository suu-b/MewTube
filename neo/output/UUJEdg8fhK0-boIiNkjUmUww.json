But here’s the problem: when these verses are taken out of context, they lose their power—and worse, they can be used to manipulate you into believing something God never actually said.\nIn this video, we’ll walk through a few of the most misused Bible verses in Christian culture. I’ll show you what they really mean in context, why the truth is actually richer and more beautiful than the surface version, and how to spot when Scripture is being twisted for emotional or spiritual manipulation.\n\nIf you want to grow in biblical discernment, understand how to interpret the Bible faithfully, and avoid false teaching, this is the place to start.\n#theology #biblestudy #christianwoman \n\n📕 Preorder my book, \"No More Boring Bible Study\" here: https://www.amazon.com/More-Boring-Bible-Study-Scripture/dp/0310369371/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ETFH8N43U6KY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Tl91Xxy-cSQri4tDGTa4dzRXVW5MamaBY-micK6fKnrGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.TXTKYxQXuyFuVc06aE6SQoxAx8Mlzpms2le_iRw_E8s&dib_tag=se&keywords=no+more+boring+bible+study+faith+womack&qid=1753421087&sprefix=no+more+boring+%2Caps%2C2416&sr=8-1\n\n🛍️Check out Biblenerdshop.com for all your merch needs\n\n💻My website: https://biblenerdministries.com/\n\n🛒Amazon storefront: https://www.amazon.com/shop/howtofaithalife?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_aipsfshop_aipsfhowtofaithalife_3X3T3GVXEFWCZ2SZS54V\n\n❤️Support this channel on Patreon & get exclusive Bible study content: https://patreon.com/howtofaithalife?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink\n\n💥Sign into/shop Faith's courses: https://courses.biblenerdministries.com/\n\n💌Get coupons/Join email list: \nhttps://successful-maker-3959.ck.page/dd8df3e2a2\n\nWrite me:   Box 6081   McKinney Tx 75071\n\n📖Check out my 1 yr Bible Reading plan here: https://shop.biblenerdministries.com/products/grace-bible-reading-plan\n\n👉Cliff notes: https://shop.biblenerdministries.com/products/cliff-notes-through-the-bible\n\n✝️Transform your Bible studies in this Bible study course I share what I learn from undergrad and seminary: https://shop.biblenerdministries.com/products/bible-study-boot-camp\n\n🎤Request Faith to speak at your conference/church: https://forms.gle/dHyV4vqk6ubGy3tQ6",

    "description": "What happens when faith feels like medicine? When Jesus becomes a “therapist” more than Lord? In this video, we explore why Jesus isn’t your therapist—and why that distinction matters more than ever in today’s emotionalized, self-help-driven Christian culture. \n\nWe'll look at what the Bible actually says about healing, brokenness, and restoration—and how the gospel offers more than just “feeling better.” This isn’t a slam on counseling (Christian therapy can be a gift!), but a reminder: Jesus didn’t die just to make you emotionally well. He came to make you new.\n\nIf you’ve been wondering where theology fits into your emotional healing or how Christian influencers have blurred the line between biblical truth and therapeutic language, this video’s for you.\n\n💻My website: https://biblenerdministries.com/\n\n🛒Amazon storefront: https://www.amazon.com/shop/howtofaithalife?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_aipsfshop_aipsfhowtofaithalife_3X3T3GVXEFWCZ2SZS54V\n\n❤️Support this channel on Patreon & get exclusive Bible study content: https://patreon.com/howtofaithalife?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink\n\n💥Sign into/shop Faith's courses: https://courses.biblenerdministries.com/\n\n💌Get coupons/Join email list: \nhttps://successful-maker-3959.ck.page/dd8df3e2a2\n\nWrite me:   Box 6081   McKinney Tx 75071\n\n📖Check out my 1 yr Bible Reading plan here: https://shop.biblenerdministries.com/products/grace-bible-reading-plan\n\n👉Cliff notes: https://shop.biblenerdministries.com/products/cliff-notes-through-the-bible\n\n✝️Transform your Bible studies in this Bible study course I share what I learn from undergrad and seminary: https://shop.biblenerdministries.com/products/bible-study-boot-camp\n\n🎤Request Faith to speak at your conference/church: https://forms.gle/dHyV4vqk6ubGy3tQ6",

It seems like everyone is talking about textual criticism but no scholars are sharing first hand about their work... except Dan Wallace. He's welcomed us into his home and shares today everything from the ordering of the Biblical Canon, how he catalogues manuscripts, and the reliability of those manuscripts.\n#bible #textualcriticism #biblicalmanuscripts\n\nJoin me in supporting CSNTM, the Center for the study of New Testament Manuscripts here: https://new.csntm.org/hey-bible-nerds-youre-invited/ \nNOTE that the link works better on desktop, but if you are on your phone, flip it sideways and the form should be more readable.\nFrom WHOMEVER joins from my link to support the ministry of CSNTM, I will draw on 3/1/2025 FOUR names to win a signed copy of the NET Bible.

It's a document that gives you \"cliff notes\" for every book of the Bible. The stuff you NEED to know to study it and REALLY understand it.\nI was sick of books that are supposed to give you that information just not being enough.\n\nThey'd either be too intellectual, too boring, too simple, or not really enhance my Bible study. So I took those resources, my seminary notes, hundreds of hours, and made my Bible Cliff Notes!\n\nI am so proud of this thing.\nBut also kinda sick of staring at them computer screen. (it's nice that they are done, I'm going to be honest!) All that to say, I can finally say:\nTHEY ARE HERE!\nI've poured my heart and soul into these things, obsessing over what you need to know and what you don't need to know. I obsessed over what is the best advice for Bible studying the book and how to make it less overwhelming. I've made these with a heart for you.\nCheck out my cliff notes to every book of the Bible here and never be lost in reading the Bible ever again!\nBTW: snag them before the end of the year, because in the new year they will go up in price!\nI pray these bless you, because I KNOW they will transform your Bible study.\nSee you there: https://howtofaithalife.samcart.com/products/cliffnotes\n\n#christian    #christianyoutuber  #biblestudy \n\n\nThis description may include affiliate links(some of the links give me a commission).\n\n\nMerch store: https://how-to-faith-a-life.creator-spring.com/\n\n\nInstagram, tiktok and twitter: @BibleNerdMinistries\n\n\nWebsite/Links: https://biblenerdministries.com/\n\nHow to Faith a Life\nBox #6081\nMckinney, TX 75071\nemail: howtofaithalife@gmail.com",

So grab your bible, pens, and get excited because I can pretty much guarantee you haven't heard some of these things before! \nI am a strong believer in the power of studying the context of a biblical passage. Like, the context of what was happening, the literary styles used, the book's purpose and themes, etc. These things add SO MUCH depth to the bible study and that's what I focus on today. Too often we've memorized John 3:16 or really want our kids to memorize it, but we don't know the context, ourselves! And if we don't know the context, they how do we know that we aren't taking it OUT of context?! Today's video we look at just that: the context, story, themes behind John 3, what was going on in the conversation with Nicodemus and what we are supposed to see in this passage that we just might miss!\n\nMy channel exists to equip and encourage you to live a life of faith!

    "description": "What is a virtuous woman? What is Proverbs 31 about? Today, bible journal with me Proverbs 31 in a women's daily devotional, talking about wisdom, Godliness, and womanhood.\nIn today's bible study with me, we are talking all about the proverbs 31 woman and the wisdom personified here. I mention that this could be a literal woman, too- but that there needs to be an acknowledgment that we couldn't possibly do everything that this woman does EVERY SINGLE DAY. This impossible standard of the woman in proverbs 31 is one that should send us to our knees- true wisdom is running to the Lord to be our everything.\nWe also look at this chapter in light of the book of proverbs as a whole- doing an in-depth bible study means you look at the context and the themes of the book! And that is what we do today. My prayers is not that you just learn a lot from this women's daily devotional, but that you also benefit from it and grow in faith.

The cool thing about bible journaling is it all adds upon itself, so certain words may stick out to me this time, but next time when I come back to it, I may notice something new, which gives a new perspective to my previous notes, which just adds to what I am learning, and it's all because I have those bible journaling notes in my bible to read and reread and build off! \nNow, I feel the need to note that just because this is how I study my bible, doesn't mean that you need to also study your bible exactly this way, this is just how my brain works and what works for encouraging MY heart! \n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\nLinks:\nIf you want to check out my bible journaling sticker club on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/howtofaithalife\n\nLink to my bible on Amazon: https://rb.gy/7qfmhl\n\nFree downloadable bible study on \"How to Grow Closer to God\":\nhttps://successful-maker-3959.ck.page/ccd1c41f1a\n\n#biblejournaling #biblejournal #howistudymybible\nHow to Faith a Life\nPO BOX #706\nKingstree, SC. 29556\nEmail: howtofaithalife@gmail.com",

    "description": "Prayer Journal flip through and get all kinds of prayer journal ideas from my prayer journal to my husband spanning from 2003-2016! This is one of my favorite things I did in my life that actually was very therapeutic through those hard days, waiting for my man! So, I am going to walk you through it and hopefully give you LOTS of prayer journal ideas on praying for your future husband. I hope you enjoy reading journals written to future husband and wife videos- because this one is very humorous and embarassing!\nNow, if you've been here a while, you may already know this, but my husband was my first boyfriend and first kiss. I was SUPER intentional about not dating in high school, just because I wanted to set that time aside to bible study more and grow closer to God. Then, when I was ready to date, I was VERY intentional about WHO I'd date. When I finally let go and dated someone, it turned out to be my husband and now we're married for four years! \nIn today's video I flip through with you my prayer journal to my husband and share all kinds of prayer journal ideas to start a prayer journal to your future husband, and the parts of my prayer journal that were the most therapeutic. \nIf you like prayer journal videos and videos that give you ideas for your prayer journal diy stuff, then definitely check out this video:\nhttps://youtu.be/Pc8EyavHwhM\nMy prayer is this prayer journal flip through will inspire you to start a prayer journal for your future husband and get you excited for praying for him, in general! These prayer journal ideas are very practical with an emphasis on making it be what you need it to be- because I definitely think theres an emphasis on surrendering in your prayer journal for future husband. Praying for your future husband or praying for your future spouse can be so healthy and so helpful! Reading journals written to future husband and wife can always be so helpful but also a little cringe-y, so I tried to laugh at myself and only share out of my journal what you guys needed! \n\nIf you'd like to see more about how to prayer journal or prayer journaling, I'd be happy to share more, just let me know down in the comments!

    "description": "Biblical hermeneutics and how to read the bible faithfully is the topic today- biblical hermeneutics is the interpretation of the bible. We look at the most used and abused verse in all of the bible. I bible study this passage and we talk about why people misuse it and how to have a faithful and biblical hermetical approach. This video is part of my series on how to read the bible where we look at all the different approaches and things that feed into our approach of the bible. Today's video looks at good hermeneutics and a hermeneutics bible study. We sit in Phillippians 4 and talk about the #1 thing that people miss when reading it. In this hermeneutics bible study we will bible study with me Phillippians 4 so make sure you have your bible and get ready to dive deep! \nIf you like videos like this one, or are interested in the rest of my series on how to read the bible, check out the series here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMpDclT-2HtigIQhzdugO3R_LNQzZVZc\n\nAnd if you'd like to learn more about biblical hermeneutics, I encourage you to watch this video:\nhttps://youtu.be/NW5QnATfgH8\nI hope you are encouraged as we talk about exegesis and hermeneutics and all about what is hermeneutics.

A good hermeneutic uses the hermeneutical approach of the triangle, but other than that, there isn't necessarily a step by step that I can give you! \nI pray this hermeneutics bible study has motivated you to dig deeper, and if that's something that you want to do, then check out my how to read the bible playlist up above! \nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#howtofaithalife #Jesusformommies #hermeneutics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFather, use this hermeneutics crash course and our look at Philippians 4 to glorify You!

Today we're talking about how to read the bible's literary styles- everything from prophesies, wisdom, poetry, etc! \nOne of the craziest parts that I love about this video is that like NO ONE talks about this stuff, it seems like. And, that's why scripture is always being misused, because it was written for one thing, but is being used for another!

    "title": "HOW TO READ THE OLD TESTAMENT - Covenant Theology (Reformed Theology), How to Read the Bible",
    "description": "Hey friends! Today we are going to talk about how to read the Old Testament with eyes looking for Jesus- using Covenant theology. This reformed theology is transformative in how to read the bible and I am so excited to dive in! \nBut first, this video, about how to read the old testament, is part of my \"How to Read the Bible\" series- in this series I seek to de-mystify some common questions in how to read the bible and just make it all as simple as possible! So if this is something you'd be interested in, make sure to hit the subscribe button and let me know in the comments if there's anything you'd like to hear about! I'd be happy to make a video and answer any questions! \nIf this video helps you, will you let Youtube know by giving it a \"thumbs up\"? That's just a really simple way to help other's find my videos on how to read the bible! \nIn today's video on how to read the bible, we are talking specifically about how to read the Old Testament through the lens of Covenant Theology. Reformed theology finds Covenant theology to be a core factor in why we read the Old Testament. So, when we talk about how to read the old testament I want you to keep in mind that this is also just how to read the bible and not just the Old Testament! Covenant theology is so very crucial to seeing Jesus in the entire Bible narrative! Reformed Theology tells us that Christ is in it all! \nSo today, I share an Old Testament overview and an Old Testament timeline to kind of point out the big parts where we see Jesus and a need for Jesus, other than the prophets. It is crucial in your old testament bible reading to know how to study the bible through the lens of Covenant theology or else there is so much that will be missed! So that is also why I wanted to address this earlier on in my how to read the bible series, is how to read the Old Testament in a Christ-centered way. Frankly, if we don't use Covenant theology, then there really isn't much point to read the Old Testament! I can see  why people might ask, \"why read the old testament?\"! So, maybe you're asking, should a christian read the old testament, and I'd say a BIG YES! In fact, I'd say a big part of Covenant theology is knowing how to read the bible and thus seeing the old testament simplified- with the lens of seeing Christ! I hope this old testament timeline and old testament overview encourage you to jump into God's Word and dig deep!\nBecause, Christ is there! It's not, \"should Christians read the Old Testament\"? It's DO Christians read the Old Testament and see Christ, because that's what we are supposed to see, in the old testament simplified!\nAnd hopefully this video gets you motivated as I share how do I read the old testament to make you want to jump into the Old Testament scriptures TODAY! Read through the Old testament not because I say you should, but because God has given you a desire to! \nLet me know in the comments if you have any leftover questions after this old testament explained overview. I tried to present an old testament simplified old testament overview, but there's no telling if I actually made Covenant theology simple! That's why I love y'alls feedback!\nMake sure to check out the rest of this playlist and my other videos here on how to faith a life- I'd love to answer any questions you may have about Covenant theology and reformed theology, and I will see y'all on Friday! \nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#howtoreadthebible #howtoreadtheoldtestament #covenanttheology",

If not, will you hit the like button if this video at least helped you? That would help this video out a lot! Thank you.\nDisclaimer: As you watch me bible journal, you'll see that I am not perfect & I hope that's just truly evident in all I do in this bible study with me the women of the bible series- that our bible journaling doesn't have to be perfect- it won't ever be. But that that isn't what God asks of us. We are just called to delight in His Word. To dive deep into the scriptures & if when you watch me bible journal, it takes the attention away from delighting in God's Word, then maybe my bible journaling videos aren't for you. Or maybe you don't need to try to use the free bible study printables, then. The last thing I want to put attention on is the crafty-ness of the bible study free printables or on bible journaling, the attention as we learn how to study the bible needs to be on God & His goodness! Rahab is such a testimony of that, too! \n\nFather God, use this bible study with me video in this new women of the bible series to bless women who are looking for bible study videos here on youtube, & are seeking out Christian youtubers and a Christian community here. May they be encouraged by the testimonies of women of the bible and women in the bible whose lives are not perfect, but rather VERY relatable! As they watch me bible journal, & as I ask them to study the bible with me, may it not be about me, but YOU! When they print these free bible study printables, may the bible journaling & the prayers lead them to delight in You and Your Word! And may this women's bible study glorify You, God! \n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack \n\n#biblestudywithme #bswm #womensbiblestudy",

    "title": "PRODUCTIVE MOM MORNING ROUTINE: online student and stay at home mom in seminary grad school",
    "description": "Today's video is a 4am productive mom morning routine of an online student and stay at home mom. In this grad school mom routine of a stay at home mom and online student, I show you how I get it all done- online school work & being a student mom, and all that is involved in my productive early morning routine. I hope this productive student mom morning routine inspires and encourages you that 4am isn't THAT scary!\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack #studentmom #howtofaithalife #gradstudentmom\nAs an online student and stay at home mom, there is definitely enough time in my day to do grad school work, but that would mean no time spent with my two boys. So, I get up early in the morning and have my grad school mom routine, so that the majority of my online school work is done in the mornings during this productive mom morning routine. I think it is important to have a grad school mom routine if I am going to get most, if not all my grad school work done in the AM. THUS, a 4am morning routine. I love being a mom in seminary, but if I am not careful, I can easily loose track & forget what's important- my boys. That's why I am extremely thoughtful about the ways I spend my early morning routine. As an online student and stay at home mom, I need to live by check lists and my planner to make sure my morning routine is a PRODUCTIVE morning routine. As as a christian mom, I KNOW I need to seize the day! \nBut, that doesn't mean I'm a workaholic! In my 4am morning routine I make sure there's time for me to take care of myself! I show you how I, as a Christian mom, get that time with Jesus in my christian mom morning routine. I also noticed that so many stay at home mom morning routines do not feed the soul & so I really try to emphasize that I need to start my mornings w/ Jesus. Also, it's important to note that as a christian mom & as a mom in seminary, it can be easy to get tired of all this bible related stuff, so I make sure I am enjoying & glorifying & worshiping Him FIRST before I start my student mom morning routine! \nWhat kind of morning routine do you have as a student mom? I really would love to hear about your christian mom morning routine or your grad school mom routine!\nIn this morning routine of a student mom video, I pray you are encouraged that your morning routine doesn't have to be this real elaborate thing. To be a productive mom with a productive morning routine 2020, all you need is the time that you get when you wake up for a early morning mom routine! So this morning routines 2020 online school edition is focused around staying awake & staying productive, because for me that's the key to a productive morning routine; just giving yourself that time & making sure you stay productive! \nOnce the boys wake up my productive morning routine goes kind of wack b/c I have 2 kids two & under it's just crazy. Typically, I'll let them eat breakfast in their highchairs & we'll sing songs & giggle while I finish online grad school. I guess that's another tip of a online student and stay at home mom, to use eating time as productive mom time. But typically my true 4am productive mom morning routine ends when they wake up. I guess what I am trying to say is it is okay if your sahm routine isn't perfectly ROUTINE. \nIf you are new here consider subscribing to how to faith a life & check out my other christian mom videos. I am a christian mom & grad student mom in seminary. I love making all kinds of bible study videos & I would love to have you subscribe if that's the kind of christian mom videos that you'd like! \n\nGod, use this grad school mom routine to bless a discouraged christian mom out there that she can make a productive mom morning routine! Or a discouraged mom in seminary.  I pray when they see this 4am morning routine that they are encouraged if they are also a grad student mom. In this productive morning routine 2020 may someone see that if they want to be a mom in seminary, they can be. Encourage a christian mom to go to school through my grad school mom routine. I guess what I am praying is may this 4am mom morning routine bring You glory and honor You, Jesus! When people hear that I am a mom in seminary, don't let them get the wrong idea, that I am not 'holier than thou' but just like any other student mom grad student. May they be encouraged whether they have a 6am productive mom morning routine or a 4am mom morning routine. It's not about the time of day, it's about using a early morning routine to change the day into a productive mom morning routine if you're a grad student or if you're a stay at home mom. Father, use this early morning routine to encourage and motivate other christian moms that they can make productive morning routines for Your glory to better serve their families and homes! May not anyone be intimidated by this christian mom productive morning routine, but encouraged. If someone is looking up christian mom morning routines, may they find this productive morning routine & be inspired!",

    "title": "CHRISTIAN MOM IN SEMINARY: mom of two in seminary grad school | young christian mom day in the life",
    "description": "Welcome to a day in the life of a young christian mom in seminary! I'm learning to focus on intentional living now that I'm a mom of two in seminary grad school. Intentional living is so important because time has gotten rarer and more precious! I have to be intentional about every hour of the day! \n\nEvery part of this day in the life is a great example of how I am focused on intentional living- thinking through how I can get everything done as a mom of two in seminary. I have to plan out house chores, youtube work, seminary lectures and readings and papers, and even plan out time to be a normal person. Being a young christian mom isn't easy, but it's so worth it. I love my life and I am focused on spending my days well and not 'wasting' a single one of them!\nIn this day in the life, I'll show you basically everything for a day, our morning run, nap routines, meal routines, chores, homework- all of it! We talk about the concept of intentional living and hopefully I give you a good representation of what a day in the life of a young christian mom looks like. We talk about intentionally living every hour to the glory of God and so that's why I am so focused on school and being present with my boys and marriage. Showing up for it all. \n\nBut yeah, let's talk more about this mom in seminary thing- I recently started online seminary classes, and since I did an undergrad degree in Biblical and Theological studies, I was able to transfer credits, so I am jumping into it full force as a full time student and mom of two. I remember watching ditl of a college mom kind of stuff here on Youtube and always wondering how moms kept their sanity, so I tried to show you it all, today. A true, raw and real young christian mom day in the life! This isn't a college mom vlog where everything is nice and calm and orderly, my life is a mess just like everyone else's! But, I am loving this new challenge of being a mom of two in seminary. It's an awesome season of life, making me dial in, on what's important and necessary and what's not! I re-evaluating how I spend my time and how I show up as a grad student mom in the classroom and in the house. I don't have to get straight A's. That's just not necessary. But I am called to be a faithful mom. And that's what I focus on when I am trying to evaluate my life and time with eyes focused on intentional living. As a mom of two in grad school, I don't need netflix and facebook, I need Jesus and I want a nap and coffee! haha. \n\nI pray that this mom ditl encourages and motivates you that you got this day, whatever lies ahead of you in your own life. I am a big believer that we all need more young christian mom encouragement, and I pray that this video did just that for you! \n\nIf you are also a young christian mom, especially a mom of two in grad school, or a student mom or a mom in seminary, please please please comment down below! I WOULD LOVE more student mom friends! And let me know if you also make ditl graudate student kind of videos because I would love to watch your videos and glean wisdom from the way you do life and make it all happen. \n\nIf you are new here, welcome to how to faith a life! My name is faith and I have this channel, #howtofaithalife . Consider subscribing, liking and sharing! \n\nFather, use this video about my life as a grad student mom to encourage other student moms out there. Especially women in seminary who are afraid that they can't do it all or think that they are all alone. Use this video to encourage other young christian moms to pursue intentional living and not waste a day of their lives away with mindless living. While people are scrolling youtube and looking at college mom vlogs, I pray for future friends to find my video, so that we can connect and become internet friends! \n\nMay this mom ditl video not make anyone feel inadequate in any way, but motivate and just provide young christian mom encouragement for student moms or christian moms. If anyone is considering becoming a women in seminary, may this video motivate and encourage them that they can do it! We need more people to be that awkward female in seminary and change the perception that seminary is just for pastors! \n\nAnd I pray for that grad student mom who is tired and weary and feels defeated. She may never watch this video, only scroll by, meet her with YOURSELF. Heal, empower, motivate and rejuvenate her in You... the well of living water, where we will drink and thirst no more. \n\nMay this ditl student mom show a realistic, not perfect take and encourage any insecure moms out there, that no one's life is perfect. And that we all need Jesus and He is the safe rock we can run to and find refuge! \n\nFather, use this video, a silly ditl of a christian mom in seminary, to encourage someone. To send someone running to You that has been running from You. Use this video for Your glory, Your kingdom come and Your will be done!\n#christianmom #jesusformommies",

    "description": "Hey faithful friends! Welcome back to part two of my testimony and Q&A! Today's video I share my testimony of singleness and dating! I know in the christian dating world, singleness and dating are buzz words and everyone has preconceived notions about what each of those things feels like, but my job is just to share my testimony of how God protected my heart and gave me my answered prayers and now I am a young christian mom and so grateful I listened and followed! \n\nSingleness and dating are two of the hardest trials young Christians face in this day and age and I am not here to lay a hard a fast rule about how to handle that topic. But, I do want to share my testimony and story of how God provided abundantly above all I could ask or imagine in my experience of Christian dating. And I do share a little christian dating advice... but again, it should be handled differently for each person's situation! \n\nIn high school, as a newer, young christian, I felt the call to choose christian singleness in order to focus more on my relationship with the Lord and I am so glad I did! Because it honestly saved me from a TON of heartbreak! I think that might be my number one single christian women advice, actually! No one says you HAVE to date right now. Relationships are hard and demanding and a wise woman knows when she can't handle one! \n\nI got married at a young age, and see all along the way how God provided and carried and called me to get married at 21. Now, fast forward 4 years later, and two kids later, I am a young christian mom who is SO GRATEFUL for where she is. Y'all know from watching my videos what it's like being married at 21 and my life post-marriage, but today I just wanted to share more details about how I got to be a young christian mom and christian dating testimonies. \n\nThis video was stirred on by your questions about how I met my husband and I hope it is a more than sufficient answer! I also know a lot of people love watching how I met my husband christian testimonies and so I pray my story encourages someone out there! When you hear my how I met my husband christian stories, be encouraged that God is at work and turn and glorify Him! I want all glory to go to God that He provided an amazing husband and all along the way of saving myself for marriage. \n\nIf you like videos like this one, consider subscribing to how to faith a life! I have a whole series for moms, if you're also a young christian mom! Check it out on my Jesus for mommies playlist! I make christian mom devotionals and bible study videos for really anyone!

    "description": "Hey, faithful friends! Bible study with me today James 5:1-6! Today's women's bible study is on James 5 and we look at the bible study topic of money. This daily devotional video also comes with a free printable which can be found here: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rtjn6xvjwUiyWGrMT_8le7RO5z1HKThK/view?usp=sharing\nNow, in today's bible study with me we look at the topic of the wealthy, and we discuss a lot of money.... stuff. I think there is often a lot of spiritual warfare around this topic, so I would just encourage you to lean into this daily devotional video. You might be tempted to click out or get distracted with something else, but really ask the Lord to speak to your heart and MOVE! \nSo, this bible study with me is on James chapter 5 and we are looking at verses 1-6. So, grab your bible and print the free printable from the link above and bible study with me! \nIn this #BSWM I try to share a lot of tips on how I study the bible, and grow your knowledge on how to study the bible, and I pray these free printables help in that area. Whether you are bible journaling, doing a topical study on money, or learning how to study the bible for beginners, I hope this bible study free printable blesses you! I also hope that this bible study with me video blesses you, in and of itself! I know not everyone does the free printables and I benefit from just normal bible study with me videos, so I pray that no matter what your involvement with this daily devotional is, that it blesses you and points you to Jesus! \nAs you bible study with me, keep in mind that this bible study is not made to replace a personal private time with the Lord, but rather to add to it. You can watch bible study videos all day long and listen to sermons all day long, but if you never pray to the Lord yourself, you haven't built a relationship with God, but rather a study of God. We study God because we love Him and we love His Word, but this bible study with me shouldn't replace personal private daily devotional time with God. So, while you study the bible with me, know that your own personal walk with the Lord cannot consist of bible study with me videos, but needs to be just you and God, and while I want to assist and help others learn how to study the bible for beginners, praying and reading God's Word is all that's needed. When you bible study with me, keep that in mind. It's not that I have all the answers, at all. I may have a formal education in Bible, but the Holy Spirit knows no limits! So, bible study with me and Jesus, and remember there's nothing fancy to it! \nIf you like these bible study with me videos and would be interested in more women's bible study videos, check out my channel; How to Faith a Life and my whole series: Jesus for mommies.

When I ask someone to study the bible with me, may they not see someone other than just another broken sinner in need of Your mercies.

As a Christian Youtuber, I think it's really important to do all I can to be as real as possible with you guys- giving you bible study videos and such but also sharing just real life stuff like marriage, parenting, my testimony, etc. In today's Q&A I share all that! \nSO, I posted and asked for your questions on the community tab and I try to go through most the questions and next monday we will talk more about my testimony about singleness and dating.

    "description": "Hey faithful friends! Welcome back to another Bible study with me through James video, today's passage that we are looking at is James 4:13-17. This is also the last day of our bible study with me challenge, the fifth day of the challenge! So, if you have been taking part in that challenge or want to start it today, you can find it here:\nhttps://youtu.be/cgRcktuMe1M\nThe bible study with me challenge is something you can do at any time, you don't have to do it when I am doing it, so maybe you are watching these videos 3 years from now, join the challenge! Tag me in a picture, I'd love to hear that the bible study with me challenge is still being used! \nToday's bible study is on James 4:3-17, finishing up chapter 4 and next week we will start chapter 5! I have absolutely loved this bible study with me through james series, and so I am sad that it is coming to an end! But we still have three more videos, I believe! This morning bible study we dive into the idea of making plans without God. We talk about the common cultural habits of leaving God out of plan-making and in this daily bible study, the last one of our bible study with me challenge (which focused on attitudes when coming to the Lord) we approach the attitude of having your life in the palm of His hands. As a Christian youtuber, I want to use whatever audience I have to bring glory to God and to help teach those younger in the faith how to study the bible. So in this bible study with me challenge, I really tried to share with y'all how I study the bible through those free printables. \nBut, even more so, I pray this bible study with me James series has shown you, week by week through the videos, how I study the bible and how each time it's a little different, based on the text. I pray that this bible study for women shows you how to approach this passage a little more biblically today, and if you like these women's bible study through James, would you hit the \"like\" button? It helps tell Youtube that I am doing something right and they can show my video to other people that may like it, too! \nAnd if you want to study the bible with me more, hit that subscribe button and the bell notifications so that you can see my next bible study with me video when it comes out! I absolutely love making these women's bible study series and so I am already planning out for the future and getting excited! \nSo often I see on other christian youtubers channels that their bible study with me videos don't scratch much deeper than the surface, and so my passion is to give you what you won't get on other channels, like not just my thoughts but wise theologians or pastor's notes on the passage! And I pray that that rings true here in this bible study with me james 4. I guess that's just another tip on how to study the bible for beginners; I like to listen to as many sermons on the passage/topic as possible, and read as much on it as possible- almost like I were writing a research paper on the passage! \nI pray this bible study series blesses you, make sure to check out the whole playlist here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMpDclT-2HsxNti-VcvxTl2rMgI_YpQL\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#howtofaithalife\n#biblestudy\n#biblestudywithme\n\n\nFather God, bless whomever watches this video on the other side of the screen. May they hear and see You in me. May they learn how I study my bible not for my glory, but so they can apply it in their own lives and grow! May these bible study lessons in this bible study with me challenge bless them. Speak through me. Be glorified in me, this is Your show! God, use how to faith a life for Your glory! Amen",

    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome back to another bible study with me video in James 4! Today's women's daily devotional is a look at judgmental attitudes and though its just 2 verses, it is a HEAVY womens morning devotional! So, grab your bibles and get ready to study the bible with me in James 4!\nBut first, if you are new here: this video is a part of my James bible study series here on my channel which is just made up of morning bible study videos that take a deep dive, verse section by verse section through the book of James.\nOften times, I'll make free printable ladies bible study lessons and today's can be found here: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-DRsmT2RVnUJKgXQTv7gq88qEvSgndf/view?usp=sharing\n\nIf you'd like to check out the whole playlist, you can find it here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMpDclT-2HsxNti-VcvxTl2rMgI_YpQL\nToday's bible study with me is one that looks at judgment among believers and addresses our sinful tendencies to judge one another, despite the fact that we are all the redeemed. As a Christian youtuber, I know that this bible study with me video could do one of two things to your heart: you may be tempted to say, \"wow, we shouldn't judge each other period! Church discipline is outdated approach and keeping people accountable and calling them out in sin isn't fun, so let's just not!\" or you could or you could respond to this morning bible study like, \"people need to be able to critique others more often, its in LoVe!\" and I tried to address both these responses in this bible study with me video. We work through these verses honestly and realistically in this real time bible study with me, so I try to address the fact that this is a touchy issue and there are many ways to look at it! \n\nIf you are interested in more info on how I study the bible, feel free to check out this video: https://youtu.be/DsL5b-zp7B8   In it, I talk about how to study the bible like a pastor and how to use commentaries, Greek and Hebrew word studies, bible study tips, etc. I hope this video even gives you some good bible study tips as you bible study with me, and we work through the free printable bible study!\nI pray this #biblestudywithme video will bless and encourage you, and if there is any questions you have about this bible study, make sure to leave them below in the comments!!! I love fellowshipping with y'all after I post my bible study with me videos, because you guys always add the best comments and things that I forgot to mention/left out!\nIf you like bible study with me videos or free printable bible study content, definitely hit the subscribe button! I love making these videos and definitely feel like God has called me to this, so there will definitely be more in your subscriptions page! I also have plenty that you can find on my channel. And if this video added anything to your personal encouragement or walk with Christ, would you hit the like button? It just helps the ministry out SO MUCH!\nI am thinking I might make a bible study routine video, if that's something you'd be interested in, let me know in the comments! I know videos like this one really help show my bible study routine and bible study tips, but I think to have a specific video dedicated to it, might be helpful?! I don't know!\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#christianyoutuber\n#biblestudy\n\n\n\nFather God, I pray that this women's daily devotional will bless at least just one person. And I pray for anyone watching it that doesn't know You- may they see You in me. Glory be to You alone. As a Christian youtuber, when I make these womens morning devotional videos its so easy to worry about mean comments or someone finding fault with what I say that I think more about that than someone coming to find a saving knowledge of You in this bible study with me. So, I pray, God- may the words that I say not only be acceptable in Your sight but may how I study the bible and the free printable bible study encourage and strengthen the faith of someone in need of it, today. As I ask people to study the bible with me, take away distractions and may they be drawn in by Your Spirit and Your love wash over them. This passage in James 4 can be misused and skewed so many different ways, may this women's daily devotional draw the attention to what the Bible says and no other sinful tendencies or focus. God, I know I have extra responsibility as a Christian Youtuber, and in a lot of ways people will JUDGE me a little harsher and that's so scary. So I pray, may this bible study with me video bless others more than anything else. Work in me, DESPITE my sinful, brokenness! Use me and these silly, crazy, videos! As a Christian girl youtuber, may this video reach those who it needs to reach and bless those that it does reach. Maybe it will show someone new to the faith how to bible study for beginners or inspire someone tired in the faith with some bible study tips, but either way- may this bible study with me video inspire and encourage SOMEONE! Amen.",

    "title": "CHRISTIAN REGRETS?! || God's word for today & scripture for today on regrets || Today's bible verse",
    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome to a video today where we explore God's word for today on Christian regrets and what it means to regret something you've done, when you're a Christian. A really popular idea is to live life with no regrets. In today's bible verse, we uncover why that's not really a biblical idea. This idea, to live your life with so much pride in yourself and your choices that you don't regret anything, isn't biblical at all! In this video, exploring Gods word for today, we see that when we look at Christian regrets with a Biblical lens, today's scripture makes it clear that we should regret our sin. Today's bible verse show us that we should loathe and hate sin! This video looks at scripture for today and hopefully will motivate you to run to the cross, run to Jesus as our only hope and life. \n\nI hope you enjoy this video, where I share some bible scripture for today. If you like videos like this one, I'd encourage you to hit the like button and comment down below what you'd want the next video to be about! I think I might do more bible verse for today videos, where I share a daily bible verse and some commentary on it. I have been thinking about daily videos for a while, now. Today's bible reading talks about a lot of grace and gospel and if those are some things you don't know much about, I'd encourage you to comment below and ask someone, even me! \n\nIt should also be noted: this womens daily devotional video should not replace today's bible reading that you do on your own. But rather, should just add to it! My videos will never be able to replace a personal relationship with Jesus Christ! God's word for today needs to be prayed and meditated on in private, one on one with God, not just consumed off Youtube! So never let my videos or when I share God's word for today, replace anything you'd do on your own! \n\nLet me know in the comments your favorite verse and your favorite place to find a daily bible verse! And if this video of God's word for today to you about your own Christian regrets, sin, and brokenness has encouraged you, would you consider sharing this video with someone else? Maybe there's someone in your life that God has brought to mind that would benefit from this video! Consider sharing it, and I so appreciate it!  Today's bible reading can apply to all of us, because we are all such broken sinners. \n\nIf you are new here, this is my channel, How to Faith a Life, and I make all sorts of womens daily devotional videos and daily bible devotions or Christian mom videos. So you should definitely check out my channel and all that's going on there! I've been doing a series of women's morning devotional videos working through James and Christian motivational series here, called Jesus for da morning, which you can find the whole playlist for here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMpDclT-2HvYZVmW_KIh8387yydkkrNP\n\nAnd if you were encouraged by today's bible verse give it a thumbs up!\nI love watching videos like this one which include god's word for today for me and inspire and motivate me to keep running the race set before me in my Christian life. I hope this video does the same for you. If you struggle with having Christian regrets or the weight of your Christian regret bares down on you sometimes, this video is for you.\nFather, I pray that this daily bible reading on Christian regrets and the words I say will do nothing but primarily give you glory. I pray for the one person who might see it, who is unsure about their faith and what they believe, give them all they need to be encouraged TOWARDS you today, through this video. I pray the word for today that is shared will only encourage and motivate people towards YOU, and nothing else. God, I am always so weary of coming off as preachy and sharing today's bible verse and some commentary naturally was something I felt led to do, but now that I am posting it, I am scared and insecure and I know You know that, but I pray that this daily bible devotions series and all the videos that You lead me to make here will shout Your glory. You do with my channel what You want to do. May today's scripture be true to Your intent and Your glory. Lead me as I have a desire to do something like daily scripture reading or making daily bible devotions videos. I am not sure what to do with this desire, but lead me even in this video, sharing today's bible verse. I am not sure what quite to do! But, nonetheless, You get the glory! May any daily scripture reading videos that I do get up, only do that: bring You all the glory! Today's bible study talks about regret and Christian regrets- and I know that there will be very vulnerable hearts watching this video: turn their attention to You and Your saving work on the cross and towards repentance and us all receiving God's word for me today. May today's bible verse shared and scripture reading read only praise You and nothing of myself. Amen\n#biblestudy\n#Godsword\n#noregrets\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack",

Well, I got all the mom motivation you need to get up off the couch and go be the mom you're called to be! This encouragement for moms is needed so much here on youtube, so I figured, if no one else is going to make it, I will!\nI pray this video brings you some extreme motivation and a pep talk for moms needing that extra push towards productivity and well, a push against the general unmotivated feeling a lot of us are feeling from 2020!\nIf you like cleaning motivation videos or really any kind of get it all done extreme motivation videos, than you're going to love this! \n\n\n\nFather, I pray that this video provides some serious motivation for moms that not only gets them encouraged and inspired, but also reminds them of the truths you say over them. I don't want to just provide some extreme motivation that gets them cleaning or running around mopping or feeling like it's the worst thing in the world to have a house that's a complete disaster. No, the worst thing in the world is to not have a relationship with You, and God, I want to remind them of that! Father, use this mom motivation and pep talk to give those tired moms out there the encouragement they need to push through the rest of the day. Whether they are a single mom, or a stay at home mom, or a teen mom- whatever their story is, God, You know it- draw them closer to You through this video. May it glorify You! I am Yours.\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/howtofaithalife",

    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome back! Today's 5am mommy morning routine is a realistic morning routine of a productive mom of 2 kids. Realistically, this is what I can expect to get done on the average morning with my kiddos asleep. I made this 5am productive mom morning routine to hopefully inspire you and your morning routine and hopefully give you the motivation to set that alarm clock if needed! \n\nI am a big believer in the power of motivation, so if you need motivation to set the alarm or get out of bed, or whatever, go ahead and check out this playlist of inspiration for moms: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMpDclT-2HvYZVmW_KIh8387yydkkrNP\n\nI have also been thinking about making an in depth christian mom bible study routine video, so if that's something you're interested in, let me know and I would love making that as well!\nIf you're new here to How to Faith a Life, I make all kinds of christian mom ditl videos and christian mom bible study videos, so definitely check out my channel and the other stuff I have going on! \nIn this christian mom morning routine I walk you through the little things I do which make a big impact on my day and outlook with my two littles. Being a sahm of two under two can be really challenging and so that is why I have found my morning routine to be so incredibly important to my productive mom life, but also spiritual life and mental health! \nLet me know in the comments what you have in your christian mom morning routines and what I should add to mine! I love hearing about other people's christian mom morning schedule or even mom bible study routine because it makes me re-evaluate my own and check motives/etc. \n\nBut, all that to say, I typically wake up with the primary motive to get in time for my mom bible study routines and then prepare for a day of sahm life! My mom morning routine 2 under 2 isn't something unpredictable or completely different from everyone else, but it's totally necessary for me and that's why I am sharing it with you! I am a big believer in setting routines for YOU, not because you feel like you OUGHT to do this or that but your mom morning routines 2020 should be what YOU NEED and be YOU TIME! After all, if I'm going to wake up before the sun, it better be to serve myself! haha. So, this mom morning routines 2020 2 under 2 is a lot about what I need to prepare for the marathon day ahead of me! \n\nIf you struggle or have struggled (like me) with postpartum depression or anxiety, you'll know just how necessary that time with Jesus can be, so that's why my 5am productive mom morning routine centers around that. And if you'd like to check out any bible studies I have made about that: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeMpDclT-2HstPj1JDTZ54mTdZwSwFjjb\n\nI love watching these videos of other morning routine of a mom youtubers and so I hope this video provides the same kind of motivation and encouragement! 5 am productive mom morning routine videos can sometimes make me feel so inadequate though, and so that is why I made it very realistic! This morning routine productive mom isn't going to like do a full body workout before the sun is up! This sahm morning routine instead includes a lot of yawns and stretching and zoning out because that's real life! So, sit back, relax and enjoy this stay at home mom morning routines 2020 !\nInstagram: @howtofaithalife\n\n\n\n#morningroutine\n#mommorningroutine\n#christianmom",

    "title": "TIRED MOM MOTIVATION- MOM MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO staying positive and motivated as a mom in quarantine",
    "description": "Today I just wanted to provide us with some mom motivation for all those moms struggling with staying positive and motivated as a mom in quarantine. If you're a tired mom who is struggling to get her daily shower in, or a depressed stay at home mom fighting the baby blues, this season of quarantine and staying home to avoid the pandemic is effecting us all! That's why I wanted to make this tired mom motivation to encourage us to run to Jesus. \n\nI don't think there are enough mom motivational videos out there, to truly encourage moms in the fight, to wake up and give more of themselves and surrender more of their time for the benefit of others, and we need that motivation! But I would be wrong to encourage us to get up and give give give, if I don't first encourage us to make sure we are fueled by Jesus! In this covid mom motivation video, I encourage mommies to run to Jesus, before they run to take a shower, or paint their nails and all the other self care things we think will SAVE US. \n\nIf you want to see more videos like these motivational mom videos let me know! I sure enjoyed making it! I myself could use some more motivational stay at home mom videos in my own life! Let me know if there's a topic you'd like me to cover in a motivational video for moms and I'd be happy to do it! I think we so often spend all our time talking about why moms are miserable, or how hard motherhood is, and we forget to actually provide motivation for tired moms to run to Jesus, the only drink that will satisfy our thirsts and longings. If you can't tell, I'm pretty passionate about motivational stay at home mom videos! And pointing people to Jesus as the way of how to be a happy sahm. True stay at home mom motivation can only be found in Jesus. There's cleaning mom motivation and mom motivation for parenting and mom motivation for organizing but there's no truer motivation for moms than the cross. So, in this video of motivation for tired moms, pointing moms to scripture, I pray that moms will be motivated to run to the Word and to call out to Jesus in their struggles. I think this is one of the main reasons why moms are miserable, because we spend all our time reminding moms to take a shower or do something for themselves, instead of reminding moms that they need Jesus! \n\nSo, if you hear nothing from this mom motivational speech, hear this: run to Jesus. Father God, use this encouragement for moms during quarantine to reach the tired, depressed, weary moms who need more of You, not another cleaning motivation video. Now is such a time when we need pandemic motivation for moms, provide that for us. And you get the glory when we find that staying positive and motivated as a mom really looks like running to You and finding You to be all we need! Thank You God, for being our lives, for being our tired mom motivation. For being the source of life and the truth that I get to share in this mom motivational video. Be glorified in me. #mommotivation #motivationforsahm #sahmmotivation \n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack",

    "description": "Hey Faithful few! Welcome back to How to Faith a Life, today we are going to do another Bible study with me through James video, on James 2:14-26! In this bible study lesson on James, we look at love through deeds, and how faith without works is dead. We look at our own lives as if to ask, do I have dead faith and living faith?\n\n\nNow, I made a printable for this bible study with me James 2 video, you can find it here: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15bPDzxHZNp8JJhzKZlMd580eKxRI28sS/view?usp=sharing\n\n\nYou can also watch the entire bible study with me through James series, here at the playlist: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zsyR3-iNgQ&list=PLeMpDclT-2HsxNti-VcvxTl2rMgI_YpQL\n\n\nIn this bible study with me through james video bible study, we talk about how our faith, our new lives in Christ should be lead by Christ and His love, which naturally, unconsciously, leads us to action. This bible study lesson on James is not to make anyone feel like they are not doing enough, but rather to be a reality check for anyone feeling like they are growing stale in their relationship with Christ. In this bible study lesson on James, and in the free printable, we evaluate our lives and the fruit of our lives. We look at what this scripture passage says about dead faith and living faith and we then look at our lives and where we are resisting God's leading. I love how James takes a very natural response to the topic, asking at the beginning of the letter: \"what good is dead faith?\". This bible study on james 2 faith without works hopefully encourages us all to lean into the love exemplified on the cross in order to go out and serve this dying and broken land with Christ's good and awesome love! We ask ourselves what does it mean to have faith that is dead, and I lead us to ask, you you have dead faith or living faith? In this bible study with me james 2 video I pray that I don't come off as anything other than another broken sinner pursuing Christ! These verses, James 2:14-26 are convicting to us all! So, while I do attempt to look at james 2 faith without works is dead explained in my own words doesn't mean that I have it figured it out. So, join me, bible study with me through james chapter 2 as we ask the Lord to convict our hearts and minds. We will finish up with our bible study james two and move onto chapter three next week! We are making progress! \nAnd if you are new to this series or my channel, my name is Faith and this is my channel here on Youtube, How to Faith a Life, where we do a lot of bible study videos like this bible study with me through James series. If you loved this james 2 faith without works video, definitely check out the rest of the videos in the James playlist, and consider looking at all my other videos I make! Especially if your a Christian woman or Christian mom! I love not just doing Christian topics like james 2, but also just hot topics in our culture, like anxiety, stress, depression, and the like! \n\n\n\nLord God, Use this James 2 faith without works video to encourage someone out their seeking answers and searching for more of you. May You use this broken sinners life as a testimony of YOUR goodness, YOUR love, and for the purpose of YOUR praise! Father, may my words not say anything other than what You'd say to this time and culture! I pray for every single viewer of this bible study with me through James 2 video, bless them with Yourself! Amen\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#biblestudywithme\n#james2\n#faithwithoutworks",

    "title": "Postpartum Anger || Postpartum Rage || Postpartum Depression & Anxiety",
    "description": "Hey faithful few, welcome back to another brutally honest video- today's is  about postpartum anger or what some call postpartum rage. \n\nThis is something I haven't talked about here, but I have definitely dealt with it, and I think way more mothers struggle with it than we realize. It can look like an unusual amount of postpartum anger at husband or really anger filled postpartum depression, and it can often come alongside the symptoms of postpartum anxiety. So like, in the middle of a panic attack, or getting really angry after a panic attack. I think I wouldn't have noticed that I was dealing with anything out of the ordinary until I noticed that I tend to have an increase in postpartum anger at my husband, throughout postpartum seasons. And I hate myself for it! \n\nIn fact, I would say a lot of my postpartum depression is ruled and reigned by postpartum anger. I am usually the most filled with postpartum rage WHEN I am also struggling the most with postpartum depression. So, today I share a few of my best tipd to overcome depression as a stay at home mom, in the midst of the anxiety and stress of dealing with two under two and the crazy that that brings. I talk about how to be a happy sahm whose life isn't ruled and reigned by postpartum rage. I talk about postpartum depression anger and what it looks like for me to fight it, like REALLY, HONESTLY. \n\nIf you also struggle with this, I'd be interested FOR SURE on hearing about your experiences. How to be a happy sahm when your hormones only want to make you angry, postpartum rage how long does it last, and how you eventually got out of it. I think I am coming out of the woods, but I really want to take care of myself and not count on getting better unless I am sure about it. I hate the postpartum angry all the time feeling and I feel like it's coming up less and less, but I never want to get desensitized to my sin. \n\nAnother thing I talk about is how so often my postpartum anger at husband is really postpartum angry at God. And making that distinction can be SO important. So often it seems like my husband can do nothing right, and I have it the hardest on planet earth, and my kids are trying to give me the hardest time possible.... and I get so angry at myself and my life and then I'M NOT ANGRY AT THEM OR ME. I am angry at God. But, I don't want to be angry at God! Then that leads me into thinking that nothings actually WRONG, because all these hardships are from God, Himself! So, He gave them to me because He made me and knows I can handle them, even though I don't feel like I can. And so, I am a firm believer that Christian mom postpartum depression is a much better term to describe all that's going on because postpartum depression is very different as a christian mom, than as somebody without a Savior. Even Christian mom postpartum anxiety is different, because in the midst of the panic attack, I have someone to call on, to calm the storm in my head. So, yeah.\nThank you for joining me today on this video about Christian mom postpartum anger.

    "description": "Hey faithful few, welcome to a candid conversation about how to know for sure if you are saved. A lot of new believers ask the question of how to know if you're really saved, and we wanted to discuss that a little today because it's actually incredibly motivating to talk about and encouraging for most people! \n\nCaileys link:\nhttps://youtu.be/vpf2e6V8WsM\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\nThere's so often this idea that maybe I need to walk down the aisle again, or man, I really messed up- how can I be saved and sin that bad?! And that's why we think it's so important to talk about the important topic of how do you know if you are truly saved. \n\nWe see in scripture the answer to the question, \"How Can I Tell If I’m Really Saved?\" is simply answered with \"fruit\". Not the kind you eat, but spiritual fruit. You see, how to have assurance of your salvation really comes down to looking and seeing if we look like Jesus, that's how we know He's inside of us!\nThe christians assurance of salvation comes down to producing fruit much like a plant. We know a plant is dead or alive, if it keeps blooming, making fruit, and sprouting. It's the same way with believers! In fact, if we are not bearing fruit, we should ask the question, \"am i truly saved?\". We see that the Christian life isn't just about avoiding hell, and asking how to be sure you wont go to hell, but rather about being Christs, being little Christ's (the definition of Christian). You see, how to know if you're going to heaven comes down to if you're life is changed, if it is different... because it should be! So, if you are asking am i truly saved, maybe you need to ask yourself instead, am I any different by what I claim to have changed my life?\nHow to know youre going to heaven should come down to knowing that you have a relationship with God, because you are close like that! ;) Thats really how to know for sure that you are saved GUARANTEED. It's that close relationship, undeniable relationship!\nHow to know for sure if you are saved comes down to knowing for sure that He has changed you! I think so many people live with these questions of will i go to heaven or hell when i die and the answers are surprisingly simple when you look at scripture!\nIf you are new here, my name is Faith and this is my channel; How to Faith a Life!

    "title": "Christian Mom Modesty: while breastfeeding? As a pastors wife?",
    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome back to another Jesus for Mommies video, today's video is on Christian mom modesty! Now, the topic of christian modesty is definitely a hot topic and there is a lot of judgment around the topic, but I am all about acknowledging the differences of what is modest all over the world! Modesty simply is not simple! :) See what I did there?\nLink to first video on modesty: https://youtu.be/5_FhGT667zg\nLink to Staying Kingdom Minded's video: https://youtu.be/ln6Uj4RWdSk\nMore specifically, I talk about breastfeeding modesty. All about outfits that work for me to easily breastfeed while still staying modest. Modest Christian women all over the world right now are struggling with what to wear so that they have access to nursing their child, and this is something I definitely have stressed out about when I am pregnant, but both times I have been postpartum, these are the kind of clothes I ended up loving the most.\nAgain, if you haven't seen my first video on modesty, definitely go check that out, I talk more about what is modesty, biblical modesty, and how I practice modesty. Christianity modest women all kinds of start to sound legalistic and that's the last thing I want to be! Because the cross! Amen? Amen! In that video I talk about the importance of modest living, instead of just dressing modestly, having a modest heart, too.\nIn this video I show modest breastfeeding clothes, modest summer clothes, and just general modest fashion for summer 2020.\nAs a christian mom modest breastfeeding clothes are very important to me so my prayer is that this video gives you some good ideas on what you can wear, and still be modest! I just share a few modest nursing outfit ideas because I really truly don't own many clothes, and that's part of what I do to make my life easier, but also practice modest living. The modest breastfeeding outfits that I show and talk about are ones that have shirts with buttons all down the front, or are layered. I like even doing both those options when possible! And my favorite thing to look for in modest breastfeeding clothes are a hem line thats extra long so that it covers my bottom! Essentially, modest breastfeeding clothes don't have to be expensive clothes from those fancy breastfeeding clothing stores, they can be everyday shirts and clothes that are also very modest and super functional and cute! And modest summer clothes don't have to be super hot and sweaty, like my skorts, that are leggings material, the beauty of modest living in our day and age is that you can find nearly anything online!\n\nThese are my modest summer clothes and I just pray that these ideas encourage and inspire you!\nRemember to check out all my videos in the Jesus for Mommies playlist and I'll see you in my next video!\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#modestbreastfeedingclothes\n#christianmom\n#christianmommodesty",

    "description": "Welcome back to another Christian mom bible study on resting in Jesus! Today we talk all things about thee sabbath, and how I was convicted in my morning devotional to take a rest. So, this vloggy mom devotional on rest is meant to encourage, inspire and motivate you to rest in Jesus. \n\nLink to bible study sheet: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4WvV_ORFE3XmHv_aC4JaNPG2bQdbU0f/view?usp=sharing\nJust print and enjoy! You may need a google account to open, but that should be your Youtube account! Comment down below if you have any issues and we will work out the technical difficulties! \n\nThis Christian mom bible study on resting in Jesus is more vloggy styled this morning, we talk about life lately and house projects, as well as my need for resting.... ie. MOTHERHOOD! And then we jump into a morning devotional on on rest and we talk in this mom devotional about laziness verses the Sabbath commandment to rest and the differences as well as the faithful response. \n\nI love doing these kind of bible study for weary moms videos because I think way too often we think God doesn't care about our worn-out-tired-eyes and in all reality God called us to motherhood, so He will sustain us, but He also totally sympathizes and cares when we are overwhelmed and exhausted. So, that's why I made this bible study on resting in Jesus, to remind us of the call to take a Sabbath and the importance of that rest. In this Christian mom bible study we look at various different scriptures and emphasize our need for rest, because I think much too often moms are embarrassed to admit that they need rest! But, if there's any take away from this Christian mom bible study on rest, its that the call to rest is totally legitimate and if we try not to be, we are essentially just trying to be our own God. BOOM. Mike drop! Like, whattt? Yup, because we see in Genesis 2, THAT GOD RESTED. And if God almighty thought it was important to rest, needed rest, are we trying to be better than Him, by never needing rest? This Christian mom bible study on taking a sabbath should point us to faithful worship THROUGH resting in Jesus! \n\nIf you are new here, this is my channel, How to Faith A Life, and I make all kinds of Christian mom morning devotional videos like this Christian mom bible study on resting in Jesus! I love making mom devotional videos, because they are what I need in my own life! And often inspired by what I am learning. Hence why this Christian mom morning devotional on rest is all about me realizing I needed to rest! I want to use my life and my hardships as an encouragement for weary moms! So if you're looking for mom devotional kind of videos, hit subscribe! If this video or the scripture for weary moms shared encouraged you in any way, hit the like button! And consider sharing this video with anyone who might benefit from it! \n\nNow, go rest and don't forget this rest in Jesus christian mom bible study! Print off the printable in the link at the top of this description so that you don't forget to truly rest in Jesus and take a Sabbath in the months ahead. I pray this rest in Jesus mom morning devotional has blessed you and I'll see you in the next video! \n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#restinJesus\n#momdevotional\n#christianmom",

    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome back to the last bible study with me James 1 video, next week will be James 2! This women's bible study on James is really turning out to be my favorite guided bible study series yet!\nIf you're new here, we are going through James verse section by verse section, in a bible study with me james kind of method. Today's video is the last bible study with me James 1, there are five others from the earlier parts of chapter one, and linked in the playlist. And if you're new to my channel: HI! My name is Faith and I make christian mom bible study videos. All kinds of guided bible study videos and bible study with me videos on hot topics that Christian moms face everyday. I love being a Christian mom, but I know it can be hard, and so that's why my channel exists: to encourage, uplift, and speak truth into the lives of other Christian moms. \n\nIn this bible study with me through James video, we look at the topic of listening and doing. We even look at my favorite verse in the book of James! Up to this point in our James bible study series, chapter one has been a lot of short piffy wisdom statements, and this is our first, larger, wisdom segment. I love this James christian bible study because it really addresses a lot of current and also timeless issues in the Christian mom life. My prayer is that it would be a great addition to your womens morning devotional. This womens bible study james talks about listening over speaking, anger, (including my postpartum anger!) and loving the orphan and the widow. This women's bible study on James seeks to just look at the scriptures here, and take from them the sweet rich flavor and not turn away and forget, but be changed by God at work, sanctifying. \n\nI hope this video will add to your womens morning devotional and will encourage and inspire you to seek to not just listen and be convicted, but DO. I pray that this women's bible study on James meets you wherever you're at and blesses you! \n\nThank you for joining me for another bible study with me through James 1, and next time it will be bible study with me through James TWO! \n\n\n\n#biblestudywithme\n#christianmombiblestudy\n#biblestudywithmeJames\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack",

    "title": "WHEN LIFE GETS HARD | Overcoming Adversity - Inspirational & Motivational Video | never give up?",
    "description": "When life gets hard, and we are trying to overcome adversity, we need inspiration and motivation that doesn't come from the world, that says to work harder, never give up, push deeper into yourself to find more to give, just keep pushing, just keep trying, no, when we are overcoming adversity, and when like gets hard, we need inspiration and motivation that comes from Jesus alone. We don't keep pushing, never give up, keep trying, keep fighting because of ourselves. The focus should never be on ourselves. The problem with dont give up christian motivation is that it makes it sound like its all on us not giving up, that we are saved and rescued or we succeed by not giving up, by ourselves pushing harder and let's be real, what's even any different about that than secular motivation?\nThe problem with girl go wash your face or girl get up christian faith motivation is that it's not about us getting up and washing our face. It's not about us not giving up when we are overcoming adversity. It's not about when life gets hard we push harder. No, Christians persevere because CHRIST PERSEVERED AFTER US. There's your powerful christian motivation in 2020! The best way to overcome adversity when life gets hard, to truly grip onto solid Christian motivation and Christian inspiration, is not to never give up, but it's to keep our eyes fixed on the cross! girl get up christian motivation should really be called girl LOOK UP! \n\nSo we never give up BECAUSE God is with you in the battle, not because we watched some motivational video that said to never give up. We overcome adversity by resting in Christ! Resting in Christ! That's the powerful christian motivation 2020.\n#nevergiveup\n#christianmotivation\n#inspirationalvideo\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack",

    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome to another in depth bible study lesson for moms, as a part of my series here, Jesus for Mommies, I like to do daily devotional for moms videos and christian bible study for moms videos that pertain to everything in Christian motherhood. \n\nIn today's womens morning devotional, we are talking about being unmotivated. I think we've all been there: feeling like we don't have anything more to give our families and we almost don't want to give anything more! Well, I think all moms could use some Christian mom motivation in their life, because it's way more fruitful than worldly motivation and that's what I want to meet you with, today! \n\nFor today's christian mom motivation, we talk about giving ourselves grace and what that might feel and look like. Then, we dive into a women's in depth bible study on what it really looks like to be a Christian mom, a believer whose identity before the throne of God is characterized not by what she does, but whose she is. I share some tired mom christian motivation and we talk about how important it is to have our daily devotional time with Jesus be our source of energy and mom motivation and encouragement. By the way: if you ever need some ideas on where to begin in the word, a daily devotional for moms, check out my series of women's morning devotional videos through James!\nAnyways, I hope this tired christian mom motivation video inspires you to seek Jesus in every moment of your draining day as a mommy. You matter. Your job matters and I just pray this in depth mom bible study triggers you to run to the cross and be filled by Jesus. \n\nIf you like videos like this christian bible study for moms, consider subscribing to my channel and checking out my other Jesus for mommies videos or bible study for mothers videos. Really any and all of my videos could classify as a mothers bible study video! \n\nConsider liking this in depth bible study lesson for moms and checking the bell, so that you get all the notifications when I come out with another video! I am impassioned to reach my subscribers with christian motivation in motherhood that sends them running to the cross. I want to provide christian bible study for mothers that truly speak truth and not just what sounds good. Anyways, leave a comment if you have any questions and I will see you in my next video! \n\n\n\ninstagram: mrsfaithwomack\n#indepthbiblestudy\n#dailydevotionalformoms\n#christianmom",

    "title": "FEELING LONELY AS A MOM? Christian mom bible study & womens morning devotional on loneliness",
    "description": "Hey Christian moms, are you feeling lonely as a mom? Here's another in depth bible study looking at the topic of loneliness in motherhood. I think whether you're a stay at home mom of babies, a working mom of teens, or a grandmother missing her grand kids, we all can relate to the topic of loneliness, especially right now during quarantine! That's why today's womens morning devotional is focusing on the topic of loneliness and loneliness as Christians in light of the cross and all that's been bought with Christ's costly blood. \n\nIf you're interested in other videos about Christian motherhood and bible studies on other struggles in the life of a Christian mom, check out the whole Jesus for Mommies playlist and here are a few of the kickers:\n\n\nChristian mom depression and anxiety: https://youtu.be/6ZVu4DvgMRg\nTired Christian mom motivation: https://youtu.be/HYCpM8OKGGc\nHow to be a Happy Stay at Home Mom: https://youtu.be/G5uFTSVNn-U\n\n\n\nAs a Christian mom, I know first hand the need in my own life for a christian mom bible study on loneliness because it's something I've definitely struggled with. It's something I've prayed a lot about in my women's morning devotionals and expressed to you guys in my videos here. Loneliness can be a huge part of postpartum depression and isolation definitely adds to it! This in depth bible study on loneliness aims to shed some light on the situation and provide a relatable bible study for women and Christian moms.\nSo, bible study with me through the topic of loneliness as a mom! We talk about feeling lonely as a mom and what our feelings are versus what the truth is. We talk a little about why motherhood is lonely, and what the bible has to say about loneliness in the Christian walk and loneliness in motherhood.\nThis bible study seeks to just put our loneliness at the foot of the cross and have God's truth and love permeate into every bit of it! Because, lets be real: loneliness has no place in a Christians life. Even though we may feel like we are battling loneliness, we are never truly alone. And this bible study for moms seeks to highlight that. \n\nIf you like videos like this bible study for Christian moms or really any kind of Christian devotional for women, check out the rest of my Jesus for mommies series here on how to faith a life, where christian mom devos are the name of the game! And make sure to subscribe to my channel for all kinds of christian content: from bible studies and devotionals for the Christian walk, to Christian motivational videos and just general Christian bible study videos for moms. Because while this is definitely a place for Christian moms, this is also a place for Christian families, daddies, daughters, and the rest. \n\n#loneliness\n#christianmom\n#christianmombiblestudy\nINSTA: @mrsfaithwomack",

    "description": "Bible study tips and how to read the bible for beginners- today I am sharing 2 things to NEVER DO in your Christian bible study.\nToday we are talking about 2 things I always try NOT to do in my bible study time. These approaches can just lead to bad hermeneutics and applications to the Christian life, but are way too common in the church nowadays. Especially among younger Christians who are developing their approach to the Bible and how to read the bible for beginners. Today we are discussing two bible study tips that I apply to basically every Christian bible study lesson or devotional that I do, that kind of are based off of or feed off of \"How to Read the Bible for all its Worth\" by Fee and Stuart. \n\nIt's so important as Christians, especially for new Christians learning how to read the bible for beginners, when we study our bibles, or approach the scriptures, to know what we are reading, like what type of literature it is and how it's supposed to be read, that's basic hermeneutics. But it's super important so that we don't misuse the scriptures or mis-interpret them! Thus, I wanted to share these basic bible study tips with y'all for your Christian bible study time or while leading Christian bible study lessons so that you know you are doing right by the scriptures. \nThese two bible study tips are meant to inform you of not only how I study my bible, but also the basics of how to have your own in-depth bible study. \n\nHow I study the bible is something I have had to learn, like a skill or discipline and so whenever I find something that's simple and sharable in a simple youtube bible study video, I think I will share it, because these are priceless skills for the Christian bible study. And priceless for beginners to learn, while studying how to read the bible for beginners. And they are crucial to how to read the bible for all its worth and how to read the bible effectively!\nThis is really important for young believers or newer Christians learning how to read the bible for beginners.\n\nI pray these bible study tips inspire and encourage you to go dive deep into the scriptures and read \"How to Read the Bible for All it's Worth\". I pray that my caveat, that God is way bigger than our inabilities to do everything perfect or to read our bibles perfectly, encourages you that you don't have to be a master of the bible to taste and see that the Lord is good!\nThese bible study tips are just things to keep in mind in the future as you jump into God's word!\nIf you like content like this, or bible study lessons, Christian motivational videos, in-depth bible study videos, or any other how to read the bible videos; then hit that subscribe button because that's what we do over here at How to Faith a Life!

    "description": "For this womens morning devotional today we are going to look at James 1:1-4. This bible study for women is going to focus on the book of James and starting an in depth bible study series and today specifically; talking about persevering through trials. This Christian mom in-depth bible study series will hopefully empower us to truly count it all joy when we face trails- because our genuine faith produces perseverance. Trials are hard for us, because as mere humans, we have no idea what's going on, where the trials will lead and why they are hitting us at that point in time, but God is faithfully working in and through us and I pray this women's morning devotional encourages you that persevering through hard times is something that God is doing through you!\n\n\nBut first, if you're new here; my name is Faith and I make bible studies for women here on my youtube channel, how to faith a life. I also have a series specifically for Christian moms, called Jesus for Mommies. In this series, I make all kinds of in depth bible study lessons and christian bible studies on all kinds of topics for women and moms. And on my channel I make all kinds of Christian motivational and inspirational videos, bible study with me videos, and basic bible study and Christian hot topic videos. Consider subscribing it you already haven't, I know you don't want to miss out on this series through the book of James!\n\n\nBack to the study: in today's womens morning devotional we tackle the topic of trials and hardships and why we have to face them at all! We ask the hard questions about why God gives trials and why God allows bad things to happen to good people, even to believers. This is a theme throughout the book of James and in our James bible study series, so this won't be the only time we touch on the topic, but it sure is an important study not to miss! I think one fault that a lot of Christian bible study series can fall into is they continually use the language that, \"God allowed this bad thing\" \"God allows that becuase...\" and I truly believe that language, \"allow\" is much too passive. No, God orchestrated it into His story, ordained it, as a tool in His story and for ultimate good for His people. So, bible study with me through the book of James and lets look at why God gives us trials. This will be the first of a couple bible study with me James 1 videos. Because I will be breaking down James by verse sections! So go ahead and hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out on this james bible study series!\n\n\nI pray this womens morning devotional meets you right where you are, wherever that may be, and in whatever you might be facing: persevering through trials OR going through an easy season! God loves you and is doing very GOOD things, even when it doesn't look like it! \n\nOn Friday I plan to upload a Christian bible study inspirational video more on the topic of trials and hardship, so stay tuned for that!\n\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#womensmorningdevotional\n#biblestudywithme\n#biblestudy",

    "description": "Instagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\nWhen you don't feel motivated to read the bible, READ YOUR BIBLE. Today's Christian motivational and inspirational video tackles the feeling we get that says we don't need to read the bible today, or we are too tired or too busy. Let me tell you this: you will never need sleep or time as much as you need Jesus. Here's your motivation to read your bible: you need Jesus more than you need time, sleep, money or anything else. And let me knock out that lie that you don't know where to begin reading: every place in the bible is a safe place for Christians. EVERY book of the bible is the best place to start. Because every verse of the bible points to our need for Jesus and His fulfillment of all we need. That should inspire you to just pick up your bible and begin reading your bible because we need it most when we are unmotivated and uninspired. Need more motivation to read your bible? Christian, it is your lifeline, your phone line to Jesus. It is your map to life in that it tells you everything you need to know about interacting in this world. So let me motivate you by telling you this: you will never be on your deathbed and say \"I spent too much time with God\". Spend time with God not because you feel like it, but because you DON'T feel like it. Here's all the Christian motivation you should need to read your bible: we need Jesus more than the very air we breathe. So read the bible, because it's His Word! \nI hope this video provides you with some solid Christian inspirational and motivational words to get you up off your phone and diving into the Word of God. Because I truly DO believe when you don't feel motivated to read the bible, that's when it is MOST important to read the bible! We don't spend time with God because we feel like we are feeling motivated to do it, Christian, we spend time with God BECAUSE we DON'T feel like it. When you don't feel motivated to read the bible, that's when it's most important TO read the bible! Need some Christian inspirational encouragement or motivation to read the bible? Just hit that subscribe button and there will be a lot more coming your way!

    "title": "OVERCOME ANXIETY ||christian inspirational and motivational video encouragement for women moms fear",
    "description": "Welcome to another Christian inspirational and motivational video, here on How to Faith a Life! Today we are talking about overcoming anxiety, fear and worry and we even talk about idols, mental health, and all the rest! This series, on my channel, 'Jesus for da morning', is my new little series where I hope to provide encouragement and motivation amidst life's struggles with the truth of Christ and the hope of the gospel. So, if you like watching Christian encouragement that is inspirational and motivational, then hit that subscribe button! I am a Christian mom, so a lot of my videos approach those topics: anxiety, stress, and fear in women and moms. But I also make general Christian bible study videos and encouragement, so you don't have to be a Christian mom to subscribe!\nBut, I make Christian encouragement for moms, because I think there's a huge hole in Youtube, where there's only a few videos that provide mom motivation and encouragement, and MUCH LESS Christian motivation and encouragement for women. So, that's what I am here to do! I figured, if no one else is going to do it, I guess I will! \n\nI also have a whole series called Jesus for Mommies that are bible studies on topics for mothers, like this one here on anxiety. I want to inspire, encourage and motivate mothers to not live and parent by fear but by faith! \n\nSo, subscribe to my channel for mom motivation or mom encouragement and to this series for christian inspirational/motivational videos! And watch this one to overcome anxiety stress and fear! One of the biggest struggles I think Christian women fight in this day and age is anxiety. They struggle with this because they have a hard time remembering their identity and their worth. Want to know why I think this? Because I LIVE it. I see in in my life, in the lives of the women in my family, and in the lives of the women in my church and friends. I SEE IT IN THE LIVES OF OUR GENERATION. So, today we’re going to dive deep into the scriptures and do a hopefully motivational Christian bible study for women that reminds us of not just who we are, but WHOSE we are so that our anxieties can be met with the truth of Christ and cut through our anxiety with a double edged sword. You see, I want Christ’s truth to be the blood that runs though my veins. To be the air I breath in and breath out. I don’t want to live my life claiming Christ but not letting Him permeate my entire being. I am nothing outside of Christ. NOTHING. I can spend all day on here, all day folding laundry, all day working out, but none of it does anything of real value if God’s not in it, because HE IS ALL THAT MATTERS IN THIS WORLD. Not what others think of me. Not my security or my comfortably, not even MY HEALTH and fitness. Nope, all these idols crumble to their knees at the name of Jesus Christ. So, where am I going with this? we established that anxiety and lack of identity are one of the top issues in Christian women in this day and age, we established that the lack of identity and the anxiety are usually empowered by idols. We established that all those idols don’t compare to Christ, and crumble to their knees before the throne, and now I ASK THIS: DO YOU? Do you crumble before the throne of God and proclaim, “God! I am a broken sinner, lost running after idols if it weren’t for you, I’d be just as good as dead. You are my all in all, Father. And I say that but I DON’T always live like that, help me believe it to my core. Father, BE my all in all. Be my life. I am tired of these struggles with anxiety and identity. I am tired of wasting my life away with worry and feeling lost in this world, not really knowing where I belong. And then Jesus responds, “I love you THIS MUCH”. And your immovable and unshakable identity is that you are my child. So no ones hate or critiques of you mean anything, because you're my daughter. So punch fear in the face! Overcome that anxiety stess and fear, not just with brute force, or something you could possibly muster up on your own, but with faith. FAITH OVER FEAR. Overcome anxiety with faith. That's the truth: I think all Christian encouragement for women can be summed up in this one principle, having more faith than fear. There's really no more inspiration for moms that's needed, most the time. Because so often women and moms, in particular, live their lives controlled by their fears, not their faith.\nI hope this christian inspirational and motivational video about anxiety has been an encouragement to any of you moms out there, please comment down below and let me know, if that's the case! From one Christian mom to another: SEEK GOD! FAITH OVER FEAR! \n\nXOXO\nstay faithful\n\n\nInstagram: mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#faithoverfear\n#anxiety\n#christian mom",

    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome to the third episode of in depth bible studies here on How to Faith a Life, for our series on prayer. Today, after the bible study, I am going to walk you through my prayer journal and share some advice as we scroll through. For our in depth bible study lesson, we are going to talk about pursuing intimacy with Jesus, growing closer with Him and seeking Him, at an intimate level. We talk about how to pray like that and how to make intimate prayers happen! In this bible study on prayer, I ask you your tips and tricks and share my own, so meet us down in the comments to read all those tips on how we pursue intimacy with Jesus through daily prayer, whether that's through a daily prayer journal or daily devotions, or running, driving, folding laundry, etc! \n\nThen we walk through my prayer journal and we talk about my thoughts on what it should look like and feel like- probably not what you expect! Contrary to popular opinion, I don't think my journal should be all pretty and colorful and perfect, or even colored. I fight the battles in this prayer journal, so it's filled with tears, coffee stains, and it sure isn't neat hand writing! A lot of the time I am crying and writing prayers at the same time! \n\nSo, as we walk through my prayer journal, you won't see a ton of neat and pretty pages, but a lot of battle grounds. \n\nI hope this bible study on prayer brings you to thinking in-depth about how you practice the spiritual discipline of prayer in your women's morning devotionals and how you can integrate more intimate, un-distracted times with Jesus! Intimacy with Jesus is for all God's people! But I think we need more practical encouragement in the church on how to actually pursue that! \n\nI hope this bible study for women, though less meat-filled, is encouraging and motivating, inspiring you to get up and pray and pursue intimacy with Jesus. Whether through a prayer journal or even getting down on your knees at the end of your bed! \n\nIf you liked this video and would liek more women's devotionals on prayer, then go ahead and hit the subscribe button because I will definitely be adding more to this series and I make all kinds of Christian bible study videos, as well as women's morning devotions or daily devotional videos for women, moms, and Christians in general! \n\nHit that subscribe button and don't forget to comment down below that you stopped by!\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n#women'smorningdevotional\n#prayerjournal\n#prayerjournalwalkthrough",

    "description": "Time for some Christian inspiration and motivation!\n\nHey welcome to Howtofaithalife, my name is Faith and this is THE space on Youtube for Christian motivation, in depth bible study lessons, Jesus morning motivation and Christian inspirational and motivational videos, like this one. As well as practical bible studies for the day to day real life, & if that’s something you think you need on ya feed, then hit that subscribe button! This video is the start of a new series I am doing here on my channel, “Jesus for da morning” - they are motivational and inspirational Christian videos for you to start your day on the right footing: Christ alone. I also have a “Jesus for Mommies” series here, for moms and a series on prayer. So, clearly we’re all over the place in all the good things, diving into Gods word and watching Him sanctify us day by day. So hit that subscribe button for more Christian motivational videos in 2020!\n\nOKAY, SO…. For our first Jesus morning motivation video for our series, \"Jesus for da morning\" I wanted to do the bible study on this idea that we need to: \nSTOP BELIEVING IN YOURSELF. \nWHAT? What kind of Christian inspiration or motivation is this? YUP.\nI want you to forget all those sports movies and all those pep talks you got in school and all those things your coaches have poured into you and remember this one thing: JESUS, will never fail you.\nBecause the truth is that if your faith is rooted in yourself, you will fail yourself. IT’S INEVITABLE. You’re a human and you are weak, you need a nap every once in a while, you trip, you zone out- whatever it is: you ain’t perfect. And if you’re a millennial and grew up in the age of all the Disney movies, this idea of “believe in yourself” was so deeply rooted in us, its uncomfortable to truly think like this: like “I can’t rely on myself” “I am going to fail myself” “I can’t be trusted” “IM A SINNER IN NEED OF A SAVIOR” BUT IS THAT NOT ALL TRUE? Do we not fail ourselves everyday?\nWe live in a time of human history where freedom and individualism and independence are SO overvalued that this idea of self-sustaining and “find yourself” and go define yourself are so overvalued that we forget that there’s no such thing as complete independence! \n\nBut I mean: Look at your bellybutton! Its physical proof that you’re dependent on others, at the end of the day, if you just believe in yourself to make it through life, or hard things, you’ll find that you fail yourself, you’re not strong enough, your not powerful enough, and in the midst of an age that’s radically seeking self actualization and independence and freedom, you’ll find more than ever that you need JESUS. You need someone that’s not bounded by the chains of sin and brokenness, you need someone else, to define you and set you free, because you can’t do that. I've said this in a lot of my other bible study videos, but: You need your identity, your value your life rooted in believing in HIM, because there’s NOTHING to believe in yourself for! \n\nIt’s like when Moses gave the Israelites the law and then in Debt 30 he said, this is life! Choose life! This is real living. This is real safety. \n\nRemember, we are called, as children of God, to not be true to ourselves, to do our desires, to go find ourselves, NO- ACTUALLY, in God we find that he’s already given us an amazing identity, value, purpose in Him and a rock solid rock to build our faith off of, JESUS. So if you don't get anything else from this in depth bible study on NOT believing in yourself, get this: if we believe in ourselves, we are living a life where we have to work and keep up the work and never rest or we might fail, AND MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH and just keep believing and hoping that we might have enough… NO! SET YOUR FAITH, SET YOUR SIGHTS ON THINGS ABOVE, ON WHAT CHRIST DID ON THE CROSS. COL 3:2 says, “Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.” It doesn't say, \"set your sights on what you can do\" or \"believe in yourself enough and set your sights on yourself!\"\n\nSo, you want Christian inspiration and motivation? Look at the cross. SET YOUR BELIEFS THERE, THE ROCK, THAT ALWAYS SATISFIES, THE ONE YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON, AND WHERE NOTHING DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY TO BE ENOUGH. The best part about it? It’s already done. Jesus said, it is finished. And it has been finished, so set you’re believe there. Stop believing in yourself and believe in the one who gives life, and life to the fullest.\n\nAlright guys, make sure you hit the subscribe button with that little bell so you don’t miss the next ‘Jesus for da morning’ video, I'm pumped to see what God has in store for 2020, full of Christian motivation and inspiration and Jesus morning motivation to start your day.

    "title": "PATIENT IN TRIALS? || christian motivation to be patient bible study in depth Christian moms",
    "description": "Hey friends! Welcome to an in-depth bible study lesson on patience, because even though we don't want it to be true, I think it's something MOST believers in our day and age need to learn and grow in! Hence, why I did this bible study lesson on patience! And I think we also all need christian motivation to be patient.\n\nBut first, Hey welcome to How to faith a life, my name is Faith and this is THE space on Youtube for Christian moms and REALLY anyone looking for Christian devotions for motivation and encouragement, as well as practical in depth bible study lessons for the day to day real life,  & if that’s something you think you need on your feed, then hit that subscribe button! I do this series here for Christian moms specifically, called Jesus for Mommies on Christian motherhood.\nNow, last time I asked a question and I really enjoyed hearing back from y’all because I feel like I really get to know y’all better every time I hear back from you, so here’s another one: When is it hardest for you to exercise patience and what do you do to fight your sin nature and fight TO HAVE patience?\nSo today we’re doing a in depth bible study lesson on patience & study for our christian motivation to be patient. If you’re anything like me, you may know you’re called to have more patience, but you don’t want to have to have more patience and you don’t really want to have to grow in your patience because patience is BORING AND EWHHHHH.\nIn our western society, patience is probably one of the least valued virtues, because we value speed and efficiency so highly. I have to confess, I lean towards valuing efficiency TOO much and it can be really bad. Especially for our christian motivation to have patience.\nIn this mother's online bible study video, I think it’s really important for us to remember that time is different to God than it is for us. He can see all of time, He is outside of time and initiated and created time, and we are stuck, in this moment, only seeing what’s right in front of us. We can’t see His plan, we can’t see His intentions or where any of this random life stuff is going.\nBe encouraged in your christian motivation to be patient, that He sees you, knows you, and HE SEES where this is all going and still calls you to be patient, right now, where you’re at. Proverbs 3:5-6\nLet me re-word that just to drive home this idea one more time: Our God, our good, good, Father, who sees everything of all time, knows where your situation is going and understands your desire and your temptation to be impatient, sees everything, initiates and holds everything together, and sees where it’s going and doesn’t stop and say, “oh, yeah, this is an exceptionally annoying situation, you go ahead and be impatient in this scenario.” No, He sees it all and still calls us to BE PATIENT. \nBut, lets get real, does my faith DEPEND on me understanding why God is waiting? Do I only follow and obey and believe the Lord if/when it makes sense and I see where He is going with it all? Now, of course we all want to shout, “of course not!” “We believe when we even can’t see!” \nSO, get this: even when we can’t bring ourselves to believe and to be patient, God is still good and loving because His character, His UNCHANGING character is outside of us believing in it. And ironically enough, doesn't that help your christian motivation to be patient?!\nSo, idk if any of that even made sense, or if I lost you, in this christian video on patience, but we’re called to be patient because God looks at all eternity and He says, “yup, be patient…..” Use your desire to be impatient as fuel to seek His face.\nDo you see what I am doing there? I think as Christian moms, doing a bible study, often times its easy for us to look over the fact that we have to see the divide: feeling verses knowing because that’s an important principle to this all: impatience is a feeling. But patience is an ACT. \nNow, I have to acknowledge, in this bible study on patience that in Genesis 29 we see Jacob exercise 14 years of patience. And of course, his patience is empowered by LOVE.\nOk guys, if this in-depth bible study lesson on patience has benefiting you in any way, I encourage you to pray about sharing it with someone who might benefit it (like another busy mom who might need to be met with a bible study on patience)and or giving it a like, and of course, hit that subscribe button if you already haven’t and are interested in more christian video bible studies on patience, fear, anxiety and the like. I hope this video gave you some christian motivation to have patience. While I make a lot of bible studies for busy moms and women, many videos can easily apply to really anyone. I REALLY appreciate y’all getting involved in the teaching and applying of this lesson, and commenting down below how YOU fight your sin nature and fight TO HAVE patience. I love y’all so much, stay patient, and stay faithful!\nInsta: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#patience\n#biblestudylessononpatience\n#christianbiblestudy",

    "description": "Hey welcome to an in depth bible study lesson on fear here at Howtofaithalife, THE space on Youtube for Christian mommies and REALLY anyone looking for Christian bible study lessons for motivation and encouragement, any kind of bible study for busy christian moms, as well as practical in depth bible studies for the day to day real life, & if that’s something you think you need on ya feed, then hit that subscribe button!\n\nSo today we’re talking and doing a in depth bible study lesson on fear, or really overcoming fear! This, christian mom bible study seeks to attack the very nature of our fears and habit of our worries.\nI think as mommies, it is so easy for us to worry after our children and our spouse, We are the caretakers of the home, and I think WAY MORE OFTEN than we want to admit, we tell ourselves that we can care for the family by worrying for the family. but there's nothing farther from the truth about our fear. \nHere's the main verse for this christian mom devotional :\nRomans 8:38-39 says, “And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angles nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow- not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below- indeed, NOTHING in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\nI mean, let’s even look at death… what’s the worst case senario? YOU MEET JESUS FACE TO FACE.  I don't mean for us to get all suicidal in this mother's bible study, but I want to encourage you, we truly have nothing to be anxious or fearful of!\nBut yeah, I mean, the reason we even need to do this bible study lesson on fear is BECAUSE we live in a scary world, we have a lot going on right now, the economy is crashing, there is so much going on and there’s a lot that lies ahead that we don’t even know about. But, we can live in confidence, knowing that none of those things can take away Jesus. Nothing can take away our salvation. NOT EVEN satan himself. And you might be watching this mom bible study on anxiety and doubting me, but Psalm 46:1-3 says, “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.” So we see that even if the earth falls into itself, we are safe in Christ.\n\nEven more so, God uses this as the groundwork to command us not to fear: Isaiah 43:1 “Don't fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine.” God actually commands us not to fear, or worry. So, not only do I encourage you in this bible study for busy moms to not worry, but also we’re commanded to surrender our desires to worry, our desires to feel like we predicted every bad thing that will happen, our desires to control the situations or our life by worrying and figuring out a solution- God calls us to surrender that at the foot of the cross.\n\nAnd I am going to take it one step further, because I am just THAT obnoxious, and this is an IN DEPTH bible study on overcoming fear, amiright?! But, not only are we commanded not to fear and worry 365 times in the Bible, not only has God got our “bill”, and made the sacrifice for our sins on the cross, not only can NOTHING separate us from the love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord, but when we know all this and still choose to live in fear and worry, we are spitting on the sacrifice done on the cross, saying, \"I know you say it's enough to atone for my sins, and I know you say you've got this God, but I don't believe you've got it all. I need to worry just a little bit more. I need to try to control this a bit more and make sure it's really all taken care of.\"\n\nBut, don't leave this women's in depth bible study without hearing this: God is MORE THAN ENOUGH. He didn’t just tell us “don’t fear honey”, but he defeated all our fears. Let me say that again, HE DEFEATED ALL OUR FEARS. ALL OF THEM. And locked us in, safe with Him. Psalm 23:4 says.“Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\n\nSo we’re called to surrender our fears at the foot of the cross, and what do we find there? We find life to the fullest in Christ, a life that is not living in fear but set free in the cross. \n\nSo instead of living with fears rule and reign in your life, live with the freedom, the life, the TRUTH OF CHRIST RULING IN YOUR HEART AND MIND this morning and for the rest of your life, after this women's morning devotional. Live like you actually believe what you say you believe. \nOkay, I hope this in depth bible study lesson on overcoming fear has been encouraging. Stay diligent in the faith, fight fear. And like I always say, stay faithful.\ninstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#biblestudy\n#smallgroup\n#devotional",

    "description": "Welcome to a Bible lesson on the power of prayer! My name is Faith, and I make these Christian bible study videos here at How to Faith a Life on Youtube. Make sure you subscribe, because I am doing a full series of in-depth bible study lessons on prayer here on my channel and I make Christian bible studies on all topics, especially mom topics, that you won't want to miss. This bible lesson on the power of prayer seeks to expose the secret to powerful prayer to be a lot simpler than maybe we expect. We talk about what happens when we pray, and spiritually and in our subconscious. In this bible study, we will see that the secret to powerful prayer, is the power of God, not our ability to do enough or try hard enough, its all on God. While faith is important in prayer, God is the one who initiates and sustains our faith. It's all Him. He gives us the idea, the desire and the power to pray, so there's really NO secret to the power of prayer! Stay tuned to the end of this bible lesson on prayer to hear about the INTERESTING paradox that we are faced with, when forming a theology of prayer. I hope this serves you well in your Christian bible study of prayer and in your day to day life, learning and experiencing the power of prayer. I think so many of us have questions, in all honesty about if we are doing it right, and what does prayer ACTUALLY do, so I pray this in-depth bible study on prayer, and really the whole series, ends up answering some of those questions. \nThis bible study lesson on the power of prayer is something I pray reaches you wherever you're at in your journey with prayer, whether you hate it, are tired and bored with your prayer practice, or even if you feel like your prayers aren't being heard. I hope this video bible study on prayer motivates and encourages you to keep praying! \n\nIf you like this bible study lesson on the power of prayer, make sure to give it a thumbs up and consider if the Lord is calling you to share it with someone you know! Then, make sure you subscribe, hitting the bell, so you don't miss the next in-depth bible study lesson on prayer! \nIf you like youtube bible study lessons and could use more video bible studies on your feed, consider subscribing.

    "description": "Let's talk how to be a happy stay at home mom. Hey faithful few are you in need of a bible study for tired moms?! Well, I was too! haha. Welcome back to howtofaithalife where I have this series, \"Jesus for Mommies\". This is our space here on youtube, as Christian moms, to gather and encourage one another in this hard journey of being moms. Today I am talking about Philippians 4:4, stay at home mom depression, and how to be a happy stay at home mom through a short little Christian mom bible study. Lets be real: being a SAHM is much harder than anyone usually realizes, going into it. And most days I feel completely overwhelmed, unmotivated and negative about it all and I need a Christian mom devo to speak truth into my life. The depression weighs me down, making me unmotivated, depressed, anxious, and unproductive. And this is my LIFE! I DO THIS ALL DAY ER'DAY! So, that's why today I am sharing how to be a happy stay-at-home mom and how to fight stay at home mom depression. Because, everyday is a battle field for me, fighting to be happy and not depressed: motivated, joyful and even, if I am being real honest, hopeful. Everyday I work on my postpartum depression. Everyday, there are certain things I do to make sure I am doing my very best to be present and grateful for my day and life. But that doesn't mean my stay at home mom depression isn't SO HARD to fight. So, I discuss a lot about the heart and how we view ourselves, our joy and our circumstances when we are battling this type of depression. In this bible study for tired depressed moms, I talk about how to stay positive and motivated as a stay at home mom under lots of pressure. But, more importantly, I get down to the heart issue of how to be a happy mom. Even though we claim to be Christian moms, doesn't mean we always are perfectly happy and cheerful and smiles. We need some tired Christian mom motivation in our lives, amiright!?! And that's because we're normal everyday sinners. But, in this Christian mom bible study, I hope I bring us back to all that we have in Christ. And I don't JUST share mom tips on how to be a happy SAHM, or how to stay motivated as a mom, but how to overcome our depression in stay at home mom life with the truths of the gospel and the joy we are given in Christ. \n\nINSTA: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#stayathomemom#SAHM#Christianmom",

    "description": "Hey faithful few! Welcome back to my series, Jesus for Mommies, here on my channel, How to Faith a Life. My name is Faith and I make these Christian mom devotionals as a way to bring bible studies and a focus back to Jesus amidst all these mom cleaning and false motivation videos here on Youtube. I say false, because it's nothing past \"get up and do it\" and we need Jesus to meet us in the depths of our needs and inabilities to measure up. I share some scripture for anxiety and depression, and talk a lot about identity.\n\nWhich I think is the main reason most moms struggle with anxiety and why we feel pretty confused when thinking about Jesus and anxiety, because Jesus didn't have inabilities or a lack of understanding about His identity, while we do. In this bible study for women, I take a bible study with me kind of approach to what it looks like to be a Christian living with anxiety and a Christian response to this anxious world. This Christian bible study for moms is one to reach you wherever you are, in the midst of your anxiety, worry, fear and stress of this world. I pray this devotional for moms reaches you in the midst of your need for God in the day to day stress of mom life and the anxiety bible verses serve as a great reminder in this mom devotional that Jesus got chu, girl!\n\n\n\nIf these are the kinds of videos you like; Christian mom content or christian devotional for women or even just Christian mom bible study stuff- go ahead and subscribe because I love making these videos and there will definitely be more where this came from! I love making this series, Jesus for Mommies on my channel, but there are also many other Christian bible studies I post here on How to Faith a Life, so make sure you don't miss any of those, either!

    "title": "BIBLE STUDY ON PRAYER || christian in-depth bible study prayer & how to pray how to study the bible",
    "description": "Today we are going to do a bible study on prayer! But first, if you are new here, my name is Faith and I have this channel, How to Faith a Life and I make videos here that are Christian bible studies and devotionals. I even have a whole series called, \"Jesus for Mommies\" where I make bible study for women and bible studies for moms. I am a Christian mom of two under two, I am a pastor's wife and I love Jesus. I have fallen in love with making videos like this one to reach the world with Christian truths, right where they are: scrolling the web. I think so often we jump onto the internet for inspiration, education, motivation, etc and in all reality, what we really need is biblical truths. THAT'S what I'm here for, to meet you, or really ANYONE with relatable, biblical bible studies that bring truth into our culture here on Youtube. Christian bible studies that bring us back to what's actually true, cool, inspiring, etc.\nSo, in today's bible study we do an overarching sweep over what the Lord's prayer looks like, its use and meaning, and then basic instructions Jesus gave us for our prayer lives and then we look at a few different things we are told to actually pray about. This bible study with me is an in-depth look on how to pray as well as how I pray. \n\nI loved preparing for this video because not only did it have me super evaluate how to pray, but also because I used my prayer journal a lot and was able to evaluate how I pray and how I study the bible. And, as you'll see, I got super convicted at points. This in-depth bible study includes a bit of theology, Greek wordage, and even some Latin phrases, so as always- if you ever have a question or want to challenge what I said, feel more than comfortable to meet me in the comments! This is an open space of community and fellowship! \n\nThis in-depth bible study even includes shots of my prayer journal entry that I made while studying this topic and how I pray in my prayer journal. If you'd like more content like that, on how I pray in my prayer bullet journal, let me know! \n\nI have been thinking about doing a daily bible study, so if that's something you'd be interested in, please let me know! Now, these videos would be significantly shorter- maybe three minutes long... but if that's something you'd enjoy, let me know down in the comments! I really kind of honestly want to do it, but if it's not going to benefit y'all then there's no point!\nSo join me, and study the bible with me.",

    "title": "YOUNG CHRISTIAN MOM & WIFE: LESSONS LEARNED || Christian mom || young wife || christian motherhood",
    "description": "Hey faithful few! Today we are talking about the lessons I have learned being a young Christian mom. We talk about the positives and the negatives of being a Christian mom and/or Christian wife in this day and age as well as the social stigmas of being a young mom. We discuss how hard it can be to find Christian mom friends and how being a young wife and mom can pull you away from the \"normal\" but my honest reaction to that. We talk about Christian motherhood and how hard it can be to find like-minded people and especially other young wife or young moms. As a Christian wife and mom, we are already so different from the rest of the world in the way we parent and live our mommy lives, I just express how much harder it can be when you throw young age into the mix, because of social stigmas. But, if God has called you to it, you gotta do it!\nI have always felt the call to be a Christian stay at home mom and now that I am living that out, it's not that it is easy, but I think in some ways I thought it would be easier for me, because that's what I am called to do! Nope, it aint! Christian sahm life can be extremely isolating! So I wish someone would have told me that beforehand. I also go into depth on a lot of other things, but I'll let you read all about it, might as well not spoil the video! ;)\n\n\nIf you are new here, I am a Christian mom to two under two and I make videos here on How to Faith a Life here on Youtube. As a Christian youtuber, I feel the need to use my skills and giftings for the kingdom, so I do a lot of Christian mom devotional videos and bible studies in my Jesus for Mommies series and things like that. I also make general mom content. But, as a Christian mom youtuber, I feel the need to provide much more than just cleaning motivation, I want to provide true motivation and encouragement that can only come from the Lord, Christian mom motivation. From scriptures, Christian books, the honest truth of my life, etc. So if you like female christian youtube channels like that, go ahead and subscribe! \n\n\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#youngchristianmom\n#christianmom\n#youngchristianwife",

I share in this Christian devotional, what the Lord put on my heart when reading through this scripture and we do an in-depth Christian bible study on Isaiah 43:1-3.

    "title": "LOSING IDENTITY IN MOTHERHOOD? || Christian bible study for moms women || christian mom bible study",
    "description": "Today's video is a Christian mom bible study devotional for moms about losing our identity in motherhood through the day to day seemingly endless chores of laundry and dishes and our whole lives revolving around other people. This devo discusses how motherhood can be so challenging and makes mothers feel lost or like they have lost something valuable and we discus that! I make videos like this one here on Youtube, I seek to bring Christian encouragement and motivation to moms that is rooted in the cross and therefore TRULY encouraging. So, we set aside this time, devote it to the Lord, as a devotional for moms to seek their TRUE LIFELINE! Pretty much every Christian bible study for moms that I make, has to do with issues I am personally thinking and praying through currently, and I do this to be real, but also to be relatable. If I am struggling with something, that means some other mom is also probably struggling with it, too! And I think Youtube needs more Christian mom motivation. These Christian mom bible studies are totally just a starting ground for fellowship and thought, so feel free to join us in our facebook group, Jesus for Mommies. There we can get a little more in depth in our devotionals for moms. \nSo yeah, In this bible study for women, we see that losing your identity in motherhood doesn't actually have to be viewed as a bad thing! I seek to provide real Christian mom motivation by turning our eyes back to Christ, and taking them off ourselves.  I hope and pray that this bible study on losing your identity in motherhood is encouraging and inspiring, as well as sanctifying! \n\n\n\nIf you'd like to see more videos like this, consider subscribing! I am a Christian youtuber, yes one of those crazy Christian mom youtubers who is out here making videos like a weirdo, but I really truly believe we need a Christian mom bible study place here on Youtube.

    "description": "Hey friends! Today we talk about my biggest sin struggle and talk about the sin, in-depth in a Christian bible study for women and men of all ages. I think it's really important as a Christian youtuber to be real and honest with y'all about my struggles and no to put up a fake picture of what it looks like to be a Christian. SO, that is why I dive into this topic more in-depth today for our Christian bible study. Not to bring attention to my sins or justify them in a weird round-about way- but to confess and encourage all us towards holiness. In fact, maybe you're trying to write a bible study lesson! Hopefully this video could be a good resource for you! I hope this in-depth bible study brings you closer to God with scripture and conviction that God uses in your hearts and minds like He has in mine. I share with y'all basic scripture around this topic, my prayers and heart as well as my general attitude with this issue. \n\nMaybe you're new to this channel: my name is Faith and I am a Christian mom and a Christian youtuber who makes Christian bible study and devotional videos for moms and just Christian believers. Most of the reason I am a Christian youtuber, is because I saw a huge need here, on this platform for Christian mom content: bible studies or devotionals that actually TRULY give real \"cleaning motivation\" because they point us not towards working harder and sweating more but towards Christ. Consider subscribing to my channel, Howtofaithalife, and become one of the faithful few (my few, but faithful subscribers and friends).

    "description": "Hey faithful few! This morning I share with you my winter morning routine for 2020. This is the schedule I follow to keep my sanity and get all that I need to get done for the day. I love my quiet time in the morning all alone with a cup of coffee! Basically, in this video I want to provide a good idea of the average DITL (or morning in the life!) for a Christian wife and mom that is a sahm (stay at home mom) of two under two. That's basically why I have had to adapt my morning routine and get up so much earlier, is that having 2 under 2 is just crazy during the day and I can't hardly get things done AND have quality time with my boys! So, here's my morning routine, starting at 5 am! Now, this is just my winter morning routine for 2020, hopefully by the spring our lives will be a little more put together and I can wake up a little later ;). Nonetheless, I hope this video provides you with some morning motivation to get up, pray and spend time with Jesus in a quiet time or bible study! After all, if Jesus really is our only hope and our lifeline, that should get us JUMPING up out of bed and into our bibles, right? I show you my bible study routine and share a few snippets of prayer lessons I have learned and advice for your prayer time and prayer journal-ing. As well as just a general idea of what my morning routine with Jesus looks like. I hope this DITL for my Christian morning routine is relatable and encouraging because I am honestly a bit insecure about how REAL I am in it, without makeup or even a normal outfit! But that's real life mom life! And it's my real and honest Christian mommy morning routine with Jesus. If you like this type of video, or if it gave you mommy inspiration in any way go ahead and subscribe and give this video a thumbs up! I would love to make more videos like this winter morning routine 2020.\n\n\n\nIf you're new here, I am a Christian mom youtuber, and a stay at home mom (sahm) of two under two! I love my two boys, I LOVE routines and organization and being frugal and crafty and most importantly, I love Jesus! Being a SAHM 2 under 2 isn't always easy so I focus on making videos that would encourage other moms like me, in Christian homemaking, motherhood, in their Christian faith walks, and just general mommy inspiration. \n\n\n\nInsta: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#morningroutine\n#5ammorningroutine\n#christianmom",

    "title": "IN DEPTH MOM BIBLE STUDY: Church?! || Christian devotional for women",
    "description": "Hey faithful few! \n\nToday's Jesus for Mommies video (my Christian mom devotionals series of bible studies) is an in depth look on our attitude/heart/struggles on going to church and as Christian moms, making it happen for our whole family. This in depth mom bible study on church is supposed to have us re-evaluate our entire thoughts surrounding going to, getting ready for, and taking part in church. This devotional technically applies to basically anyone everywhere: so whether you're a single dad needing a devotional, or a widow searching for a christian devotional for women- I hope you find this to be encouraging and that it prepares your heart for worship on Sunday. In today's Christian mom devotional, I address the idea that it can be REALLY hard for Christian moms to go to church and have to deal with all the expectations from others for their family, kids, wardrobe, etc. BUT, today I try to provide a Christian viewpoint on what we Christian moms are called to- in all reality, when it comes to church. This devotional for women is to encourage us when we feel like failures- we can't seem to arrive to church on time or with our lives together! The expectations and our failures can really weigh on us, as Christian moms. In this in depth mom bible study I talk about Isaiah 61:2-3 and our theology on the robe of righteousness and what happens on a spiritual level when we are praising and praying to our Father. And how that effects our whole viewpoint of our failures to worship perfectly, as Christian moms who have arrived late or whatever. I hope this Christian mom devotional on church encourages you and inspires you to go to church with a prepared heart this Sunday morning!\n\nIf you like Christian youtubers and could use a Christian mom youtuber in your life, consider subscribing! It's not like I am trying to be the most awesome famous Christian youtuber of 2020, but I DO want to reach mommies with God's truths and encourage other mommies with in depth mom bible studies in this challenging journey of Christian motherhood through christian mom devotionals. I love making these videos which include a sort of Christian devotional for women or devotions for moms and girls. I have been having a lot of fun making these devotional for moms videos and really think I'll move into that direction with this channel, being one  of the many female Christian youtube channels. Make sure to check out the whole Jesus for Mommies playlist, to make sure you haven't missed any of my other videos! Like this video so other Christian mommies can find this mom devotional, and I will see you in my next video!\n\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#christianmom\n#christianmomdevotional\n#christianyoutuber2020",

I hope to encourage and inspire other pastor's wives that may be starting out in the ministry or preparing to be a first lady, with hopefully some kind of direction!

    "description": "Hey friends! Welcome back to another one of my Christian mom bible study videos in my series, Jesus for Mommies, where I bring a Christian devotional for women or Christian moms who might just need a little more Jesus in their coffee. Are you a tired Christian mom needing a little motivation? I think we need more TRULY motivational videos here on Youtube for tired Christian moms, like a daily devotional for moms or even just encouragement for moms that's Christian. That's what I am trying to do here with my Jesus for mommies series; provide mommy inspiration and encouragement for moms that's Christianly and biblically based. If that's something you think you need in your life, consider subscribing and joining us on our Facebook group: Jesus for mommies for more of it! It's a group of a bunch of other tired Christian moms who are seeking the Lord and gathering for a place of fellowship and motivation based on God's Word and our identity in Him.\nToday's devotional for moms focused on why you shouldn't try to be the perfect Christian mom. Why you shouldn't try to be perfect at all. And how that's a harmful ambition for you, your spouse, and your kids. I think we can LIVE in mommy wars here on youtube, where the perfect mom has the perfect house and the perfect car and the perfect marriage and they are showing it off in their video and making us all feel so... NOT ENOUGH. I think we fall into thinking that Christian moms are supposed to be just like that because Jesus was perfect. But I talk about redefining what it looks like to be a perfect mom, especially a perfect Christian mom. As a Christian mom, we are called to be kinda OPPOSITE of that. As a tired Christian mommy YouTuber, I want to be the opposite of that for you guys, and also in my day to day life for my family. So you guys can keep me accountable. \n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#Christianmombiblestudy\n#devotionalformoms\n#Christianmomyoutuber",

    "description": "Hey friends! Today I share with you a realistic day in the life of a stay at home mom of two under two. In this day in the life, we do a little bit of organizing/purging, a little cleaning, a little meal prep- and a lot of trying to maintain sanity while adjusting to two kids under two! Being a sham (stay at home mom) can be hard some days, there's a lot of misconceptions surrounding it and even more guilt and feelings of failure that I think stay at home moms of two under two have to battle. I touch a little on being realistic, as a Christian mommy vlogger, and not wanting to present an unrealistic viewpoint of motherhood and how to get things done with a baby and toddler. I feel very strongly about providing a realistic ditl of two under two and not some rose-colored-glasses viewpoint. I hope this ditl (day in the life) of a stay at home mom with 2 under 2 gives you a realistic and encouraging look into my life and story that makes you feel seen and heard, not alone.

    "description": "Ready to dive into another Christian mom devotional? Today's is a mom bible study on anxiety.\nHey faithful few! Welcome back to another episode of Jesus for Mommies! This series provides Christian mom devotionals for the everyday mom who is struggling along with all of us. To meet us where we are, with Christian mom motivation and scripture for weary moms. Today we talk about a Christian view of being a weary, tired mom and what we're called to do when we feel like that. This bible study for tired moms is kinda a bible study for what I need right now where I am at in my season of life fighting stress and anxiety. I hope it provides you with some real tired Christian mom motivation to get you up and going and loving on your household! We discus the attitude of Christ, His burden, and the world's lies. As well as probably fifty thousand other rabbit trails! ;) I hope this video meets a need for you, and on youtube for real talk among us Christian mommies that our lives aren't and won't ever be perfect but they are His, and that is beautiful.\nMaybe you're a tired stay at home mom needing motivation, or needing scripture for weary moms, or a woman needing encouragement against anxiety or just some Christian wife encouragement. Either way I hope this bible study for tired moms inspires and encourages you AGAINST anxiety in your motherhood! This bible study for tired anxious moms is meant to not be a solve all to all our hardships in stay at home mom life, but rather start a conversation that is God-glorifying.

    "title": "CHRISTIAN MOM LIFE BALANCE || balancing it all in 2020 || balancing mom life in 2020",
    "description": "Hey friends! As we kick off 2020 I've been thinking a lot about balance and Christian mom life balance... what that looks like to balance it all in 2020. I think we'd all say we are afraid we'll struggle balancing mom life in 2020... because mom life is crazy! But, as Christians we have truths we can hold onto and so here I TRY to provide a few key Biblical, Christian truths for us to keep in mind when we feel like we'll never achieve balance! Christian mom life balance is something admirable to pursue, for sure, but let's make sure we're not letting the world define what balance is! Whether it is work and mom life balance, because you're a working mom or stay at home mom life balance for self care and house work: we all have GOT to be on our knees asking the Lord what motherhood needs to look like in THIS season of our lives because balancing it all is going to look different in one season than the next! I pray this video gives you some food for thought in 2020 as we all pursue balance in our mom lives. I think I can really struggle with anxiety when I feel like I am not working hard enough or can't seem to manage my time, and so I hope this video is just an encouragement for moms! \n\n\n\nInstagram: mrsfaithwomack\n\n\n#balance\n#momlife\n#christianmom",

Adjusting to two under two is definitely a process! That's why this video we don't do tooo much, its just an uncut day in the life of a (sahm) stay at home mom with two under two- surviving one day at a time. And TRYING to adjust to two under two. This day is a slower day and so it gives you a great idea of just a rainy day around the house and how I am doing handling our two! I hope this ditl of 2 under 2 encourages and inspires you- that the mundane is beautiful! The uncut life of a stay at home mom is definitely crazy, but its one that I wouldn't trade in for anything! I feel so blessed to be going on this journey of two under two, join me as I am learning and adjusting to two kids under two by subscribing to my channel!

    "description": "Hey Faithful few! Today's video is just a peek into my new life of two under two, with a newborn and toddler. You might call it an uncut day in the life of a stay at home mom. We feel so grateful to have welcomed my second son into the world just two weeks ago, and though most everything is a blur and I am not sure quite what a routine is going to look like yet, I figured I would show you what our life is looking like as we 'survive' day to day. Uncut life of a stay at home mom with two under two: a toddler and a brand new newborn! Totally realistic.  While I was pregnant, I really searched just for a normal, honest, DITL of a mom of a newborn and toddler and couldn't find anything with a true newborn. In my book, once a baby is a month or more in age, a routine is kind of getting set and they are getting to be less of a newborn. Anywho, here's a honest afternoon with my crazy bunch as a stay at home mom of 2 under 2! Haha, I love saying that- It feels so good to finally have two! So, this is truly just a random day in the life as well as some updates on how we are doing, over folding laundry! ;) I am a mom of two, now, after all! I am going to have to multitask wherever I can! I hope you enjoy this uncut day in the life of a stay at home mom, make sure to give it a thumbs up and comment and let me know what you'd like to see in future videos!\n\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#DITLtwoundertwo\n#twoundertwo\n#stayathomemom",

    "description": "Hey there, faithful few! Today I share with you all my lessons learned from the past 18 months of cloth diapering and my plan for cloth diapering my 2nd newborn son, due in just a few weeks! I show you the nursery, we talk potty training, one size cloth diaper stash and I walk you through my newborn cloth diaper stash as well. I watched probably too many of these videos when I was preparing for my first son, worried that I wouldn't have enough newborn cloth diapers and when it came down to it, I realized I had way too many diapers of the WRONG brand. So, moral of the story is that there's no use worrying over the newborn cloth diaper stash too much, because you never know how they will fit! Nonetheless, I share with you my plan for cloth diapering as well as the lessons I learned along the way. Cloth Diapering is definitely a process, one that's a bit fluid, changing with the phases of your child! For example, I used to hate pocket diapers, but now that I have a wiggly-worm son, I love them and can't seem to make my once-beloved-flats work. \nI hope this video benefits you in your cloth diapering journey!

    "description": "This is my 34 week Pregnancy Update- I can't believe I am that far in the pregnancy! After moving houses, the whooping cough catastrophe, and then the death of my sister, it has been a whirlwind! But, nonetheless, I share all the symptoms and LITTLE things that are all coming from this BIG belly of mine! I share about our life and the chaos going on and why I am having a hard time focusing on the pregnancy. I even share why we might be moving AGAIN! We talk about insomnia, varicose veins, needing to pack a hospital bag, all all the things in between! As this is my second child, it's been harder for me to be on-top of the normal to-do list that I lived by for my first pregnancy! But, we finally have the crib up, and are starting to pull out clothes and car seats from storage... we're slowly getting there!\n\n#34weekspregnant\n#thirdtrimester\n#gettingreadyforbaby",

    "description": "It's been a while... I filmed this about two weeks ago, before things got even more crazy with my sister's death. BUT, here's the update as of then. haha! My husband and 16 month old came down with whooping cough, even though my son was fully immunized and we were struggling to settle into the new house and third trimester of my pregnancy. Whooping cough is no joke! If you know anything about pertussis, or whooping cough, it is a serious cough that basically never goes away. People can cough until they throw up and even until they pass out- which is what happened with my husband. \n\n#whoopingcough\n#pertussis\n#quarantined",

We've had so much craziness going on in our lives lately that I felt like I needed to devote an entire sit-down video to explaining it all and talking about real-life hard stuff, because my life is nowhere near perfect, and I think it is important for us to share and be open with each other. We talk about my fears of being pregnant and homeless, discuss moving stress and the timeline as well as my pregnancy and how it impacts how I handle the stress. I then go into a pregnancy update on weeks 21 and 22. As I near the end of the second trimester, things begin to just get generally uncomfortable. Things like varicose veins, back pain, and shortness of breath are to just name a few. Overall, the stress of life and the need for prayer is what dominates my thoughts right now.

Nonetheless, the 17th and 18th weeks of my pregnancy have come and gone, and we are trudging closer and closer to that halfway mark. This pregnancy has been faster, for sure. In this pregnancy update, I talk about my pregnancy lately and all the symptoms I am working through. I also show you my bump! In this 17 and 18 week bump date we talk about back aches, and varicose veins, and my lingering sickness. While this may sound like a lot, I am definitely entering into a easier patch than what I am coming from, which is perfect timing because of our life circumstances! If you didn't see my recent vlog- we just found out we are moving!!! \nHere is that vlog: https://youtu.be/1Y-wvtil5sU\nThis pregnancy has definitely been put on the back burner, as I focus on packing and organizing. Which is just fine with me, I am grateful that it is less demanding and I CAN put it on the 'back burner'. I lumped these two pregnancy week videos together because they are so similar, both have been mostly the same and not too much to write home about. 17 weeks and 18 weeks weren't very different nor eventful! \nLet me know if you're going through pregnancy with me and we can chat!

    "description": "This video is a day in the life of a pregnant mom video where we discuss some huge changes that are happening in the life of our family! I talk about the changes, all that it will mean for our family and process all that with y'all. I remember watching a lot of \"day in the life of a pregnant mom\" videos while I was pregnant with my first son, and wondering how to survive as a pregnant mom. Hope this video gives you a realistic idea of what the day to day life of a stay at home mom looks like. I also showed y'all some of our morning family run to give a better, more realistic idea of running while pregnant. I love running while pregnant and doing really any exercise while pregnant but I think there's totally a stigma around it. People think that all you can do while pregnant is sit on the couch, but that's not true! There is totally a lot of safe exercises and even running that you can do while pregnant! I love love love to run and so I have talked a lot with my doctors and they definitely approve of it. I like taking my husband along on our runs just to make me feel safer, but anyways- all I am trying to say is you can do it girl! Try running through your pregnancy and let me know how running while pregnant went! I would love to do more running vlogs if y'all have interest in that, so leave a comment down below! I think we need more moms talking realistically about running. You don't have to be a marathoner to love running! In this day in the life of a stay at home mom, we play and eat and do all the basic things of most any other family. We even stop by Walmart! Ha. Nothing special, but everything normal. I hope it is inspiring in some ways. \nI guess the only \"special\" thing that goes on is we discuss the big family changes that are happening and all my fears around being pregnant and moving, and packing and pregnant. Moving while pregnant will not be an easy thing, and so we talk a little about my attitude going into this. If you liked this vlog, please leave a thumbs up and comment down below! And as always, stay faithful! \n\nINSTA: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#pregnantexercise\n#dayinthelifeofapregnantmom\n#pregnantrunner",

Being 16 weeks pregnant, blows my mind! I cannot believe I am that far along. Pregnancy this time around has been a lot harder and we discuss why. A lot of my pregnancy symptoms tend to seem more severe, because I am already chasing after another child! I show you my pregnant belly and update you all about the bump date and the growth that the baby is making. I hope these weekly pregnancy updates are not only encouraging, but also relatable.

    "description": "This video is about being pregnant and breastfeeding and how/when my son weaned himself because I lost my supply. All of this is my 15 week bumpdate, part of my weekly pregnancy updates! I have had an overall great experience breastfeeding, and even breastfeeding while pregnant! So, when my son weaned himself I wasn't very happy. I was happy to keep breastfeeding during pregnancy so I was taken off guard when all of a sudden, it was done! He had weaned himself! Granted, it wasn't easy being pregnant and breastfeeding a toddler. But it was working for us! I've come to realize that I was slowly losing my milk supply because nutrients were going to the pregnancy. Low milk supply in the second trimester is something I had read about online, but I thought I would be able to tell, more! The only signs of low milk supply that I was having is my sons detaching and me having a hard time re-latching him. But, at the end of the day, I was happy that I went with baby led weaning rather than going through some hard and long process!

I love watching what I eat in a day videos because they always inspire me to think more creatively about foods that I can try to incorporate into my weekly meal system, but even more so- they help me think creatively about foods that work within a gluten free, lactose free, and red meat free diet!

    "description": "Hey Faithful Few! Welcome back to my series of Christian Devotions for mothers, \"Jesus for Mommies\"- hopefully, my prayer for these video devotions is that they meet you where you're at and lead us into fellowship and conversation. Today's topic is depression and anxiety. This is a weighty topic and one that I am very closely aquatinted with, because my family and I have struggled with it. Anxiety and depression are very real issues that can feel crippling even in the Christian walk and I think it is important for us to acknowledge them and meet them with scripture. My goal is to not only provide Christian help with depression, but also start a conversation in the comments where women can encourage each other and pray for each other, bearing one another's burdens. We look at revenant and encouraging scriptures and really talk about a Christian theology of depression and try to counter many of the lies that I feel like try to hit us while we are struggling with depression and/or anxiety. Whether it is after the loss of a loved one or postpartum hormones, depression can be debilitating for mothers- I know first hand! Hopefully this video will provide some encouragement. Christian depression counseling is very important and this is to never replace that- but rather be a tool in addition to it. I want to provide some Christian, depression help. As one mom to another, or one believer to another, I pray this video helps bring some light to the darkness. \nLeave a comment down below If there is anything I can be praying for! Whether this video is two years old or not- I'll see it and I love to take a moment and stop and pray for my brothers and sisters in the faith. It not only is a blessing to me, re-grounding me throughout my day, but I hope it is a comfort for you!\nConsider liking this video, so others may find it and subscribe if you want to see more content like this one!

And then I discuss why I think morning sickness was a little easier the second time around- and how to make it more tolerable while running after another child. It's no true morning sickness cure or morning sickness treatment, but its basic talk about changing mindset and focusing on the time you're given to make the most of it. \nMorning sickness all day can really truly get depressing and hard, so I think it's of most importance to use acute morning sickness as an opportunity to grow and be sanctified. \nI hope this video about being 14 and 13 weeks pregnant is encouraging and inspiring.

    "description": "This video is about cloth diapers and whether or not it's truly worth it to give it a try. I talk about cloth diapers in general, where to buy them, how to use them, how much they cost and compare the work load to disposables. It's important to make the decision to cloth diaper, coming in as informed as possible. And while I was preparing for my first child I looked for videos just like this one- so now, one year into cloth diapering, I share the truth: what I have learned and what I believe about cloth diapering. I talk about what makes cloth diapers hard, what makes them easy, what makes them cheap and if the cost is really worth it. I talk about ways that I tried to make cloth diapering cheaper. I hope this video gives you ideas on how you can cloth diaper on a budget, and helps you compare cloth diapers vs disposable diapers. Cloth diapering, for beginners can be overwhelming. You don't know how much to buy, what to buy, and if you should be even buying cloth diapers at all! That's what I made this video for- people that just need a overall look at the pros and cons.

I talk about this pregnancy compared to my first, my pregnancy symptoms, first trimester struggles, share my belly shot and even talk about the emotions behind all these things. Let's be real: pregnancy IS emotional. If you are also 10 weeks pregnant, or pregnant along side me, let me know! I love comparing and contrasting pregnancy symptoms and hearing from other moms about how their pregnancies go! This process of being pregnant is magical and hard all at once and I think it is important that we moms share the process together- even if you went through it 10/20 years ago- our experiences matter!\nIt is a marvel that our bodies can grow little beings, that's for sure!

    "description": "This video is about some sad news that I got from my OB doc the other day and processing through the information. My doctor explained more to me about Cephalopelvic disproportion and why I shouldn't try a VBAC (vaginal birth after Caesarean section). The doctor helped explain to me that my pelvic disproportion will effect all my pregnancies and births and we would only be taking huge risks that he wouldn't suggest for even his wife if I tried a VBAC. I mourn this information and the loss of never being able to complete a normal delivery or a vaginal delivery. I talk about the limits on c-sections and how I have to plan for a second c-section. All of this is scary because of the traumatic birth I experienced and the c-section infection that resulted from that birth. I hope this video strikes up conversation about birth plans and labor, as our bodies are so strong and each woman's body and birth is beautiful. I am grateful for modern meds which saved my life and my sons life in my last birth!\n\nMore information about my first labor and delivery story:\nPlanned natural birth goes way wrong: https://youtu.be/Eyb6bHPTu4Q\nMy C-Section got Infected!: https://youtu.be/5AnM8h227is\n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#csection\n#csectioninfection\n#vbac\n#onlycsection\n#toosmallpelvis\n#cephalopelvicdisproportion\n#androidpelvis",

    "title": "CHRISTIAN MODESTY?! || Christian Modesty Christian Women Biblical Modesty",
    "description": "Christian Modest is a hot topic and I got asked to share my thoughts on it! Ahh! Well, here we go.\nI take a sort of unconventional way about this- which some people may disagree with or take fault with, which is completely fine! I'm here to give you my opinions and biblical viewpoint on Christian modesty, but I also know that not everyone will agree with me. But here are my thoughts on Christian modesty, based on my ideas of Biblical modesty. We don't have a lot spelled out in scripture about modesty, so there is definite room for debate and differences. In this series I discuss all the topics related around Christian womanhood and Christian living for moms. Hence, the name of the series, \"Jesus 4 Mommies\". In this particular episode, we dive into the heavy conversation of Christian modesty, as a few viewers had requested. We talk about differences in culture, body types, regions and different ideas of culture. I give a pretty broad idea about modesty because I have learned to acquire that same worldview through various places that I have lived and traveled. But, I also understand how, if someone has only lived in one place their whole life, might have a different understanding of modesty with more defined rules and lines. But I encourage Christian Women that modesty is going to be different in different places. I hope I stir up Christian discussion in love and that the community of my followers can agree in love that the cross is our ALL. It is the ONLY means of salvation, not whether or not our skirt is modest enough. So, Through our conversation over Christian dress, and modesty, I pray that we give grace and leave room for disagreements among Christian women who all view the world differently and have different climates, lifestyles, and cultures.\n\n#modesty\n#christianmodesty\n#christian",

    "description": "This video is about how I lost so much weight after my pregnancy that I ended up losing weight through the process of being pregnant! Pregnancy weight loss is a real thing! I talk about my tips and tricks to lose weight after pregnancy and how to lose that weight fast. I talk about how to loose weight during pregnancy and I talk about the numbers to my postpartum weight loss and how the weight loss journey involved hormones, everything from my sleep to my water intake to my milk production. This topic, postpartum weight loss, is a super sensitive issue but I want to give you this information on postpartum weight loss because I was looking everywhere for it just a few months ago. I talk about how breastfeeding helped me loose weight- especially pumping excess milk. I talk about how many calories are lost pumping each bottle of breast milk and how sometimes milk production is way more important than making it to the gym. Thus, how to loose weight during pregnancy and postpartum weight loss is often through the milk production. Pumping excess milk can be a great weight to kick your body into fat-burning-mode for postpartum weight loss but I caution you; don't let your milk loose its nutrition, and don't loose your milk! You are responsible for making sure your body is giving your child the nutrition he/she needs. DO NOT let your child go hungry! But, nonetheless, you can make pregnancy weight loss happen by being smart, responsible and healthy! Postpartum weight loss doesn't have to be this big mystery!\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/howtofaithalife\n\n\ninstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\nVideos about Running Pregnant:\nStill Running at 38 Weeks:   https://youtu.be/RLvas_nVw58\nRunning @ 29 Weeks: https://youtu.be/KR_5iK-lBJY\n\nGluten Free Dairy Free Morning Sickness: https://youtu.be/br5Jeyn5QBU\n\nC Section Infected: https://youtu.be/5AnM8h227is\n\n#postpartumweightloss\n#pregnancyweightloss\n#pumpingmilk",

    "description": "This weekend we rushed my son to the ER, for a supposed allergic reaction to amoxicillin. I wasn't completely sure what was going on but he was clearly having trouble breathing and I knew it was probably from me giving him his first dose of amoxicillin that was prescribed for an ear infection. Within ten minutes of giving him the medicine he began severely wheezing- which I had never seen him do before. Thus, we freaked out and rushed him to the hospital. Once we got to the emergency room, he was put under a bunch of testing and the doctors ruled that he was fine to go home with an inhaler and a new prescription. So glad we didn't risk anything and took him straight to the hospital because his wheezing was so scary! If you are a new parent and are not sure if your child is having an allergic reaction to amoxicillin or not- just GO TO THE HOSPITAL! \n\nInstagram: @mrsfaithwomack\n\n#emergencyroom",

I was starting to gain too much weight in this pregnancy, and so I talk about how to loose weight while pregnant through working out while pregnant. More specifically, running while pregnant. Being a pregnant runner can be hard, specifically when there's so many misconceptions that pregnant women are just supposed to gain weight and get fat. But, I talk about how I have been able to stay a pregnant runner throughout my entire pregnancy and loose weight while pregnant or at least curb weight gain in pregnancy by running while pregnant. I hope any pregnant mommies or pregnant moms to be can find whatever information they need on how to lose weight while pregnant for a more healthy pregnancy or even to just curb pregnancy weight gain. It can be real hard to stick with a pregnancy diet, between cravings and morning sickness, so that's why I feel it is so important for more pregnant moms to know just how important and helpful working out in pregnancy can be! Especially running while pregnant. \n\n\n\n\n\n Link to the \"Belly Band\" on Amazon:\nhttps://amzn.to/2QMJgM7\n\nMy struggle with morning sickness:\n1.
