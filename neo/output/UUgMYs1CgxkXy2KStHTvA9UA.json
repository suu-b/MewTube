    "description": "Vasco Grillo is a very interesting utilitarian.  He thinks that the most important affects of our actions are those on wild animals, especially very simple ones.  He goes, on this topic, even further than I do.  I thought it would be fun to discuss our disagreements, so I had him on.  Check out more of his research here https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/vasco-grilo?from=post_header, especially his most recent post for practical interventions https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7pwjTpiaD4ytj4W9Y/prioritise-soil-animals-over-farmed-invertebrates.",

    "description": "I'm with Tjump on the religion stuff, but I think his views on morality are incorrect.  Some issues.  \n1 Tjump is using a proprietary definition of morality.  No one else would say an action is bad because it's not the best possible action.  \n2 His criticism of utilitarianism that he claims to be on the criticisms of utilitarianism page on the SEP is from a page that does not exist, and is a criticism that no one except Tjump makes.  \n3 Based on most definitions saying \"x is immoral\" means \"x shouldn't be done.\"  If he thinks it's immoral and should be done, that's a strange definition of immoral, that's unique to him.  \n4 His claim that this is a problem for some but not all models of utilitarianism is false.  I'd encourage anyone who disagrees to send me a model supporting each of those.  Ultimately, Tjumps criticism is a merely semantic dispute based on his own unique usage of moral language.  \n5 As you observed, he could not name a utilitarian who espoused the view that he claimed afflicted many models of utilitarianism.  This is because it is a view that no one serious holds.  Everyone serious utilitarian would agree that it would be better if you could save all six people in the trolley problem, but that if you can only save five, you should save the five over the one.",
