They may be shrewd in business, undaunted in social encounters, and vociferous in defending their causes in public. And yet, in other situations, these very same people can find themselves sharply and strangely unable to protect their own interests. This is one of the more subtle effects of childhood trauma in adulthood.\n\nThe situations in which these people become powerless, innocent, unworldly and too pure for their own good are intimate ones. In close relationships, the years seem to fall away from them. They find themselves in a couple and lose any ability to imagine that their partner might be anything other than ‘very nice’ and ‘on their side’. Other people may spot a problem at once; in their eyes, all is completely well until it is far, far too late…”\n\nOUR COLLECTIONS\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpcEwc0qydf2jSszQFSht81E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpckOvZZ_AZjD7WM2p9-6NBv\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpeUL1vz9Su7OmeghBDgmj7X\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpeypJMHfNbJ4RAFkRtmAN3P \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpcpxBm1RoGRx4mVKNRIrKkG\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28Xmpcp7jXVszdNruKUtHZ2zuZb\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28Xmpfv2COuuJaKzy6E2n8nSMdi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28Xmpc1qCJ6RYYh4rKNOOlKtFIK\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life/  \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@theschooloflife?lang=en \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nNatalia Talkowska\nhttps://www.natalkadesign.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

But we aren’t, for that matter, ever being shown the complete picture – for a fundamental reason: they still have a lot to lose. They are our wife or husband, our long-term partner, meant to be with us until death; and therefore, they have a reputation to defend.

Reading books, a lot of books, is the hallmark of brilliance as well as the supreme gateway to prestige and understanding. It’s hard to imagine anyone arriving at any insights of value without having worked their way through an enormous number of titles over the years. There is apparently no limit to how much we should read. We might – logically and ideally – be reading all the time and get ever cleverer with every moment we do so. The number of books we have managed to read by the day we die will tell us pretty much all we need to know about the complexity and maturity of our minds.\n This so-called maximalist philosophy of reading enjoys enormous cultural prestige. It is backed up by enormous publishing and journalistic industries that constantly parade new titles before us – and imply that we might be swiftly left behind and condemned to a narrow and provincial mindset if we did not rush to read four of this year’s major prize winning books as well as seven fascinating titles that have received ardent reviews in the Sunday supplements since March.

It can be infinitely easier to look after someone else than to direct generosity inwards.\n\nIt may in this context help to try out a minor imaginative exercise: to picture ourselves as being, alongside our normal duties, always responsible for looking after a small child, a distinctly sensitive five year old, who happens to be a version of our younger selves…”\n\n\nOUR COLLECTIONS\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpcEwc0qydf2jSszQFSht81E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpckOvZZ_AZjD7WM2p9-6NBv\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpeUL1vz9Su7OmeghBDgmj7X\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpeypJMHfNbJ4RAFkRtmAN3P \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28XmpcpxBm1RoGRx4mVKNRIrKkG\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28Xmpcp7jXVszdNruKUtHZ2zuZb\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28Xmpfv2COuuJaKzy6E2n8nSMdi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxNMb28Xmpc1qCJ6RYYh4rKNOOlKtFIK\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life/  \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@theschooloflife?lang=en \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDeanca Rensyta\nhttps://www.deancarensyta.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

Most people around us won’t be any the wiser, but with greater or lesser subtlety, we will be scanning: suggesting coffees and lunches, accepting every invitation, giving out our email addresses and thinking with unusual care about where to sit on train journeys. Sometimes the rigmarole will be joyful; at times, a bore. But for a portion of us, as many as one in four, it will count as one of the hardest things we ever have to do. Fun won’t remotely come into it. This will be closer to trauma. And it will be so for a reason that can feel more humiliating still: because, a long time ago now, we had a very bad childhood – one whose impact and legacy we still haven’t yet wholly mastered. \n\nIt may not look like it, but babies are also looking out for love. They’re not going out in party smocks or slipping strangers’ their phone numbers. They are lying more or less immobile in cribs and are capable of little besides the occasional devastating cute smile. But they too are looking out for someone’s arms to feel safe in; for someone who can soothe them, someone who can stroke their head, tell them it will all be OK when things feel desperate and lend them a breast to suck on.

Why is our childhood so critical in shaping the rest of our life? And what does it all mean, anyway? Along the way, Alain walks Jamie through some of the reasons why we experience the ‘ick’, the typical emotional burdens parents project onto their children, and why breakdowns often lead to breakthroughs. They also explore ways of understanding our own relationships – and how our attachment styles and past experiences can shape the way we love.\n\n\nGreat Company is an original podcast from JamPot Productions uploaded with their permission to The School of Life.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on the Great Company podcast, links below:\n\nYouTube |  ￼ @greatcompanypodcast\nInstagram |  ￼ @greatcompanypodcast  \nTikTok |   ￼ @greatcompanypodcast  \n\n--\n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

This Ancient Greek myth - which dates back to the earliest days of civilisation - introduces us to the gifted and canny architect Daedalus, who was imprisoned by evil king Minos in a tall tower in an isolated corner of Crete, together with his beloved son Icarus. Unwilling to spend the rest of his days in captivity, Daedalus constructed some wings by glueing together the feathers of passing birds with beeswax and invited Icarus to join him on the window ledge in a bid for freedom.

There are feelings that exist in an ‘unprocessed’ form within us. A great many worries may, for example, remain disavowed and uninterpreted and manifest themselves as powerful directionless anxiety. Under their sway, we may feel a compulsive need to remain busy, fear spending any time on our own or cling to activities that ensure we don’t meet what scares us head on (these might include internet pornography, tracking the news or exercising compulsively). A similar kind of disavowal can go on around hurt. Someone may have abused our trust, made us doubt their kindness or violated our self-esteem but we are driven to flee a frank recognition of an appalling degree of exposure and vulnerability. The hurt is somewhere inside, but on the surface, we adopt a brittle good cheer (jolliness being sadness that doesn’t know itself), we numb ourselves chemically or else adopt a carefully non-specific tone of cynicism, which masks the specific wound that has been inflicted on us…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here:  https://goo.gl/FxY6e6\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nVale Productions\nhttp://www.valeproductions.co.uk/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

    "description": "Why is it so hard to regulate your emotions? Learn how to stay in tune with your mood and embrace emotional fluctuations.  \n \nRead our article, ‘We are made of moods’ to find out more about your changing emotional states: https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/we-are-made-of-moods/  ?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=We%20are%20made%20of%20moods\n\n\nOur moods are affected by the smallest of changes – from fluctuations in our blood sugar content and serotonin levels, to whether or not our partner gave us a kiss before we left for work. In turn, our emotions condition almost every aspect of our behaviour: how we respond to events, react to challenges, and feel about ourselves. Understanding just how powerfully our emotional state impacts our thoughts and actions can help us manage those effects more readily – and build a more stable and forgiving relationship with ourselves. \n \n☀️📚 About The School of Life:  \nWe are a passionate group of people on a mission to bring about healing, growth, calm and self-understanding. \n \nWe derive our ideas from psychology, psychotherapy, philosophy, art and culture.

An adulthood worthy of the name is an internal process which may post-date the acquisition of a formal adult identity by many years. We might be 92 and still, very slowly, leaving adolescence behind. If we lived to be 450, many of us would still be struggling to acquire the fundamental constituents of a grown-up…”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nLéon Moh-Cah\nhttp://leonmohcah.com \nhttp://instagram.com/leon_moh_cah\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

We require only so much of it as is compatible with making it out of bed. We have to confront an uncomfortable fact about self-awareness: those who most know how to enjoy life may also be those who - at points - are masters at fruitfully lying to themselves.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDeanca Rentysata\nhttps://www.deancarensyta.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

It’s simply such a pity – and so profoundly unfortunate – that we have ended up with such an unyielding and resistant partner…”\n\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDave Anderson\nhttps://daveandersonart.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

The answer one might expect is that they start to hate the person who doesn’t give them the love they need. Far from it. The reality is that the child becomes filled with shame.  What is shame? A sense that one is profoundly unworthy, dirty, soiled, sinful, ugly, embarrassing – and also, in danger; a fit subject of attack and ridicule by strangers. The child is unable to redirect the blame outward: it does not ask: ‘What is wrong with my parents for not loving me adequately?’ It simply wonders in a forlorn way: ‘What have I done wrong in order to have ended up on the receiving end of my parent’s disapproval?’ A primitive fear of abandonment kicks in. The child prefers to attack itself for being bad than to confront a yet more awful possibility: that it is entirely dependent for its well-being on inadequate and unkind parental figures.",

The answer one might expect is that they start to hate the person who doesn’t give them the love they need. Far from it. The reality is that the child becomes filled with shame.  What is shame? A sense that one is profoundly unworthy, dirty, soiled, sinful, ugly, embarrassing – and also, in danger; a fit subject of attack and ridicule by strangers. The child is unable to redirect the blame outward: it does not ask: ‘What is wrong with my parents for not loving me adequately?’ It simply wonders in a forlorn way: ‘What have I done wrong in order to have ended up on the receiving end of my parent’s disapproval?’ A primitive fear of abandonment kicks in. The child prefers to attack itself for being bad than to confront a yet more awful possibility: that it is entirely dependent for its well-being on inadequate and unkind parental figures.\n\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nNatalia Biegaj\nhttps://www.nb-animation.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

The river of ideas and feelings is relentless, turbulent and chaotic. In a typical minute, we might briefly register that we are annoyed with a friend, then our minds are directed to a worry about a tax return, which is then quickly supplanted by the sighting of a raven, which makes us think of our grandmother, who evokes a trip we once took to Greece, which ushers in thoughts of some lip balm we need to purchase, which is then supplanted by a registering of a pain in our left knee, which is succeeded by a memory of a friend we lost touch with after university, which cedes to a recurring reflection on what kind of lamp we might invest in for the living room.

It would help us to say, at points, and at last, ‘no.’\n- We would realise, with considerable dark humour, that we were fools. We are idiots now, we were idiots then and we will be idiots tomorrow. There are few other options for a human being.\n- We would shed our pride; we would realise how much we constantly misunderstand - and never more so than when we begin to have faith in our competence and sanity.\n- We would acknowledge the influence of the body on the mind. We may sink into existential despair not because there is anything objectively tragic at hand, but because we are in urgent need of an orange juice or missed out on an hour of sleep.\n- We would respect the art of diplomacy and the importance of politeness; we would acknowledge the surprising thought that other people may be just as easily hurt as we are.\n- We would learn, painfully, to use language to give those around us an indication of what is at play within us. We wouldn't hold it against them that they didn't understand things we had never bothered to teach them.\n- We would realise how much others long for warmth and reassurance and would be less inhibited about offering those two very serious categories of gifts: cosiness and sweetness.\n- We would acknowledge that it was impossible to be friends with, or liked by, everyone. Attempting to please universally ultimately only leads to offending many; we would know how to disappoint frankly and quickly to avoid drawn-out appeasement.\n- We would feel more carefree at the idea of being strange. Public opinion would matter less, because we would have seen enough of the shallowness and reflex moralism of crowds. This would be our one life, we would know; and we would have the courage to be oddballs where we needed to be.\n- We would take our own boredom as a guide. Everyone else might declare it a brilliant book or an extraordinary play. We might toss it aside or walk out.\n\nThis is some of what we might think and feel if we ever became those paragons of true intelligence: emotionally mature people.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nHannah O’Brien\nhttps://www.hanobrien.com/\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

We politely disagree: \n1. Pick someone you feel profoundly grateful ever decided to look your way. Start from a sense that you are the lucky one - and that they are superior (the truth is irrelevant). \n2. Make sure you fancy them. Check out that you have compatible areas of perversion - and little interest being normal in bed.\n3. Allow yourselves both to admit, from an early stage, that you are ‘mad’; heavily distorted by your pasts, unable to understand yourselves, prone to irrational assumptions - and unsteady in your assessments of reality.\n4. Make apology the most regular of occurrences. Say sorry about everything all the time and reduce the price of an admission to almost zero.\n5. Remove all pride from your character. You were an idiot then, you are an idiot now, you will be an idiot tomorrow. There’s no other option for a human being. Make jokes.\n6. Regularly explore how you have disappointed one another. Let them sometimes hate you and you them. Don’t be frightened by anger moderately expressed. The enemy of love is stifled emotion, not maturely explored authenticity. Listen very carefully when they tell you how they feel.\n7. Never describe them categorically as this or that (insulting trait). Only ever say: I feel you are this or that… Observe the difference.\n8. Get good at sensing the fear beneath your angry moods, then express the fear gently rather than acting out the anger.\n9. Reduce expectations of perfection. It’s going to get horrible at times. Allow for major frustrations. You will want to kill them and they you. Don’t.\n10. Accept you will have crushes on others. Let them wash over you - and, if the mood is right, share them with the partner.\n11. If there are children, recognise that love will suffer hugely. Look forward to properly picking up the baton again in 15 years.\n12. Become the sort of person who has no embarrassment about being ‘needy.’ Accept the child in you and look after their needs in the relationship.\n13. Read up about attachment theory - and keep the concepts close at hand.\n14. Stop being defensive; stop needing to maintain a proud hold on your own dignity. Laugh continually at your foolishness - and apologise for it.\n15. Accept that they can’t save you from your own disturbances. Try to be happy in yourself and if you are not, don’t redirect the blame. Observe how often your rocky patches are projected versions of your own life crises. Get a therapist.\n16. Don’t expect everything from love.\n17. Be very prepared (though reluctant) to leave. Remain out of choice, never desperation.\n“\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nHannah O'brien\nhttps://www.hanobrien.com/\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk",

And yet we are at a loss as to what we might do. What, if anything, could help?\n\nOne kind of answer is this: we should try to notice when the desire to regurgitate food or watch porn or drink strikes us.\n\nThough this might sound strange, those in the grip of addictions seldom do notice.

We might, as vulnerable people, admit to a desire to be mummied or daddied, to curl into a ball, to cry over a so-called small thing, to be reassured about an apparently minor flaw, to call up our lover every ten minutes, to suffer from anxiety or paranoia, to speak in a regressive voice or to hug a favourite stuffed animal…”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nLinkedIn: ttps://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nAaron Sampson\nhttps://www.motionmaverick.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/motionmaverick/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/",

Below the surface they are engaged in a ruthless and ongoing attempt to sell us a version of reality: to tell us what we are ‘really’ like, what we actually need, what life is truly about - and who they have been and what their motives are.

The English 18th century historian Edward Gibbon is particularly helpful with this task of bringing us to a less frightened perspective. His massive, elegantly written work covers 1500 years, from the pinnacle of Roman power around the year 180 AD, through the collapse of the Western Empire to the final fall of its last outpost, the city of Constantinople, in 1453.

Why do parents bully their children? In short, in order to try to feel better about themselves. Because they suffer intensely in the very same area that they are bullying their child in. If we, as children, want to know what our parents were afraid of or haunted by, we only need to ask: in what areas did they bully me? What did they make me feel scared or inadequate about? Someone made them feel awful and they surmise - by twisted logic - that they will feel better through the process of making their own child feel very bad indeed; they aren’t doing it personally, the child is collateral damage to a misguided project of healing and attenuation of symptoms. It doesn’t make any sense of course,  but it may actually work for the parent, for a time.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nMike Booth\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/",

Appalled by the sentimentality around him, he learnt to make art that was insular, unrelenting, sombre and oriented towards pain. It was, one critic said, the visual equivalent of a condemned prisoner’s last gasp.

Simply put, almost no adult remembers a single thing that happened to them before they were three years old: countless days and nights, a succession of complicated moods, sensations and events will have vanished into thin air, like a library of precious books that is sent up in smoke or dumped unceremoniously into the sea. Furthermore, most of us remember very little of what went on before we were seven. This may seem like an obvious point, but it has momentous implications.

The audience was packed with celebrities, aristocrats and famous politicians, eagerly awaiting another triumph from a man universally heralded as a genius. At the end of the performance, there was a standing ovation.

But beneath shyness, there may lie something more surprising, pernicious and poignant. We suffer from a suspicion of ourselves that gives us a sense that other people will always have good reasons to dislike us, to think ill of us, to question our motives and to mock us. We then become scared of the world, speak in a small voice, don’t dare to show our face at gatherings and are frightened of social occasions because we fear that we are ideal targets for ridicule and disdain. Our shy manner is the pre-emptive stance we adopt in the face of the blows we feel that other people want to land on us.

It’s their sense that nothing is at stake in their behaviour towards others that leads them to ignore the rules of politeness and humanity – and to kick people as if they were plated in armour. They are – in this respect – paying homage to childhood. Think of the situation of a young child, of perhaps six, who has fun mocking a parent’s double chin or the wrinkles around their eyes. To this child, the parent is still, in many ways, an invulnerable deity. They live in a remote, impressive world of work, credit cards, driving and the news.

It’s their power to attract love that ensures they will be fed and clothed, protected and kept alive.\n\n In exchange for this nurture, young children readily offer their parents or caregivers unconditional admiration. They naturally adore and are boundlessly impressed by those who pick them up and bathe them, warm their milk and change their sheets.

Life is a more or less ongoing emergency for everyone. We are invariably haunted by doubts about our value, by concerns for our future, by shapeless anxiety and dread about things we’ve done, by feelings of guilt and embarrassment about ourselves. Everyday brings new threats to our integrity and except for very rare moments when we and the world feel solid, there is almost always a background throb of unwellness in our minds.

When he was contacted by an admiring reader, a Baroness Fanny Pistor, under the ostensible excuse of seeking help with her writing style, he was able to discover a whole new side to his sexual identity. What he wanted most of all was that Fanny would dress in a grand and imperious-looking fur coat, flog him, dominate him and treat him with haughty cruelty.

The ruptures are often quite small, and to outside observers perhaps imperceptible: one person fails to respond warmly to another’s greeting; someone tries to explain an idea to their partner who shrugs and says off-handedly that they have no idea what they’re on about; in front of friends, a lover shares an anecdote which casts the partner in a less than flattering light.

Reading books, a lot of books, is the hallmark of brilliance as well as the supreme gateway to prestige and understanding. It’s hard to imagine anyone arriving at any insights of value without having worked their way through an enormous number of titles over the years. There is apparently no limit to how much we should read. We might – logically and ideally – be reading all the time and get ever cleverer with every moment we do so. The number of books we have managed to read by the day we die will tell us pretty much all we need to know about the complexity and maturity of our minds.\n This so-called maximalist philosophy of reading enjoys enormous cultural prestige. It is backed up by enormous publishing and journalistic industries that constantly parade new titles before us – and imply that we might be swiftly left behind and condemned to a narrow and provincial mindset if we did not rush to read four of this year’s major prize winning books as well as seven fascinating titles that have received ardent reviews in the Sunday supplements since March.

What makes straightforward people gratifying to be around isn’t so much that their positions and intentions are always inherently unproblematic, it’s that we happen to know exactly what the issues are from the start. There is therefore no need to guess, infer, decode, untangle, unscramble or translate. There are no sudden surprises or revolutions in perspective. If these straightforward types don’t want to do something, they will, politely and in good time, explain that it’s really not for them. If they’re unhappy with our behaviour, they won’t smile sweetly while developing noxious stores of envy or hatred in the recesses of their minds; they will immediately provide a gentle but accurate statement of how we are frustrating them. If they are worried a project is going awry, they won’t pretend that all is well until a catastrophe can no longer be denied. If they are attracted to someone, they will find charming, kind and inoffensive ways of making their feelings clear. And in bed, they may want to please, but they can also be honest and unashamed about what actually excites them.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nNoelle Smith Design\nhttp://www.noellesmithdesign.com/\n \nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/",

Voltaire was enraged. Of course science wasn’t going to improve the world; it would merely give new power to tyrants. Of course philosophy would not be able to explain away the problem of evil; it would only show up our vanity. Of course love was an illusion; power a chimera, humans irredeemably wicked, and the future absurd. Of all this his readers were to be left in no doubt.

It had purported to tell us how old the earth was (4,000 years old), how many suns there were in the universe (one), how evolution had begun (by divine decree) and why rainbows existed (to remind us of God’s promise to Noah). But these lamentable attempts were finally put to an end when science was able to investigate reality with reason, asserted itself against obscurantist priests – and drove religion into the cobwebbed attic it presently resides in. Science didn’t so much replace religion (there was no need) as expunge the scourge altogether from human consciousness.

We should dare to learn whether we belong in the introverted camp.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://bit.ly/308YFw6\n\n”The modern world purports to respect both introverts and their opposites but in practice, the action, the rewards and the glamour are all precisely designed to synchronise with the talents and sensibilities of those in the extroverted camp. To have any chance of seeming normal or achieving success, one must pull off a range of feats to which extroverts seem inherently well suited: impress strangers, attend conferences, make speeches, outshine competitors, manage people, join in with prevailing enthusiasms, reflect public opinion, socialise, travel a lot, go out often and date widely.\nIt can take a very long time before we realise that – however much we might hope for this to be otherwise – this is not in fact us at all. For our part, we happen to get very worried before going to parties, we have felt close to death before giving speeches, any kind of social occasion perturbs us heavily, we’re left extremely jittery by encounters with news and social media, we start to feel sick if we haven’t had the chance to sit on our own and process our thoughts for a few hours every day, new places (especially bedrooms) worry us hugely, we’re very awkward about having to be responsible for anyone at work and we are extremely wary of jolliness or demonstrations of group fervour of any kind.

Le Corbusier began his career by attacking the architecture of the Victorian age – and contrasting it with what he saw as the beauty and intelligence of engineering. ‘Our engineers are healthy and virile, active and useful, balanced and happy in their work,’ he exclaimed in his polemical book, Towards a New Architecture (1923), while ‘our architects are disillusioned and unemployed, boastful or peevish. This is because there will soon be nothing more for them to do. We no longer have the money to erect historical souvenirs. At the same time, everyone needs to wash!

We don’t want others necessarily to agree with all our feelings, but what we crave is that they at least validate them. When we are furious, we want another person to say: I can see that you’ve been driven to distraction. It must feel very chaotic for you inside right now for you. When we are sad, we want someone to say: I know you’re unusually down and I understand the reasons why.

    "description": "There is no more important book to understand our times than Albert Camus's The Plague, a novel about a virus that spreads uncontrollably from animals to humans and ends up destroying half the population of a representative modern town. Camus speaks to us now not because he was a magical seer, but because he correctly sized up human nature. As he wrote: ‘Everyone has inside it himself this plague, because no one in the world, no one, can ever be immune.’ \n \nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

We understood love intuitively long before it was ever a practical possibility. We knew that it was bound up with a sense of being profoundly understood and finally able to say everything, without fear of judgement or censure. Love was a two-person conspiracy against everyone else too dumb or leaden to get ‘it’, the true nature of being alive. It had to do with fancying someone totally and the amazingness that they might fancy you back, to the extent that you could do anything with them, like rest a finger inside their mouth and ask them to bite it hard. We imagined from the first that love might be the best part of life – and we were not wrong. In the name of love, we put ourselves in extraordinary situations. We went out far more than we would have wanted. We bought fancy clothes, we thought about our hair and worried about our spots, we drank intensely coloured cocktails, we ended up at small hours in alien parts of town, in the bedrooms of people we knew weren’t right but that seemed at least in some way to be an advance on the cause. We accepted dates with people we knew were problematic because we wanted not to ossify or grow too peculiar. It wasn’t always right, in fact, it was mostly always wrong, but we kept our spirits up and told ourselves it would eventually be OK, as they kindly assured us it would be…”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nDeanca Rensyta Mihardja\nhttps://www.behance.net/deancarensa5a9\n \nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/",

We fed the seagulls and drank cheap white wine from paper cups on the seafront and felt connected and happy. Then there was a moment on honeymoon, when we discovered the little Vietnamese restaurant hidden away in a side street in Paris and became friends with the owner and her husband. Or we recall how, at a large party, we both realised we didn’t particularly like the other guests – it was a special, conspiratorial moment: the two of us, shoulder to shoulder, talking over just what was wrong with everyone else.

We keep many of our dilemmas and confusions away from those we like, for fear of irritating or inconveniencing them and so spoiling the relationship. We may well have a voice echoing in our minds from childhood: ‘Don’t bother your mother, can’t you see she’s exhausted from her trip? Don’t bother your father, he works hard for us and he’s busy right now…’ There are powerful reasons why we equate making others happy with burdening them as little as possible. \n\nBut our analysis is missing a key detail of human psychology: we like to be bothered.

We must – wherever possible – learn to think more of other people, keep in mind how often we fail to see things from their point of view, and be aware of the small and large ways in which we disadvantage and ignore collective interests. Being good means, at its most basic, putting other people more squarely at the center of our lives.\n\n But for some of us, the problem isn’t so much that we are heedless to this advice, rather that we take it far too closely and remorselessly to heart. So mindful are we of the risks of selfishness, we run into an opposite danger: an abnegation of the self, a modesty that borders on self-erasure, an automatic impulse to give everything over to competing parties, a shyness about pressing oneself forward and a manic inability to say ‘no’ or cause the slightest frustration to others.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nGabriella Marsh\nhttps://gabriellamarsh.com/\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/",

    "description": "We live in a culture that hugely values activity and 'hard work'. But - paradoxically - the hardest work we can sometimes do is to stop rushing around and, for once, sit with our thoughts, analyse our feelings, take stock of where we are and understand ourselves better. From the outside, it might look as though we're being lazy. But we're in fact doing the hard work of processing our emotions, in a way that can be hugely helpful to our mental well-being and, in its way, remarkably difficult.\n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

We’re simply not able to write anything new or can’t face setting up more meetings. We don’t want to clean the fridge or go out to befriend prospective clients. All we have an appetite for, it seems, is to loll on the sofa and maybe dip randomly into a book, wander down to the shops and buy a packet of biscuits or spend an hour or so soaking in the bath. We might, at an extreme, merely want to sit by the window and stare at the clouds.

The baby will start to look stern and then burst into tears and the wise parent knows that nothing is particularly wrong (though the baby may by now be wailing): it is just time for a nap. The brain needs to process, digest and divide up the welter of experiences that have been ingested, and so the curtains are drawn, baby is laid down next to the soft toys and soon it is asleep and calm descends.

For some, it’s an innately beautiful touchstone, the designator of a special kind of experience that is so valuable, it is best left reverentially unexplored and pure, lest one disturb its ethereal mysteries with the cold hand of reason. For others, it’s nonsensical bunkum of appeal only to adolescent dreamers, the underemployed and the weak minded. But precisely because ‘spiritual experiences’ are so often either worshiped or derided, it pays to try to submit them to dispassionate and sober examination, not in order a priori to crush them or honour them, but so as to make them more intelligible, to friend and foe alike. Whatever our suspicions, spiritual moments are capable of being pinned down, split into their constituent elements and assessed with due regard.

We are used to thinking highly of reason and logic. We are not normally enemies of evidence and rationality. How then could these ingredients become problematic in the course of love? But from close up, considered with sufficient imagination, our suspicion can make a lot of sense.\nWhen we are in difficulties what we may primarily be seeking from our partners is a sense that they understand what we are going through. We are not looking for answers (the problems may be too large for there to be any obvious ones) so much as comfort, reassurance and fellow-feeling. In the circumstances, the deployment of an overly logical stance may come across not as an act of kindness, but as a species of disguised impatience.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nCreative Seed\nhttps://creativeseed.co.za/\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\nVale Productions\nhttps://www.valeproductions.co.uk/",

    "description": "There's a special kind of argument that can arise in a couple when, for a range of reasons, there hasn't been enough sex. Unfortunately, couples tend to feel too ashamed to mention what the argument is really about - and so squabble about essentially unrelated things. Even worse, the fact there are arguments makes it ever less likely that sex will actually take place in the future. The couple is stuck in a cycle that needs to be understood - and then broken.\n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

We might be intellectually creative: and so want to be a novelist, journalist or academic. We might be musically creative: and so want to start a band. Or we might be sensorily creative: and so want to start a restaurant. The problem is that securing any of these jobs is – statistically speaking – almost impossible.

What Sartre meant by ‘being’ are the bits of our life that we are free to choose for ourselves: how we live, what job we do, how we conceive of what happens to us.

The torture comes down to one essential question which pursues us into the early hours: What do they have that we do not?\nPart of the agony rests on a basic feature of human psychology; we know ourselves from the inside, in great and dispiriting detail, whereas we can know others only from the outside, from what they choose to reveal, which may be almost nothing, aside from an attractive face and a charming manner.”\n\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://bit.ly/2O0IL3H\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\n2zLZe2V\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nLois de Silva\nhttp://www.loisdesilva.com/\n\n#TheSchoolOfLife #BreakUps #Relationships",

    "description": "Fractious couples are often made up of one party who is 'avoidant' (hiding their intimacy needs) and one who is 'anxious' (nagging and pressuring counter productively for their intimacy needs to be met). These couples go through cycles that run from cosiness to fury to sulk to blow up to cosiness. Why do these cycles happen and why are they so hard to break?

The anxiously attached party typically complains – more or less loudly – that their partner is not responsive enough: they accuse them of being emotionally distant, withholding, cold and perhaps physically uninterested too. The avoidant lover, for their part, stays relatively quiet but in their more fed-up moments, complains that the anxious party is far too demanding, possibly ‘mad’ and, as they put it pejoratively, ‘needy’. One person seems to want far too much, the other far too little.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDirection & Illustration- Natalia Ramos\nhttp://www.nataliarama.com\n\n#TheSchoolOfLife #AttachmentStyles #Relationships",

Our culture teaches us to trust and follow our feelings. But couples therapy knows this is to be a disaster, for our feelings are for the most part errant and encoded with primitive responses from a troubled past. So instead, it encourages a far wiser response: standing well back from our first impulses, neutralising them through understanding and where possible rerouting them in less self-punishing and more trusting directions.”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nMarcie laCerte\nhttp://marslizard.net/",

While ostensibly interested in assuaging her grief, the lover is in reality more concerned with exploiting her vulnerability – for what are assumed to be nefarious ends. He is excited, perhaps even sexually, by her sadness and far from rescuing her, uses her sorrow to aggrandize himself. Even before mentioning the horse on which the rescuer might ride into town, this is all meant to – and does indeed – sound properly ridiculous, if not outright sinister.”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/eQNMJM\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nZedem Media\nhttps://www.zedemanimations.com/en/portfolio #TheSchoolOfLife",

These may be solid enough reasons, but when the problems persist over an extended period, their power to explain our situation weakens. Without anything remotely persecutory or unkind being intended by this, one is forced to cast around for psychological rather than procedural explanations. The problem must lie in our minds rather than in the world.”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/iKTxNh\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDavid Crisp\nhttps://vimeo.com/mistercrisp #TheSchoolOfLife",

Correctly administered, without requiring any conscious cooperation from us, pills play around with our brain chemistry in a way that helps us get through to the next day – and the one after.

    "description": "Many of us suffer enormous anxieties about what might happen if the worst came to the worst. Well-meaning friends often reassure us that things might go really well, but there is often great relief to be found in imagining the darkest scenarios and being able to see that we could, ultimately, survive them. \n\nFURTHER READING\n\n“In the background, many of us are terrified of so much – disgrace, illness, sacking, our mortality, the suffering and death of loved ones… When these fears come up, we are often encouraged, out of kindness, to think of the best-case scenarios. It’s a well-meaning move, but it also – unintentionally – leaves our fears to fester; they fill us with unnamed dread and sometimes loom far larger than they should. So an opposite move – displayed here – involves looking our anxieties directly in the eye, refusing to be cowed by them and examining them in exhaustive detail so as to drain them of their debilitating power. Doing so is liable to bring us to an important realisation: we could cope –  even if the worst came to the worst…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://bit.ly/2s4OZRU\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nMad Adam Films\nhttp://madadamfilms.co.uk/\n\nIllustration from 'The Magic Pudding' by Norman Lindsay (1918) Copyright © H, C and A Glad.'\n\nImages and Music from:\n\nBrazil 1985\nCitizen Kane 1941\nThe Singing Detective 1986\nRogue One 2016\nA Christmas Carol 2009\nClouds of Sils Maria 2014\nThe Wind in the Willows 1995\nNosferatu 1922\nPan's Labyrinth 2006\nBBC Cunk on Britain 2018\nMoonrise Kingdom 2012\nAnother Year 2010\nThe Horse's Mouth 1958\nBBC Life on Earth 1979\nThe Moon and the Sledgehammer 1971\nAmerican Honey 2016\nPhantom Thread 2017\nThe Kid with the Bike 2011\nAlmost Famous 2000\nOnly Lovers Left Alive 2013 #TheSchoolOfLife",

To learn that others judge us to be foolish, perverse, ugly or unpleasant is one of the most challenging aspects of any life. However, the impact of criticism is hugely variable – and depends ultimately on a rather unexpected detail: what sort of childhood we have had. The clue to whether criticism will be experienced as merely unpleasant or wholly catastrophic lies in what happened to us many decades ago in the hands of our earliest caregivers…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://bit.ly/2qDCFs5\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films in our playlist: \nhttps://bit.ly/2g0YFKq\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nAndrei Verioti\nhttp://andreiverioti.com/\n\nSound Design\nMarian Popescu #TheSchoolOfLife",

The whole of it calls for tears.’ The Roman philosopher Seneca used to comfort his friends – and himself – with this darkly humourous remark which gets to the heart of Stoicism, the school of philosophy which Seneca helped to found and which dominated the West for two hundred years. We get weepy and furious, says Stoicism, not simply because our plans have failed, but because they have failed and we strongly expected them not to. Therefore, thought Seneca, the task of philosophy is to disappoint us gently before life has a chance to do so violently. The less we expect, the less we will suffer. Through the help of a consoling pessimism, we should strive to turn our rage and our tears into that far less volatile compound: sadness. Seneca was not trying to depress us, just to spare us the kind of hope that, when it fails, inspires bitterness and intemperate shouting.…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/CX4zsr\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on PHILOSOPHY in our playlist: \nhttps://goo.gl/AVtBYq\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\nMad Adam Films\nhttp://madadamfilms.co.uk/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

Few of us want to be a school teacher, instructing children in some narrow academic subject or other, which is what we overwhelmingly associate with the word ‘teacher’, the person in a rather frayed jacket in front of the class, the type who bored us rigid for long stretches of our early years. However, teaching is far from being something that we only need to learn if we’re contemplating a career in education. Considered properly, teaching – by which we mean, the vital business of getting an important idea from one mind into another – is one of the most crucial life skills that any of us ever require. Every one of us, whatever our occupation, needs to become a good teacher, for our lives constantly require us to deliver crucial information with grace and effectiveness into the deep minds of others…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/KX59kb \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nNick Hilditch\nhttp://nickhilditch.com/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

Jesus has recently come down from Galilee to Jerusalem when some Pharisees, members of a sect focused on precise adherence to Jewish tradition and law, present him with a married woman whom they have caught having sex with someone other than her husband. ‘Teacher,’ they ask him, ‘this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.

    "description": "The idea of ‘atonement’ sounds very old-fashioned and is deeply rooted in religious tradition. To atone means, in essence, to acknowledge one’s capacity for wrongness and one’s readiness for apology and desire for change. It’s a concept that every society needs at its center. \n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

It means, according to the dictionary, the action of making amends for a wrong or injury and, especially in religious contexts, reparation or expiation for sin. The modern world chiefly believes that the rightful way to amend for a wrong is either to pay a fine or go to prison. These are, in certain circumstances, surely the best moves – but they fail to deal with what is, in the end, the far largest category of wrongs that humans commit: instances of everyday nastiness, error, foolishness, lack of empathy and shortsightedness. Fining or imprisoning on a mass scale is not realistic here and yet, leaving the wrongs unaddressed seems not quite right either. We need a procedure for atonement that is both real and functions outside of the judicial system…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/D9bsxV\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nMike Booth\nhttps://www.youtube.com/somegreybloke #TheSchoolOfLife",

You’ll be in a highly explosive sealed aluminum tube, breathing recycled kerosene-infused air, for the next six-and-a-half hours, with no way of getting off or out. The pilot may be exhausted or inwardly distressed. Air traffic control at any of the 40 waymarks along the journey may get momentarily distracted. You’ll be streaming 5 miles above the surface of the planet. No one else seems remotely sensitive to what any of this implies – they’re chatting and reading magazines – but for you, it’s the beginning of a kind of hell.

However, we seldom accord the business of decision-making the kind of careful attention it requires. When faced with a large decision, we lack rituals and procedures. We typically procrastinate, lean on the nearest person or rush headlong into an unexamined solution. Fortunately, decision-making is a skill and – like any other – it can be taught. The chief enemy of good decisions is a lack of sufficient perspectives on a problem. We should systematically think through any issue from six distinct angles: through the eyes of – variously – our Enemy, our Gut, Death, Caution, Courage and our Parents. As we try out, juggle with and then synthesise these oblique perspectives, we will feel our sense of possibility expand – and a tolerable way forward gradually emerge from the present confusion…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/MizVUb\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nDiyala Muir\nhttp://diyalamuir.com\nhttps://vimeo.com/diymuir #TheSchoolOfLife",

    "description": "We are often encouraged to believe that the goal of our lives should be happiness. But unfortunately the word happiness is misleading, in that it suggests that it might be possible to have a good life and not go through a lot of pain. We might be better off defining our purpose in terms of another word – this one drawn from Ancient Greek: EUDAIMONIA.  \n\nFURTHER READING\n\n“Eudaimonia is an Ancient Greek word, particularly emphasised by the philosophers Plato and Aristotle, that deserves wider currency because it corrects the shortfalls in one of the most central, governing but insufficient terms in our contemporary idiom: happiness.\nWhen we nowadays try to articulate the purpose of our lives, it is to the word happiness we commonly have recourse. We tell ourselves and others that the ultimate rationale for our jobs, our relationships and the conduct of our day to day lives is the pursuit of happiness. It sounds like an innocent enough idea, but excessive reliance on the term means that we are frequently unfairly tempted to exit or at least heavily question a great many testing but worthwhile situations…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/bEfZ7d\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://www.theschooloflife.com/london/app/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nEirini Vianelli\nhttps://www.eirinivianelli.com/animation/\nhttps://vimeo.com/eirinivianelli #TheSchoolOfLife",

There is so much we might fairly want to change about them. We’re an entirely imperfect lot. And so we want them to be more self-aware, punctual, generous, reliable, introspective, resilient, communicative, profound… At home, we want them to focus more on the sink, the children, the bins, the money and the need to put the phone down and look up. At a macro dimension, we want them to think more about the suffering of encaged animals, the destruction of our habitat and the iniquities of capitalism. We are, most of us, very far from our ideal selves – and at the level of the species, come close to an evolutionary error.

A similar kind of disavowal can go on around hurt.

It’s associated with saying something upbeat but untrue in order to hoodwink its unsuspecting target for low personal gain. In Aesop’s famous fable, The Fox and the Crow, an ugly crow has found a piece of cheese and retired to a branch to eat it. A sly fox, wanting it for himself, flatters the crow, calling it beautiful and wondering whether its voice will be as sweet as its appearance. The crow lets out a horrific screeching sound and the cheese drops straight into the fox’s gaping expectant mocking jaw. But there’s another form of flattery with more valuable and ethical ambitions. Parents of small children invariably discover its uses – which deserve to be better known and practiced around all age groups. Let’s imagine that a child isn’t yet entirely kind to their brother, or good at drawing, or a perfect cook or helpful around the house – but the parent declares that they are so as to encourage and make more concrete what is as yet only tentative and fragile in their ambivalent nature. The child is being helped to end up as some of the things he has already been described as being...”\n \nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/Mn9GJp\n \nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n  \nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n \nSOCIAL MEDIA\n \nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n  \nCREDITS\n \nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nAna Stefaniak\nhttp://www.anastefaniak.co.uk/\nhttps://vimeo.com/sirmagpie #TheSchoolOfLife",

Don’t they?\nBut in truth, truly good conversations come along very rarely; largely because our societies fall for the Romantic myth that knowing how to talk to other people is something we are born knowing how to do, rather than an art dependent on a little planning and a few skills. We rightly accept that total improvisation in preparing a meal is unlikely to yield good outcomes; but we show no such caution or modesty when it comes to how we might talk over the food once it has been made. Finding oneself in a good conversation can feel as haphazard and random as stumbling on a beautiful square in a foreign city at night ­– and realising one won’t reliably know how to get back there in daytime.”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://goo.gl/dSuY1L \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nKhyan Mansley\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Khyan1\nhttps://twitter.com/khyan #TheSchoolOfLife",

In order to locate our lover, we must let our instincts carry us along, taking care never to impede them through pedantic psychological analysis and introspection or else considerations of status, wealth or lineage. Our feelings will tell us clearly enough when we have reached our destiny. To ask someone with any degree of rigour why exactly they have chosen a particular partner is – in the Romantic world-view – simply an unnecessary and offensive misunderstanding of love: true love is an instinct that accurately and naturally settles on those with a capacity to make us happy.…”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nZedem media\nhttp://www.zedemanimations.com/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

You walk past the house of the girlfriend you knew when you were sixteen. You look up to what used to be her bedroom window. From the outside, everything still looks the same, though somebody else lives there now. Her parents are retired, she’s married with two small kids in another city. You feel a searing nostalgia for everything that was and no longer is. It’s not so much her you miss, more what you had, who you both were, how things looked then. It’s hard to explain what the feeling is, though it is confounding in its intensity. At that moment, your phone rings. It’s a friend – who asks how you are.

Too often, it seems a supreme form of duplicity, a sly attempt to excite another person and derive gratification from their interest without any corresponding wish to go to bed with them. It looks like a manipulative promise of sexual affection that, at the last moment, leaves its targets confused and humiliated. In our sadness, back home alone after the nightclub or the party, we may rail against the flirt for ‘only’ flirting, when it had appeared there would be so much more. But this kind of pattern represents only one, unedifying and regrettable possibility around flirting. At its best, flirting can be a vital social process that generously lends us reassurance and freely redistributes confidence and self-esteem. The task is not to stop flirting, but to learn how better to practice its most honourable versions.\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \n\nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nNina Cosford\nhttp://www.ninacosford.com/\nAnimation by \nAli Graham\nhttp://www.grarg.com #TheSchoolOfLife",

It’s well observed that between the ages of around one and twelve, many children manifest a deep attachment to a stuffed soft object, normally shaped into a bear, a rabbit or – less often – a penguin. The depth of the relationship can be extraordinary. The child sleeps with it, talks to it, cries in front of it and tells it things it would never tell anyone else. What’s truly remarkable is that the animal looks after its owner, addressing him in a tone of unusual maturity and kindness. It might, in a crisis, urge the child not to worry and to look forward to better times in the future. But naturally, the animal’s character is entirely made up. The animal is simply something invented, or brought to life by one part of the child, in order to look after the other.\"\n\nMore on this and other topics here: https://goo.gl/Z0Zk5b \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/P0DPzb \n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nDo you speak a different language to English?

Though taking someone at face value is rightly seen as a supreme symbol of respect, within love, it may at points be more accurate, as well as a great deal kinder, to dig beneath the surface meaning of words in search of a partner’s real but more bashful, complex or hesitant underlying emotional intention.…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other topics here: https://goo.gl/NchXWr \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nZedem films\nhttp://www.zedemanimations.com/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

We reach around for the most benevolent interpretations. We don’t think they are doing it in order to upset us.

But more recently, politeness has come under suspicion. While we may not outright reject it, it’s not a word we now instinctively reach for when we want to explain why we like or admire someone. ‘Politeness’ can sometimes even carry almost the opposite of its traditional connotations, suggesting an offensive or insolent degree of insincerity and inauthenticity. A ‘polite’ person may come to be judged as a bit of a fake – and in their own way, really rather rude...”\n\nYou can read more on this and other topics here: https://goo.gl/Qz2hgC \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n     \nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nSteve Whittle/Reflective Films\nhttp://www.reflectivefilms.co.uk/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

    "description": "David Hume is one of Scotland’s greatest philosophers (Adam Smith is another, about whom we also have a film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejJRhn53X2M). His claim to greatness lies in his appreciation of ordinary experience, his descriptions of consciousness and his humane, tolerant approach to religious disputes.  \n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?

This is, at one level, possibly a great insult to our self-image, but Hume thought that if we could learn to deal well with this surprising fact, we could be (both individually and collectively) a great deal calmer and happier than if we denied it...”\n\nYou can read more on this and other topics here: https://goo.gl/SuwPBi  \n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE    \n\nWatch more films on PHILOSOPHY + CURRICULUM in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLphilosophy \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nMad Adam\nhttps://madadamfilms.co.uk/ #TheSchoolOfLife",

His goal was to work out nothing less than how power worked and then to change it in the direction of a Marxist-anarchist utopia.

It threatens our planet through excessive consumption, distracts us with irrelevant advertising, leaves people hungry and without healthcare, and fuels unnecessary wars. Yet we’re also often keen to dismiss the ideas of its most famous and ambitious critic, Karl Marx. This isn’t very surprising. In practice, his political and economic ideas have been used to design disastrously planned economies and nasty dictatorships. Frankly, the remedies Marx proposed for the ills of the world now sound a bit demented. He thought we should abolish private property. People should not be allowed to own things. At certain moments one can sympathise. But it’s like wanting to ban gossip or forbid watching television. It’s going to war with human behaviour. And Marx believed the world would be put to rights by a dictatorship of the proletariat; which does not mean anything much today. Openly Marxist parties received a total of only 1,685 votes in the 2010 UK general election, out of the nearly 40 million ballots cast…”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n  \nWatch more films on POLITICAL THEORY in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/2dma0Sn \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nMike Booth\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/somegreybloke #TheSchoolOfLife",

His father, a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where he often went to cafes on the Left Bank and sat on benches in the Jardin du Luxembourg. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore distinctive, heavy glasses. He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for literature, but refused it on the grounds that the award was capitalist and bourgeois. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described himself as ugly. He wore his hair vigorously brushed back. When he died in 1980 (aged 74), 50,000 people accompanied his coffin through the streets of Paris...”\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on PHILOSOPHY in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLphilosophy \n \nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \n\nX: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nMad Adam\nhttp://www.madadamfilms.co.uk #TheSchoolOfLife",
