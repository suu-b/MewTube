    "description": "💥Join us on our Journey to 1 Million Subscribers💥\nPeter Boghossian is an American philosopher. For ten years he was a professor of philosophy at Portland State University, but resigned following the college’s response to ‘the grievance studies affair’. This entailed Boghossian - alongside James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose - submitting bogus papers to peer-reviewed publications related to gender studies and other similar disciplines, in order to satirise the poor academic quality of such fields. More recently Boghossian has been engaging in what he calls, ‘street epistemology’ where he encourages people in public places to examine their opinions, why they hold them, and what it would take for them to change their minds.\nCheck out his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@drpeterboghossian\n\nWe are proud partners with GiveSendGo - a world-leading crowdfunding platform that believes in free speech.

Get 20% off and free shipping when you use the code TRIGGER20 at https://www.manscaped.com\n\nDavid Davis has been a Conservative Member of Parliament since 1987. He joined the Government in 1990 and served in both the Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office, where he was responsible for government negotiations on Europe, NATO enlargement, the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the updated Geneva Convention. He went on to serve as Conservative Party Chairman, then Shadow Deputy Prime Minister. David was Shadow Home Secretary from 2003 until he announced his resignation in 2008, forcing a by-election to raise awareness of New Labour’s relentless erosion of civil liberties. Following the EU Referendum in which he campaigned to leave, David was appointed Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Since leaving Government in 2018, David has campaigned on issues including Brexit, educational reform, tax fairness, social mobility matters and civil liberties.\n\n\n\nOR Support TRIGGERnometry Here:\n\nhttps://www.subscribestar.com/triggernometry\nhttps://www.patreon.com/triggerpod\nBitcoin: bc1qm6vvhduc6s3rvy8u76sllmrfpynfv94qw8p8d5\n\nMusic by: Music by: Xentric | info@xentricapc.com | https://www.xentricapc.com/ YouTube:  @xentricapc  \n\n\n\nAdvertise on TRIGGERnometry:\n\nmarketing@triggerpod.co.uk\n\nJoin the Mailing List:\n\nhttps://www.triggerpod.co.uk/sign-up/\n\nFind TRIGGERnometry on Social Media: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/triggerpod\nhttps://www.facebook.com/triggerpod/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/triggerpod/\n\nAbout TRIGGERnometry: \n\nStand-up comedians Konstantin Kisin (@konstantinkisin) and Francis Foster (@francisjfoster) make sense of politics, economics, free speech, AI, drug policy and WW3 with the help of presidential advisors, renowned economists, award-winning journalists, controversial writers, leading scientists and notorious comedians.\n\n00:00 Intro \n02:03 David's Life Before Politics \n09:07 Why David Became a Conservative \n15:25 Does the Parliamentary Conservative Party Value Freedom?\n17:57 Sponsor Message: Manscaped\n19:20 Why Did So Many People Support the Government During Covid?\n28:31 Is the Conservative Party Still Actually Conservative?\n37:59 The Unwillingness of Current Leaders to Make Unpopular Decisions\n46:49 Predicting the Next General Election\n51:46 How Would Thatcher Have Handled the Ukraine Situation?\n59:32 Are We in a Second Cold War?\n1:01:39 Updates on the Brexit Situation\n1:07:34 What’s the One Thing We’re Not Talking About?
