    "title": "You Are the Entrepreneur of Your Life  | Stephen Hicks | Universidad Francisco Marroquin",
    "description": "This talk was given in the Fall of 2024 at the Universidad Francisco Marroquin in Guatemala City, Guatemala.\n\nStephen Hicks delivers an impassioned and data-rich talk about personal agency, mindset, and the revolutionary social, economic, and technological world we live in. Addressing students, especially psychology majors, Hicks argues that the most important concept for their generation is “entrepreneurship”—not merely in the business sense, but as a guiding philosophy for living a flourishing, autonomous life.  To illustrate the importance of entrepreneurial thinking, Hicks presents three compelling stories from medical history:\n\nDr. Hicks draws a conceptual link between philosophy and psychology via the notion of *mindset*. Our mindset—how we perceive ourselves, the world, and our possibilities—is central to how we navigate life. \n\nHicks urges students not to drift through life or accept inherited scripts. Instead, they should embrace the freedom and responsibility of shaping their own destinies. The entrepreneurial mindset, deeply rooted in the revolutions of the modern era, is the key to not only surviving but thriving in an unpredictable world.\n\nStephen R. C. Hicks, Ph.D., is Professor of Philosophy at Rockford University, USA, and has had visiting positions at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., University of Kasimir the Great in Poland, Oxford University’s Harris Manchester College in England, and Jagiellonian University in Poland.\n\nOther links:  \n\nExplaining Postmodernism audiobook: https://youtu.be/qQcNjHNXnEE\nNietzsche and the Nazis audiobook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2C90l7YlT8&t=2331s\n\nPlaylists:\n\nEducation Theory: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4ooYs8ObKd-MFI0zUdqS3qeQ\nEntrepreneurship and Values: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4oqytunn6nwIXkLx8CJp1TYo\nNietzsche: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4ori6DyybR_LgBpj",

    "description": "This conversation with Chuong Nguyen, of the Unlicensed Philosophy podcast explores Friedrich Nietzsche's profound influence on modern philosophy, particularly postmodernism, and his complex relationship to Nazism. Hicks outlines how Nietzsche’s ideas on power, morality, and perspectivism laid groundwork for later thinkers like Foucault, and how these ideas—often misinterpreted—intersect with both Nazi ideology and contemporary political movements. He also refutes the claim that Nietzsche’s sister distorted his philosophy to align with Nazi beliefs. \n\nStephen R. C.

    "title": "Modernism, Postmodernism and the Way Forward | A Conversation | Stephen Hicks & Andy Schmitt",
    "description": "This conversation between Andy Schmitt and Stephen Hicks spans a wide array of topics centered on the evolution of Western philosophy, especially the transition from modern to postmodern thought. They trace the rise of modern philosophy from the fifteenth-century globalization unleashed by Columbus, Gutenberg’s press, and Martin Luther’s insistence on individual Scripture reading, through the emergence of scientific reasoning, to the radical individualism of the Quakers. \n\nThey examine how postmodern thinkers—Derrida, Foucault, Rorty, Lyotard—dismantled both religious and scientific claims to objective truth, ushering in an age of skepticism, expressive subjectivism, and cultural fragmentation. \n\nHicks argues that this upheaval has provoked a three-way debate—between modernist, postmodern, and revived pre-modern perspectives—and contends that renewed engagement with philosophy can help us overcome today’s “culture wars.” \n\nDr. Hicks was interviewed by Andy Schmitt on his Orthodoxy channel in December 2024.\n\nStephen R. C. Hicks, Ph.D., is Professor of Philosophy at Rockford University, USA, and has had visiting positions at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., University of Kasimir the Great in Poland, Oxford University’s Harris Manchester College in England, and Jagiellonian University in Poland.\n\nOther links:  \n\nExplaining Postmodernism audiobook: https://youtu.be/qQcNjHNXnEE\nNietzsche and the Nazis audiobook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2C90l7YlT8&t=2331s\n\nPlaylists:\n\nEducation Theory: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4ooYs8ObKd-MFI0zUdqS3qeQ\nEntrepreneurship and Values: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4oqytunn6nwIXkLx8CJp1TYo\nNietzsche: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4ori6DyybR_LgBpj",

Its essence is inarticulate and its expression, when compelled, skeptical.\"\n\nRoger Scruton (1944-2020), the British conservative philosopher,  took up conservatism after witnessing first hand the 1968 Paris student riots.  Unlike many contemporary conservatives who align with economic liberalism and free markets, Scruton articulates a conservatism rooted in authority, tradition, and social cohesion. He argues that the conservative instinct is rooted in a recognition of social continuity and the importance of inherited institutions. \n\nHe focuses on conservatism's differences with liberalism, which he sees as its greatest foe.

Why not have anarchy?\"\n\nRobert Nozick (1938-2002) was an American philosopher who wrote on political philosophy, epistemology, decision theory and ethics.  The topic of this video is focused on a section of Nozick's  Anarchy, State and Utopia, in which he examines the nature and limits of slavery.\n\nNozick also critiques collectivist views that treat society as an entity above individuals, asserting that only individuals with their unique lives and values are real. He warns against using individuals for the supposed benefit of society, as this disrespects their autonomy.\n\nA significant portion of the lecture is devoted to Nozick’s \"Tale of the Slave,\" a thought experiment that examines various scenarios of control over an individual, from outright slavery to democratic systems. Through this, Nozick questions whether individuals are truly free under modern systems of taxation, paternalistic regulation, and democracy, drawing parallels to slavery. \n\nPhilosophers, Explained covers major philosophers and texts, especially the great classics.

In this essay, Qutb details the nature of the cause, the belief system, a plan of action and a call to action. \n\n\"Fundamentally, it is a religious battle that Qutb is engaged in. It was not a political or an economic or a racial struggle. Instead, essentially it was a struggle between beliefs, either unbelief or faith, either jahiliyya or Islam.

    "description": "The topic of this video is the 1852 work \"Catechism of Positive Religion\" by Auguste Comte.  Comte (1798-1857) was a French philosopher, He is noted for coining the terms 'sociology' and 'altruism.'\n\nOne of his great concerns was the social breakdown that occurred during the French Revolution.  He saw the cause as the confusion of theological, metaphysical and scientific thinking that most people live by.  \n\nComte argued for a radical new philosophy of science: positivism, in which we no longer seek the causes of events we witness in the world, but limit our thinking  to discovering the actual laws of phenomena, that is to say, their invariable relations of succession and likeness. We are to measure what we can observe.\n\nAs applied to society, he concluded that morality was to consist in altruism or \"live for others.\"  He also argued for strict regulation of society and human behavior.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n00:27 The text\n04:38 Science applied: sociocracy\n14:05 \"The heart states the question, the intellect answers them\"\n17:25 Moral motto of positivism: \"live for others.\"\n18:35 Conversation I\n20:50 One true religion\n22:09 The application of medicine in a sociocracy: the role of regulation\n24:19 What of personal instincts?\n26:22 Altruistic unity\n30:57 The Immense and Eternal Being: Humanity\n34:15 Ordering from Above\n35:45 Should people think for themselves?\n38:05 Humanity as the whole of human beings, past, present and future\n39:05 Am I nothing?\n41:37 Conversation III - Education under the true science\n45:24 The nine social sacraments\n46:00 In closing: the Temples of Humanity\n\nPhilosophers, Explained covers major philosophers and texts, especially the great classics.

    "description": "In this video Dr. Hicks discusses Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy as presented in his 1785 work \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\". \n\nKant argues for a conception of morality based on duty and reason, rather than on desires, inclinations, or the pursuit of happiness or pleasure. He claims that the only thing that has unconditional moral worth is a \"good will\" - the will to do what is morally right simply because it is morally right and not for any other reason. \n\nKant distinguishes between hypothetical imperatives, which are based on desires or goals, and categorical imperatives, which are moral laws that apply universally and unconditionally.\n\nKant contends that moral worth comes from acting out of duty to these categorical imperatives, not from the consequences of one's actions. Kant also argues that as rational beings, we must regard ourselves as legislators of the moral laws to which we are subject, rather than as merely passive subjects of those laws.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:09 Introduction\n00:39 Text and explanation of terms\n01:28 Looking for a pure moral philosophy\n03:03 Lying\n06:42 What makes a good will good?\n10:47 What of happiness?\n13:22 Acting from duty\n19:38 Genuine moral worth\n20:51 Categorical Imperative\n32:32 An end in itself\n41:30 Freedom\n44:00 Justification\n\nPhilosophers, Explained covers major philosophers and texts, especially the great classics.

    "description": "Socialism continues to attract followers more than a century after Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels first called for communist revolution in 1848.  Dr. Hicks sets out to investigate what is the attraction.\n\nEarly adherents of socialism were religious: monks and nuns, for instance.  But Marx and Engels offered what they called scientific socialism.  And yet, when you look at their writings, one has to ask: is it really based on facts, evidence, argumentation, experimentation, the whole apparatus of reason? Or is it ultimately a kind of faith commitment? \n\nIn the end, Dr. Hicks likens their idealistic visions to a modernized, atheistic Garden of Eden.\n\nFor some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a philosophical analysis podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.

    "title": "Morality Without Gods | Open College No. 53 | Stephen Hicks",
    "description": "Is morality natural or can it only be explained and justified by referring to a supernatural Being?  \n\nThe religious position is that nature cannot explain morality and therefore, we must believe in moral supernaturalism.  \n\nThe natural position is that humans make choices.  Reality provides a standard by which we can distinguish good from bad.  Therefore, morality is a natural phenomenon. \n\nOn a personal level, should I decide on my core ethical values by 1) seeking direct communication with God or the gods or, 2) should I join an established religion and accept their code or, 3) simply copy the prevailing norms of society or, 4) should I independently judge what I consider to be good and bad? \n\nFor some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a philosophical analysis podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.  It has been available on a number of other platforms.  It is now being offered on YouTube as well.  Its mission is to “ to explain the chaos.”\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n00:31 Our question\n01:40 Can social science data help?

    "title": "If God exists, why is there evil in the world? | Open College No. 39 | Stephen Hicks",
    "description": "The problem of the existence of evil in the world has long been a major argument against the existence of an infinite God who is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient. This question comes from the natural theology tradition, which is concerned with studying religious issues using reason and evidence.  The existence of God and the existence of evil in the world are seen to be incompatible.  \n\nDr. Hicks examines the argument and some of its counterarguments.  \n\nHe also looks at some of the final conclusions that are reached.  Some conclude the argument is sound.  Others see there is no way to answer the theodicy argument.  An act of faith is required.  Reason is inadequate.  Finally, other modify God's perfection or power.\n\nFor some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a philosophical analysis podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.  It has been available on a number of other platforms.  It is now being offered on YouTube as well.  Its mission is to “ to explain the chaos.”\n\nStephen R. C.

    "description": "In this podcast, Dr. Hicks discusses the teleological or 'design' argument for the existence of God.\n\nHe begins with a discussion of the difference between revealed and natural theology. \n\nRevealed theology states all of the major truths are revealed by God to humanity, or perhaps to specific prophets, who then communicate them to the rest of humanity.  \n\nNatural theology argues that God gave us various observational and rational faculties and we should use them to observe reality and argue to the existence of God. \n\nHe examines in critical detail the following teleological argument for the existence of God:\n\n1) The natural universe is orderly.\n2) Complex order cannot arise from within nature itself.\n3) Therefore, complex order requires an external or complex orderer.\n4) This external orderer must have great power and intelligence.  \n5) Therefore, there must be such an supernatural orderer.\n6) His name is God.\n7. Yes, He exists.\n\nHe concludes that the argument is worth serious study, but, in the end, it does not work.\n\nFor some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a philosophical analysis podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.

So, what should we think about religion?  \n\nIn this podcast, Dr. Hicks looks at the role that reason, evidence and logic and faith play in religious belief.

    "description": "\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" by Thomas Kuhn(1922-1996) is a seminal work in the philosophy of science.  It is also an often quoted text in postmodern theory.\n\nKuhn saw science as a discipline which lurches from normal science to revolutionary science.  Revolutionary science presents a new paradigm for seeing the world which is incommensurate with the current paradigm of normal science. On his view, there is not really any progress in science.  It is merely a series of lurches.\n\nDr. Hicks takes a look at this skeptical work which sees science as no more important, truthful or enlightening than any other belief system.  \n\nFor some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a philosophical analysis podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.

What is democratic socialism and can it protect us against dictatorial socialism?\n\nDr. Hicks examines the ideas of democratic socialism and its history.

    "title": "Should we Blame Keynes for Everything? | Open College No. 28 | Stephen Hicks",
    "description": "John Maynard Keynes was the most influential economist of the twentieth century.  In his The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936, he argued that deficit spending during an economic downturn would create demand and eventually encourage supply.  Once the economy recovers, the deficits should be repaid.   Deficit spending has been the norm for the past ninety years, but the deficits are rarely repaid.  \n\nIn this podcast, Dr. Hicks looks at Keynes' theory and how it has been implemented.  How close is current Keynesian practice to original Keynesian economic theory?\n\nFor some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a philosophical analysis podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.

Oppression and exploitation \n7. People shaped by economic forces\n8. Violent revolution will be necessary\n9. Class distinctions will fade\n10.

    "description": "For some time, Professor Hicks has been doing a podcast on a wide range of contemporary topics.  It has been available on a number of other platforms.  It is now being offered on YouTube as well.  Its mission is to “ to explain the chaos.”\n\nIs a free and open society more susceptible to the dangers of envy? We are all familiar with the claim that socialism is simply based on envy.   Yet, some have argued that envy is, in fact,  worse in a free society because a free society leads to greater inequalities. This point was argued by Jean Jacques Rousseau and also, John Rawls.\n\nProf. Hicks looks at both positions as well as taking a glimpse at levels of envy in past, primitive cultures and small modern communities where comparison is relatively easy.  He concludes by looking at positive reasons for attention to social comparison.\n\nStephen R. C.

It is now being offered on YouTube as well.  Its mission is to “ to explain the chaos.”\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche collapses in the streets of Turin, Italy in 1889.  He is 44 years old.  He never recovers.  He had been working on what may be his magnum opus.  Enter Nietzsche's sister.  Her  name was Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche.   In 1901, under Elisabeth's direction, an edition is published with the title \"The Will to Power.\" In 1930, Elisabeth, before they came to power, became a supporter of the National Socialists. She was a believer. Looking back, what should we make of this work?\n\nThe most widespread view after World War II has been to dismiss The Will to Power on the grounds that it was distorted by Elisabeth: either by omissions, or by selective highlighting, or, possibly, additions. \n\nIn this podcast, Dr. Hicks looks at the facts, the extent of Elisabeth's influence on the work and offers his thoughts.\n\nOther links:  \n\nExplaining Postmodernism audiobook: https://youtu.be/qQcNjHNXnEE\nNietzsche and the Nazis audiobook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2C90l7YlT8&t=2331s\n\nPlaylists:\n\nEducation Theory: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4ooYs8ObKd-MFI0zUdqS3qeQ\nEntrepreneurship and Values: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4oqytunn6nwIXkLx8CJp1TYo\nNietzsche: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLurzsfhvI4ori6DyybR_LgBpjgJUskRC-",

There was lots of good stuff, great achievements in the Middle Ages. \n\nBut the mainstream view, by contrast, has been that the Middle Ages were a dark period in Western history. Life expectancy was low. Literacy was low and declining. People were by-and-large superstitious, ignorant of science and of the larger world around them.\n\nSo who has the better argument?  Good historians break the Medieval into two parts: from 400 CE to 1000 CE and that from 1000 CE to 1500 CE time periods.

There is a persistent claim that our culture is a failure. It is made by pessimists of all stripes, including many postmodernists.\n\nPr. Hicks will look at this claim in some detail by looking at the achievements of the Enlightenment in light of its promised progress. He will also examine some of the reasons that might explain the pessimism found amongst some intellectuals.\n\nStephen R. C.

    "description": "This lecture took place at Clemson University on October 30, 2019.\n\nIt was sponsored by The Clemson Institute for the Study of Capitalism, America's premier academic institution dedicated to studying the moral foundations of capitalism and a free society.  Their YouTube channel is at: https://www.youtube.com/c/clemsoncapitalism/featured \n\nIn this lecture, Dr. Hicks gives a historical overview of key educational ideas from Ancient Greece, the modern era and up to these postmodern times.  He discusses key ideas from each of the periods.  Classical education stressed discipline, obedience and rule following, while modern thinkers, like John Milton, Galileo, John Locke and Montaigne stressed independent judgment and the power of reason.  \n\nHe then examines the contemporary scene in which reason is seen fundamentally as an instrument of white male power by such postmodern thinkers as Richard Rorty, Andrea Dworkin, Jacques Derrida, Henry Giroux and Chandra Mohanty, who argue that the classroom has become a political and cultural site--a center of power struggles--and that education must be turned to activism.\n\nHe concludes with a look at the empirical data which vindicates the role of reason in light of the advance of political freedom and economic prosperity in the last 200 years.\n\nTime stamps:\n00:00 Pope Lecture\n1:09:35 Q & A\n\nStephen R.
