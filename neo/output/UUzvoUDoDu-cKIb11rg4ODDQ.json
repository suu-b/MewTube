Start your free trial today: https://learn.lingopie.com/holykoolaid\n\nWhat if Jesus wasn't the only religious leader whose followers claimed he rose from the dead? Are post-mortem appearances and resurrection stories actually unique to Christianity, or do we find eerily similar patterns across religions worldwide? And why do we give ancient accounts of Jesus's appearances zero scrutiny while dismissing nearly identical modern claims outright, despite them having better evidence?\n\nToday we're exploring six religious figures from the last 150 years whose post-death re-appearances are actually far better attested than Christ's. From Lobsang Rampa (a supposed Tibetan monk who turned out to be a British plumber named Cyril Hoskin) to Sai Baba of Shirdi, whose followers still report physical encounters over a century after his burial. From Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, whose disciples claimed vivid, sensory post-death visitations, to Satya Sai Baba with his potentially 100 million followers. We'll even examine Haile Selassie, Ethiopia's emperor whom Rastafarians worship as the literal second coming of Christ, and whose followers insist he never actually died.\n\nThese movements weren't Jesus copycats. Their followers genuinely believed their masters had transcended death, reported dreams, visions, and even physical re-appearances, and built global movements around these resurrection narratives. So what does this tell us about human psychology, grief, and the stories we tell about our departed spiritual leaders? Let's find out.\n\nThis is part one of a two-part series. In the next video, we'll examine the bizarre case of Francis Schlatter, the vanishing Messiah, and what his story reveals about an extraordinary aspect of human psychology that no one is talking about.\n\n--\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

But before America rushes to sanctify him, we need to remember who Charlie Kirk really was, what he stood for, and the enormous harm he caused.\n\nThis video is not a celebration of violence. It’s a hard look at the hypocrisy of mourning one man while ignoring the countless victims of school shootings, gun violence, and systemic injustice that he downplayed, mocked, or enabled. From pushing racist conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine propaganda to attacking LGBTQ+ rights, women’s rights, immigrants, and democracy itself, Kirk built his career on spreading division and misinformation.\n\nMeanwhile, the same leaders who ignored hundreds of school shootings now lower the flag for Kirk, elevating him to the level of a hero.\n\nThis is a deep dive into why Charlie Kirk’s legacy is not one of freedom or courage, but of damage, fear, and lost potential, and why his death, tragic as it may be, should not be whitewashed into a myth of martyrdom.\n\n--\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

Despite campaigning on transparency and pointing fingers at Democrats, Trump immediately packed the DOJ with loyalists who refused to release the Epstein files. When his own supporters demanded answers, Trump lashed out, calling them \"stupid\" and declaring the entire Epstein investigation a \"Democrat hoax.\" But as victims come forward and files leak out, the truth is proving harder and harder to bury.\n\n--\nSources Cited:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yt9q2toW9GHiq-R6Wakv6Jef9rTHB-YbNISnW1cLAX0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHelp Me Scale Up Production (fundraiser):\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/scaling-up-the-fight-against-misinformation\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

    "description": "Why do so many people fall for pseudoscientific scams despite having access to more information than ever before? What's the real difference between legitimate science and the snake oil salesmen flooding social media with dangerous misinformation? And if science is supposed to be our best tool for separating fact from fiction, why does it seem so confusing and contradictory?\n\nThe scientific method most of us learned in school—observation, hypothesis, experiment, conclusion—isn't wrong, but it's woefully incomplete. The truth is, science has been evolving for centuries, building layer after layer of safeguards against our pattern-seeking, confirmation-bias-riddled brains. From Roger Bacon's empirical observations in 1265 to the Royal Society's first scientific journal in 1665, from James Lind's controlled scurvy experiments in 1753 to the discovery of the placebo effect in 1937 and double-blind trials in the 1950s... each advancement was designed to outsmart human fallibility and force objectivity where we naturally fail.\nToday we'll explore exactly why understanding real science isn't just academic—it's self-defense against a world drowning in misinformation. \n\n--\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

    "description": "Why do prophecies from completely contradictory religions all seem to come true? How can biblical prophets, Nostradamus, and modern televangelists all claim divine accuracy when their predictions should logically cancel each other out? What if every \"miraculous\" prophecy in history succeeded through the same psychological tricks rather than supernatural insight?\n\nFrom the Book of Daniel's postdiction scam to Julie Green's shotgun approach on Rumble, false prophets have weaponized nine devastatingly effective techniques to fool billions into believing their guesswork is divine revelation. Today we'll expose exactly how evangelical prophets like those predicting Trump's 2020 victory, Jehovah's Witnesses with their catastrophically failed end-times predictions, and even Jesus himself in Matthew 16:28 have used vagueness, historical revisionism, and social pressure to maintain their prophetic reputations despite spectacular failures. \n\nWe'll examine why Nostradamus's cryptic quatrains have been retrofitted to \"predict\" everything from Hitler to 9/11, how the Gospel of Matthew invented Herod's massacre to fulfill Jeremiah's prophecy, and why scholars universally agree that Daniel was written centuries after the events it supposedly predicted. Whether it's the Psychic Twins playing statistical odds with earthquake predictions or religious communities quietly sweeping failed doomsday prophecies under the rug, we'll break down the psychology behind why believers forget prophetic failures and remember only the hits.\n\n--\nExposing Biblical Pseudo-history (ft.

    "description": "Is Noah’s Ark actually possible? Does science disprove the flood? And does the global flood myth destroy the credibility of the Bible? Let’s dive deep into the countless scientific problems faced by Noah’s Ark and see why it renders this Bible story completely impossible.\n\nReligious institutions often shy away from the many problems plaguing the Noah’s Ark narrative, or they mislead their audience with incorrect or scientifically bankrupt statements in attempt to defend it. Numerous modern attempts to recreate the Ark have been undertaken (from Johan’s Ark in the Netherlands, built by Dutch creationist Johan Huibers, to the Ark Encounter in Kentucky, assembled by Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis). At the cost of millions of dollars, these attempts required modern supply chains, high tech power tools, cranes, and massive labor forces and yet still fail to create even remotely seaworthy vessels. And they ignore countless other areas which demonstrate the unlikeliness of this story.\n\nToday we’ll be exploring exactly WHY Noah’s Ark would be impossible. From fragile marine ecosystems to the insane logistics of properly caring for so many animals with such diverse needs, let’s breaks down the mathematical, biological, and physical reasons why Noah's Ark couldn't have happened as described in Genesis.\n\nThis is Part 2 of our Noah's Ark series. In the first episode, we showed how we can know definitively that a global flood never happened.

Journey back to the 1980s when Ronald Reagan was president and America collectively lost its mind during the Satanic Panic, leading to innocent people being imprisoned for impossible crimes like flying on broomsticks and sacrificing babies in non-existent underground tunnels.\n\nFrom the shocking McMartin Preschool trial that became the longest and most expensive criminal case in American history, to Tipper Gore's crusade against \"Satanic\" music, this video explores how \"recovered memory therapy\" and flawed interviewing techniques created false testimonies that ruined countless lives. Featuring key figures like Michelle Smith, Lawrence Pazder, and Raymond Buckey, we trace the devastating human cost of this hysteria and draw uncomfortable parallels to modern conspiracy theories like QAnon and Pizzagate, reminding us what happens when moral panic replaces critical thinking.\n\n--\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nSources Cited:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1dmZbJJ7hKIHakLEKosT-jeQkLCkHjcFZGjL5MUPB8-4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

    "description": "What if someone you knew suddenly claimed hysterically that their genitals had just been stolen by demonic forces? Or their hand suddenly developed a mind of its own, trying to strangle them in their sleep? Throughout history, these bizarre symptoms were attributed to demonic possession or supernatural forces, leading to exorcisms, violence, and even death.\nIn this video, I explore the fascinating and disturbing reality of medical conditions mistaken for demonic possession. From fears that someones penis was supernaturally stolen in Nigeria which led to the tragic lynching of 8 innocent missionaries, to Lead Poisoning in mining communities causing hallucinations and convulsions, to Alien Hand Syndrome where limbs seem to have their own sinister agenda, and Hyperthyroidism creating dramatic personality changes that convinced communities of demonic influence.\nLearn how superstition, lack of medical knowledge, and belief in the supernatural have led to horrific consequences throughout human history - and continue to do so today. These aren't paranormal phenomena but completely natural, scientifically explainable conditions that deserve proper medical treatment, not exorcisms.\nJoin me as I debunk demon possession myths while exploring the fascinating intersection of medicine, psychology, culture, and belief. Don't miss this eye-opening look at how science helps us understand what our ancestors mistook for evil forces.\n\nNote: The penis theft story and alien hand syndrome case study are base on actual events. The lead poisoning story is based losely on a description of what people were noticing happening in US lead mines at the time (and backed by the medical literature), but the specific person is hypothetical. The character in the hyperthyroid case is fictional, but is based in a real historical settings and on a real medical condition which has been misunderstood for centuries. \n\n--\nCheck out the entire Demon Possession Debunked series here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3KsycS3DRQ&list=PLCTNr4WPOQ94pFhu3JGkmmsZglojUkT1S&index=1\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:09 - Demonic Penis Theft (Koro Syndrome)\n3:22 - Lead Poisoning\n5:32 - Alien Hand Syndrome\n7:43 - Hyperthyroidism\n9:29 - Summary/Outro\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

    "description": "Is demon possession real, or are there scientific explanations for what looks like supernatural encounters? Have we mistaken neurological disorders and medical conditions for signs of demonic activity throughout history? From medieval exorcisms to modern-day spiritual warfare, countless people have attributed hallucinations, seizures, and erratic behavior to the influence of dark forces. But as science advances, we now understand that conditions like Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis, Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, Sydenham’s Chorea (St. Vitus Dance), Ergotism (\"St. Anthony's Fire\"), and Cotard’s Delusion have been misinterpreted as possessions for centuries. What was once seen as the work of demons or witches has been uncovered as neurological misfires, autoimmune disorders, and even fungal poisoning—all treatable with medicine, not exorcisms.\n\nFrom the Salem Witch Trials to Joan of Arc’s divine visions, history is littered with tragic cases of misdiagnosed supernatural events. Ergot-contaminated bread caused mass hysteria. Autoimmune diseases sent people into terrifying psychotic episodes. Seizures brought visions of heaven and hell. And yet, many still believe in possession today. This video dives into the real causes behind so-called demon possessions, exposing the medical mysteries that masqueraded as supernatural battles. If you’ve ever wondered whether science has debunked exorcisms, or if demons are just a relic of human misunderstanding, then you won’t want to miss this.\n\n--\nCheck out the entire Demon Possession Debunked series here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3KsycS3DRQ&list=PLCTNr4WPOQ94pFhu3JGkmmsZglojUkT1S&index=1\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nOr join my channel here on YouTube to get access to special members-only perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ/join\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:09 - Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis\n2:21 - Ergotism (\"St. Anthony's Fire\")\n4:24 - Temporal Lobe Epilepsy\n7:03 - Sydenham’s Chorea (St. Vitus Dance)\n09:57 - Cotard’s Delusion\n11:19 - Summary/Outro\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

In this thought experiment, we explore how unlimited knowledge and enhanced cognition could reshape society, especially around religious belief. As science fills the \"god gaps\" that historically supported religious faith, will humanity split into two groups - those who embrace expanded consciousness and those who reject it to preserve their beliefs?

    "description": "Jack Coe the faith healer who kickstarted a nation-wide faith healing tent revival before landing himself in jail for practicing medicine without a license would con hundreds of thousands of Americans out of millions of dollars. He built a small empire, packed out arenas, and traveled the US in the world's largest tent - claiming he possessed the gift of healing and spoke words of prophecy during the uncertain times of the Cold War. Joining the ranks of Oral Roberts, A. A. Allen, and William Branham, Jack Coe helped create the blueprint that laid the grounds for the modern faith healing con used by many health and wealth prosperity doctrine preachers today.\n\nAfter working closely with Gordon Lindsay, editing the Voices of Healing Magazine, Reverend Jack Coe launched his own magazine, the Herald of Healing which reached over 300,000 members. Although he was exposed as a faith healing charlatan by Adon Taft of the Miami Herald, Pastor Jack Coe amassed a fortune while offering nothing but false hope and deception before the pastor died of polio at just 38 years old.\n\n--\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting my work:\nMake a per-video pledge: https://patreon.com/holykoolaid\nMake a monthly pledge: https://subscribestar.com/holykoolaid\nMake a one-time donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\n--\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://holykoolaid.creator-spring.com\n\n+ Connect with me: https://linktr.ee/holykoolaid\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nSources cited:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1uq3KW7yH3YqtozFVQ0427opTUwz14J89gAw0dJQgOGc/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNewspaper Clippings:\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/clippings/?user=12993269%3Athomaswestbrook&tag=jack%20coe\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

    "description": "Certain conditions faith healers avoid like the plague. Here are a list of things faith healers will never attempt to heal because they always fail spectacularly. While pastors and prophets like Benny Hinn, Alph Lukau, and Kenneth Copeland will often make grand claims about their healing powers and tell elaborate tales of the miracles they've seen and performed, most of their stunts all have one thing in common.

At the 2022 Better Conference (BetterCon), Thomas Westbrook gave this talk calling out abusive behavior in the atheist community, but the points in this talk are fairly universal to all communities.

    "description": "The problem of instruction is Christianity's biggest problem. Is the Bible perfect, literal, and inerrant? Or are there mistakes in the Bible? How was the Bible written and who wrote the Old Testament and New Testament? Why is it so hard to understand and correctly interpret? If an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipresent God crafted such an important message for his children, we should expect it to be omni-coherent. Instead, we have altered copies of manuscripts - a convoluted anonymous mess riddled with scientific blunders, historical inaccuracies and anachronisms, internal contradictions, and failed prophecies.

Even as hundreds of nuns, priests, and members became sick, they continued to hold packed services with no social distancing and discouraged people from wearing masks. Father Andrew Lemeshonok told the nuns to lie about the spread of the infection and told his congregation that churches were places of healing and that you can't get sick from holy communion even when you share a spoon with sick people and kiss the same icons. To keep the scandal under wraps, the leadership of the monastery resorted to cult-like tactics, discouraging nuns from even reaching out to friends and family.\n\nSupport my work:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\nPaypal: https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/holykoolaid\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://holykoolaid.creator-spring.com\n\nPrimary Sources:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/russian/news-52421423\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries\nhttps://news.tut.by/society/683501.html\nhttps://whowhatwhy.org/2020/05/16/russian-roulette-orthodox-church-gambles-with-worshippers-health/\nhttps://www.euronews.com/2020/04/21/belarus-and-coronavirus-lukashenko-s-business-as-usual-approach-is-mind-blowing-negligence\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxAi83heF4U\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ahmedova.marina/posts/3141781212524899\nhttps://obitel-minsk.ru/chitat/den-za-dnyom/2020/slovo-na-temu-koronavirusa\nhttps://obitel-minsk.ru/chitat/den-za-dnyom/2020/pravilno-li-segodnya-idti-v-xram\nhttps://orthochristian.com/131226.html\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/covid-19-serbia-some-lockdown-measures/30567463.html\nhttps://www.intellinews.com/belarus-emerges-as-eastern-europe-s-coronavirus-hotspot-184319/\nhttps://www.kp.by/daily/27122.5/4210916/\nhttps://www.corona24.news/c/2020/04/30/coronavirus-in-belarus-holy-elisabeth-monastery-is-closed-for-visits.html\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/world/belarus-strongman-attends-church-for-easter-slams-coronavirus-curbs-across-countries-2584071.html\nhttps://www.kp.by/daily/27126/4208304/\nhttps://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1159854/like-after-chernobyl-people-in-belarus-kept-in-the-dark-opinion\nhttps://belarusfeed.com/covid-19-belarus-infected-recovered-deaths/\nhttps://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1188422/coronavirus-update-lithuania-reports-5-new-cases-one-more-death",

    "description": "At the first annual International Atheist Day, Thomas Westbrook of Holy Koolaid gave a talk about religion and the harm it's causing. The theme of the talk was, \"You are Being Screwed,\" and in it, he discussed how scientific progress has occurred in the teeth of religious opposition, and religion is still a great cause for harm in the world. International Atheist Day is an Atheist Republic event, organized to bring atheists all over the world together, to come out of the atheist closet, stand up for the rights of the non-religious, and destigmatize atheism.\n\nThe event in Austin was organized by the Atheist Community of Austin, in conjunction with Atheist Republic and the Center for Inquiry.\n\n#AtheistDay #AtheistDay2019 #InternationalAtheistDay\n--\n\nIf you like my videos, please become a Patron & Support my work: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n\nMake a one-time donation to Holy Koolaid: https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=W29AS5WEHJQYW\n\nJoin my newsletter: http://www.holykoolaid.com/newsletter/\n\n--\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n\n\n+ Connect with me: https://linktr.ee/holykoolaid\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nThank you so much for your ongoing support.

    "description": "The best collection of psychic fails. Watch Theresa Caputo, John Edward, Sylvia Browne, Derek Acorah, Sally Morgan, and many others fail miserably in this epic compilation of psychic blunders, mistakes, failed predictions, and lies. Watch these mediums epic fail when they appear on other peoples' shows where they can't control the edits. Several psychics fail to prove their paranormal claims while attempting to win the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) Million Dollar Challenge. These self-proclaimed psychics fail big: Theresa Caputo exposed on Anderson Cooper, John Edward fails at cold reading, Sylvia Browne mistakenly says a living person is dead. James Van Praagh makes a fool of himself in front of a live audience. Sally Morgan pretends to hear the voice of a dead grandmother, without realizing she's channeling based on the picture of a grandfather. Confirmation bias, shotgunning tactics, Barnum statements, hot reading, and cold reading, can fool many people, but only when you're not looking for the psychic misses during a psychic reading. When you don't focus on the hits and ignore the misses, it's obvious how fraudulent these supernatural claims are.\n\nWatch my full Exposing Psychics playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GITxVhvDlig&list=PLCTNr4WPOQ97HRxlAVg5HCPC5IixISI-M&index=1\n\nMy equipment wishlist (help me upgrade my studio): https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3MRV42D9L8ALA\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n\nCONNECT WITH ME\n+ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n+ Twitter: @holykoolaid\n+ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nMUSIC\n+ Memories\n+ http://www.bensound.com\n+ Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n\nStay skeptical.

But this is bullshit, and it's bigotry of low expectations. It's time to fight for equality for women. Enough is enough, and it's time we speak out and fight for the rights of those who have no voice.\n\n--\n\nMy equipment wishlist (help me upgrade my studio): https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3MRV42D9L8ALA\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n+ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n+ Twitter: @holykoolaid\n+ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid\n+ Instagram: @doubtandabout\n+ Snapchat: doubtandabout\n\nS U B S C R I B E\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nM U S I C\n+ Ofelia's Dream\n+ http://www.bensound.com\n+ Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n\nDON'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

Here are 5 mistakes people make when coming out atheist. As you leave the faith, hopefully avoiding these mistakes will make your journey out of the atheist closet easier.

Modern brain science has yielded interesting new studies (such as the Aware Study by Dr. Sam Parnia, Olaf Blanke's work with electrodes stimulating the brain, and Dr. Michael Persinger's god helmet) that all seem to indicate that near-death experiences are entirely a construct of the brain. It's extremely unlikely that there's life after death as Dr. Jeffrey Long believes or \"life after life\" as Raymond Moody puts it, which means we don't need to be afraid of hell, and we should seize the day and make the most of this life.\n\n--\n\nDifferent ways to donate to help Holy Koolaid grow: https://holykoolaid.com/donate\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n+ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n+ Twitter : @holykoolaid\n+ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid\n+ Instagram : @doubtandabout\n+ Snapchat: doubtandabout\n\nS U B S C R I B E\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nM U S I C\n+ Dance of Death\n+ http://www.purple-planet.com\n+ Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n\nDON'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

    "description": "Overcoming fear is difficult, but, you don't have to be afraid. You can overcome your fear of the supernatural, demonic powers, spiritual forces, curses, witchcraft, and the dead. There are too many frightening things in this world to lose sleep over irrational fears of the paranormal. Fear leads us to do irrational things and to not always act in our best interest. But the supernatural can be explained, whether you're experiencing a hypnagogic hallucination or hypnopompic hallucinations during sleep paralysis or are under the influence of psychedelic drugs; whether you've had near-death experiences, or are encountering fear-inducing infrasounds or seeing things because of sleep deprivation. Motor neurons make us experience other people's fears, causing mass-hysteria. Pareidolia makes us think we see faces and figures where there are none. Science can help explain to us what's really going on in the brain when we encounter what we think is supernatural, and it can free us of our fears by making the unknown known.\n\n--\n\nWatch my full Overcoming Paranormal Fears playlist here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qgtiAVcB4A&list=PLCTNr4WPOQ94_xvr64RTHSWa1PpYyw7_s\n\nMy equipment wishlist (help me upgrade my studio): https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3MRV42D9L8ALA\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n+ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n+ Twitter : @holykoolaid\n+ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid\n+ Instagram : @doubtandabout\n+ Snapchat: doubtandabout\n\nS U B S C R I B E\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nM U S I C\n+ Dance of Death\n+ http://www.purple-planet.com\n+ Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n\nDON'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

    "title": "Can prophecy predict the END times?",
    "description": "Do prophecies prove god? Is there anyone who can see the future or predict the end times? Does fortunetelling work? Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that anyone has pre-cognition. It doesn’t matter if you’re using tarot cards or crystal balls, no one can predict the end of the world using their gut feelings. Prophecy is not real but is extremely malleable. To demonstrate this, I use Nostradamus to “predict” after the fact that Kim Kardashian’s butt will go viral on the internet. So the next time you flip the channel to a televangelist prophet of doom or meet a guy in a sandwich board yelling that the end is near, you can chuckle and know that the end times aren’t at hand, and the apocalypse isn’t worth losing sleep over. Life is short, so enjoy it and stop living in fear.\n\n--\nWatch more videos like this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbzFFaGTX-Y&list=PLCTNr4WPOQ96GwKAeRreFouvN7-8XI5aL\n\nDifferent ways to donate to help Holy Koolaid grow: https://holykoolaid.com/donate\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n+ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n+ Twitter: @holykoolaid\n+ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid\n+Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/holykoolaid\n+ Instagram: @doubtandabout\n+ Snapchat: doubtandabout\n\nS U B S C R I B E\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nM U S I C\n+ A Moment's Reflection\n+ Emerald Therapy\n+ Epic TV Theme\n+ http://www.audionautix.com\n+ Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n\nDON'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

    "description": "WEIRD SCIENCE by Victor Harris Jr. is a secular, inspirational poem about the cosmos. Victor Harris Jr. is a skeptic, humanist, atheist, and poet with a passion for science. His love of science comes alive through inspirational poetry and uplifting science-based verses quoting the likes of Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan while reflecting on our place in the Cosmos.\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n\nTranscript:\nI am an amazing amalgamation of milliseconds;\nA compilation of coincidences;\nA collection of infinitely small spans of time that separates me from the possibility of my bloodline.\nI have managed to outswim 500 million of my brothers and sisters to be here today – continuing a chain of happenstance that began moments after the big bang brought the universe into being.\nMatter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, so the same molecules that make up me in this instance have been in existence for over 13 billion years!\nWe are heavenly, but there is no godly hand evident in the creation of man.\nI can instead trace evidence of my being into the cosmos.\nThe same elements that make me unique have been sourced to create the universe.\nI mean, forget Jesus; stars died.\nGalaxies gave their lives to form my fingertips.\nHow could I not find wonder in waking up, be more amazed at each day that I am granted more time on this little blue marble, floating through the vast emptiness of space?\nI am in awe of life.\nTo quote Carl Sagan:\n“I find it elevating and exhilarating to discover, that we live in a universe which permits the evolution of molecular machines as intricate and subtle as we.”\nI am left breathless by the understanding that my continuance is an example of the improbable vs. the impossible, and despite what some might think, this makes my life more precious – makes each day more valuable – lends weight and reality to the precious actuality of each person that I allow into my life because I see that they are an amazing amalgamation of milliseconds, a compilation of coincidences, a collection of infinitely small spans of time that separates them from the possibility of their bloodline. So I offer assistance where I’m able, compassion when I can, and a hug when life’s weight proves too great for them to stand because these memories will be the markers of my legacy – allowing me to exist for eternity – or at least, a few years past my mental exit from this planet, a few years past my physical exit from this planet, a few years past that moment in time when my atoms are reconnected with the cosmos.\nI live my life relaxed and happy because I know that I could be gone tomorrow.

    "description": "Did the story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually happen? When you read the Bible literally and don't gloss over the weird bits, you start to see just how messed up the stories actually are. In this episode of Animated Bible Myths we explore the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, how God (Dinkleberry) destroys two towns for being gay, rescues a lazy drunkard, Lot, and his incestuous daughters, and turns the Lot’s wife into a block of salt. This is a satirical cartoon of the Biblical myth of Sodom and Gomorrah.

    "description": "Matt Slick debated David Smalley this last week. At the debate, I decided to ask Pastor Matt Slick the same question that led Matt Slick’s own daughter to become an atheist. Here is his response, and my reaction to it.\n\nThe question I asked Pastor Matt Slick:\n\"If God was absolutely moral, because morality was absolute, and if the nature of “right” and “wrong” surpassed space, time, and existence, and if it was as much a fundamental property of reality as math, then why were some things a sin in the Old Testament but not a sin in the New Testament?\"\n\n--\n\n43Alley - Realizing Hell Does Not Exist: https://youtu.be/Wgj65-EfmoA\n^ Unfortunately, this video has been taken down, so I've made my own video on realizing hell doesn't exist that might help you overcome your fear of hell: https://youtu.be/A0PNvs0LkCw\n\nPastor Matt Slick is the founder of CARM (Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry). A site which tries to answer questions people have about Christianity. As a former Christian, I was not impressed.\nwww.carm.org\n\nDavid Smalley is the host of the Dogma Debate Podcast:\nhttp://dogmadebate.com/\n\nDifferent ways to donate to help Holy Koolaid grow: https://holykoolaid.com/donate\n\nMy equipment wishlist (help me upgrade my studio): https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3MRV42D9L8ALA\n\nGet Holy Koolaid Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/holykoolaid\n\nCONNECT with Me:\n+ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\n+ Twitter : @holykoolaid\n+ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid\n+ Instagram : @doubtandabout\n+ Snapchat: doubtandabout\n\nS U B S C R I B E\n+ Please Subscribe to my channel: https://goo.gl/ie3EZh\n\nAnimation Tool\nVYond: http://bit.ly/2nl9MOj (Affiliate Link)\n\nStay skeptical.
