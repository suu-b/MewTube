    "description": "In this video we take a look at an argument that William Lane Craig (@drcraigvideos & @ReasonableFaithOrg ) attempting to defend God against the problem of evil by asserting that one cannot criticize God's reasons for allowing evil because we cannot know those reasons.

    "description": "@MattWalsh claims to debunk every abortion argument.  Here we examine the last 5 arguments he addresses and determine whether or not his counter-arguments are good ones (Ill give you a hint, at least one of them is good).\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:26 \"Women Have Reproductive Rights\"\n1:02 Conception & Reproduction: Semantic Straw Man\n1:48 Weird Use of the Term \"Reproduction\"\n3:22 'What about Rape and Incest\"\n4:49 A Big Mistake: Human Entity, Human Being, Person are Not Equivalent.\n6:32 \"Women Cannot Be Forced to Remain Pregnant, They Have Bodily Autonomy\"\n7:37 Matt Begs the Question: \"Parent\" and \"Child\"\n8:12 Begging the question again, \"Murder\" Edition\n9:01 \"Fetuses Aren't Conscious, Therefore We Can Kill Them\"\n9:47 We Know Some Stuff About Consciousness\n10:47 Some Stuff We Can Agree On About Consciousness\n12:38 Murder Question Begging Again\n12:46 Temporary Unconsciousness and the Limiting Principle\n14:48 \"Pro-Lifers are Just a Bunch of Men Trying to Boss Women Around\"\n15:30 Why Matt Gets One Right!!!\n16:19 Conclusion\n16:30 Reminder: I Am Analyzing Matts Arguments, I Did Not Make Any Claims Regarding the Rightness or Wrongness of Abortion\n16:53 The Idiot Proof List\n \n\nIDIOT PROOF LIST\n1. In general, When people make the argument, “abortion laws violate women’s reproductive rights they are including pregnancy as part of the reproductive process.\n2. When people are talking about sexual reproduction, they usually consider pregnancy to be part of reproduction. ***Find any sort of scientific or scientific or popular SECULAR discussion of reproduction that clearly considers reproduction to be finished at the moment of conception and win a prize!!!***\n3. If there are any published, philosophical accounts that define a person as a human being (this means the two terms ‘person’ and ‘human’ are meaningful equivalent ie. synonyms ie. all and only humans are persons ie. human and person are bi-conditional) they are exceptionally rare (if they exist at all).  ***Find one and win a prize!!!*** \n4. There are more than 20 definitions of ‘person’ in the Oxford English Dictionary…Many of which do not include the term ‘human’ or ‘homo sapiens’.\n5. Question begging arguments assume the truth of the conclusion to an argument or sub-argument.\n6. We know some things about consciousness.\n7. People have identified different kinds of consciousness (Reflective vs Phenomenal vs Access etc.) not just differing degrees of consciousness.\n8. ‘Awareness’ is a pretty darned conventional definition of consciousness (specifically phenomenal consciousness).\n9. Nagel’s account of consciousness, “there is something that it is like’, is generally considered by philosophers of mind  to be an adequate, introductory explanation of phenomenal consciousness.\n10. There is no scientific or evidence based reason to believe there is something that it is like to be a zygote.\n\n#abortionrights #philosophy #logic #abortion #mattwalsh #ethics #prochoice",

Here is my response to some of those comments.\nAt  the end I give an argument regarding moral obligation that I would love for people to try to prove wrong. It is an argument that I believe to be valid and sound...and since it is valid and sound, I believe the conclusion to be true.

(I haven't).\n2:15 Matt didn't do anything wrong saying 'Stupid'. (It wasn't helpful).\n3:02 The literal definition of 'person' IS 'Human Being' (No, its not).\n4:17 You arguments don't prove abortion is right!

There was a bunch of discussion in the comments section of the last video and with your help, I think I was able to do a little better job of thoroughly explaining the best analysis of the argument that I've got.\n\nIn this video you will get a more thorough explanation of what I think is going on with the argument from this short by Matt Walsh .  In the short, Matt argues that 'leftist' arguments for 'abortion rights' are hollow because very few leftists have addressed the following sorts of questions:  If rights are merely social constructs, then isn't the case that whatever the government decides are the rights of the people are the rights of the people?  What else could one appeal to if they aren't going to appeal to God?  If the law says women don't have a right to an abortion then isn't it the case that women don't have abortion rights?\n\nI love comments.  If you have anything you want to add to the discussion or you just want to point out mistakes I may have made...Hit that comment section,  there is a pretty darned good chance I'll respond... likely with more words than you would ever want to read.,\n\n#prolife  #prochoice #abortionrights #abortionlaw  #philosophy #logic",

    "description": "In this video we will take a look at a simplified version of an argument that  J.L.  Mackie gave in Evil and Omnipotence.  In that paper he attempts to prove that God does not exist on the grounds that God would not allow the evil we find in the world.  I won't promise a definitive conclusion as to whether or not he succeeds in proving God doesn't exist, but I will show that a version of Mackie's argument  proves that a handful of popular 'Free Will Defenses'  fail...and we will see Dr. Craig 'Owning' himself ;).\n\n0:00 Introduction and Some Dr. Craig Clips\n3:21 Some Requests\n6:22 Mackie's Logical Problem of Evil\n7:24 All Assumptions and Definitions\n11:22 Adequate Solutions to The Problem of Evil\n12:19 Fallacious Solutions\n12:32 Good Cannot Exist Without Evil\n15:00 Evil Is Necessary For Good\n15:32 Intro to The World Is Better With Some Evil (Including a Daily Dose of Wisdom Argument)\n20:26 Laying out the Free Will Defense (Including a Daily Dose of Wisdom Argument and an Argument From Dr WIliam Lane Craig)\n24:29 Thanks and Intermission\n25:21 You Help Create a Coherent Conception of Free Will (Free Will With Limited Choices)\n29:09 Proof That Youtube Versions of The Free Will Defense Fail\n30:45 Dr. Craig's Free Will Defense\n32:55 Dr Craig 'Owns' Himself By Unwittingly Arguing That Belief in God is Improbable and Irrational\n35:16 William Lane Craig Proves 'God Does Not Exist' is Justified.\n\nA Couple of Links to Mackie's Paper: \nhttps://archive.org/details/evil-and-omnipotence/mode/2up\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/2251467\n(If neither of those work for you I am certain you can find a copy online with a little looking :).\n\nIf you want more on The Problem of Evil or any other topic in Philosophy, The Stanford Encyclopedia is ALWAYS an awesome place to start: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/\n\nThank you to https://www.youtube.com/@UC0A9YrHgD5hZ2JXQrxRPHsw, https://www.youtube.com/@UCWyWFV9K5Ei0jiTttfnDpXQ and  https://www.youtube.com/@UC-0CLfju1-EMJCybkTkLXTA .

    "description": "Lots and lots of people feel comfortable dismissing arguments because they believe the person making the argument is 'biased'.  I explain why dismissing an idea because you believe the person expressing it is 'biased' is an ad hominem circumstantial fallacy...and you should try not to do it ...Instead, when you suspect someone of bias, be a little suspicious of their credibility and make sure to thoroughly thoroughly examine their claims.  If someone accuses you of bias?  They have given up on the argument.  Ask them to prove it.\nOh, and I do not have Imparnumeraphobia, but it works for the example. :)",
