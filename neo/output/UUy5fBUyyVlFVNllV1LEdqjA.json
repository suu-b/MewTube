    "description": "Actor, writer and director, James Morosini (It’s What’s Inside, The Sex Lives of College Girls) keeps it refreshingly honest this week— touching on the time he got catfished by his own father, and then wrote, starred in and directed a movie about it; the time he drove 6 hours for his first kiss only to learn he wasn’t on his crush’s hot list; and why becoming his town’s drug dealer to make friends backfired on him. We dive deep into his new movie, It’s What’s Inside, and his indie darling, I Love My Dad.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more from Podcrushed?

    "description": "Today we have not one, but two guests -- Bob Odenkirk, the award-winning actor, writer, and comedic trailblazer whose career has spanned decades, and his daughter Erin Odenkirk, an accomplished multimedia artist and illustrator. Together they co-authored a book of children’s poems and illustrations called ‘Zilot & Other Important Rhymes”, which manages to entertain while also encouraging children to write their own poems. Bob tells us why he still sometimes feels like a fourteen-year-old, Erin tells stories of growing up in the uber-creative Odenkirk household, and the hosts finally discover what exactly a \"zilot\" is.

She and Penn reunite for the first time since filming the season finale of Gossip Girl in 2012. Taylor shares what it was like being the youngest actor on set, her impressions of working with Penn, and why it was important for her to give her all to pursuing a career in music. Taylor lets us in on her creative muses, how she's drawn inspiration from the darkest moments of her life, and how she's learned to pick herself up after facing heartbreaking losses.
