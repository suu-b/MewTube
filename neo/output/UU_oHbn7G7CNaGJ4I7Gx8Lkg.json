    "description": "*subscribe for more*\nJoining me today is Fr Seraphim Holland to answer your Orthodox Questions. \n\nAbout Fr Seraphim in his own words.\nExcerpt from his testimony:\n\nThere is so much *beauty* in Orthodoxy that I do not see in Protestantism, and Orthodox are also quite far away from the neo-platonist tendencies of some Protestants. Some emphasize reason so much that they seem to forget that man has a body and a soul, and that God, who is totally free and beautiful, having made man in His image, has given man an inherent love for beauty. The Orthodox, worship God *naturally*, and not just with cold blooded reason, but also with their God given feelings and intuition.\n\nIn Orthodoxy, a man is not \"saved\" in an event. He is transformed, and is like a sapling that grows towards the light, and he loves God more and more, because \"He first loved us\" [14]. Because of his love for God, and his ascetical struggles (to win the kingdom of Heaven by violence), God helps to change him, and his will slowly, imperceptibly conforms to the perfect will of God. He becomes like God; he shares in the energy of God. We call this process \"theosis\", and this is salvation. It is not just intellectual assent, and it is not just ascetical endeavor, which some call \"works\". It is a synergy of the two. The first follows the other, and the other empowers a man to do the first.\n\n#orthodox #protestant #apologetics\n\n00:18 I saw your recent video that went a little viral — I guess you had a run-in with a Protestant evangelist in the streets?\n01:45 How should Orthodox Christians understand moments like this — coincidence, providence, or something else?\n05:03 What should I do when I am tempted to eat a hot dog during a fast?\n07:02 Can you please explain the Orthodox stance on relics, bones, etc.?\n08:46 I believe Orthodoxy is true, but I feel disconnected to it culturally — how can I get over this?\n13:00 Why does Joseph look depressed in the Nativity icon, and why is there a homunculus there?\n15:57 Why do people say Christmas is pagan, and what is a good rebuttal?\n20:15 During the Great Entrance on a weekday liturgy, is it proper for the faithful to kneel when the priest comes out with the gifts?\n22:52 How does someone deal with celebrating their own birthday during a fasting period?\n27:07 How would I seek monasticism outside of America?\n30:57 Should we go into a parish that will baptize us or one that will chrismate us, since we are Catholic?\n35:11 How do we deal firmly and respectfully with Christian groups or people with an ecumenist belief?\n38:36 I was born Coptic but lost my faith — should I be baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church?\n42:14 What does Canon 7 of the Second Ecumenical Council actually say about receiving converts?\n48:15 How can I soften my heart and learn to love my enemies?\n53:59 My father is a pastor in an evangelical church — how do I follow Orthodoxy without ruining his reputation?\n56:47 How should I prepare for my first serious spiritual conversation or confession with my priest?\n1:02:35 What are your recommendations for someone on a carnivore diet regarding the fast?\n1:04:01 Why does the Orthodox Church fast so much?\n1:06:33 What is your opinion on women not wearing head coverings?\n1:10:46 How would you explain verses Protestants use to support Penal Substitutionary Atonement or Calvinism?\n1:16:10 Why is theosis incompatible with Penal Substitutionary Atonement?\n1:21:09 Why do Protestants promote private interpretation of Scripture when Scripture warns against it?\n1:24:22 What is the Orthodox response to “Call no man father”?\n1:27:04 Do Muslims and Christians worship the same God?\n1:32:33 What should someone do if the nearest Orthodox church is several miles or hours away?\n1:36:25 Does sola scriptura ever actually lead people to Orthodoxy?\n1:43:11 Why do people say the Western Rite isn’t really Orthodox?\n1:49:05 What is the best way to combat spiritual attack when becoming Orthodox?\n1:51:44 How does one choose a patron saint?\n2:00:44 Is it appropriate to pray with Protestants at meals or family gatherings?\n2:03:10 Who was the father of James the Just?",

New evidence has come to light surrounding the corpus of \"Pseudo\" Dionysius that claims the corpus is actually genuine to the first century. \n\nLet's explore this new evidence and dive into this very important subject for the advancement of apologetics dialogue on icon veneration. \n\n#orthodox #protestant #apologetics \n\nSaint Dionysius the Areopagite, the disciple of Saint Paul, was a famous first-century bishop, theologian, and martyr from Athens. He is the author of some of the earliest theological treatises in the Church and an inexhaustible source of apostolic wisdom. Presented here for the first time in English is his authoritative biography written by the learned 9th-century monk Michael Syncellus, together with the story of his martyrdom in Gaul translated from an ancient Latin account. The picture that emerges is one of an inspired prophet, merciful pastor, and zealous missionary.\n\nGet the book! \nhttps://www.scriptoriumpress.ca/#saint-dionysius\n\ntimestamps \n00:00 New Scholarship/ What It Shows\n02:30 Who Was Dionysius?\n05:10 Icon Veneration\n12:00 Episcopacy\n15:10 Evidence For And Against \n21:15 Why The Old Scholarship Is Wrong",

    "description": "*Please subscribe, it helps a lot*\n\nAs requested I made a quick guide on how to pray using the 1662 book of common prayer. This is an Anglican tradition but is useful for any Christian who wants to grow in their prayer life. I personally pray the BCP 1662 and wanted to give not only a quick tutorial of how to pray using the BCP 1662 but also a very barebones guide to Gregorian chant and singing the psalms. I hope this has been helpful, God bless you. \n\n#bookofcommonprayer #prayer #tutorial",

As a testimony of how God can change someone, which may be a help for inquirers and others who are seeking the truth 2. I plan to do a series in which I go back through my old pre-conversion objections and respond to them, showing that Orthodoxy can withstand even the most intense scrutiny.) \nThanks for joining me on this journey, God bless you. \n\nIn discussions and debates with Eastern Orthodox adherents, often infallible tradition is brought up as some point. However when it is brought to light to the Eastern Orthodox in question, that the canons of the ecumenical councils have inconsistencies, there are a number of modern polemics that they will employ. But are these modern polemics consistent with the fathers who convened the councils? Or are they a recent attempt to reconcile the modern Eastern Orthodox Church with history? Let’s find out.\n\n#orthodox #catholic #protestant #apologetics",

As a testimony of how God can change someone, which may be a help for inquirers and others who are seeking the truth 2. I plan to do a series in which I go back through my old pre-conversion objections and respond to them, showing that Orthodoxy can withstand even the most intense scrutiny.) \nThanks for joining me on this journey, God bless you. \n\nIn recent times Eastern Orthodox apologists have soft sold some very important doctrines to evangelical seekers, attempting to get them into the church and change their minds over time. In this video we go over a few dogmatically binding declarations of the Eastern Orthodox Church and how modern contemporaries are soft selling their meaning to the unassuming inquirer. This is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed when dealing with those interested in the Eastern Orthodox Church. \n\n#orthodox #catholic #protestant #apologetics",

These variations caused confusion and disputes among followers loyal to their own texts. Amidst this tension, Caliph Uthman made the fateful decision to standardize the Quran, commissioning a single, official text and ordering the burning of all other copies. Critics viewed this as a shocking betrayal, an assault on the sacred diversity of the text. They believed Uthman erased precious nuances passed down from Muhammad’s companions, By burning the other versions Uthman severed an irreplaceable link to the original Quran. Rumors of lost verses and altered meanings fueled outrage, with many convinced this act distorted the faith, endangering the integrity of Muhammad’s legacy",

By the 11th century, Islamic states like the Fatimid Caliphate and the Seljuk Turks controlled large portions of the Holy Land, and their influence was increasingly felt in the Eastern Christian Byzantine Empire.",

    "description": "The question of whether Jesus of Nazareth existed as a historical figure has been the subject of considerable debate, but there is a strong consensus among historians and scholars that Jesus did indeed exist. This consensus is based on historical evidence, both from Christian and non-Christian sources, as well as the criteria used in historical analysis. Here’s an overview of the main points:\n\nScholarly Consensus on Jesus’ Existence\n\n 1. Historical Agreement: The majority of historians, both secular and religious, agree that Jesus was a real person who lived in first-century Palestine. This view is supported by various ancient sources, despite differing opinions on the theological interpretations of his life. Historians typically distinguish between the “historical Jesus” (the man who lived and was crucified) and the “Christ of faith” (the figure worshiped in Christianity).\n 2. Non-Christian Sources: Several non-Christian sources from the ancient world mention Jesus or his followers. Some of the most significant include:\n • Tacitus: The Roman historian Tacitus, writing around 116 CE, refers to “Christus” who was executed by Pontius Pilate during the reign of Emperor Tiberius.\n • Josephus: The Jewish historian Josephus mentions Jesus in his Antiquities of the Jews (c. 93-94 CE). While one passage is disputed (the Testimonium Flavianum), a more minor reference to James, the brother of Jesus, is widely accepted as authentic.\n • Pliny the Younger and Suetonius also mention early Christians, who followed a man called “Christ.”\n 3. Early Christian Sources: The New Testament, while theological in nature, is also considered a valuable historical source, particularly the Gospels and the letters of Paul. Most scholars agree that these texts contain a core of historical facts about Jesus, including his crucifixion, though the supernatural claims are not accepted as historical by non-religious historians.",

    "description": "Atheist persecution of religion refers to instances in history where atheist or anti-religious ideologies have sought to suppress or eliminate religious beliefs and practices. These persecutions often arise in political contexts where atheism or secularism is linked to state policy, particularly under regimes that view religion as a threat to their power or as an impediment to social progress.\n\n1. Soviet Union (1917-1991)\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of atheist persecution of religion occurred in the Soviet Union. Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the communist government led by Vladimir Lenin and later Joseph Stalin promoted state atheism as part of its Marxist ideology. The Russian Orthodox Church, along with other religious institutions, was viewed as a pillar of the old tsarist regime and a potential rival to the communist government. As a result, the state launched aggressive campaigns to reduce the influence of religion, including:\n\n • Confiscating church property\n • Closing religious institutions\n • Arresting, imprisoning, or executing clergy\n • Promoting atheist propaganda through education and media\n\nReligious belief was portrayed as backward and superstitious, and many churches, mosques, and synagogues were destroyed or repurposed for secular uses.\n\n2. Communist China (1949-present)\n\nUnder the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also adopted atheism as state policy after the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. The government sought to weaken the influence of all religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and traditional Chinese folk beliefs, through state control and repression. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), religious persecution intensified, with religious sites destroyed, clergy persecuted, and religious practices banned.\n\nAlthough religious freedom is nominally protected in modern China, the CCP continues to heavily regulate religious groups and crack down on “unauthorized” religious activities. Persecution remains particularly severe for groups like the Falun Gong, Tibetan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims, and underground Christian churches.\n\n3. Cambodia (1975-1979)\n\nThe Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, was one of the most brutal atheist regimes in history. When the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia in 1975, it implemented policies aimed at eradicating all forms of religion, along with other aspects of Cambodian culture. The Khmer Rouge viewed religion as counterrevolutionary, and its leaders sought to create a completely atheistic society.\n\nDuring their rule, the Khmer Rouge executed monks, destroyed Buddhist temples, and forcibly converted the population to atheism. An estimated 90% of Cambodia’s Buddhist monks were either killed or disrobed, and many Christian missionaries and religious practitioners also suffered persecution.",

    "description": "Miguel Pro, a Jesuit priest, was executed by a firing squad in Mexico on November 23, 1927, during the anti-Catholic persecutions of the Mexican Cristero War. Born in 1891, Pro was known for his joyful personality and dedication to his religious mission, especially as a priest during a time when the Catholic Church faced severe restrictions under the presidency of Plutarco Elías Calles.\n\nThe Calles Law, implemented in 1926, aimed to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church by restricting religious practices and rights. In response, many clergy members, including Pro, operated in secret to provide religious services. Pro returned to Mexico from Europe after his Jesuit training and worked covertly, disguising himself to administer the sacraments and support the faithful.\n\nIn 1927, Miguel Pro was falsely accused of involvement in an assassination attempt on Álvaro Obregón, a prominent political figure. Although there was no evidence linking Pro to the crime, the government used him as a scapegoat to suppress the growing Catholic resistance. His execution was intended as a public display to deter others from defying the regime.\n\nOn the day of his execution, Pro declined a blindfold, faced his executioners, and extended his arms in the shape of a cross, shouting “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Christ the King!”) just before the shots were fired. This phrase became a rallying cry for the Cristeros, Catholic rebels who fought against the anti-religious policies of the government.",

    "description": "Hostile or non-Christian sources provide indirect but significant evidence for the historical existence of Jesus. These sources are often critical or dismissive of early Christianity but still reference Jesus or his followers, showing that Jesus was known to non-Christians in the ancient world. Here are some key examples of hostile citations:\n\n1. Tacitus (c. 56-120 CE)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus mentions Jesus in his Annals (Book 15, Chapter 44), written around 116 CE. In his account of Nero’s persecution of Christians, he refers to “Christus,” who suffered the “extreme penalty” (crucifixion) under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus clearly dislikes Christians, calling their faith a “mischievous superstition,” but his writing confirms that Jesus was a historical figure who was executed.\n\n2. Pliny the Younger (c. 61-113 CE)\n\nPliny, a Roman governor, wrote to Emperor Trajan around 112 CE, seeking advice on how to deal with Christians. In his letter, he describes Christians as worshipping “Christus” as a god. Pliny’s letter is not friendly toward Christianity but shows that Christians were numerous and devout, and that they worshipped a historical figure, Jesus.\n\n3. Lucian of Samosata (c. 125-180 CE)\n\nLucian, a Greek satirist, mocks Christians and their beliefs in The Death of Peregrinus. He refers to Jesus as “the crucified one” and ridicules Christians for their devotion to him. Although hostile, Lucian’s writing suggests that Christians were widely known and that Jesus had a historical existence.",

After Jesus’ crucifixion and subsequent resurrection, he appeared to his disciples, but one of them, Thomas, was absent. When the others told Thomas they had seen the risen Lord, he famously expressed doubt, saying, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”\n\nEight days later, Jesus appeared again, this time with Thomas present. Jesus invited Thomas to touch his wounds, saying, “Stop doubting and believe.” Confronted with the reality of the risen Jesus, Thomas responded with a profound declaration, “My Lord and my God!” This statement is significant because it’s one of the clearest instances in the Gospels where someone directly acknowledges Jesus not only as Lord but as God.",

    "description": "Mao Zedong’s atheist agenda was deeply intertwined with his broader political ideology and the goals of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As a Marxist, Mao embraced atheism as a key component of communism, which viewed religion as an instrument of oppression, historically used to justify inequality and the exploitation of the working class. For Mao, religion was not just a relic of the past, but also a challenge to the absolute authority of the state and its socialist agenda.\n\nIn his efforts to establish a secular, atheist state, Mao’s policies aggressively targeted religious institutions and practices. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Maoist zeal led to widespread destruction of religious buildings, texts, and artifacts. Temples, churches, mosques, and monasteries were closed or repurposed, and religious leaders were often persecuted, imprisoned, or sent for “reeducation.” The aim was to eradicate religious influence from Chinese society and replace it with loyalty to the Communist Party and Maoist ideology.\n\nMao’s regime promoted scientific materialism as the official state philosophy, encouraging people to reject superstitions and religious beliefs. Educational programs were implemented to instill atheism, especially in the youth, who were seen as the future vanguard of the revolution. Religious practices were stigmatized and framed as backward or counterrevolutionary, and those who continued to practice faith were often subject to social ostracism or state punishment.",

    "description": "Denying the existence of Jesus has become an uncommon stance in modern historical scholarship, yet it occasionally resurfaces in certain debates. However, the futility of such a claim lies in the overwhelming evidence, both historical and contextual, supporting his existence. his existence as a historical figure is supported by sources that go beyond Christian texts.\n\nThe New Testament, though a religious document, contains valuable historical references, and its accounts have been analyzed through rigorous methods of historical inquiry. Moreover, several non-Christian sources from the first and second centuries, including the Roman historian Tacitus and the Jewish historian Josephus, make reference to Jesus. These independent accounts confirm that Jesus was a real person who lived in the first century, preached in the region of Galilee, and was crucified.",

There is so much historical evidence for Jesus existence, ministry, and crucifixion that it’s impossible to claim he didn’t exist without looking like someone who has never studied history. It’s my opinion that the vast majority of atheists have never actually interacted in detail with evidence for Christ or Christianity in general besides a surface level gloss over, or Sunday church attendance. Which is why so many are lead astray by Facebook posts and conspiracy theories. \n\nI’ll make more videos on these other topics in the future. But for now we will go through the early church fathers and hostile witnesses to prove Christ was a real historical figure. \n\n#faith #jesus #apologetics #churchhistory  #christian #atheist #agnostic #atheism #catholic #orthodox #protestant #religion",

    "description": "Atrocities committed in the name of atheism,\n\nOne of the most prominent examples is the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. The state actively promoted atheism and sought to eliminate religion from public life, viewing it as a form of \"false consciousness\" that hindered socialist development. In the process, religious institutions were targeted, clergy were persecuted, and churches, mosques, and synagogues were destroyed or repurposed. Millions of religious believers, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, and others, were executed, imprisoned, or sent to labor camps for their faith. The regime’s aggressive secularism led to widespread suffering and the suppression of religious freedom, with religion being equated with subversion or counter-revolutionary activity.\n\nAnother example is China during the Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong, where the Communist Party’s promotion of state atheism led to intense persecution of religious groups. Religious symbols were destroyed, and religious leaders were humiliated, imprisoned, or killed. Temples, churches, and mosques were closed, and religious practices were banned or forced underground. This period of religious repression resulted in the suffering of millions, with atheism being pushed as part of a state ideology that sought to erase cultural and religious heritage.\n\nIn Albania, under the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, atheism was explicitly enshrined in the constitution, and Albania was declared the world’s first officially atheist state. Religious institutions were closed, and practicing religion was punishable by imprisonment or death. Religious leaders were executed, and religious texts were banned, with the state actively promoting atheism as a fundamental aspect of its Marxist-Leninist ideology.",

    "description": "Without the Crusades, it is conceivable that the political, cultural, and religious landscape of Europe could have shifted in a way that favored broader Muslim influence or rule. The Crusades, which began in 1095, were a series of military campaigns primarily aimed at reclaiming the Holy Land from Muslim control, but they also functioned as a broader response to the rapid expansion of Islam. To understand how we could have ended up under Muslim rule without the Crusades, we must examine a few historical dynamics:\n\nEarly Islamic Expansion\nThe rise of Islam in the 7th century brought rapid territorial expansion. Within a few decades of Prophet Muhammad’s death in 632 AD, Muslim forces had conquered large parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain (Al-Andalus). By the early 8th century, the Umayyad Caliphate had reached as far as the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. The advance into Europe was only halted at the **Battle of Tours** in 732 AD, where Charles Martel, a Frankish leader, defeated the Muslim forces.",

Without belief in a divine lawgiver, the basis for morality may shift from being objective or universal to subjective or relative. Critics argue that atheism leads to **moral relativism**, where right and wrong become matters of personal or cultural preference rather than rooted in absolute principles.

As secularism increases, religious frameworks for ethics and morality, which have historically guided many societies, are being replaced by more individualistic or relativistic standards.\n\nOne problem of increasing secularism is **moral relativism**. In a more secular society, without a shared belief in a divine authority or religiously grounded ethical system, morality can become subjective. What is right or wrong may be seen as a matter of personal preference or social consensus, rather than rooted in an objective, higher power. This shift can lead to ethical inconsistencies, as moral standards may change based on societal trends or individual perspectives.",

They are—to make a comparison-like different languages, different dialects, to get there. But God is God for everyone. If you start to fight saying my religion is more important than yours, mine is true and yours isn't', where will this lead us? There is only one God, and each of us has a language to arrive at God.

Appeals regarding disciplinary matters were also made to the see of Constantinople,(16) and to other sees. Such appeals to major sees were always treated in a synodical way. Appeals to the bishop of Rome from the East expressed the communion of the Church, but the bishop of Rome did not exercise canonical authority over the churches of the East.\n\nCheiti Document - Orthodox, Roman Catholic Unity document",

James here expounds how Paul's words ought to be understood. This is why he uses the example of Abraham, whom Paul also used as an example of faith, to show that the patriarch also performed good works in the light of his faith. It is therefore wrong to interpret Paul in such a way as to suggest that it did not matter whether Abraham put his faith into practice or not. What Paul meant was that no one obtains the gift of justification on the basis of merit derived from works performed beforehand, because the gift of justification comes only from faith.",

    "description": "What ought we to think? That while the apostles were scandalized, the Mother of the Lord was immune to scandal? If she had not experienced scandal during the Lord’s Passion, Jesus did not die for her sins. But if “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” and if all “are justified and saved by his grace” (Rom 3:23), then Mary, too, was scandalized in that moment. This is what Simeon is prophesying about: … Your soul will be pierced by the sword of unbelief and will be wounded by the sword point of doubt. (Homily on Luke 17, 6-7; PG 13, 1845; SC 87, 236-58)\nOrigen 185 – 253",

Therefore they often appear ridiculous before the learned; and they are disturbed and scandalized when they hear that someone does not honor something read in the Bible with equal veneration as all the rest. Here, then, we distinguish and number distinctly first the canonical books and then the non-canonical, among which we further distinguish between the certain and the doubtful.\nThe canonical books have been brought about through the dictation of the Holy Spirit. It is not known, however, at which time or by which authors the non-canonical or apocryphal books were produced…Their authority, however, is not considered adequate for proving those things which come into doubt or contention, or for confirming the authority of ecclesiastical dogma, as blessed Jerome states in his prologue to Judith and to the books of Solomon. \n\nGlossa Ordinaria 13th century",

Nor be thou disturbed, like a raw scholar, if thou shouldest find anywhere, either in the sacred councils or the sacred doctors, these books reckoned as canonical. For the words as well of councils as of doctors are to be reduced to the correction of Jerome. Now, according to his judgment, in the epistle to the bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus, these books (and any other like books in the canon of the bible) are not canonical, that is, not in the nature of a rule for confirming matters of faith. Yet, they may be called canonical, that is, in the nature of a rule for the edification of the faithful, as being received and authorized in the canon of the bible for that purpose. By the help of this distinction thou mayest see thy way clearly through that which Augustine says, and what is written in the provincial council of Carthage.”\n\n- Cardinal Cajetan",
