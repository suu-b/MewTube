    "title": "Why I am not a Calvinist",
    "description": "#calvinism #philosophyofreligion #apologetics #predestination #christianity \nHey everyone, in this video I'll explain why I am not a Calvinist by going through several philosophical arguments I've developed against it.  I doubt any of these are groundbreaking but I figured I'd make this video anyways because I am concerned Calvinism can lead to misconceiving God's nature in a problematic way.  Most of this video will discuss predestination and double predestination, but I'll also touch on other aspects of TULIP, such as Total Depravity and Unconditional Election.\n\nTwo YouTubers who are good candidates to clarify/respond:\n@redeemed_zoomer \n@TruthUnites \n\nJohn MacArthur Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88WvD_Tvv_o&pp=ygUOcHJlZGVzdGluYXRpb24%3D\n\nReferences:\n[1] C.

    "description": "In this video, I'll go over issues with David Hume's argument Against Miracles in \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.\"  By \"debunking,\"\n I mean pointing out issues in its current fomulation.  As a result, it can be reformulated in a stronger way, but it needs to take into account developments in thought since then.  My issues with Hume's argument are as follows:\n1.  Hume's argument begs the question\n2.  Hume's argument is inconsistent with Hume's own skepticism\n3.  Hume's argument \"proves too much\"\n4.  Hume was ignorant of modern science (due to his place in history), which severly undermine his argument\n5.  Hume was ignorant of modern probability theory (including Bayesian statistics and Bayesian epsitemology), developed in response *to* his argument against miracles\n\nDespite these problems, I have a great respect for Hume and do think his argument is worth considering and discussing.  However, as atheist Peter Millican argues, it needs to be reformulated.

This argument is used by others such as James Fodor in his book Unreasonable Faith.  @ReasonableFaithOrg William Lane Craig's response is not only adequate, but brings out the question-begging nature of some formulations of this as an argument for an infinite collection/set.\n\n#christianity #mathematics #god",
