    "description": "On August 21, 2025, Diana Harshbarger (TN-1) was scheduled to speak at a local event called \"Breakfast with the Congresswoman\". \n\nSince her constituents have been asking for, begging for and demanding a town hall for the entirety of congressional recess, many of us purchased tickets (because no, it wasn't free) to attend. But the event was cancelled last minute without explanation. \n\nI decided to show up and have breakfast with the congresswoman anyway. And share a legislative update so the district can stay informed. \n\nIf you live in District 1, please share this video, call Diana's office and demand a Town Hall ASAP. Then register to vote and make sure she doesn't get to keep her seat in 2026.\n\nDC OFFICE (202) 225-6356\n5calls.org\n\nMy Links:\nDonate | https://jezebelvibes.com/donate\nWebsite | https://jezebelvibes.com/\nResources and affiliate links | https://jezebelvibes.com/resources\nMerch | https://jezebelvibes.com/shop\nNeed resources for religious trauma?

I am no longer available this evening but wanted to share the Congresswoman’s statement on the passage of the historic Big, beautiful Bill. Please make sure to follow our Facebook page and twitter as we share specifics on how President Trumps and the Congresswoman are delivering for East Tennessee families. Lastly I want to suggest you might consider filming at a better angle next time.\n\nGod bless!\n\n\nMY RESPONSE: When will you be available this week for me to drop off the information Diana needs to better understand what she just voted on?\n\nZAC: She knows exactly what she voted for. My email address is ---\n\nMY RESPONSE: I would like to hand them to you in person so I know they were received. \n\nZAC: That won’t be necessary, email works .\n\nMY RESPONSE: Of course. Have the night you deserve.\n\n\n--- \n\nAt the time I am uploading this, they are voting. I do not know if it will pass or fail. But this video will live on as a proof that they are actively lying about this bill. And I want to post it to show YOU that YOU have power and a voice. And you always have the option to not only call and email, but to show up in person and demand your voice be heard.",

    "description": "Responding to a comment left on my channel about tolerating faith, even when it leads to unnecessary harm:\n\n_\"You say in this video that believing something without evidence to make yourself comfortable (faith, as you defined it) is ok. I would say it's never ok. I've seen enough harm come from faith that I'm willing to say it more often than not leads to unnecessary harm. Is the faith of the astrology girly as immediately harmful as that of Steven Anderson? Of course not. But the astrology girly is legitimizing a faulty way of knowing, and once that's legitimized in her mind, anyone can use it to put anything they want in there. This is the absolute minimum harm faith can do; create an unnecessary vulnerability to further harm. Even so, I don't like how this belief of mine that faith is harmful makes me think of others. Whether right or wrong, it makes me incapable of truly tolerating people with nonsense beliefs. I say nothing of it irl, of course, but there's always a passive moral judgement and mistrust of anyone who'd allow faith to take hold of their mind. I'd really like that to not be true of me. To that end, could you maybe explain how you can be so comfortable with faith that you can call having it \"ok\" ?\"_\n\n*Please keep in mind that all everything I say here is my subjective opinion, and is intended to deconstruct fundamentalist/evangelical/conservative Christian ideologies from an ex christian perspective*\n\n5 Bible Passages that caused me to lose my faith | https://youtu.be/gDCCzzwy_Nk?si=GgmE_e2qIH97PJcC\n\nEx-christian Deconstruction Reading List | https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/146949852-kristi-burke?shelf=ex-christian-deconstruction\n\nCheck out my merch | https://www.Jezebelvibes.com/shop\n\nNeed resources for religious trauma?

Using the common analogy of a courtroom, I point out that having an innocent person suffer for the guilty isn’t true justice—it’s not getting what you deserve. I question the fairness of eternal punishment for finite actions and encourage viewers to reconsider what “perfect justice” really means when examined closely. \n\n*Please keep in mind that what I share in these videos is my subjective opinion and my goal is to deconstruct fundamentalist/evangelical/conservative Christian ideologies from an ex christian perspective for those who are questioning or deconstructing their beliefs.*\n\n*Website* | https://jezebelvibes.com/\n*Resources and affiliate links* | https://jezebelvibes.com/resources\n*Merch* | https://jezebelvibes.com/shop\n*Need resources for religious trauma?

While many find comfort in this story, I believe it’s important to question the necessity of blood atonement and the reasoning behind god's supposed need for sacrifice. Why does an all-powerful deity require such a system?

But what if the real issue is knowledge itself? In this video, I challenge the idea that rejecting god is about a hardened heart and explore how my journey away from faith wasn’t driven by rebellion, but by learning and understanding. From the story of Adam and Eve to modern church teachings, I question why the pursuit of knowledge is so often discouraged.

    "title": "\"You're Deceived By Satan\" | Ex Christian Responds",
    "description": "Christians love to say that ex-Christians have been \"deceived by satan\" and are on a path of darkness. It’s a common accusation, and it can linger in the back of your mind, making you wonder: What if they’re right? In this video, I break down why the claim that we're being deceived just doesn’t hold up. Is being tricked really a crime deserving of eternal punishment? If god is truly all-knowing and all-loving, why would he allow deception in the first place? Let’s explore the contradictions in this argument and find some peace in letting go of these fears.\n\n*Please keep in mind that what I share in these videos is my subjective opinion and my goal is to deconstruct fundamentalist/evangelical/conservative Christian ideologies from an ex christian perspective for those who are questioning or deconstructing their beliefs.*\n\n*Website* | https://jezebelvibes.com/\n*Resources and affiliate links* | https://jezebelvibes.com/resources\n*Merch* | https://jezebelvibes.com/shop\n*Need resources for religious trauma?

    "title": "Deconstructing Adam and Eve | Why Eden Was a Set Up",
    "description": "In this video, I break down the story of Adam and Eve as told through a fundamentalist, literalist lens—and why I think it's deeply flawed. Growing up, I believed this account was a historical truth, but now I see it differently. Was Eden a paradise or a setup? Why did God place the Tree of Knowledge there at all? We explore the story’s inconsistencies, question God’s role in it, and reconsider what this narrative might actually be trying to convey. \n\n*Please keep in mind that what I share in these videos is my subjective opinion and my goal is to deconstruct fundamentalist/evangelical/conservative Christian ideologies from an ex christian perspective for those who are questioning or deconstructing their beliefs.*\n\n*Website* | https://jezebelvibes.com/\n*Resources and affiliate links* | https://jezebelvibes.com/resources\n*Merch* | https://jezebelvibes.com/shop\n*Need resources for religious trauma?

    "title": "From Holy To Heretic | Why I Left Christianity",
    "description": "In my first YouTube video, I share my journey from being a devout Christian to becoming an agnostic atheist. Raised in a Southern Baptist church, I spent years deeply involved in my faith, only to face questions that shook my beliefs to the core. From exploring Calvinism to questioning the nature of God, I eventually realized that I could no longer believe. I share the emotional and intellectual struggles I faced, including feeling lost, outcast, and having to redefine my purpose after leaving Christianity. My hope is that by sharing my story, I can offer encouragement to those who are questioning and seeking their own path. We’re in this together—you’re not alone.\n\n*Please keep in mind that what I share in these videos is my subjective opinion and my goal is to deconstruct fundamentalist/evangelical/conservative Christian ideologies from an ex christian perspective for those who are questioning or deconstructing their beliefs.*\n\n*Website* | https://jezebelvibes.com/\n*Resources and affiliate links* | https://jezebelvibes.com/resources\n*Merch* | https://jezebelvibes.com/shop\n*Need resources for religious trauma?
