    "title": "Should Christians REALLY be Doing This as an Act of Faith?",
    "description": "Mark 16:17–18 says believers “will pick up snakes with their hands, and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them.” Some churches have taken this literally, and sadly, people have lost their lives because of it.\n\nThis passage was never meant as a command for Christians to prove their faith. It described miraculous signs that confirmed the message of the early apostles as they spread the gospel. \n\nGod calls us to trust Him, not to put ourselves in harm’s way with deadly and dangerous acts.\n\nReal faith is not about risking your life to prove to God that you believe. It's about having confidence in who Jesus is and what He has done. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

He was setting boundaries that would guard women from being treated like property and from the pain of being discarded or dishonored.\n\nIt was about preserving dignity and honoring covenant, not controlling people.\n\nBehind every law is the heart of a loving God who desires to protect what is sacred, including sexuality.\n\n#biblestudy #oldtestament #biblicaltruth #christianliving #biblehistory #faithandculture #godsword #scripturetruth #biblecontext #christianteaching #biblestudytools #biblefacts",

That includes being mindful of what we listen to, and what we let our children listen to.\n⠀\nThis isn’t about calling out Taylor Swift. She seems like a kind and talented person. But when we look at the themes and messages in popular music — hers included — we have to ask ourselves: Does this honor God? Does it help me grow in holiness? Does it align with truth?\n⠀\nMusic isn’t neutral. It has a message. And over time, that message forms a mindset.\n⠀\nLet’s be intentional. Let’s be discerning.

    "description": "If you were raised Catholic, I want to speak to you from the heart. This may be difficult to hear, especially when your beliefs are deeply tied to family, tradition, and identity. But I invite you to consider this from a place of love and truth.\n\nOne of the key differences between Catholic and Protestant teaching is the inclusion of the Apocrypha—a collection of books found in Catholic Bibles but not in the original Hebrew Scriptures or most Protestant Bibles. These books, like Tobit, Judith, and 1 & 2 Maccabees, were written between the Old and New Testaments. While they contain historical and moral insights, they were never considered inspired Scripture by the Jewish people, by Jesus, or by the apostles.\n\nIn fact, it wasn’t until the Council of Trent in 1546 (over 1,500 years after Christ) that the Roman Catholic Church officially declared the Apocrypha as part of the biblical canon. That decision came in response to the Protestant Reformation, where leaders like Martin Luther urged a return to Scripture alone (sola scriptura).\n\nWe must be careful not to treat something as God’s Word if it was never affirmed by Christ or the early church. I know that may feel like a big shift. \n\nAs always, I’m here if you ever have questions. We’re all on a journey of learning and growing in the truth. Let’s talk in the comments. \n\n#ChristianShorts #BibleTeaching #ApocryphaExplained #FalseTeachingExposed #BibleStudyTips #TheBeatWithAllenParr #BiblicalTruth #WhatTheBibleSays #ChristianContent #AllenParrShorts #BibleCanon #SolaScriptura",

    "description": "This is one of the most difficult questions Christians wrestle with — the topic of predestination.\n\nSome say…\n\nIf Jesus died on the cross to offer us free will, then how could God predestine some and not others?\n\nAnd if God is loving and doesn’t want anyone to be separated from Him, how could He predestine anyone to hell?\n\nIt seems contradictory, and I get it. This is hard to process.\n\nBut the truth is… it’s both.\n\nPredestination and free will can exist. It’s one of those divine mysteries we may never fully understand on this side of heaven.\n\nAnd that’s okay.\n\nAs Scripture says:\n“My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways... As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways.”— Isaiah 55:8-9\n\nIf you want a deeper, more thorough explanation to help you understand this complex topic, click the link in my bio to watch the full video released today.

    "description": "Does God Choose Who Goes to Heaven or Hell? | Romans 9 Explained\n\nThis might be the most difficult and controversial chapter in the entire Bible.\n\nRomans 9 raises powerful questions:\n\nIf God chooses who gets saved… does that mean He chooses who goes to hell?\n\nIs God unfair for showing mercy to some but not to others?\n\nDo we even have free will if God is sovereign?\n\nIn this video, we take a deep dive into the five illustrations Paul uses to unpack these questions — from Isaac and Ishmael to the Potter and the Clay. Whether you’ve wrestled with God’s sovereignty, election, or the fairness of salvation, this teaching will challenge and encourage you.\n\nWe don’t shy away from the hard truths — but we also leave room for mystery.\n\nGET YOUR FREE \"THE BIBLE STORY\" EBOOK HERE\nhttps://go.letsequip.com/the-bible-story-free-ebook\n\nENROLL IN MY $7 BIBLE STUDY COURSE HERE\nhttps://go.letsequip.com/bsr\n\nWANNA LEARN HOW TO STUDY THE BIBLE?\nhttps://jointba.com\n\nPURCHASE MY NEW BOOK TO GET A FREE BIBLE STUDY COURSE\nhttps://misledbook.com\n\nSHOP OUR NEW MERCH HERE!\nhttps://allens-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT!\nhttps://youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nJOIN THE #1 ONLINE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY ON THE INTERNET\nhttps://letsequip.com/community\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE \nhttp://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\nREGISTER FOR OUR FREE 60-MINUTE BIBLE STUDY TRAINING CLASS\nhttps://go.letsequip.com/tbaoptin\n\nLEARN HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CHRISTIAN YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nhttps://bit.ly/cfccourse\n\nDOWNLOAD YOUR FREE EBOOK\nhttps://bit.ly/iybsfree\n\nSUPPORT THIS MINISTRY FINANCIALLY\nhttps://allenparr.com/support\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nWebsite | https://allenparr.com\nInstagram | https://instagram.com/allengparr\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/allengparr\nFacebook | https://facebook.com/allenparrministries\n\nTO INVITE ME TO SPEAK:\nWant to have Allen come and speak at your next event?\nhttps://allenparr.com/speaking\n\n00:00 - Introduction  \n02:00 - The Problem in Romans 9  \n06:00 - Isaac vs. Ishmael  \n08:00 - Jacob vs. Esau  \n11:00 - Moses and Pharaoh  \n16:00 - The Potter and the Clay  \n19:00 - Vessels of Wrath vs. Vessels of Mercy  \n28:00 - Final Encouragements and Takeaways",

Jephthah was a rejected son turned warrior who made a reckless vow to God before battle… and what walked out of his house when he returned victorious would shatter his entire world. Did God really demand the life of his only daughter? Or did Jephthah act out of ignorance, trying to prove his worth? In this video, we unravel one of Scripture’s most disturbing and emotional stories—one filled with pain, sacrifice, and the haunting question: Was this what God wanted? As we uncover the truth, you'll also hear a deeply personal story from Allen that reveals how his own rejection and pain led to the creation of this very channel.

    "description": "Abortion is one of the most sensitive and debated topics today. Some argue it’s a personal choice, but as hard as this may be to accept, God’s Word is clear: life is sacred from the womb (Psalm 139).\n\nNo matter how culture tries to redefine sin, the truth doesn’t change. Abortion is not God’s way.\n\nIf you’ve made that choice, know this: there is forgiveness and healing through Christ. And if you’re facing an unplanned pregnancy, trust that God always makes a way, offering help, strength, and guidance.\n\nI say this with love: don’t let the world convince you that ending life is the answer. God’s path is hard sometimes, but it’s always right.\n\nIf you’re carrying any of these burdens and need prayer, my team and I are here for you.

    "description": "The Bible gives us clear signs about the Antichrist.\n\nHe will perform false miracles, speak against God, stage a counterfeit resurrection, rise to global influence, and require a mark to buy or sell as a sign of loyalty to him (2 Thess. 2:9–10; Rev. 13:16–17).\n\nThis level of deception isn’t driven by human effort. Scripture says it will be empowered directly by Satan (2 Thess. 2:9).\n\nWe don’t know the day or hour when the Antichrist will appear. But as we live in the last days, it’s essential that we understand what God’s Word actually says. Knowing Scripture protects us from being misled, whether by speculation about world leaders or by the Antichrist himself when he is revealed.\n\nStay rooted in truth. Your discernment begins with God’s Word.",

Do we rest in the grave, or enter the presence of God?\n\nPaul wrote, “To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:8). Jesus told the thief on the cross, “Today you will be with Me in paradise” (Luke 23:43).\n\nThe Bible shows that believers are immediately with the Lord, fully alive in His presence.\n\nIf you’ve ever feared the idea of death being a dark or empty place, Scripture brings clarity. For those who are in Christ, death is not silence or nothingness, it’s immediate, conscious presence with the Lord.",

    "description": "Some believers give the enemy too much credit. Others don’t acknowledge his influence at all. But the Bible reminds us that Satan is real, active, and strategic, and millions are under attack.\n\nHis most common tactics include isolation, depression, suicidal thoughts, and planting doubt in God's Word. He’s trying to destroy your identity, your purpose, and your connection to truth and God.\n\nBut here’s the good news, Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8), and greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4).\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nWhen thoughts come into your mind that are not of God, take them captive just like Paul taught:\n“We take every thought captive to make it obedient to Christ.” — 2 Corinthians 10:5\n\nPray. Surrender those thoughts to God. Trust that He is protecting you.\nIf you've given your life to Christ you are a child of God, and the enemy has no dominion over God's children.",

Even in His suffering, He acted as our intercessor.\n\nThis moment reveals the depth of God’s mercy. It reminds us that no one is beyond the reach of grace, not even those who nailed Him to the cross.\n\nThe same mercy Jesus extended then is available now.

No time to earn anything. All he did was believe... and that was enough.\n\nImagine hanging on a cross, moments from death, and hearing the Son of God promise you eternity. Not later. Not someday. Today.\n\nThis is the power of grace. It’s never too late to turn to Jesus. The thief asked for mercy, and Jesus gave him a place in paradise.\n\nIt was a declaration that salvation is by faith alone.\n\nIf you've been waiting to clean yourself up before coming to Christ, stop waiting because tomorrow isn't guaranteed. Surrender your life to Him today.\n\nIf you know someone who doesn't know Christ, please share this with them.",

The Sheep and Goat Judgment – This is where Christ separates those who truly followed Him from those who only claimed to. (Matthew 25:31–46)\n2. The Bema Seat Judgment – In this judgment, believers are not judged for salvation, but for how faithfully they lived after being saved. (2 Corinthians 5:10, 1 Corinthians 3:12–15, Romans 14:10–12)\n\nThese are not metaphors or symbols; they are real events that are coming.",

But as followers of Christ, we have to ask ourselves: Does what we wear reflect God’s heart for us and for others? \n\nIn 1 Timothy 2:9-10, Paul reminds us that we are called to dress modestly, with decency and respect. \n\nThis doesn’t mean we have to wear unflattering clothing. Modesty doesn’t mean we can’t look good, but it does mean we must be aware of the deeper impact of our choices. Our clothes (this goes for men too) should not distract our brothers and sisters in Christ by tempting them to sin. \n\nSo, let’s be intentional. Let’s dress in a way that honors God.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on modesty as a Christian?",

    "title": "They Used to Sing About Jesus. Now They Reject Him Completely!",
    "description": "I remember searching for one of my favorite worship songs by Audrey Assad, but instead of a song, I found a video where she shared that she had turned away from her faith. My heart sank. How can someone create such beautiful music worshiping God and then walk away from Him?\n\nShe’s not the only one. Marty Sampson and others have also left Christianity, and it raises an important question: Why is this happening?\n\nThis is why apologetics matters. It’s not just about defending our faith, it’s about understanding it deeply and helping others do the same. As believers, we aren’t called to condemn those who walk away but to pray for them and equip ourselves to answer the hard questions that might someone doubt their faith.\n\nIf you want to grow stronger in your faith and be equipped to help others navigate their toughest questions, I encourage you to watch my free masterclass, How to Defend Your Faith with Dr. Frank Turek | Apologetics 101, on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live/anH0396d7g4?si=klMjX917zPv9FFcF\n\nYou'll gain a vast amount of knowledge and feel more equipped in apologetics than ever before.",

They sound powerful on their own, but when we look at the full passage, the meaning is often quite different from how it's used. This matters because misinterpreting Scripture can lead to confusion about who God is and what He promises us.\n\nIf we truly want to grow in our faith, we have to move beyond just knowing verses and start understanding them in the right context. 🙏🏾 \n\n#bible #verses #misunderstood #christianvideos #biblicaltruth",

    "description": "In today’s world, sex is often treated as just physical—but God designed it to be sacred. It’s not about rules or restrictions, but about protection, blessing, and a covenant between husband and wife (Genesis 2:24).\n\nIf you’ve made mistakes, God’s grace is bigger than your past. 🙌🏾 He offers forgiveness, restoration, and a fresh start (1 John 1:9).\n\nBut grace isn’t a free pass to live however we want. When we truly understand God’s design, we respond in love and obedience—not just asking for forgiveness but choosing to live differently. \n\nHow has understanding God’s design for sex and marriage changed your perspective or choices? Let’s talk below. ⬇️ \n\n#christian #verse #verseoftheday #christianmarriage",

When we step outside of His design, we invite pain, confusion, and brokenness that He never intended for us.\n\nYes, God forgives, but His grace isn’t a free pass to continue in sin.

But is that really how God works? 🤔\n\n→ In the Old Covenant, tithing (10%) was required to support the Levites and the temple (Malachi 3:10).\n\n→ Under the New Covenant, we are called to give cheerfully and from the heart—not out of obligation (2 Corinthians 9:7).\n\n→ God doesn’t bless based on how much you give. The prosperity gospel teaches that bigger donations = bigger blessings, but that’s not how God operates. He blesses as He wills, based on the heart, not a dollar amount.\n\nSo, should we give? 🙌🏾 Yes! But not because we’re forced to—because we trust God.",

    "description": "Is this really the face of Jesus?\n\nFor centuries, the Shroud of Turin has puzzled scientists, historians, and theologians.\n\nSome believe it’s the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, while others claim it’s just a medieval hoax.  But what does the evidence actually say?\n\n🔬 Science still can’t explain how the image was formed. It’s not paint, ink, or any known artistic technique.\n\n📜 Historians trace it back to the early centuries, possibly smuggled from the Holy Land before appearing in France in the 1300s. It was later moved to Turin, Italy, where it remains today.\n\n✝️ The markings align exactly with what the Bible describes—wounds from scourging, a crown of thorns, pierced hands and feet, and even a side wound.\n\nAs a believer, I see this as just another powerful reminder that our God is real, Jesus Christ lived, and our faith stands on solid ground. No other religion has as much historical and physical evidence as Christianity.\n\nBUT—this shouldn’t be the only reason we believe. Our faith is built on God’s Word, and this is simply an additional reason to stand in awe and be grateful that He came in the flesh to save us! \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

    "description": "Seventh-Day Adventists share many core Christian beliefs, like the Trinity, Christ’s deity, and His sacrifice for our sins. However, there are key teachings that set them apart and raise serious concerns. They claim to be the 'remnant church' with exclusive truth and teach that non-Adventist Christians are deceived for not observing the Sabbath.\n\nAdditionally, their reliance on Ellen G. White’s writings as an authoritative source and their end-time beliefs about persecution by other Christians further separate them from biblical Christianity.\n\nThis video isn’t meant to criticize but to examine these beliefs through Scripture and encourage a deeper understanding of God’s truth.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

    "description": "Whether you’re a Christian seeking to grow deeper in your faith or part of a group like Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, or Seventh-Day Adventism, please know this: God’s love for you is not something you need to earn. 🙏🏾 \n\nThese groups often teach that works, like door-to-door evangelism, are needed for salvation, often leading to fear,  anxiety, and the burden of feeling like you’re never enough.\n\nBut the truth of the Gospel is this: Jesus already did the work for us. Through His sacrifice on the cross, we are saved by grace through faith, not by our own efforts (Ephesians 2:8-9). Salvation is a gift, not a reward for performance.\n\nIf you’re in a place where fear has been a part of your faith journey, I want you to hear this: Jesus invites you into freedom, not fear (Matthew 11:28).\n\nTo my brothers and sisters in these groups, this message is not meant to condemn but to invite. I encourage you to explore the true Gospel message of grace. Seek out a church that teaches the love and freedom found in Christ—one that aligns with the Bible’s teachings about the Trinity and the finished work of Jesus.\n\nYou are deeply loved by God, not because of what you do, but because of who He is. Praying for you as you take steps toward His peace and truth. ❤️",

Philippians 2:7 says, 'He made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant.'\n\nThis simple beginning points to the incredible truth of the gospel—Jesus came for everyone, from the least to the greatest.\"",

    "description": "As Christians, worship is an important aspect of our faith. It allows us to connect with God and express our love and adoration for Him. However, not all worship music is created equal. In this video, we'll be discussing worship music that Christians should avoid.\n\nWe'll start by examining the lyrics of certain songs that may contain false or misleading theology. It's important to ensure that the songs we sing align with the truth of God's word. \n\nWe'll also touch on the dangers of singing songs that promote a prosperity gospel, which emphasizes material blessings over spiritual growth. Finally, we will discuss what it truly means to worship God in spirit and in truth. \n\nWATCH THE ENTIRE GETTING HIGH SERIES HERE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_KG9driqqY&list=PLbE_MYjGeeTCxgrlGOegmAxydPgZ44KKs\n\nSHOP OUR NEW MERCH HERE!\nhttps://allens-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT!\nhttps://youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nJOIN THE #1 ONLINE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY ON THE INTERNET\nhttps://letsequip.com/community\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE \nhttp://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\nREGISTER FOR OUR FREE 60-MINUTE BIBLE STUDY TRAINING CLASS\nhttps://go.letsequip.com/tbaoptin\n\nLEARN HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CHRISTIAN YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nhttps://bit.ly/cfccourse\n\nDOWNLOAD YOUR FREE EBOOK\nhttps://bit.ly/iybsfree\n\nSUPPORT THIS MINISTRY FINANCIALLY\nhttps://allenparr.com/support\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nWebsite | https://allenparr.com\nInstagram | https://instagram.com/allengparr\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/allengparr\nFacebook | https://facebook.com/allengparr\n\nTO INVITE ME TO SPEAK:\nWant to have Allen come and speak at your next event?\nhttps://allenparr.com/speaking",

    "description": "Weight loss is NOT just a physical thing. It's a spiritual thing. The reality is that we have only ONE body to care for and steward and we honor God best by properly stewarding that body. That includes being in the best shape we can, managing our diet and exercising self-control. Last year I last 35 POUNDS in just over 90 DAYS! It was LIFE-CHANGING for me. Food was literally my IDOL for 46 years. Now, a year removed from my weight loss program, my weight has fluctuated within just 3-5 pounds from my ideal weight. Why? Because I developed habits that changed my life and I NEVER plan on going back.

    "description": "Divorce is one of the saddest, most painful experiences a human being can experience. No one wins with a divorce. The spouses suffer and the children do as well. There are a lot of teachings about the subject of divorce and remarriage. Many Christians won't accept what the Bible truly says about the subject.

    "description": "Should pastors have private jets? I think the bigger question that many Christians ask is, \"Should pastors live an extravagant lifestyle or should they intentionally reject the idea of being wealthy?\" Should a congregation purchase a private jet for their pastor? More importantly, is there a much bigger lesson the body of Christ can learn about this that extends far beyond private jets? I believe there is and I explore that in this video. \n\nSHOP OUR NEW MERCH HERE!\nhttps://allens-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT!\nhttps://youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nJOIN THE #1 ONLINE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY ON THE INTERNET\nhttps://letsequip.com/community\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE \nhttp://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\nREGISTER FOR OUR FREE 60-MINUTE BIBLE STUDY TRAINING CLASS\nhttps://go.letsequip.com/tbaoptin\n\nLEARN HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CHRISTIAN YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nhttps://bit.ly/cfccourse\n\nDOWNLOAD YOUR FREE EBOOK\nhttps://bit.ly/iybsfree\n\nSUPPORT THIS MINISTRY FINANCIALLY\nhttps://allenparr.com/support\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nWebsite | https://allenparr.com\nInstagram | https://instagram.com/allengparr\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/allengparr\nFacebook | https://facebook.com/allengparr\n\nTO INVITE ME TO SPEAK:\nWant to have Allen come and speak at your next event?\nhttps://allenparr.com/speaking",

I trust that you'll get immense value from it and I ask that you share this with them. \n\nSHOP OUR NEW MERCH HERE!\nhttps://allens-shop.fourthwall.com/\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT!\nhttps://youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nJOIN THE #1 ONLINE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY ON THE INTERNET\nhttps://letsequip.com/community\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE \nhttp://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\nREGISTER FOR OUR FREE 60-MINUTE BIBLE STUDY TRAINING CLASS\nhttps://go.letsequip.com/tbaoptin\n\nLEARN HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CHRISTIAN YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nhttps://bit.ly/cfccourse\n\nDOWNLOAD YOUR FREE EBOOK\nhttps://bit.ly/iybsfree\n\nSUPPORT THIS MINISTRY FINANCIALLY\nhttps://allenparr.com/support\n\nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nWebsite | https://allenparr.com\nInstagram | https://instagram.com/allengparr\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/allengparr\nFacebook | https://facebook.com/allengparr\n\nTO INVITE ME TO SPEAK:\nWant to have Allen come and speak at your next event?\nhttps://allenparr.com/speaking",

    "description": "Guess what? 2022 is fast approaching and this is normally the time when people start making all sorts of goals and New Year's resolutions. But instead of making another \"resolution\" or creating a \"vision board\" or setting \"goals\" for next year, I'd like to suggest a different approach for this upcoming year that requires more intentionality. \n\nJesus said that He came \"that we might have life and have it more abundantly.\" Usually when people see that, they assume it is referring to financial abundance. While that may be part of it, I believe the abundant life is much more than that. On this LIVE STREAM I provide the exact strategy that I've been implementing in my own life and plan to continue in 2022 to live the abundant life.

    "description": "Over the past 10 years or so we have seen several high-profile celebrity pastors of very large churches fall in ministry. They have either been removed, resigned or simply retired. The sad reality is that they all left a trail of wounded victims along the way. While we don't expect our leaders to be perfect, we do expect them to be above reproach. \n\nFrom studying the lives of these three prominent high-profile pastors, I've come up with a list of qualities that most of them had in common that led to their demise. The sad part is that there are many more pastors who will undoubtedly follow in their footsteps UNLESS they make some serious changes.

What changes can the church make to attract more millennials to their services? This video speaks first to the millennial, or anyone who has left church for that matter, and analyzes whether their reasons for leaving are valid or not.

    "description": "If an atheist claimed that God is a murderer because He ordered the killing of innocent people in the Old Testament, how would you respond? This is one of the arguments you may hear when discussing God with an atheist. \n\nThey will suggest that God contradicts Himself by ordering us not to murder but then murders people Himself or, commanding people to murder others. So, how do we refute this claim?

    "description": "Is being a poor Christian more Christlike than being rich? Sadly, we live in a world of extremes. On one hand many people believe that if you are not prosperous then you are not in God's will for your life. On the other hand, some people are so afraid of wealth because they associate it with evil. They say it's more Christlike to be humble, meek, meager and \"get by\" with little so as to reflect the character of Christ. \n\nBut, how exactly should we view this idea of Christians being rich or poor? Is it okay to be a Christian and have immense wealth or should we shy away from being rich and wealthy so that we reflect the character of Christ more?

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat is the unforgivable sin? Some call it the \"unpardonable sin.\" What does it mean to blaspheme the Holy Spirit? Are you afraid you've possibly committed the unforgivable sin? Is it suicide? Murder? Adultery? Is there a sin that a believer can commit that is too great for God to forgive? In this video we take a detailed look at Jesus' statements in 3 of the 4 gospels regarding the unforgivable sin and discuss whether that applies to believers or not.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE: https://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\nThe BEAT helps people grow spiritually by providing truth, training and teaching from the word of God.  \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT: https://www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\nDOWNLOAD MY NEW eBOOK entitled, \"Five Keys to Unlocking Your Purpose\" ~ https://www.allenparr.com/five-keys-ebook/\n__\n\nVisit my website: www.allenparr.com for more helpful resources.\n__\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK\nIf you want me to come and speak in your area fill out this form below.\nhttp://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n__\n\nLET'S CONNECT:\nFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/allengparr\nTWITTER: www.twitter.com/allengparr\nWEBSITE: www.allenparr.com\nYOUTUBE: www.youtube.com/thebeatagp",

NOT! Don't get used to this because this is my first and LAST VLOG probably. Anyway, I hope you enjoy me sharing a little bit of my life and my day with you.

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHey everyone! A little while back I released my first online course called Bible Study Made Easy! This 6-hour course teaches you a proven strategic method for how to study the Bible in a step-by-step format. Since that time so many of you have had some good questions about exactly what this course is all about and what's inside and what the modules were all about so I decided to make a video taking you inside the course and explain to you all of the modules in detail. If you desire to learn how to study the Bible with me personally guiding you along the way inside my small group, give some time and prayer to enrolling in this course. Don't let the financial investment deter you because there is a 30-day money back guarantee should you change your mind and feel this course is not worth it. So far EVERYONE inside the course has absolutely loved it! You would also get immediate private access inside my Facebook group as well where I'm on live every week doing advanced bible study training, Q&A sessions and more! I sincerely hope to see you on the inside! \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE: https://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\nThe BEAT helps people grow spiritually by providing truth, training and teaching from the word of God.  \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT: https://www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\nDOWNLOAD MY NEW eBOOK entitled, \"Five Keys to Unlocking Your Purpose\" ~ https://www.allenparr.com/five-keys-ebook/\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVisit my website: www.allenparr.com for more helpful resources.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK\nIf you want me to come and speak in your area fill out this form below.\nhttp://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLET'S CONNECT:\nFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/allengparr\nTWITTER: www.twitter.com/allengparr\nWEBSITE: www.allenparr.com\nYOUTUBE: www.youtube.com/thebeatagp",

Are you or those around you slowly turning into modern-day Pharisees? The first sin in the Bible was pride. God hates pride. Pride can show up in our lives in very subtle ways. In this video I take a detailed verse-by-verse look at Matt. 23 and identify 3 ways we can tell that pride is in our lives and how we can tell if we are a modern-day pharisee.  \n\nHERE IS THE VIDEO ON JUDGING:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In27Ex21b2Y&t=4s\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE: https://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\n\nThe BEAT helps people grow spiritually by providing truth, training and teaching from the word of God.  \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT: https://www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\nDOWNLOAD MY NEW eBOOK entitled, \"Five Keys to Unlocking Your Purpose\" ~ https://www.allenparr.com/five-keys-ebook/\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVisit my website: www.allenparr.com for more helpful resources.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK\nIf you want me to come and speak in your area fill out this form below.\nhttp://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLET'S CONNECT:\nFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/allengparr\nTWITTER: www.twitter.com/allengparr\nWEBSITE: www.allenparr.com\nYOUTUBE: www.youtube.com/thebeatagp",

We are often guilty of not preparing people for what it TRULY means to be a fully-devoted follower of Jesus Christ. In this 10-minute sermon from Luke 14:25-35 Jesus is brutally honest about what it means to be a disciple rather than just being a Christian.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE: https://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\n\nThe BEAT helps people grow spiritually by providing truth, training and teaching from the word of God.  \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT: https://www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\nDOWNLOAD MY NEW eBOOK entitled, \"Five Keys to Unlocking Your Purpose\" ~ https://www.allenparr.com/five-keys-ebook/\nDOWNLOAD THE NOTES HERE: https://allenparr.krtra.com/t/lizJMm3nw5Yf\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nFor more on this check out these two sermons...\nFrances Chan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUEHZCxjq-o\nMark Driscoll: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPUegEmemeU\n\nVisit my website: www.allenparr.com for more helpful resources.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK\nIf you want me to come and speak in your area fill out this form below.\nhttp://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLET'S CONNECT:\nFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/allengparr\nTWITTER: www.twitter.com/allengparr\nWEBSITE: www.allenparr.com\nYOUTUBE: www.youtube.com/thebeatagp",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhy does God kill innocent people in the Old Testament but commands us not to do so? In doing so, does this not make God both a murderer and a hypocrite? Why does God kills and order His people to kill entire nations including babies and seemingly innocent people? Why does God kill is one of the questions that atheists will use to suggest that God is not good. This video gives 6 reasons why God kills innocent people in the Old Testament. \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLEARN TO STUDY THE BIBLE: https://bit.ly/ytbsme1\n\n\nThe BEAT helps people grow spiritually by providing truth, training and teaching from the word of God.  \n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE BEAT: https://www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\nDOWNLOAD MY NEW eBOOK entitled, \"Five Keys to Unlocking Your Purpose\" ~ https://www.allenparr.com/five-keys-ebook/\nDOWNLOAD THE NOTES TO THIS VIDEO: https://allenparr.krtra.com/t/Ssz9ZDhUtRZa\n\n\nVisit my website: www.allenparr.com for more helpful resources.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK\nIf you want me to come and speak in your area fill out this form below.\nhttp://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLET'S CONNECT:\nFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/allengparr\nTWITTER: www.twitter.com/allengparr\nWEBSITE: www.allenparr.com\nYOUTUBE: www.youtube.com/thebeatagp",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nGRIEVING: HOW TO COMFORT SOMEONE\n\nWhat do you do and how do you respond when someone you love is experiencing a loss? That’s coming up next on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for tuning in. Today we are asking the question, “How do you comfort someone in a loss?” And the truth is that sometimes it’s awkward because we don’t really know what to do and what to say. We’re often afraid of saying the wrong thing. So, today I want to share with you 2 DON’Ts and 4 DO’s when comforting someone through a loss. \n\n1. DO NOT…\na. Assume the person wants or needs space. If this person is a true friend of yours, not only do they want to hear from you, they need to hear from you and they expect to hear from you. And if you don’t express your genuine concern for them it can compound their pain because the people closest to them were not there for them in their point of greatest need.\nb. Talk too much – The Bible says, “let every word we speak be HELPFUL and according to the NEED OF THE MOMENT.” \ni. This doesn’t mean don’t talk at all, it just means to use wisdom.\nii. Sometimes when we don’t know what to say to someone we say too much. What we need to realize is that when someone is experiencing the pain of a loss there really isn’t ANYTHING secular or spiritual that you could say that would remove or lessen the pain. \niii. Say…“Well, they are in a better place.” “Heaven has just received an angel.” – The reality is that you don’t always know whether the person is going to heaven or not. “It was their time.” “You’ll see them again.”\niv. The reason why we shouldn’t say things like this is because although we hope these things are true we don’t know for sure where the deceased person is.\nv. Also, more importantly, at that moment the person doesn’t care about seeing that person in heaven. They miss them right now on earth. \n\n2. Prayers\na. Not just praying for them but praying with them.  \nb. There is something encouraging that begins to happen when you lay your hands on someone who is in pain and they hear you cry out to God with all of your heart on their behalf. \n\n3. Presence\na. Job – Health, Wealth, Family, Friends\nb. This means recognizing that they are in a very vulnerable state and don’t need to deal with it alone.  \nc. Weep with them. \nd. Listening to them for as long as they need. The key, once again, is not to do a lot of talking. \ne. Follow up with them every couple of days and during special days such as that person’s birthday or during the holidays to reassure them that they don’t have to walk through this alone. \n\n4. Provisions\na. The Bible says, “Do not withhold good to those who deserve it when it is in your power to help them.”\nb. Ask them is there anything that they need? Often times when a person experiences loss they are in a state of denial or shock and for some time they won’t be able to think straight enough to do basic things.\nc. So, offer to take them food, shop for groceries, doing housework, send them a gift card, watch their children, take them out to lunch or a movie, invite them over to dinner, etc. \n\n5.  Patience\na. In other words, don’t pass judgment on them if it takes them longer to process the pain of the loss than it takes you. \nb. Understand that depending on the depth of the loss this person may need some serious time to process the loss.",

    "title": "AM I A LUKEWARM CHRISTIAN? | THE LOVE THAT GOD HATES",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nAM I A LUKEWARM CHRISTIAN?\n\nThe Bible says that God is love. But there is one type of love that God hates. That’s coming up next on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for tuning into the BEAT. Today we are talking about what it looks like to be a worldly Christian. And it is my belief that one of, if not the biggest, problem within Christianity today is that too many Christians profess to be Christians but the lifestyle would say otherwise.  The Bible teaches that there are four classes of people (non-Christian, baby Christian, worldly Christian, spiritual Christian). Let’s look at how God feels about worldly Christians.\n \n1. James 4:4 – Speaking to Christians James reminds them that, “Friendship with the world makes you an ENEMY of God.”\n2. Rev. 3:15-16 – So He’s not saying I wish you were saved or unsaved. But rather he is suggesting that COLD water is good and useful and so is HOT water but lukewarm water is USELESS and He wants to SPIT it out of His mouth!  \n\nSo what exactly does it look like to be a worldly Christian? Let’s break this up into two categories. \n\nBELIEFS\n1. Rom. 12:2 – Do not be conformed to the pattern of this world. In other words, don’t let the world system that we are surrounded by squeeze you into its mold. But instead be TRANSFORMED by renewing your mind. \n2. A recent poll showed that 57% OF ALL PROFESSING CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OTHER THAN JESUS TO GET TO HEAVEN?\n3. When Christians believe that because our society has evolved that it’s now okay to redefine marriage to be between two people from the same sex, that’s a worldly belief. \n4. When you believe that it’s okay for two Christians to live together before marriage because it’s more economically feasible CHRISTIANITY IS TRENDING TOWARDS WORLDLINESS. \n5. And Jesus says, “When I see lukewarmness I want to spit you out of My mouth.”\n6. The reason why this angers God is because it reveals that we fear the rejection and value the opinions of men more than we do God. \n\nThe second thing that characterizes a worldly Christian is not only their BELIEFS but also their BEHAVIOR. \n1. Comfortable in sin\na. When you are living in perpetual sin AND your heart is no longer tender and grieved over it that is a sign that you’re trending towards worldliness. \nb. The Bible describes this as a “seared” conscience; comparing it to skin that is now burnt and insensitive to feeling. \n2. Spiritual Stagnancy – Paul said to the Corinthian church, “I could not talk to you as I would spiritual people. I had to talk as though you belonged to the world.” Why? Because they had not progressed in their understanding of God to the point where they would even be able to receive deeper teachings from Paul. It’s natural for us to have high and low seasons but if you are not growing spiritually over a long period of time you could be trending towards worldliness. \n3. Worldly Love – Finally John described worldliness as people who are controlled by the lust of the flesh (people who are dominated by things that gratify their fleshly desires), lust of the eyes (people who lust after what they see and as a result their minds are obsessed with obtaining more and more wealth and possessions rather than giving to others), and the pride of life (people who are absorbed with themselves and things that make them look good in front of other people.)\n\nFor more info on this subject check out chasegodtv\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z6ux_ehslo",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWHICH BIBLE TRANSLATION SHOULD I READ?\nWhich Bible version is best for me? \n\nYou got KJV, NASB and now the Message. And so today I want to talk about the three different types of Bible translations and the pros and cons of each. \n\nNo Bible Translation is Perfect\n• The original Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek [which is why most theological schools teach Greek and Hebrew] meaning men had to interpret what they believed the text was saying. \n• The problem is that there are close to 5 million words in the Biblical Greek language and only 1 million English words making it very difficult to always find an exact English word or phrase that reflects the true meaning of the biblical text. \n\n1. “Word for Word” Translations – These versions are normally written at a 11-12th grade reading level. \na. This is where the translators attempted to take each word from the Greek/Hebrew (Aramaic) and translate it to English preserving the exact word order\nb. One example of this type would be the King James Bible\ni. Pros – The translators prided themselves on translated the Greek/Hebrew manuscripts word for word preserving the authenticity of the original manuscripts.\nii. Cons – The problem is that it was translated in 1611 in Old English words that are over 400 years old.\niii. So, not only are there words like thee, thou, whither and comest, restoreth that we no longer use but there are other words that mean something totally different today than they meant in 1611.\nc. Amplified – Another one in this category is the AMP Bible which is one of my absolute favorites. \ni. Pros – It adds key words and phrases in brackets to help you better understand what you are reading.\nii. Cons – The words they add are left up to the interpreter who added them.  \n\n2. “Thought for Thought” – NIV, NLT\na. This is where the translators took whole phrases and tried to capture the general idea of what the phrase was saying and then disregarding the original word order and then translated it into English. \nb. Examples of these would be the New International Version and the New Living Translation\nc. Pros – They are written at a 7-8th grade reading level making it very easy to understand which is great because the Bible is already hard to understand. \nd. Cons – Some of the original meaning can be watered down in an attempt to make it more readable.\n\n3. Paraphrase – The editors took whole chunks of the Bible and did not even try to attempt to translate it literally but rather they put it in very modern words that people can understand. \na. The most popular paraphrase today is the Message Bible. \nb. Pros – it is the easiest Bible to read aimed to be read at a 4-5th grade reading level. \nc. The obvious con here is that a paraphrase disregards the meaning of individual biblical words and they take liberties in adding more words in an attempt to make it more readable which then makes it subject to the interpretation of the translators.  \n\nSo, what’s the best one to use? The one that you enjoy reading the most and the one you feel that God speaks clearest to you. I personally subscribe to the NLT because I’ve found it to be the best combination of accuracy and clarity and when I read it I actually understand what the Bible is saying. I would only use a paraphrase, such as the Message Bible, as a secondary resource only after I’ve read and studied from an actual bible translation.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHELP! I KEEP SINNING! HOW TO FESS UP WHEN YOU MESS UP!\n\nWhat do you do when you keep committing the same sin again and again? That’s our topic today on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for tuning into the BEAT. Today we want to talk about what to do when you find yourself struggling with the same sin again and again and you may not be now but I can assure you that at some point you will have something that no matter how hard you try you can’t seem to stop going.  [I wish someone would’ve told me these things when I was a younger Christian because I did it all wrong.] So today I want to share with you 5 DOs and 5 DON’Ts.\n \nDOs\n1. Confess your sin – 1 Jn. 1:9 – Even if you have to confess the same sin 10 times every day. Confess it. The reason why we do is because it reestablishes fellowship with God. \n\n2. Accept God’s Free Gift of Grace – Rom. 5:20\n\n3. Try to Identify the Root Cause of Why – Many people deal with the fruit and not the root and never ask the question, “why am I struggling with this sin?” And so because they never ask the question they seldom get the answer. \n\n4. Accountability – Proverbs 18:1; 14:12; 11:14; James 5 – Let’s face it. If you would’ve been able to conquer this sin on your own by now you would’ve done it. The enemy wants you to live in secrecy where you feel so ashamed of what you’re doing that you can’t share it with anyone. \n\n5. Reestablish Intimate fellowship with God – Ps. 119:11 – When you do your chances of committing sin are less. Remember that Dusty Bibles lead to Dirty Lives.\n\nDON’Ts\n1. Don’t think you have lost your salvation – Listen, the very fact that you are experiencing a strong sense of remorse over your sin is ongoing proof that the Holy Spirit is alive and well doing His job inside of you.\n\n2. Don’t live in condemnation – Rom. 8:1\na. Don’t start beating yourself up living a depressed life thinking that the more depressed you make yourself the more impressed God is with your spirituality. God never requires us to get depressed over our sin. \nb. Sometimes we think we need to create some sort of buffer time between when we sin and when we get back with God because if we try to get back with God too quickly it means we aren’t taking our sin seriously. \nc. When we do this leads us to create distance between ourselves and God to where we don’t feel worthy to pray, read our bible, worship or share our faith with others making us ineffective. \n\n3. Don’t try to do something good to make up for your sin – Isa. 64:6 – It doesn’t work like that. \n\n4. Don’t make promises to God you can't keep\n\n5. Don’t Rationalize it – Prov. 28:13 – Don’t make excuses for your sin. \n\nIf you know someone struggling with sin in their life (just about all of us), please pass this video along to them. And remember, Dusty Bibles lead to Dirty Lives.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHOW TO HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR SPOUSE\n\nHow do you have a conversation with your spouse or anyone for that matter that you know is going to be a difficult one? That’s coming up next on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for tuning into the BEAT. Today we are talking about having “difficult conversations.” Every couple, including my wife and I as recent as this week, are going to have to have difficult conversations no matter what you see people posting on Facebook. And so today I don’t have a lot of scripture but I want to share with you 7 practical tips that my wife and I are trying to practice in our marriage so we can have healthy yet difficult conversations.\n\n1. Don’t Avoid Them\na. When we avoid obvious issues in our relationships it basically means that we are settling for a second-class mediocre marriage. And what happens is there is an obvious elephant in the room. And we think that over time that elephant will disappear but on the contrary the longer we leave it there the bigger it gets.\nb. Resentment begins to build which leads to separation which then leads to fake intimacy in public where you act like you’re happy to impress others but behind closed doors there is no true intimacy. \nc. So my first piece of advice is that the worse thing you can do is ignore or avoid the issue, but rather see how confronting the issue can actually heal your marriage and bring you closer together. \n\n2. Do not criticize someone for something they cannot change – This is called “not fighting fair.” This leads someone to feel as though you don’t accept them the way they are and because they can’t change it they will never be fully accepted in your eyes, which can be devastating to any relationship especially in marriage.  Number three…along those same lines…\n\n3. Do not criticize your spouse for something you knew before you married them – When we consistently do this it sends the subtle message that had you known this before you would've made a different decision in terms of marrying them. \n\n4. Avoid Using Absolutes\na. This is something that we’ve often told not to do but seldom do people tell you why. The reason is, for one, it’s not true. Generally a person doesn’t always do something or never do something. But second…\nb. When we use the words “never” and/or “always” what it does is that it immediately puts the person on the defensive because now instead of listening to you they are thinking about examples that can counter your “never/always” statement. “Well what about last week when I did this? And last month I did it twice! And what about you? You never do this for me!” \nc. And then it just gets bad. Get those two words out of your vocabulary when you’re having difficult conversations. \n\n5. Stick to the Issue – As difficult as it is try to stay focused on the specific issue that is being discussed. Why?\na. First of all, when we bring up issues from the past it reminds the other person that we have not yet fully forgiven them for past mistakes.\nb. Second, it distracts you from addressing and ultimately resolving the original issue that was brought up because now more than likely you’re addressing another issue. Stay focused on the issue at hand.\n \n6. Don’t Deflect –The natural tendency when someone confronts you about you is to immediately lash back and bring up something about them instead of receiving what they are saying. Receive it, pray on it and then ask God to show you if there is any truth to what they are saying and what needs to change within you. When people get defensive when difficult issues are brought up, the other person takes note of that and then are less likely to bring up anything in the future in fear that it will turn into WWIII. So your defensiveness leads them to shut down, internalize the issue and live in fear right in their own home. \n\n7. Don’t be afraid to bring in a third party – When you see a certain symptom again and again regarding your health you go to the doctor. When there is an issue that consistently comes up that creates arguments and tension you can either allow this issue to further deteriorate your relationship or you and your spouse can humble yourselves and get help from a variety of different unbiased, Christian counselors, professional or non-professional that can help you work through it because often times, for whatever reason, your spouse will receive a message better from someone else than they do from you. \n\nAnd so today I want to encourage you with this quote as you are dealing with conflict. Remember, “I’d rather lose an argument to my spouse than to lose you my spouse to an argument.”",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWHEN YOU FEEL STUCK\n\nWhat do you do when you’re doing everything you know how to do and you just feel STUCK in life?\n\nHey everyone, my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for tuning in. I don’t know about you but there have been times in my life where I just feel stuck. Nothing’s working. Doors seem to be closed. People around you are getting blessed and if you’re not careful you’ll sink into depression wondering if your change is ever going to come. So today I want to share with you from the word of God 3 lessons that I believe God desperately wants us to learn in these seasons of our lives where we can’t seem to break through and I want to give you one word to hold to for each lesson.  \n\nAnd so today we want to look at a man named Joseph who did everything right. God had given him some amazing dreams for his life and yet in Gen. 40 he finds himself stuck in prison. The first lesson I believe God would have us to learn is a lesson on testing…\n\n1. Testing\na. There is a beautiful scripture in Psalm 135 that says, “until God fulfilled Joseph’s dreams God was testing his character.” \nb. God often gives us tests in life. The Bible says God “tested Abraham.” He “tested” the nation of Israel in the wilderness. The Bible says that the testing of our faith produces perseverance and it says in Romans that this perseverance ultimately produces character in our lives. \nc. When Joseph was sold as a slave he was under a test. How is it going to respond when things don't go his way? Would he forgive his brothers for selling them into slavery? Will he still continue to do his best on a job that is beneath him and he's overqualified for? Or would he give half effort, complain to those around him, and constantly look ahead instead of being present? How would he respond when falsely accused? How will he respond when people mistreat him? Will he respect, honor and submit to the people in authority over him or will he talk negatively about the people who are over you? How will he respond when he's tempted and everything in his flesh wants to give in to that sexual temptation? The way we respond to all of these tests when we feel STUCK demonstrates and develops greater character in our lives. \nd. KEY WORD: RESOLVE – Resolve to demonstrate good character.\n2. Trust\na. Later in this amazing story of Joseph’s life he finds himself now in prison and he forms a great relationship with a man who was also innocent who was getting ready to get released to go back and work for the king. And Joseph says to him, “when you get out remember me and put in a good word for the king. I’m not supposed to be here!” \nb. Often times we say we trust God. We sing songs about trusting God. We tell other people how they can and need to trust God. But when we are stuck in life it reveals whether we are putting our trust in God or in man. \nc. Who is your trust in? Man or God? Tests often times reveal who we are trusting in. So many times we put our trust in our connections, our resources, our possessions, our education, our experience instead of God. When we get stuck we think \"I've got what it takes to get myself out of this.\" God’s got you. God knows exactly where you are and how long you’ve been in your situation. And He’s already gone ahead of you to make provisions for your next assignment that you don’t even know about. \nd. KEY WORD: REST – Be still and know that God is God. Don’t force things and put your trust in God.\n3. Timing\na. The Bible says that after two full years in prison that Joseph was released. But he wasn’t just released; God had promoted him to being the second most influential person in the entire land IN HIS TIMING.  I can imagine Joseph thinking, “why did I have to stay in prison for TWO years?” \nb. The question is, “do we think with our finite minds that we know more than God?” Or can we say like the psalmist said, God I don’t understand what you’re doing but, “But I trust in you, O Lord…and my times are in your hands.”\nc. KEY WORD: RELINQUISH – Relinquish your timetable of when you think things should happen in your life and trust God’s timing because just as the heavens are above the earth so are His ways higher than ours.",

    "title": "THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN: A Biblical Perspective",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nMY THOUGHTS ON THE OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN – DONALD TRUMP\n\nHey everyone, I’m sure by now we’ve all heard of the statements that Donald Trump has made that are slowly being released. And I want to share my thoughts on it. Now let me go on the record by saying that in no way and I’m endorsing Hillary Clinton, nor am I trying to bash Donald Trump but rather I simply want to focus specifically on the statements that he made some ten years ago and are being released now and I think there are just a few things we can learn.\n\n1. Be Careful Not to Judge\na. I think we as Christians need to be just a little careful not to judge him as a person but rather judge the words that he has said. I’m reminded of a story in the Bible where a woman who was caught in the very act of adultery was brought to Jesus. And she was surrounded by a crowd of people with stones in their hands ready to throw he in a pit and stone her to death. And Jesus said, “wait a second, if there is anyone who is here who is without any sin then you can be the first to person to throw the stone.” And the Bible says they thought about it for a second and one by one from the oldest to the youngest they put their stones down and left. Now was Jesus condoning this woman’s behavior? No. But He was teaching a lesson that we should be quick to look at ourselves first before we cast judgment on someone else. \nb. All I’m simply trying to say is that if someone were to go back and look through all of our emails, voicemails and text messages from 10-20 years ago they just might find some things that we are not proud of today. \n\n2. Words Matter\na. The Bible says, “A fool expresses all of their emotions, but a wise person controls them.” I think the lesson here is to be extra careful to filter what comes to our minds so that it doesn’t come out through our mouths. \nb. The Bible says, “Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.” In other words, what we say reveals what’s in our hearts which leads people not only to judge what we say but who we are. \nc. So we need to be careful because we never know how something we say or do today can affect us some time down the road which is why it’s critical that we always live our lives above reproach. \n\n3. Own it 100%\na. The next thing I’d say is that when people catch us in the wrong in any arena in life whether it may be in relationships, at church, at work or in this case in politics, our best response is to just own it 100% and apologize deeply for the hurt you’ve caused the other person. \nb. There are two things I that I noticed about Donald Trump’s apology. First he said, “if” I offended anyone I apologize suggesting that there was a possibility that his words were not offensive.\nc. But more importantly he apologized but then said that it was just “locker room talk” and that “Bill Clinton has said even worse things to me on the golf course.” \nd. When we add anything to a confession it appears as though we are trying to exonerate ourselves which then takes away from the genuineness of the confession and it comes off that we are trying to justify what we’ve done by suggesting that other people do it too. \n\n4. Objectification of Women\na. Finally I’d say that we as Christian men need to be careful that we don’t objectify women. The statements that are made in the locker room that we think are no big deal, the jokes we laugh at, tell and share with others, the women we gawk at at the gym simply communicates our approval that women are to be objectified as sex objects. \nb. Certainly watching pornographic material would also constitute as endorsing the objectification of women.\nc. We must remember that non-Christians are constantly looking at us to see if we are going to be examples of Christ-like character and when we objectify women we’re not doing what Jesus would do, we’re acting just like the world does. \nSo guys, I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Please share them below in the comments section. Thanks so much I’ll see you next time on the BEAT.",

    "title": "How Should Christians Vote?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHow Christians Should Vote?\nHow do you vote when you don’t agree with either candidate? That’s our topic today on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for tuning into the BEAT. Today we are asking the question, “How Should A Christian Vote?” particularly in situations where you might not agree with either candidate. So today I hope to provide a few principles that can govern not who we vote for but how we vote.\n1. Remember that our ultimate hope is not in a person or a party it’s in God\na. So no matter who is in office God is sovereign and the Bible says that the heart of the King is in the Lords hand. \nb. It also says in Romans chapter 13 that every authority is established by God. So this just simply means that if the candidate that you choose does not happen to get in the office not only do we still have hope that God's sovereign will will be done, but we must also remember that we have not only a civil but a spiritual responsibility to pray for and support whoever is elected.\n2. Don't feel obligated to a two-party system\na. In other words, there is no scripture in the Bible that commands you to vote Democrat or Republican. On the contrary it says that we will be held accountable not only for the evil deeds we do but also when we “give approval to those who practice them.” \nb. If you cannot in any good conscience cast your vote and show your support for either candidate without feeling as though you are supporting some gross immorality then you are under no civil, moral or spiritual law to vote for either of them. \nc. On the contrary you have the right to publicly communicate your beliefs by voting independent or for a third party. \n3. Don’t Vote Party or Personality Vote Principles\na. With that being said, be careful not to elevate one issue as being more biblical, Christian or near to God's heart than another simply because it’s more personal to you\nb. For instance, according to the Bible, taking care of the poor and dealing with the social injustices that are running rampant in our country is just as near and dear to the heart of God as the lives of unborn children or same-sex marriages.\nc. So I would say study what the Bible says about these issues and then ask God to lead you to vote on the ones you feel are nearest to God’s heart and which ones would impact our country the most.\n4.  Vote on Character\na. As one person said until Jesus runs for president you will always be voting for the lesser of two evils (lowest approval rate of any two candidates in history).  \nb. So the question we should ask ourselves is, “Which person's character do I trust more to make decisions under pressure that can and will affect our country as a whole?” \nc. The best way to assess this is to look at how they’ve demonstrated character in the past. How do they make decisions? How do they treat people? Are they trustworthy? Do they show genuine care for mankind?\n5. Be Informed on the Issues\na. Instead of casting an emotional vote because of how someone looks, our predisposed opinion of them, the way our family normally, their gender or the color of their skin, instead take the necessary time to be informed and aware of as many issues as possible so that we can make an educated decision on who to vote for. \n\nSo, this is a controversial topic but we don’t shy away from these topics on the BEAT so I would LOVE to hear your thoughts on this please leave the in the comments section below. Thanks so much for watching and I’ll see you next time on the BEAT.",

    "title": "PHILIPPIANS 4 | \"I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST\"",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHey what's up everyone, today we conclude our series in the book of Philippians chapter 4. And I want to break this up into three parts. First, there is a prayer we need to pray. Second, there is a principle we need to learn. Finally there is a promise we need to claim. \n\nPrayer to Pray\n1. Command\na. Do not be anxious – the word means to be pulled in so many directions\nb. Why? Anxiety is the number one thing that will steal and rob us of joy.\n2. Pray\na. About everything – This lets us know that God is concerned about the most minute details of our lives. \nb. Petition – Specific request for benefit\nc. Thanksgiving – Grateful acknowledgement of God’s blessing\n3. Result\na. Peace exchange – “You give me your weight and in exchange I’ll give you my peace.” \ni. This peace is the result of knowing that you are transferring the weight from you to God and you’re putting the ball in God’s court and you can now hold God to fulfill His promises to you. \nii. It will surpass all human understanding and comprehension. \niii. Peace OF God – It’s a peace that ONLY God can give to you that the world won’t understand. It’s the result of knowin\niv. This peace will guard your heart (from wrong feelings) and your mind (from wrong thinking).\n4. Principle to Learn\na. Contentment – The first thing that we notice is that Paul said that he “learned” how to be content in all circumstances which means this is NOT something that just happens overnight. This is something that is learned over time and through experience. \nb. The key to his contentment was twofold.\ni. POWER: Christ who gave him the strength. Phil. 4:13 has been one of the most misquoted verses in the Bible. People rip this verse out of content to suggest that we can do anything we put our minds to like run a marathon, become a doctor, become a professional athlete. But Paul isn’t referring to any of that. Rather, he is talking about being able to be content whether he’s ballin’ on top or struggling to provide. \nii. PERSPECTIVE #1: Paul clearly had the right perspective on material things. In 1 Tim. 6:6-8 he says, “we came into the world with nothing and we will leave with nothing. So with food and clothing I’ll be content.” Now I admit I’m not there yet! But because Paul had the right perspective he was able to experience contentment. \niii. PERSPECTIVE #2: Secondly, Paul understood that temptations come with both being rich and being poor. It’s interesting here that Paul said he had to “learn how to be content being rich.” He understood that when you’re rich you will experience different temptations. First, to feel self-sufficient and to trust in your wealth rather than in God. And secondly the temptation to be greedy because once you get a taste of wealth you want more and more.  If you’re poor you may be prone to steal or resort to unethical means to provide for yourself (see Prov. 30:7-9).\nc. LESSON: It’s easy for us to be content when we have more than enough. The true test of our faith is how we respond in the low seasons when our change is strange and our money is funny. \n\nPromise to Claim\n1. Paul says here that God will supply all of our needs. The problem is that we get our needs mixed up with our greeds.",

    "title": "Breaking generation curses | HOW TO BREAK FREE FROM GENERATIONAL CURSES",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nBreaking generation curses:\nWhat is a generational curse and how can we break it? \n\nHey what’s up family today we are talking about The idea of generational curses comes primarily from Exodus and verses similar to that referring to the effects of sin being passed down to the 3rd and 4th generation. And so today I want to answer three questions. What is it? How does it get into our families? How can we break it? \n\n1. What is it? It’s a specific pattern (teen pregnancy, divorce, pornography, anger, abuse, adultery, alcoholism) that is deposited into the family where the family members will be more predisposed to repeating because of heightened exposure to it.  \n2. How does it get there? I want to look at three stages by focusing in on three words in this verse. \na. STAGE #1 – INIQUITY – There are several words used in the Bible to describe offense to God (sin, transgression, trespass) and then the word used here which is iniquity. The Hebrew word iniquity is deepest level of sin and literally means something that is “bent” or “deformed.” \nb. It refers to a specific weakness or stronghold in our lives that comes as a result of consistently, willfully sinning against God without repentance.  \nc. STAGE #2 – VISITING – Notice it says that this “iniquity” in us will “visit” the children down to the 3rd or 4th generation. Some versions translate this word as “punish” but the literally meaning is to visit or to call. So when we have iniquity or strongholds in our lives, we deposit that into our family and it comes visiting and knocking on the door of our children and our children’s children. We still have the choice to open up and let it in. But without the power of the Holy Spirit we will more than likely not have the spiritual power to continue to shut the door in sin’s face. \nd. STAGE #3 – HATE – Doesn’t refer to hatred but rather choosing or preferring something else over God. \n2. How do we break it?\na. Realize the power we have – Unfortunately many people never read the rest of the verse that says, “but showing mercy to thousands of generations who love me.” This lets us know that not only can we break the cycles in our families but even more importantly we also have the power to create new ones that reflect God’s righteousness and pass those down to thousands of generations.  \nb. Stop Blaming our Family\ni. The bible says, “Why do you quote this proverb? The parents ate sour grapes and now the children’s teeth are set on edge.” Meaning because my parents did it then I’m prone to be like them. \nii. If you are a Christian we can no longer blame who we are and the decisions that we make on our family or our upbringing. We cannot use our family background as an excuse to stay the way we are because the Holy Spirit who lives in us now gives us the power we need to break any cycle or stronghold that has been deposited into our family. \nc. Get Accountability – James says to “confess your sins to one another so that you can be healed.” Even though we have the power to break any cycle we must also remember that because of what we were exposed to we will always be more strongly tempted in this area than others, which is why we need people to keep us accountable. \n\nSo, can Christians experience generational curses? NO. Can Christians be affected by the consequences of generational cycles?\n\n\nsee other keywords  search :\n\n1. Derek Prince - Breaking Generational Curses \n2.

    "title": "PHILIPPIANS 3 | \"IS KNOWING JESUS YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY?\"",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nThe Priority of Knowing Jesus\n\nIs knowing Jesus Christ the highest priority in your life? Today we’re gonna continue our study in Philippians chapter 3. \nHey guys we’re back for another exciting study in the book of Philippians chapter 3. If you missed the first three videos in this series I encourage you to go back and check those out. \n1. Paul’s Warning – 1-3\na. Paul begins this chapter with a stern warning to his readers to “watch out for those dogs.” So who is he calling “dogs” and who is he warning his gentile readers. So, understand that when Paul wrote this letter there was this group of Jewish Christians who were following Paul around and teaching Gentiles that in order for them to be saved they had to be circumcised first and obey all of the Jewish laws AND believe in Christ and only then will they be saved. \nb. So Paul warns them and says, “Don’t listen to what they say. You can’t do anything to earn your salvation\nc. So Paul says, “If you think that external achievements and success can bring you into a relationship with Jesus let me prove it to you by showing you \nd. These guys placed a high emphasis on religious effort and strict adherence to a code of laws. \ne. LESSON: Know the truth well enough to discern truth from error.\n2. Paul’s Testimony – 4-6\na. There is nothing outward that we can do that can bring us into an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. Let me prove it to you…\nb. They took so much spiritual pride in their religious pedigree that it forced Paul to rattle off his resume of achievements. \nc. I was circumcised on the 8th day – In other words I had godly parents who obeyed God.\nd. People of Israel – I’m a member of God’s chosen people\ne. Tribe of Benjamin – that was one of the bigger tribes\nf. Hebrew of Hebrews – I’m 100% Jewish not mixed with anything\ng. Pharisee – The highest religious group of Jews. They knew the OT backwards and forwards and took pride in how perfectly they obeyed it. \nh. Righteousness, flawless – Paul says, “there has NEVER been a even a blemish on my record.” Meaning either I obey the law perfectly or when I don’t I immediately get the right lamb, pigeon, dove or goat to atone for my sins. \ni. But in verse 7 Paul describes his transformation. He says, “But these assets I have come to regard as liabilities\nj. So in other words Paul says, “I’ve lived my entire life thinking that all of these accomplishments and advantages were gaining me favor and earning me points in God’s economy and now I have to revise my balance sheets because everything I thought was earning me points in God’s economy actually served to keep me further away from the goal of knowing Jesus Christ. \nk. LESSON: No amount of external success can replace intimacy with God. You can obey the bible, give money to the church, serve in ministry every night of the week, go to seminary and fill your head with a whole lot of theological knowledge and NONE of this replaces intimate time with Jesus. \n\n3. Paul’s Pursuit – 7-11\na. PERSON – Paul says, “I don’t just want to know about Jesus. I don’t want to sound like I know Him by quoting scriptures and a bunch of Christian clichés. I want to know Him intimately, which means both intellectually and experientially. \nb. POWER – I want to experience that same power that resurrected Jesus from the dead to be flowing through me. That power is strong enough to resist temptation, break strongholds and addictions in my life, empower me to share my faith when I’m afraid and don’t know what to say and empower me to use my gifts when I feel the weakest and most inadequate. \nc. PAIN – I’m even willing to know His pain if that will enable me to be more acquainted with who Jesus is and what He’s done for me. Most of us aren’t willing to pray that prayer. \nd. And then Paul goes on to finish by saying that he has not yet attained the intimacy with God that he desires but he presses forward every day to know Jesus more and more. \ne. LESSON: Intimacy with God is a lifelong journey and should be our greatest priority. It should be more important than our careers, our families and even our ministries.",

I personally know other people who have given their hard-earned money to churches and when they were in need whether it was financial or they or their loved ones were sick no one from the church came to visit them or support them and this has left them bitter and angry towards church. So, today I want to give you just a few things to consider if you’re dealing with church hurt.\n1. Don’t allow a bad experience to cause you to drift\na. When you get hurt by a church you will be strongly tempted to say, “Man forget it!” and just turn away from God and God’s people completely. God says, “Call on me IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE. So it’s in these times when God invites us to draw even closer to Him in prayer. \nb. And so if you find yourself in a season when you’re not going regularly, it’s even more important to maintain a regular prayer life and Bible study because I’m telling you, if not, you can quickly drift away from God.\n2. Extend Grace to your Leaders – What happens is we put our leaders and pastors on this pedestal and when they disappoint us we become crushed. Understand that they are human too. I don’t believe there is a more difficult job in the world than being a pastor. And depending on the size of the church it is very easy for a leader to oversee an email, a text message or even a request for help. So know that just because you were hurt by a church, it may not be that it was their intent to do it. \n3. Don’t judge all Churches by one church\na. It’s interesting to me that when we get hurt in relationships we eventually find the courage to get into another one and if it’s a good one we are glad we did because if we didn’t we would have missed out on the person God meant for us. \nb. In the same way no matter how many bad church experiences you’ve had, keep trying because there is the right church out there for you if you pray, use wisdom and ask God to lead you to it because if you don’t you could be short-circuiting your own blessings.\n4. Bring it to the Church’s Attention\na. The Bible says we should “speak the truth in love.” As difficult as it is and no matter how long ago it happened, the only way that church is going to improve is if you are bold enough to sit down with the leaders and clearly communicate your disappointment with them. \nb. When you do that you’re not only expediting the healing process in your own life but you are also helping the church be aware so that hopefully other people won’t have to experience the same pain you did.\nc. This leads me to my next point. As hurt as you may be…\n5. Resist the Urge to Speak Negatively About the Church – This is huge. What we are doing without even realizing it is slandering the church or a church leader because of our own personal experience, which in turn could cause someone else to miss out on what God wants to do in and through their life at that church.\n6. Forgive those who have hurt you\na. Remember that forgiveness for the Christian is not an option, it’s a command. You absolutely do not have the choice to remain bitter and unforgiving towards others. \nb. Forgiving them doesn’t mean that the pain is gone but it means that you can now pray for them, support them and even celebrate their success.\n\nSo guys I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been frustrated, bitter and angry with church or church leaders but I still go, give, support and serve because I know that the church is what Jesus is using to reach the world and I desperately want to be a part of anything that Jesus is building.\n\nsee this video other search:\n1. how to handle church pain\n2. how to heal from church hurt\n3. how to deal with disappointment\n4. what does it mean to backslide\n5. how to forgive your church",

    "title": "PHILIPPIANS 2 | \"WHAT DOES HUMILITY LOOK LIKE?\"",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nPHILIPPIANS 2 - What does HUMILITY look like?\n\nHey everyone welcome back to part 2 of our short series on the book of Philippians. We are taking one chapter a day and choosing a passage of scripture, making some observations and then looking at how we can apply this to our lives. Today we are in chapter 2 and I want to focus on verses 1-11. We are gonna break these 11 verses down into two parts. Verses 1-4 we will call “The Principle” and verses 5-11 we will call “The Picture.”\n\n1. The Principle (v. 1-4)\na. If you have any encouragement from being a Christian; if you’ve been comforted at all from the love of God, if you have the Spirit in you and if you have any tenderness or compassion in you then have the same mindset that Jesus Christ had. \nb. Do not be selfish; don’t do things with a selfish motivation\nc. Consider others as more important than yourself\nd. Don’t consider only things that are interesting to you but look into what is interesting and important to others.\n2. The Picture (v. 5-11)\na. Now Paul says, “I’ve given you the principles but now I want to show you what this looks like by giving you a picture of selflessness and humility.”  \nb. He begins by saying, “In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus.” So he is encouraging us to apply what we are getting ready to read to all of our relationships such as our family, spouse, children, co-workers, church members, etc. \nc. Mindset #1 – Sacrifice – “rather, He made Himself nothing” – The Bible teaches that Jesus was in heaven, a totally perfect environment. But He chose to sacrifice His perfect environment and position as the son of God to come to earth and be a carpenter. He was willing to give up something that was valuable to Him. \ni. QUESTION: If we say we want to be like Jesus we must challenge ourselves in terms of how willing we are you to sacrifice your time or your money for God and for those we are in relationship with? \nd. Mindset #2 – Servant – “by taking the very nature of a servant…” – It’s enough that Jesus was willing to sacrifice but He didn’t come to sit on a throne and have people serve Him. Instead He was always serving others (teaching them, healing them, raising from the dead, feeding them, washing their feet, etc.) \ni. QUESTION: Do I look to be served more than I look for opportunities to serve others? Do I see myself as being above doing certain things when people ask me or do I have the attitude of a servant?\ne. Mindset #3 – Submission – “by becoming obedient to death.” – So what we see here is that in order for Jesus to come to earth He first had to be submissive to His Father. Now remember, Jesus is just as much God as God the Father and yet He submitted His will for the will of the Father. \ni. QUESTION: How willing are you to submit to people in relationships (husband, wife at times, your boss, it could be the flight attendant on the plane who tells you to put your laptop away) or do you always have to be the one in control having people submit to you?\nf. Mindset #4 – Suffering – “even death on a cross” – Jesus was willing to suffer so that we might have eternal life. Sometimes we are taught that the Christian life is supposed to be easy but Jesus’ example shows that at times we may have to suffer.\ni. QUESTION: How much are you willing to suffer in your relationships with other people?\n\nSo, what does it look like to be like Jesus? It involves being willing to sacrifice what’s valuable to you, serving others, a submissive attitude and a willingness to suffer if need be and the blessing is that it says that God exalted Jesus Christ. And if He rewarded Jesus for having these attitudes I trust He will do the same for you!",

    "title": "PROSPERITY GOSPEL EXPOSED!! | Does God Promise Health and Wealth?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nprosperity gospel exposed  Does God promise us health and wealth in the Bible? That’s our topic today on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone, my name is Allen Parr. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every single Tuesday and today we are hitting on one of the most controversial topics out here, “Does God Promise us Health and Wealth?” You know the Bible says that in the last days people will flock to teachers who are preaching what their itching ears want to hear.” But today I want to give you 5 problems that I have with this prosperity gospel. \n\n1. Inconsistent with the Bible\na. On the contrary God promises that Christians will experience tribulation (Acts 14:22, suffering (Rom. 8:17) and even persecution (2 Tim. 3:12).  \nb. The Bible even references “believers who are poor.”\nc. The Bible says that it’s not until heaven that God will wipe away our pain, our tears and our sorrow indicating that we can’t expect “our best life” on earth but rather in eternity.\nd. Finally, as you’ve heard me say before, be careful about taking isolated verses or isolated events that happen in scripture and saying that this must be the normative experience for every believer. \n\n2. Switches the Focus – The biggest issue with what is called the prosperity gospel, besides the fact that it is not biblical, is that it switches the focus from what we can and should be doing for God to focusing on what God needs to do for us which puts Him in the place of some spiritual genie who only exists to make us happy. Instead of saying, “God, in whatever state I find myself, how can I bring the most glory to your name?” \n\n3. It sets people up for disappointment with God – If churches are telling their members that God has promised them health and wealth then what happens is when that is not their reality or the reality of their loved ones either they are told that they didn’t have enough faith to receive what God had for them or they are left to believe that God reneged on His promises; neither of which are true.   \n\n4. Limited to the Western World – 80% of the world lives on less than $10.00 a day and many of whom are stricken with disease due to lack of clean water and very limited health care. This is not their fault. It’s just the reality they were born into. So this false teaching sends the message that these Christians who are born in 3rd world countries are somehow less spiritual and less blessed than those who have access to wealth and adequate health care.  \n\n5. This is not consistent with the lives of Jesus and the Apostles\na. The great Apostle Paul admits to having a thorn in his flesh, which most scholars agree was a physical infirmity that limited Paul’s ministry. \nb. The Bible says that Jesus was a carpenter, which was not considered an affluent career. \nc. It says that he was a traveling preacher who didn’t have a place to sleep and primarily lived off of the benevolence of others. \nd. Finally it says that His life was characterized by pain, sorrow and ultimately crucifixion.\ne. Jesus went on to say that we, His servants, are not above our Master and if they persecuted Him we could expect the same.  \n\nSo guys, I’m not in any way suggesting that God doesn’t or can’t heal us or bless us with wealth or that God wants us to be poor, broke down and sick? But what I am suggesting today is that if for whatever reason that becomes our reality God’s desire is that we glorify Him just as much as we would if we were living in perfect health and wealth. \n\n\n\n\nJesus said to beware of false prophets and false teachers. The Bible also says that in the last days people will gather teachers around to hear what their itching ears want to hear. In other words, there will be a mass of people flocking to preachers and teachers who say the very things they desperately want to hear. And who doesn’t want to hear that they will be healthy and wealthy? And while that sounds good what does the Bible really say?\n\nsee this video other search:: \n1.

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nAnd so today I want to make a few observations from chapter 1. \nThere are two things that we can learn from Paul that become evident in this passage. First, he was a man of PRAYER.\n1. Prayer – v. 1-11\na. Consistently (v. 3-4)\nb. Specifically\ni. Be loving\nii. Increase in their knowledge of God\niii. More depth of insight\niv. Discernment\nv. Purity\nc. APPLICATION: Do you just pray for people once and then stop or do you pray consistently for them? And when you pray are you lazy with your prayers or do you pray specifically for them like Paul does for the Philippian church? \n\nAnd so the first 11 verses are all about PRAYER. But now in verses 12-26 we switch and \n\n2. Perspective – v. 12-26\na. Paul had the right perspective on his PROBLEMS – (v.12-13)\ni. Paul sees prison not as an OBSTACLE but an OPPORTUNITY – \nii. Instead of feeling sorry for himself and getting mad at God, Paul uses turns his prison cell into a mission field and two things happen.\n1. People in Rome hear the gospel and get saved that otherwise would not.\n2. Other Christians become more confident to share the gospel after seeing Paul endure and respond to his imprisonment. \niii. APPLICATION: \n1. Don’t get so caught up in your own personal prison that you don’t see the opportunities around you to make a difference in other people’s lives.\n2. People are watching you handle your trials. \nb. Paul had the right perspective on MINISTRY\ni. Finally, Paul says in verse 15…\nii. There was a group of Christian preachers who were glad that Paul was in prison because they were jealous of Paul’s influence and platform and this took the attention off of Paul and gave them the opportunity to develop their own platforms. But even knowing this Paul is like, “whether they preach with good motives or bad motives I ain’t gonna sweat it because at the end of the day the gospel of Jesus Christ is still being preached!” \niii. This teaches us that Paul had a kingdom perspective and not an empire perspective. \niv. Paul says, “Even though these people are preaching the gospel out of envy thinking they are adding pain to my situation, whether it’s me or them the main thing is that people are hearing the gospel and people are getting saved. \nc. Paul had the right perspective on his LIFE – (v. 21) – Paul says in verse 21, “For me this is a win-win situation. If I live that gives me more time to tell other people about Christ, so I’m good! If I die then I get to be with Christ in heaven.” \ni. Paul wasn’t so connected to his life here on earth that he wasn’t able to see the bigger picture. \n\n\nSo guys we are just getting started with this short book I encourage you to read it along with me. I’d love to hear your observations from chapter 1 or any questions you might have so please leave them in the comments section below.

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHOOK:  Hey guys I’m so excited! Today we are going to start our first book study on the BEAT. Stay tuned we’re gonna jump right in!\n\nINTRODUCTION: Hey everyone, today we are doing something a little different. Over the next four Fridays we are going to be studying the book of Philippians together. \n\nWHY: Because it’s a short book. It’s easy to read. AND it’s packed with all sorts of application. \n\nAlright, so any time you study a book of the bible it’s critical that you check out the background info first. So here we go…\n\nBACKGROUND: \n1. CHURCH: The church at Philippi was founded by the Apostle Paul on his second missionary journey in A.D. 49 (Acts 16:1-40).\n2. Somewhere along the line Paul gets thrown in prison.\n3. Someone sends word to the church in Philippi that Paul was in prison in Rome\n4. WHY? – One day while Paul was in prison one of the main leaders of that church named Epaphroditus traveled some 800 miles to bring to Paul three things…\na. A financial gift from the church that he wants to hand deliver from the church\nb. Report on how things were going in the church\nc. To express the church’s concern for Paul situation in prison.\n5. WHEN – And so in response to this visit Paul wrote this letter from prison and sent Epaphroditis back to Philippi to hand deliver his letter to them.  \n\nPURPOSE: SO WHY DID HE WRITE? \n• To thank them for the financial gift they had given him\n• Provide spiritual wisdom to them as a church\n• To update them on his situation to tell them, “hey I’m in prison. Thank you for the prayers but I’m doing well.”\n• He wanted to express his love and concern for this church and let them know that he is praying for them.\n\nTHEME: The major theme of the book is JOY! The word joy, rejoice or some form of that word is used 16 times in the book. And so the lesson here is that even though Paul is in prison he wants to demonstrate to his original readers and ultimately to us how it is possible to experience true authentic joy and happiness in spite of your personal circumstances.\n\nSO, your assignment is to read Philippians chapter 1.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\n3 Lessons We Can Learn From The Rio Olympics\n\nIf God were to award a gold medal, how can we be sure we would win?\n\nINTRODUCTION: Hey everyone, my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for joining me today. Every Tuesday we release a new video and this week is the second week of the 2016 Olympics and if you’re anything like me you’ve been glued to the TV watching all sorts of sports you would normally not watch just because it is Olympic season! So today I want to take a look at three qualities we desperately need to possess to win God’s gold medal. \n\nBACKGROUND: In the city of Corinth every two years they hosted something very similar to the Olympic Games. So, knowing his audience is well familiar with athletics Paul uses this analogy and gives us three things to consider about rewards.  \n\n1. Determination – 1 Cor. 9:24\na. What makes Olympic athletes so great is that they don’t allow injuries, failures or haters deter them from reaching their goal. \nb. Mo Farrah fell down, got back up and still won his race. What’s the lesson?  \nc. So, in the same way if we want to win we cannot allow fear, fatigue failure, distractions, discouragements, or disappointments or any other temporary setback to derail you from fulfilling God’s purpose for your life. \nd. Why? \ne. Because Paul says Olympians do all of this for rewards that will eventually perish. But the rewards we get for God last for all eternity which is why we should always focus more on our calling than we do our career.  \n2. Discipline\na. You can be determined and have all the passion in the world but you won’t win in life unless you have discipline. \nb. Paul is saying that these athletes train several hours a day to be great. \nc. You must be willing to put in the time every day to work on your business, craft, your gift, your idea, etc.  \ni. What do you want to accomplish? (write it down, make it clear, be specific, set goals, time frames, etc.) – VISION\nii. How do you get there? STRATEGY\niii. And how will you know if you got there? ASSESSMENT\nd. Every day you should be doing something relates back to one of those questions. \ne. This leads to my 3rd point which is….\n3. Direction\na. Notice that gymnasts aren’t trying to be swimmers and \nb. In the same way if we want to win we need to find that one thing that we know God has called us to and then give ourselves COMPLETELY to it. \nc. How do you do that? \nd. Let me give you three questions to point you in the right direction. \ni. What gifts do you have?\nii. What pain in your past can you help other people work through?\niii. What have other people consistently affirmed in your life?\ne. The more things you are trying to be great at and focus on the less effective you’ll be for all of them. \n\nNow I wish the passage ended there but there is a fourth D and that is DISQUALIFICATION. So Paul says that if we don’t discipline our bodies to exercise self-control and to deny our fleshly desires we can sadly be disqualified from receiving God’s best for our lives.",

    "title": "Marriage Killers | Things that will Destroy Your Marriage",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nDo you know what destroys marriages? Stick around and find out!\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for hanging out with me today. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every Tuesday and today we are talking about things that destroy our marriages!\n\nWe’re are going to take a look at one of my favorite passages of scripture Eph. 4:25-29. The context here is that Paul is describing what he calls the old man, which refers to our old way of thinking and living BEFORE CHRIST, with our new man, which refers to who we are now that we have the Spirit of God living within us. And so he begins to list several things that should not be a part of our new nature. And so I want to give you three things from this passage that will absolutely destroy your marriage. \n\n1. Dishonesty – Eph. 4:25 – Paul says, “Therefore each of you must put off FALSEHOOD and speak truth to your neighbor.”\na. Exaggerating\nb. Making excuses to save face when we are caught doing something we didn’t think the other person knew about\nc. Making False promises\nd. Not following through\ne. Lying\nf. Damages trust and remember that trust takes years to build, seconds to break and forever to repair. \n\n2. Anger – Eph. 4:26\na. Notice Paul says here to “BE ANGRY.” He’s not suggesting that we never get angry but rather that we don’t sin when we get angry. How do we do that? \nb. One of the ways is to remain angry and refuse to resolve the conflict. \nc. Paul gives us a time frame in which to resolve it (not to be taken literally) which is by the end of one day.\nd. Then more importantly he tells us why we should resolve conflict quickly. It’s because when we don’t we are giving the devil an opportunity to tempt us to hold a grudge, harbor unforgiveness, become bitter and think negative thoughts about the other person. \ne. Remember the principle. When you and your spouse aren’t talking to each other, the devil is speaking to both of you. \n\n3. Unhealthy Communication\na. Notice four things here. First, Paul describes it as unwholesome which could refer to criticism, cursing, outbursts of anger, being judgmental, etc. Any of that kills your marriage. \nb. Second, be careful to use our words that build each other up. \nc. Third, it says “according to the need of the moment” meaning we need to discern not just what we say but when we say it. [TIMING IS EVERYTHING].\nd. Finally, the tone we use when we say it, “he says it should give ‘grace’ to those who hear.” Some of us have some really good things to say but because our tone and our timing is off it’s not received. \n\n4. Unforgiveness - Notice Paul says here, \"To forgive JUST AS Christ has forgiven you.\"\n\nSo if you’re dating, engaged, married or in any type of relationship you value I pray that will replace dishonesty with integrity, anger with conflict resolution and unhealthy communication with encouragement, affirmation and speaking positive things into the life of your partner. You start doing that and I trust that our relationships will be what God intended for them to be.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nDOES THE BIBLE SUPPORT SLAVERY?\n\nDuring the darkest era in the history of our country Christian slave owners would use the Bible to support slavery. But is that what the Bible teaches?\n\nHey everyone, my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every single Tuesday and today we are touching on a very controversial and misunderstood topic, which is, “Does the Bible Support Slavery?” And so in this video I want so share with you 7 facts about slavery in the Bible.  \n\nUnderstand that slavery in the Bible was not the same as it was in our country\n\n1. God Did Not Establish Slavery but Regulated it\na. In other words just as there are laws on murder, divorce and theft (all things God clearly does not condone), God also knew the hearts of people were evil and had to establish laws to regulate slavery to ensure that slaves were treated properly. \nb. Actually the exact opposite is true. God only creates laws to regulate evil not good. \n2. The Purpose of Slavery \na. The purpose of slavery in the Bible was the help the poor survive.\nb. This is the exact opposite of what our country practiced for nearly 400 years. This leads…\n3. In the Hebrew culture slavery was primarily volitional – Lev. 25:39\na. The most common way a person became a slave was if they were in debt. They would either sell themselves or their children’s services to pay off the debt – Lev. 25:39\nb. Others would choose to be slaves to have all of their basic needs met by their master. These are called “bondservants” – Exodus 21:5-6. This leads to the next point which is… \n4. Kidnapping was outlawed and punishable by DEATH – Ex. 21:16 (see also 1 Tim. 1:10) – Taking someone against their will and making them your slave was against the law and the will of God. \n5. Slavery was limited to 6 years – Ex. 21:2\na. It was never God’s will for the rich to overtake the poor. \nb. On the contrary this system allowed for people to work off their debt in a safe and loving environment. However, after 6 years the slave would go free and the master was commanded to give something to them and send them on their way which is contrasted to what our country practiced. This leads me to my sixth point…\n6. Slave masters were to treat slaves with respect\na. They were commanded to treat them as “employees” and not as slaves – Lev. 25:39.\nb. If they killed their slaves they themselves would face punishment – Ex. 21:20\nc. One of the ways to do this was to maintain the family unit which is a principle slave owners in America violated – Lev. 25:41; Ex. 21:3\nd. Finally, a master was buying the services not the servant. God was very clear that no man can “own” another man because we were created in God’s image and everyone belongs to God – Lev. 25:55.\n7. Slavery was not based on race – Nowhere in the Bible does it condone enslaving a race of people only individuals on a voluntary basis. \n\nSo, does the Bible make concessions for and have laws that regulate the practice of slavery? I’d have to say yes it does. Does it support the degradation and mistreatment of slaves as was practiced in our country? NO it does not. \nI’ll leave two links below in the comments section\n\nFOR FURTHER READING: https://answersingenesis.org/bible-questions/doesnt-the-bible-support-slavery/\n\nAnd...\n\nhttp://www.compellingtruth.org/slavery-Old-Testament.html",

    "title": "Seven Reasons Why We Need the Holy Spirit",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWHO IS THE HOLY SPIRIT?\n\nWe know about God the Father. We know what Jesus did on the cross. But who is the Holy Spirit?  Who is the Holy Spirit and what role does He play in our lives? \n\nHey everyone, my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. And today we are answering the question, “Who is the Holy Spirit?” And “What role does He Play in my life?” So, I want to give you 7 things the Holy Spirit actively does in your life but beforehand I want to point out two disclaimers. \n\nDISCLAIMERS\n1. The Holy Spirit is not an “it” or a “force” – The Holy Spirit is the 3rd person of the trinity. This means that we should not refer to Him as an it, like He’s some force (may the force be with you). The Bible says we can grieve Him, quench Him and we can lie to Him, He talks to us, etc. The Holy Spirit is just as much God as God the Father and God the Son but has a different role or function. God the Father is the source of all things. Jesus was sent to die on the cross for our sins and the Holy Spirit has several functions that we will discussion.  \n2. You don’t have to wait for Him, tarry for Him or pray to get Him, God gives Him to indwell every believer at the moment of salvation. 1 Cor. 12:7; \n\nWHAT DOES HE DO?\n1. Salvation – The first role He plays in your life occurs before salvation. He is the One that is working on your heart convincing you that you are a sinner in need of total forgiveness. That need for something beyond what this world is offering is ignited within you by the Holy Spirit. \n\n2. Convicts us – John 14:26; John 16:8-11 – One of His main roles is to act as a warning light and convict us when we get off track. This is the reason why you can still sin after you get saved but you just can’t enjoy your sin anymore because now the Holy Spirit Who lives within you is constantly convicting you. He does this primarily by reminding you of what God’s will is for your life. Before you sin He will remind you. After you sin He will convict you.\n\n3. Teaches us – John 14:26 – When you are studying the Bible one of His jobs is to pull the scales off of your eyes and teach you what the Bible is saying and help you apply it to your life. Theologians call this “illumination” the process by which God shines His light on the word of God and applies it to your spirit specifically for where you are at that moment. We call this illumination when God opens your eyes to understand His word in a way you’ve never understood it before and then to apply it to your life so that it goes from your head (where you understand it) to your heart (where you believe it) and finally to your hands (where you live it out). \n\n4. Reminds you – The Bible says, “He will bring back to your remembrance…” God can’t bring back to your remembrance something that was never there! Which is why it’s critical that you get into the word of God because it is from your spiritual reservoir that the Spirit will draw from when you need to know God’s perspective on something whether it may be temptation or a decision you need to make. This is why you never need to be afraid of sharing your faith because He has promised to give you the right things to say at that time. \n\n5. Counselor – The Holy Spirit acts as a counselor and a guide throughout life. In other words He helps us make wise decisions. For instance when you’re in a heated debate you will often hear Him say, “Say that!” or “No, don’t say that!” \n\n6. Produces Fruit – Gal. 5:16 – Finally, the longer you are a Christian the more fruit the Holy Spirit will enable you to bear. One of His main functions is to help you live out and increase in this fruit every day.\n\n7. Empowers you to use your Spiritual Gifts – Acts 1:8 – The Holy Spirit infuses you with power especially when you are feeling inadequate and enables you to use your gifts on a level outside of your normal strength. \n\nSo, between God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the most overlooked and often misunderstood member of the trinity and yet He does the most hands-on work in terms of making us look more like Jesus every day.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat does it mean to be unequally yoked? That’s coming up next on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every Tuesday and today we are answering the question, “What does it mean” or “what does it look like to be unequally yoked?” This idea comes from 2 Cor. 6:14 where Paul says, “Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers.” So today I want to talk about what that means and then give you four ways you can tell you’re in an unequally yoked relationship. \n\nCONCEPT: Paul uses the imagery of two oxen whose necks are connected to one another with a yoke. Farmers would “yoke” animals together to plow fields or carry heavy loads. They were taught never to yoke together say a horse with an ox because they differed in size, strength, purpose and capacity. So because they are connected with a yoke, one of the animals would overtake and control the other taking it in the wrong direction resulting in the field never getting plowed. \n\n1. Different Spiritual Maturity \na. I’m talking more specifically to the women here because you’ll often see a woman in church without her husband but you’ll rarely see a man in church without his family if he is a spiritual leader. \nb. You’re gonna find yourself consistently caught between obeying God and submitting to your husband. \nc. Either you’re gonna grow spiritually which means you won’t be able to share the most important part of you with your husband because he won’t be able to understand. Your with someone who can’t even relate to the most important part of you. \nd. Or what normally happens is your spiritual growth will be stunted because of his. \ne. Can your mate eventually come around and be the spiritual leader you desire? Yes, but it’s rare and we are advised to avoid such cases. \nf. Now there is one exception here and that is if the man is 1) showing tangible signs of investing in his spiritual growth and 2) Teachable\n2. Different Values\na. MONEY – You want to give money to the church; they want to buy new furniture\nb. CHURCH INVOLVEMENT – You want to serve in church; they think you’re at the church too much\nc. You want to go to church together; they would rather stay home\nd. DECISION MAKING – You believe the bible is the final authority on making decisions. They believe it’s an old antiquated book with no relevance. They have a different way of making decisions. \ne. PRAYER – You want to pray together. They don’t see the point or don’t know how. \nf. You want to use vacation to go on a missions trip; they don’t see the value\ng. RAISING KIDS – Raising Kids\nh. MORALS – When someone consistently pressures or tempts you to go against what you morally believe is wrong you’re unequally yoked.\ni. All of these different values can cause friction and tension and ultimately break down the relationship. \n3. Different Purposes\na. I’m not talking about two Christians who have different purposes but both of them are under the umbrella of Christian service. \nb. I’m not moreso about one person who feels called to Christian service and the other feels called to corporate, entertainment, sports, etc. \nc. Both of them are going to give all their time, energy, passion and money to what they feel called to and eventually their paths will take them in different directions creating tension and friction in the relationship. \nd. Or at some point one of them is going to have to sacrifice what they feel “called” to for the good of the relationship which often times leads to deep-seated resentment. \n\n\nSo can two Christians be unequally yoked? Well, the Bible nowhere discourages us from marrying another Christian. However, the bigger the gap in spiritual maturity the more differences you’ll have to work through in marriage.",

    "title": "Three Ways to Measure Spiritual Growth",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHow can you know that you are growing spiritually?\n\nHey everyone welcome back my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every Tuesday and today I want to give you 3 questions that I want to encourage you to ask yourself regularly to be sure that you are growing spiritually and they come from Hebrews 5:12-15. And the first is…\n\n1. AM I A CONSUMER OR A CONTRIBUTOR? (v. 12a)\na. Notice the writer says, “by this time you ought to be teachers…” \nb. The Greek word for time is “chronos” which refers to a span of time. The Greek word for “ought” means “obligation.”  \nc. So he is essentially saying, “because of the amount of time that has elapsed since you’ve been a Christian you are obligated to now be teaching others.” \nd. So my question is, “Am I coming to church every week primarily to consume or am I contributing by teaching others and sharing my wisdom, experiences, successes, failures and contributing to the disciple-making process? \ne. And so the first way to know you are growing spiritually is if you are actively making disciples and pouring yourself into someone else. \n2. AM I EATING MEAT OR DRINKING MILK?\na. Notice he says, “You need milk; not solid food. For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.”\nb. Milk demonstrates dependence. In the same way that a baby needs their mother for milk a young baby Christian cannot feed themselves independently from their pastors and teachers. \nc. Milk is a picture of the elementary teachings about the Christian faith (v. 12). It’s what every baby needs in order to grow. What the author is saying is that’s good at the beginning of your walk as a Christian. But there comes a time in the natural course of spiritual growth that you should become interested in learning the deeper aspects of the Christian faith which by the way will help you become more equipped to be a contributor rather than a consumer.\nd. Finally milk is pre-digested food. By the time you get to church that pastor has already eaten, chewed on and digested that food and is ready to give it to you. God wants you to have the same experience the pastors and teachers are having. He wants to give you fresh food and a fresh revelation for yourself. \n3. AM I ABLE TO DISCERN TRUTH FROM ERROR?\na. Notice he says, “But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by CONSTANT PRACTICE to distinguish good from evil.” \nb. Am I able to spot false teaching when I hear it? Notice that the writer says the ONLY way to do this is by “constant use” or “practice.” There are so many false teachings in our churches today. \nc. And the best way to spot a counterfeit bill is not to study all of the counterfeit bills but rather to study the true dollar bill so that anything you see that is different you automatically know is counterfeit.\nd. If you want to be discerning don’t spend time studying other religions. Study the word of God and then you’ll be able to quickly discern truth from error because when we don’t do this…\ne. Paul says that when we do not have discernment we are “like infants tossed back and forth by every wind of doctrine .” [a baby will put anything in its mouth]\nf. Your ability to discern false teaching when you hear it is an indication that you are growing spiritually.\n\nHey guys I talk about this subject a lot on my channel because I am convinced that Bible study is the primary way a Christian grows spiritually. I’ve written some blogs, eBooks and done some videos all designed to maximize your understanding of God’s word that I believe you’ll find helpful. I’ll leave the links in the comments section below. I’d love to hear which of these three questions you are struggling with personally leave it in the comments section below.",

    "title": "HOW TO RESPOND WHEN PEOPLE MISTREAT YOU!",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWHAT TO DO WHEN PEOPLE KEEP MISTREATING YOU\n\nHow do you respond when someone continually mistreats you again and again? That’s coming up next on the BEAT.\n\nHey what’s up everybody my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every Tuesday and today I want answer the question, “What do you do? How do you respond when someone close to you continues to mistreat you whether it may be at work, at church or even at home?” In Rom. 12 Paul gives us 6 clear steps on how to handle it. Number 1\n\n1. Speak Well & Don’t Curse them – Paul says, “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.” As difficult as it is try and find something positive to say about them, wish the best for them, pray for them, while at the same time resisting the temptation to gossip about them, ruin their reputation or speak negatively about them.  \n\n2. Set an Example for others – Paul says, “Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.” Other people are watching you and when you take the high road and consistently seek good for those who mistreat you are setting the example of great character for others to emulate.”\n\n3. Initiate Peace – Notice he says, “If it is possible [meaning sometimes it isn’t], as far as it depends on you [meaning you can’t control the other person; only your own actions], live at peace with everyone.” Even if the person you are in conflict with is wrong God still says you do EVERYTHING in your power to initiate peace in the relationships because if the relationship doesn’t work you can say that you did your part to seek reconciliation. \n\n4. Leave room for God – Next he says, “Do not take revenge…but LEAVE ROOM for God’s wrath.” When we seek to get even ourselves I believe this verse implies that God takes His hands off of it and says, “well if you think you can do a better job then you handle it.” Take your hands off of the situation. God says it belongs to Him anyway. Leave room for God to do KNOWING by faith that no injustice or mistreatment escapes His view.\n\n5. Do Something Good for them – Paul says, “On the contrary, when your enemy is hungry, feed him…when you do you will heap burning coals on his head.” When you do something good for someone who doesn’t deserve it your good actions will often times cause them to feel convicted and ashamed because they will naturally compare their mistreatment towards you to your good forcing them to come face to face with their own behavior.\n\n6. Don’t Allow Someone Else to Change your Character – Finally, Paul says, “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” In other words, be careful NOT to allow someone else’s evil and mistreatment to turn you into an evil person all because you want to get revenge because when you do you not only have become just as low as them but you’ve also given someone else control over your own emotions. \n\nSo guys, you may be in a difficult situation at work, at church, or even in your own home. I want to encourage you today to do what God is requiring of you and to trust God’s word because it works. By faith, resist the urge to get even and trust that in God’s timing He will not only bless you for responding with character but He will also deal with the person who is mistreating you.",

    "title": "Do Prophets Still Exist Today?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nDo Prophets Still Exist Today?\n\nIn other words can God still use someone to tell you something about your future? That’s coming up next on the BEAT.  \n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. Here on the BEAT we release a brand new video every Tuesday and today we are talking about the controversial subject of prophecy and whether this gift still exists today. And so I want to give you 3 things that I see that are different about prophets in the Bible and modern-day prophets then end by answering the question “what should you do when someone comes to you and says ‘I have a word from God for you’”\n\n1. Prophets confronted SIN and called to REPENTANCE\na. The prophets of the OT challenged the people head-on on sin issues that they were dealing with in that day (whether it may be immorality, adultery, idolatry, oppression of the poor, obstruction of justice, etc.) and then called the people back to repentance. \nb. These guys were HATED by the people and often times got stoned because their message consisted of things people DIDN’T want to hear rather than telling them what they DID want to hear\nc. This is a very different message than what we hear today where modern-day prophets often avoid confronting our generation on issues of sexual sin, adultery, divorce, abortion and instead focus more on things they know people do want to hear such as pronouncing blessing, prosperity, healing and financial breakthrough over people’s lives.  \n   \n2. Prophets were SPECIFIC not GENERAL\na. You ever go to a church service and someone who claims to be a prophet says “there’s someone in here with cancer? And that could be like half the people in there.” \nb. There is someone sitting on the third row who went to the doctor on Thursday and got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer who has been given 3 months to live. \nc. Prophets in the Bible were very careful to make sure that they were truly Deut. 18:20 says, “Stoned which means they were very careful to make sure they were speaking on behalf of God” which means we need to be very careful about saying that we “have a word from God” for someone or “God told me to tell you…”\nd. So, when you are assessing whether someone is a prophet or not make they are specific with their prophecies. \ne. Accurate – they came to pass 100% of the time. There was no hit or miss with a true prophet.\nf. And the didn’t depend on whether the people receiving it had enough faith to believe it. \n\n3. Prophets were not MOTIVATED by MONEY\na. You got so many prophets today who will charge people an arm and a leg to attend a conference knowing how desperate people are to hear a word from God. Then when they get into the conference they promise people a financial blessing if they further sow a seed into their ministry. \nb. The prophets in the bible lived and led very humble lives which is much different than much of what we see today. WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID…\n\nWhat should you do when someone speaks a word of prophecy over you?\na. Receive it because it could very well be that God is trying to get a message to you through them – 1 Thess. 5:20-21\nb. Check it against the Scripture because God never contradicts Himself and the Bible says He is not the author of confusion. He will never tell a prophet something to tell you – 1 Jn. 4:1\nc. Ask God to confirm it to you – I’ve seen people adjust their entire lives and make decisions based on what a self-proclaimed prophet told them only to later discover that person didn’t hear from God but it was too late. \nd. Ask God for wisdom – James 1:5\n\nSo, does the gift of prophecy still exist today? I don’t see anywhere in the Bible that clearly says it doesn’t but the problem is you may have to sift through a few false prophets who will lead you astray to get to a true prophet.",

    "title": "Why Good People Have Affairs",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWHY GOOD PEOPLE HAVE AFFAIRS\n\nHow does a person go from being happily married to having a full-blown affair? That’s the question we want to answer today on the BEAT. \n\nThe number of marriages where one or both spouses admit to having either a physical or emotional affair is 41%. Why so high? Well today I want to give you 5 reasons why good people have affairs. \n\n\n1. They Lack a Fear of God\na. The Bible says, “The fear of the Lord is the BEGINNING of wisdom.” So even if your marriage is horrible and everything in you wants to cheat, fearing how God is going to discipline you keeps you from making a decision you’ll regret later. \n2. Assuming someone else can make them happy (read Lk. 15:\na. So what happens is this. A single person is unhappy with themselves. They meet someone and fall in love and that person makes them happy. But once the infatuation wears off they become bored in their marriage and they revert back to who they really are which is someone who is unhappy. But in their minds they equate their unhappiness with a deficiency in their spouse. So they crave that feeling of happiness again and go out and find someone else who will make them happy. And they do…for a short time until they revert back to being unhappy again. \nb. This is a dangerous deceptive pattern because instead of addressing the emptiness within they seek happiness in a relationship not realizing that it is impossible for anyone to make you happy. \n3. Comparing your spouse’s WORST to someone else’s BEST\na. The problem with doing this is what we see in other people is only what they want us to see not realizing that they too come with their own set of deficiencies but because you don’t see them on the surface it’s easy to assume they are not there. \nb. The more you compare your spouse’s WORST qualities with what appears to be someone else’s BEST qualities the more you will be tempted to cheat. The way to combat this is to constantly remind yourself of all of the wonderful things that your spouse brings to your life.\n4.  Not cutting off “innocent” friendships\na. You know you’re attracted to someone and so instead of cutting it off you play with it and flirt with it because in your mind it’s innocent not realizing that the more we entertain it the more connected you become and the more connected you are the more difficult it is to sever the relationship. \nb. So when you’re having issues with your spouse you’ve left the door open for the enemy to use this relationship as a temptation to cheat.\n5. No accountability – living a life of secrecy – Prov. 18:1\na. Many affairs could be prevented by early detection. In other words if you have godly accountability, they can often times perceive that you’re flirting with the idea of an affair.   \nb. But many people refuse to live in community, become open and transparent with someone else and give someone else the right to ask them the hard questions.  \n\nAffairs can have devastating long-lasting effects on your spouse in terms of pain and your children as well. So if you are struggling in your marriage I want to encourage you to consider the long-term consequences of such a decision.",

    "title": "What Does it Mean to Step Out on Faith?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat Does it Mean to Step Out On Faith?\nHOOK: What does it mean to step out on faith? \n\nINTRODUCTION: Hey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel here on the BEAT we release a brand new video every single Tuesday and today we want to answer the question, “What exactly does it mean for someone to step out on faith?” And for this we turn our attention to the greatest chapter on faith Hebrews 11 and I want to zoom in on one man named Abraham and we pick up his story in verse 8. \n\n1. Faith obeys the WORD FROM GOD – “By faith Abraham, WHEN CALLED.”\na. I want you to notice something here that many people miss. \nb. Noah – The Bible says Noah “was warned” about the flood, so as a result by faith he went and built an ark. \nc. Abraham – It says Abraham “was called” so as a result he left everything… \nd. These men didn’t just come up with an idea, make a major life decision and say, “GOD I’M STEPPING OUT ON FAITH NOW BLESS IT!” Their decision was preceded by a word from God.\ne. So if you don’t sense a strong leading by God Himself then stepping out on faith is not for you. \n2. Faith is willing to DELAY GRATIFICATION – vs. 8 – “He would later receive…”\na. When you step out on faith you must be willing to accept the fact that what you want to receive from God may or may not happen for some time. \nb. Abraham – 25 years\nc. Joseph – 13 years\nd. So if you’re someone who is looking for an immediate blessing then stepping out on faith is not for you.  \n3. Faith moves FORWARD without all of the FACTS – “even though he did not know where he was going.”\na. Stepping out on faith means you understand that God only gives you enough information to see right in front of you and He often times conceals the details about the journey along the way. \nb. So if you’re someone who needs the facts before moving forward stepping out on faith is not for you. \n4. Faith is willing to leave that which is COMFORTABLE – “like a stranger in a foreign country”\na. This one is so difficult for many of us. We value comfort, predictability and certainty. \nb. The problem with that is if we value it too much we will never see God’s power.\nc. When God calls you to an act of faith you must be willing to leave your family, a romantic relationship, a job, a church, etc. and this is why you must be sure that God is leading you because these are major decisions with major implications that could alter your entire life. \nd. Don’t make them without prayer and seeking wise counsel. \ne. So if you’re someone who values COMFORT then stepping out on faith is not for you.  \n5. Faith believes in the Supernatural power of God – vs. 11\na. “Faith COMMANDS you to do something you’ve CONVINCED yourself can never be done.”\nb. If you can do what you believe God is calling you to do without God then it’s not faith. \nc. So if you’re someone who only believes in the NATURAL then stepping out on faith is not for you. \n\nI don’t know what decisions you may have coming up but I want to encourage you to pray, seek wise counsel and if you believe that God Himself is leading you then step out on faith and trust that God will lead you every step of the way.",

    "title": "Does God Support Polygamy?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nDoes God Support Polygamy?\n\nWhat do Abraham, Jacob, Esau, David, and Solomon have in common? All of these great men of God had multiple wives. So, does God support polygamy? That’s the question we want to answer today on the B.E.A.T.\n\nINTRODUCTION: Hey what’s up everybody my name is Allen Parr and so the question comes up, “Did God permit Polygamy?” This is a tricky question and one that needs to answered carefully Well there’s actually one verse in the OT that seems to CLEARLY suggest He did (Deut. 21:17). So, in this video I want to look at 1) some of the REASONS why some men had multiple wives; 2) the RESULTS of those decisions and then finally 3) the RELEVANCE for us today. \n\n1. Men had multiple wives for a variety of reasons\na. Barrenness – Sometimes it was because their wife was unable to have children and further the family lineage.\nb. Protection for Women – Other times they were providing protection for women because due to many men dying in war there was a disproportionate number of women to men and women were unable to provide for themselves so men would step up and take extra wives to provide support and covering (sadly women were often forced into prostitution to provide for themselves)\ni. Deut. 25:5 – There is even a scripture that encourages a man to marry his brother’s wife if the brother died without children. \nii. And so the idea here is do you become a polygamist or do you force that woman to possibly become a prostitute?\nc. Alliances – Sometimes it was to forge alliances with other nations and so kings would trade wives to secure the partnership. \nd. Greed – Other times men like David chose to take on wives for selfish reasons. \ne. But even though, interestingly enough on one occasion God says to David, “Why did you have to go and steal someone else’s wife? If the ones you had weren’t enough I would have given you more…” (Is God condoning polygamy?)\n\n2. The RESULTS of Polygamy\na. Whether it’s a sin or not, interestingly, each time a man took on more than one wife in the Bible it created major problems and divided the home.\nb. We can look at Abraham and his two wives, Jacob and his 2 wives + 2 concubines, we can look at the situation between Hannah and Peninnah which was an absolute nightmare, David and his wives and Solomon’s heart turned away from God because of his 700 wives.\n \n3. The RELEVANCE for us today\na. God Established His institution of marriage at creation – The Law of First Mention – God’s design for marriage is very clear and is outlined in both the OT and the NT. In Gen. 2 God says, “And the TWO shall become ONE.” Jesus then confirms this in the NT (Paul says the same thing about church leaders needing to be “the husband of ONE wife.” (see also Eph. 5:22-33 and Col. 3:18-19)) where He repeats the very same scripture found in the OT. So anything outside of God’s original design cannot be His perfect will.\nb. Don’t confuse God’s PERMISSIVE will with His PERFECT will – There are many things He allowed but doesn’t desire. \nc. Don’t take something that God is DESCRIBING and interpret it as God PRESCRIBING it – David cursed his enemies in prayer does that mean we should do it? When interpreting the Bible be careful not to take isolated events and then make them normative for every believer (poison, snakes, etc.) Does that mean that because it worked for them we should do it?\nd. Just like God blesses and uses us despite our many sins in the same way God was patient to bless many men in the OT who took multiple wives. So instead of asking, “Why or how could a holy God bless someone like that?” Instead ask, “How could God overlook some of the stuff that I’ve done and still bless me in spite of what I do?\n\nSo did God allow polygamy for various reasons in the OT? I think we have to safely say that He did. But has that ever been God’s perfect will for a marriage relationship? I think we can safely say NO.",

    "title": "The Secret to Praying for Prosperity",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nTHE SECRET TO PRAYING FOR PROSPERITY\n\nLet’s say you have an idea, a business or a ministry that you want God to bless. How do you pray? That’s coming up next on the BEAT.\n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you all so much for visiting my channel. Here on the BEAT we release a new video every single Tuesday and today I am SO excited to share with you a short but powerful prayer that I’ve been praying particularly over the past couple years that God has been faithful to answer. This prayer is only one verse long but it has four parts to it and it can be found in 1 Chronicles 4:10.  \n\n1. Pray for God’s Blessing – The prayer starts out by saying…“Oh that you would bless me indeed…\na. So here you’re simply humbly asking God to bless you, your business, your idea or whatever it is you are trusting God for. You’re not coming naming and claiming or demanding anything from Him but rather recognizing that again and again in His word God invites His children to let our requests be made known to Him. \nb. Did you know that there were some things that ONLY happened in the Bible because people were bold enough to ask God to do it? \nc. I’m reminded of a man named Hezekiah who was on his death bed who cried out to God and said, “God would you be so gracious to extend my life?” And God essentially said, “Because you asked I’m going to add 15 years to your life.” \n\n2. Pray for Influence rather than Affluence – “…enlarge my territory…”\na. Here is when we check our own motivation as to why we are asking God to bless us. \nb. God give me a bigger business so that I can have a wider sphere of influence on more people so I can make an eternal impact on their life and trust that as your influence expands God will bring the affluence if it’s His will.\nc. So if your motivation is to reach more people for Jesus Christ with your idea then why would God not want to enlarge your territory?\n\n3. Pray for Favor – “and that your hand might be with me…”\na. This is where you ask God to do what you cannot do. This is where the natural stops and the supernatural takes over. It’s where your Preparation meets God’s Providence…\nb. It’s here that you recognize that no matter how skillful, intelligent, and resourceful you are you cannot accomplish what God wants you to accomplish by yourself. You need God’s power and His favor upon you because when God’s hand is on something it CANNOT be stopped!\nc. So here you are praying for two primary things…\ni. RELATIONSHIPS/PEOPLE – Bring the right people to me to help me pull this off. Pray that God would supernaturally ordain the right relationships. Give me favor with people. Open up the right doors and opportunities. \nii. RESOURCES/PROVISIONS – You’re praying for God to provide supernaturally. You’re praying that you would literally see the hand of God working behind the scenes so that you have the confidence to know that God has your back on what you’re asking Him for. \niii. REACH/PROMOTION – Pray that God would promote you to help you reach the people He intends for you to reach. \n\n4. Pray for Protection – “…keep me from harm that I may not experience pain.” \na. Here you are praying that God would protect you from people who are jealous, envious, vindictive, have secret agendas and people who don’t have the best interest at heart for whatever it is you are trusting God for. \nb. Pray that God would keep you and your business covered from any and all attacks that may distract, derail or ultimately destroy you. \n\nThis one verse although short is packed with power! So I want to encourage you to start praying these four things over your life, your family, your business and your ministry or any other idea you’re trusting God for today and trust God to prosper you as He sees fit. \n\nLet this prayer be not something you quote verbatim necessarily but a guide for how to pray. \n\n\n\n\nThere is something within us that is often times uncomfortable to ask God to bless something that we are doing. But I want you to notice one thing. This is not name it and claim it. He did not come to God in a prideful way demanding that God give him a specific blessing. He left that up to God and simply said, “God in whatever way you want to bless me I’m content.” \n\nBe bold to ask God to bless your business – What I love is that he let God determine how he wanted to bless him (financially, people, etc.)",

    "title": "Why Does God Allow Evil And Suffering?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWHY DOES GOD ALLOW EVIL AND SUFFERING?\n\nThe number one question that people would ask God would be, “Why did you allow so much Evil and Suffering?” That’s coming up next on the BEAT. \n\nHey everyone my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel. Here on the beat we release a new video every single Tuesday and today we are tackling the tough question, “Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?” This is a question that people have asked since the beginning of time and has been coined, “The Atheist’s Most Potent Weapon” and the argument goes like this. Either A) God is helpless and not all-powerful because if He was He would be able to put a stop to evil and suffering. Or B) God is not a good and loving God because good and loving God will allow suffering and evil. So atheists are like, “See I gotcha! You don’t have an answer!” But there actually are some answers that God has revealed in the Bible (you may or may not like them) and I want to share several of them with you today. \n\nPREMISE: That everything in this universe belongs to God which means He has the right to do whatever He desires to do with it because it belongs to Him.\n\n1. Sometimes God allows SUFFERING because He has a Greater Purpose For It that we cannot see\na. The greatest example of this is the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. As evil and gruesome as it was God allowed it because He had a greater purpose in mind, specifically that you and I could become Christians, receive complete and total forgiveness of our sins and live for eternity with God. \n\n2. God uses SUFFERING to get our attention and turn us towards God\na. I’m reminded of when in the OT God was trying to get Israel’s attention because they had backslidden. And in one text God said, “I killed your young men with the sword…yet you still did not return to me.” In other words I used that to get your attention to draw you back to me. \nb. In the same way the Sunday after 9/11 churches attendance was at an all-time high. Could it be that God used the tragedy of 9/11 to get our attention as a nation and turn us back towards Him. \n\n3. Sometimes God allows suffering to DISCIPLINE individuals or nations\na. In the OT a king by the name of David had an adulterous affair with a woman named Bathsheba. And God chose to discipline him by allowing the child of the affair to die. \nb. In the same way that we discipline our own children, He does this as an act of love so we don’t do something more destructive to our own lives. \n\n4. God allows SUFFERING to make our TESTIMONY stronger [God’s #1 priority is not our happiness]\na. In Hosea 1 God says, “Hosea, I want you to marry a woman who will one day commit adultery on you because I want you to know personally how it feels to love someone unconditionally who continues to be unfaithful to you so that when you are speaking to the people you’ll know personally how I feel when they continue to be unfaithful to me” \nb. In the same way God uses your suffering to make you stronger so that you can comfort people from a place of experience rather than intellectual knowledge. \n\nNow I recognize that none of these answers provide comfort to those who have experienced deep suffering but what it should do is get us to take our eyes off of this temporal existence and place our focus on heaven where the Bible says there will be no more death, no tears, no sorrow and no pain.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nIs Social Media our Frenemy?\n\nHey guys my name is Allen Parr thank you so much for visiting my channel if you enjoy this video we release new videos every Tuesday and today I want to talk about some traps [some of which I have been guilty of] that I see so many people falling into when it comes to social media. I have 7 of these so let’s…jump…in!\n \n1. Coveting – This is when we covet someone else’s platform, their success, their influence, their following, how many likes, comments and shares they get, etc. And what can end up happening is that we can fall into the trap of getting our validation or seeking some semblance of self-worth from social media. Let’s say you post something (post, picture, video) and you think, “man this post is about to go viral” and to your surprise you only get three likes and someone else posts some foolishness and gets like 300 likes within 1 hour. If you’re not careful you will begin to internalize this as people must not like me because they didn’t like my post instead of realizing that it very well may be that they never saw your post because of Facebook’s secret algorithm.\n2. Venting\na. The Bible says a fool gives vent to all their feelings but a wise person holds them back…\nb. It’s not the right forum for that\nc. In your attempt to try to make someone else look bad you’re actually making yourself look bad and emotionally weak. \nd. It’s an act of cowardice to put someone on blast without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves and share their side of the story.\ne. Defaming someone’s character if it’s an individual and you’re stealing potential customers from a business. \nSo next time you’re tempted to vent write it all out in your status and then check the box that says post ONLY TO ME!\n3. Comparing – One of the things that is easy to do is to compare your reality with someone else’s highlight reel. And so if you only look at what people post about their marriage, their children and their careers online you’ll think their situation is perfect not realizing that people generally only post their highlights not their lowlights and the enemy will start to play tricks with your mind causing you to think that your situation sucks because you don’t have what you think they have.    \n4. Squanders time – The latest statistics show that the average American spends 3.5 hours a day (9 for the average teen) on social media and probably 3.5 minutes a day reading the Bible. The Bible teaches us to “make the most of our time” and to “number our days.” We could spending that time investing into ourselves or investing into others so we need to REALLY consider whether this is the best use of our time.  \n5. Trap of Secrecy – over 20% of all divorces are the result of a secret online relationship. Social media is conducive to having secret relationships with so-called friends or old acquaintances that your spouse or significant other knows nothing about. Trap #3 is the COMPARISON TRAP… \n6. Distracts us from building relationships – You can be out with friends and instead of engaging in meaningful conversation you are distracted by scrolling through countless news feeds, snap chatting with someone across the world, looking up a photo on pinterest or following someone’s post on Instagram. And what this does is it sends the message to the other people that they are important enough to deserve your undivided attention. \n7. Co-signing/support – 2 Cor. 5:20 – What we like, share, and support is not only a reflection of you but as a Christian it is a reflection of Christianity as a whole. So when we like something that has a message that is worldly or inconsistent with the Bible (such as the law on same-sex marriages) we are putting our stamp of approval on this saying that we are in agreement with what someone else posted which has the potential to lead someone to believe that all of Christianity is in support of it because you are a representation of a bigger group of people.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nTHE BOOK OF REVELATION EXPLAINED IN UNDER 5 MINUTES!\n\nHave you ever wondered what the book of Revelation is all about? \n\nINTRODUCTION: And today we are talking about the book of Revelation, a book that has several different interpretations and one that many Christians avoid reading and some are even afraid to read it. But today I want to take you through a 7-fold chronological journey through the book of Revelation.\n\n1. Background – Rev. 1:1\na. Name – The name of the book comes from the first verse, “The Revelation of Jesus Christ” which lets us know that this book is all about the unveiling or uncovering of the person, plan and power of Jesus Christ.\nb. Written in 95 A.D. by the Apostle John who also wrote the gospel of John and the letters 1, 2, and 3 John\n\n2. Letters to Churches – Rev. 2-3\na. Letters from Jesus to 7 churches in Asia minor and each church \nb. Each letter exposes some aspect of the churches in that day and the modern day churches\nc. These chapters represent the church age in which we currently live\n\n3. Tribulation – Chapters 6-19 – The next thing that will happen is the church will be raptured and the tribulation will begin. \na. This represents a 7-year period of time after the church has been raptured where God allows those who are left behind one final opportunity accept Him as Savior. \nb. But the catch is that , because there is no church wickedness and evil are rampant throughout this section making it very difficult for people to choose Jesus. \nc. The final 3 ½ years of this period are what’s called the Great Tribulation. And man it’s gonna get bad (no drinking water, painful sores, sun will get so hot it will scorch the skin of men.”\n\n4. The Battle – 19\na. After these things there is the battle of Armageddon. It won’t be much of a battle because Satan and his armies will be severely destroyed by Jesus. \nb. Satan will be bound for 1000 years\n\n5. 1000 year reign – Rev. 20:6 – This is the actual Second Coming of Jesus Christ. All Christians from all time will reign physically on earth with Jesus. Satan will be bound during this time so there will no demonic influence for 1000 years.\n\n6. Judgments – Rev. 20:11-15 – Satan & every unbeliever who has ever lived will then stand before God and be judged for their sins and then cast into the Lake of Fire for eternal separation from God.\n\n7. New Heaven & New Earth – Rev. 21:1 – \na. Interestingly enough there are only 4 chapters in the bible where there is a perfect environment (Gen. 1-2 & Rev. 21-22). \nb. And so what we see here is the magnificent story of God coming full circle and God reestablishing the perfect environment that He had intended. \nc. The Bible says that the earth, which is decaying every day, is not fit for eternity so God will destroy this current earth and create a new heaven and a new earth where we will dwell with Him throughout all eternity.\n\nI hope this short video if nothing more will encourage you to study this book and see the awesome plan God has the future and most importantly that this book will give us as Christians the comfort in knowing that no matter how crazy things appear in this world that God was, is and always will be in complete control.\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "Top 5 Verses Christians Take Out of Context",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nThe Top 5 Verses Christians Take out of Context\n\nHave you ever heard someone quote a scripture and you wonder, “is that what that scripture really means?” Today we are going to talk about the importance of CONTEXT! \n\nHey what’s up everyone my name is Allen Parr and here on the BEAT we release a new video every Tuesday and so today we are talking about scriptures that Christians commonly take out of context and I want to give you my top 5.\n\n1. “Judge not, or you will be judged” \na. This verse is often used to suggest that people don’t have the right to judge other people. You may hear someone say, “you can’t judge me, the Bible says you can’t judge…”\nb. BUT, if you look at the context more carefully Jesus is NOT prohibiting all judgment but rather He is saying that before you judge someone else take some time to look at yourself first so that you will be able to see clearly enough to administer a proper judgment on something.\n2. “Consider it all joy when you experience various trials”\na. This verse is often used to somehow suggest that when we experience hard times the Christian response is to ignore our human emotions and rejoice and thank God for your trial.\nb. But when we look at the context it’s not saying that we should rejoice when negative things happen to us but rather we rejoice in what the trial produces in our lives which is the ability to persevere and to make us a complete well-balanced Christian. \n3. “Where two or three are gathered together in your name there I will be in the midst”\na. This verse is usually quoted when no one shows up for prayer meeting to encourage the saints to pray anyway OR if we are going through a difficult time and we have 2 or 3 people praying for us…\ni. First problem is that if you’re a Christian Jesus is with you all the time whether you’re by yourself or in groups of two or three\nii. Second problem is that the context is talking about how to resolve conflict in the church between two people and if there are at least two to three credible witnesses in agreement then Jesus says I will be in the midst of that conflict resolution. \n4. “Speak those things that are not as though they are” – this verse has been misused by so many people to suggest that if we have enough faith we have the ability to create our own destiny simply by speaking things into existence. \na. The problem with this one is if you read the passage carefully it clearly says that that God is the only one that is able to call something into existence that is not. \nb. You and I cannot twist God’s hand and force Him to do something outside of His will simply by speaking it because that puts us in the position of God and God in the position of a servant. \n5. By His stripes we are healed – Now people have used this verse when they are praying over someone who I sick suggesting that through Jesus’ death on the cross (i.e. His “stripes”) we are healed of any sickness and disease. The problem with this is…\na. If you trace the Hebrew word for heal throughout the entire book of Isaiah you’ll see that every time it is used to refer to God spiritually healing a nation of people who have backslidden and He is healing them of their spiritual sickness. \nb. We know it’s not talking about sickness because in the NT Peter quoted this same verse and the context clearly proves that the idea of being healed is spiritual and not physical. \nc. Peter used this same verse in the NT and helps us understand the meaning of the original text to refer to a spiritual healing and not a physical one. \n\nMy hope and goal with this video is that we would all be much more careful when speaking for God and make sure that we are quoting scriptures in the right context and not just saying things that we’ve heard other people say or even your pastor say or the common Christian cliché. Remember that when you take the text out of CONtext, you get CONNED every time!",

    "title": "Boost Your Leadership with These Six Principles",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nBoost Your Leadership with These Six Principles \n\nQUESTION: What are the qualities that separate leaders from great leaders? Today I want to show you how to maximize your leadership potential.\n\nMany of us find ourselves in leadership positions even if we don’t want to be, whether it may be at work, our own business, at church or at home. I’ve been blessed to be around some amazing leaders. And so today I want to point out 6 qualities from the life of Jesus that every great leader I know possesses and the first is…\n\n1. Leaders possess…PASSION\na. Jesus was passionate about what He was leading. One time He even went into the temple and flipped over all of the tables (Mt. 21:12)\nb. A great leader exhibits passion. One of the reasons why the morale on certain teams is low is because the morale of the leader is low. \nc. If you want to maximize your leadership potential be sure you are passionate about what you’re leading and that you communicate that passion to your team.  \n2. Leaders win with…PEOPLE\na. Every great leader knows how to win with people. \nb. Communication\ni. Clear – People on your team should not have to ask you questions about things that should have been communicated to them. \nii. Consistent – For a leader there is no such thing as too much communication. People would rather hear from you too much than not at all. Over-communication is a leader’s best friend. \niii. Compelling – Does it call people to action? \niv. Charismatic – “Spoke as one having authority” There was something about the way Jesus spoke that crowds gathered around Him. Great leaders are often great speakers. \nc. Motivation – This involves getting the best out of people and making them feel important to where they want to do what they can to help you.  \nd. Delegation – A leader understands the principle of multiplication and making others feel empowered to carry out your vision. \n3. Leaders see…POSSIBILITIES\na. In other words great leaders aren’t afraid to take risks to do what’s never been done before. \nb. Jesus was attempting to do something that had never been done in the history of time which was to unite Jews and Gentiles together. That was a risk…\nc. But in order to be a risk taker you must first overcome your fear of failure. \n4. Leaders solve…PROBLEMS\na. Every great leader is able to not only solve problems but they have the discernment to foresee and plan for them before they come. \nb. Jesus foresaw the problem of sin and executed a plan to solve it by dying on the cross for our sins. \n5. Leaders exhibit…PERSEVERANCE\na. Jesus was on a mission to fulfill His divine purpose of dying on the cross. He didn’t allow opposition to deter him from his mission.\nb. Anything you attempt to do for God or just in general you will encounter opposition. Great leaders may get discouraged but not deterred. \n6. Leaders demonstrate…PROGRESS – Lk. 2:52 – The Bible says even Jesus grew in wisdom…\na. A great leader recognizes that they must always be progressing to stay ahead of the people they lead. This means that a leader is always a reader and a leader is always a learner. \nb. See 1 Tim. 4:12\n\nSo I pray that you would use this as a checklist to grade your leadership as you strive to maximize your leadership capacity.  I’d love to hear your thoughts on leadership leave them in the comment section below. \n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on Facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K\nLinks for YouTube Stuff",

    "title": "Do Christians Need to go to Church?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhy do People Need to Go to Church?\n\nHave you gotten strayed away from going to church on a consistent basis? Or you’re going but you’re not involved? Today I want to talk about why you need to get back in church.  \n\nINTRODUCTION: Hey everyone my name is Allen Parr and thank you for visiting my channel. We release new videos every single Tuesday and today we are talking about why it’s important to go to church. I’m not sure what your reason is for not going consistently but I want to give you 5 reasons why you should go to church. \n\n1. Christ\na. Jesus went to the place of worship every Saturday consistently. So, if we want to be like Jesus we should attend regularly. \nb. Also, the Bible refers to the church as the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:24; Rev. 19:7-9) which means it’s the most important thing to Him. So when we neglect or disregard the church as not being important, what we are saying is “Jesus I love me some you, but I don’t love your wife.” \n2. To Contribute\na. One of the biggest problems is that people see church primarily for what they can get out of it instead of what they can contribute to it. \nb. I’ve got news for you. The church needs you. You have experiences, gifts, talents and a testimony that someone in the church is not benefitting from what you have to give because you are not involved. \nc. Might I remind you also that the Bible is very clear that one day we will have to give an account to God for how we used the gifts He’s given us. \n3. Children\na. Even if you don’t believe in regular attendance, do it for your children. Church is a great place for them to learn about moral, ethical behavior and to receive a solid foundation that the Bible says that when they get older there is a high likelihood that they won’t depart from it.  \nb. It can also be a place for them to discover their gifts and talents and learn about the value of community at a young age. \nc. Also, statistics show that couples who attend church together are 35% less likely to divorce than couples who don’t. \n4. Community\na. Care – When you are going through your most difficult seasons of life the church is designed to be a place where you can be surrounded by people who genuinely care about you, will pray for you and hold you up at times when you can’t stand by yourself. Also within community is…\nb. Counsel – The church is a great place to go if you’re going through a difficult time in your life and you need counsel or maybe you have a big decision to make and you need someone to help you process it.\nc. But also within this community are opportunities for you to grow spiritually through Bible studies, conferences, or the Sunday morning experience. \n\nThe fifth and final reason is somewhat of a selfish one but that is…\n\n5. Connections\na. Wherever you want to be in life you will not get there alone. And so…\nb. The church is a great place to make personal and professional connections that may help you get your family and/or your business where you want them to be. \n\nENCOURAGEMENT: So I’m not sure what your reason is for why you don’t go to church but I want to encourage you first of all to forgive those who may have hurt you in church and then to find a church that is committed to teaching the word of God and one that you can experience the blessing of true, genuine, authentic community.\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "How to Pursue a Woman...The Right Way",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHow should a Christian man pursue a Christian woman? That’s our topic today on the BEAT\n\nWhat’s up everybody it’s your boy Allen here so today I want to talk to the single men and give some advice on how we can pursue a woman.\n\nDISCLAIMERS: There is no biblical formula for how to pursue a woman or how to date (dating was not an issue in their culture). I confess that I did not personally see the value in these principles before I started courting my wife.\n \nAnd so with that being said, I want to suggest 6 principles for how we men can get this right. (SCREEN: Ladies I need you would help us by holding us accountable to these 6 principles.)\n\n1. Check Yourself – In other words, be honest about where you are emotionally and whether or not you are in the right place to spiritually lead a woman. \n2. Consistency – Women can’t STAND a man who doesn’t follow through with what he says so make sure your actions are consistent with your words. \n3. Clarity – It is so important to women for us to be crystal clear about what our intentions are from the jump. This has several benefits…\na. Sets you apart from other men who are interested in playing games\nb. Establishes your leadership which she craves and desires\nc. When you don’t it sends the message that she’s good enough to kick it with but not good enough to commit to. Once you’ve established clear intentions…\n4. Caution – Be careful to avoid physical contact early on because… (ladies hold us accountable…)\na. CONTACT without COMMITMENT = CONFUSION\nb. When a man becomes physical with a woman \ni. “What is it about me that is good enough for him to lay up on but not commit to?”\nii. “How many other women is he kissing on since we are not exclusive?” \niii. “Is this just a physical thing?”\nc. With each contact it engages her heart even more and puts her in a very insecure place \nd. Something else to consider is that not only are you protecting her and her heart but you’re protecting yourself because if the relationship doesn’t work \ne. But if you don’t it can have devastating effects on her self-esteem, can damage her trust in men and make it more difficult for the man that God sends to pursue her next. While it may be easy for us to move on, often times she may be left dealing with emotional pain of another broken relationship. \n5. Community or Covering\na. In other words…find out who are the most influential people in her life. \nb. If she mentions that she has a spiritual covering such as a pastor, mentor, life group leader or even her father it would be in your best interest to make your intentions known to them. \nc. HUGE! Because…these are the people she trusts, respects and listens to. So it’s best to let these people know who you are and get them on your side early on. \nd. Now let me be clear, you are NOT asking for permission but simply making your intentions known. \n6. Character – (Prov. 31) \na. Many of us get so caught up in the physical attraction and ignore the character and then after the physical wears off we move on searching for something more. Pay more attention to the qualities you need in a wife not a girlfriend. \nb. Studies show that even in good marriages couples have sex for about 2 hours a week. It’s her character that will keep you engaged the other 166. \n\nI wish someone would have told me this a long time ago. So guys the good news is that God doesn’t expect us to be perfect before we pursue a woman. But I hope this list gives us something to shoot for as we experience the challenges of dating.\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "What to do when You're Angry at God?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat do you do when you are angry, frustrated and disappointed with God and your dreams turn into nightmares? That’s the question we want to answer today on the BEAT. \n\nINTRODUCTION: What’s up everyone, Allen here and today I want to take a close look at the life of Job, a man who lost all ten of his children, all his wealth and his health and I want to give us four things to consider when we are angry, frustrated and disappointed with God. \n\n1. Release your emotions to God – Job 23:2-3, 8; elsewhere he even said, “Cursed be the day I was even born!” \na. Job was ANGRY with God not only because of what he was going through but because it seemed like God was nowhere to be found and while experiencing incomparable pain he was bold enough to express his true feelings towards God. \nb. And many of God’s greatest servants were at one point in their life very angry with God and yet God was patient with them, loved them through it and blessed their life.\ni. Naomi – She lost her husband and her two sons and shook her fists in God’s face and \nii. Hannah – Was bitter because she could not have children. \niii. David – “My tears have become my food!”\nc. So, my first encouragement to you if you are angry with God, God already knows what you’re feeling. Stop feeling guilty about it. Release it to God and be encouraged to know that you are in good company of people who have been disappointed with God.  \n2. Recognize that God could be testing you – Job 23:10\na. Job said, “even though I can’t seem to find God anywhere in my trial, I KNOW that His eyes are still on ME! And when He TESTS me…”\nb. Don’t start blaming yourself for what you’re going through when it could very well be that God may be testing you today and that test is more for you to see where you REALLY are because the true temperature of your faith will be revealed in the tests and trials of life. \nc. Peter said, “these trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold.” (1 Pet. 1:7a). This leads me to my third point which is…\n3. Resolve to Obey God during your test – Job 23:11-12\na. One of the temptations when you are in the midst of a trial is to say, “God this Christian thing isn’t working! Prayer, obedience, fasting and church attendance is getting me NOWHERE!” And you end up making poor decisions and reverting back to a habit, a person or a lifestyle that God has delivered you from. \nb. But Job said, “I have stayed on God’s path; I have followed His ways and not turned aside; I have not departed from His commands.” Elsewhere he said, “although you slay me God, YET I will trust you!” \nc. When we revert backwards I am a firm believer that we may be prolonging the time of our own test. \n4. Remind yourself of God’s Power – Job 42:\na. When you are experiencing a deep trial the tendency is to think that what you’re going through will never end. \ni. When I look at how God blessed Job, Abraham, Joseph, David, Hannah, Naomi and a host of other Bible characters, I see both a God who took them through extended seasons of pain…\nii. But also…I see a God who was merciful, kind, patient, faithful and one who IN HIS TIME does not allow His children to suffer indefinitely and one who is merciful and faithful. You may have to meditate on these stories again and again to find strength to believe when you’ve lost all hope. \n\nYou lose a loved one. Your spouse cheats on you. You know God is in control which makes it worse. Why doesn’t He do something about this? Why did He let this happen? \n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "How to Have a Killer Quiet Time with God",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nIs your quiet time with God either missing, miserable or mysterious? Today I want to give you 6 tips on how to maximize your time with God. \n\nHey everyone, Allen here and today I want to show you six things you can do to hopefully get the most out of your quiet time with God and they all start with the letter T. \n\n1. Talk – Ps. 119:18 – Before you open up the Bible to read it, ask God to show you what He wants you to see in the passage you’re reading. \n\n2. Time – Pick a time that you are unhurried (meaning you can’t rush in and out of God’s presence and expect to have some grand connection) and uninterrupted (meaning you are completely and totally free from distraction – NO PHONES). \n\n3. Type – THIS IS HUGE! If you don’t do this what happens is you’ll spend half of your time trying to figure out WHAT to read instead of actually reading. So let me give you a few suggestions. \na. Topical (faith, fear, courage, spiritual gifts, etc.)\nb. Character (David, Joseph, Esther, Hannah, Paul, etc.)\nc. Book (Romans, Genesis) – “Hey for the next week or so I’m going to read and re-read the book of James.” (great book actually)\nd. It doesn’t matter which one you do. Just PICK ONE! \n\n4. Tools – 2 Tim. 2:15 says, “STUDY to show yourself approved…” – If you’re going to graduate from reading the Bible to studying the Bible you need some tools to enhance your study. \na. Study Bible – Life Application – filled with character profiles, lessons learned, concordance, etc.\nb. Bible Dictionary – Pharisee – “What in the world is a Pharisee?” You grab your Bible dictionary and look up the word Pharisee and it will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the Pharisees. Another tool that’s quite helpful is a concordance…\nc. Concordance – Let’s say you come across a Greek or Hebrew word that you want to know more about. You look that word up and it tells you how that word was used in that day. \nd. Commentary\ne. Most of these you can access online for free. I’ll put links in the description box below. \n\n5. Translation\na. Choose a translation that is EASY for you to understand. I’m always amazed at new Christians who start reading the King James Bible. Although that’s a great translation, it’s the most difficult to read because it was written in the 17th century and we don’t talk that way anymore.\nb. So I recommend the NLT or the NIV. \n\n6. Transform – The ultimate goal of Bible study is not information but transformation. So to help you apply the Bible I want to suggest \na. 4 Questions (Command, Attitude, Sin, Example)\nb. 4 Spheres (relationships, work, ministry, personal\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "What Does the Bible Say About Divorce and Remarriage?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K\nLinks for YouTube Stuff\n\nWhat does the Bible teach about divorce and remarriage? That’s our topic today on the BEAT.\n\nHey what’s up everyone my name is Allen Parr and so today we are dealing with a very sensitive subject. Statistics show that over 50% of all couples experience divorce, which means not only are they affected by it but their children are as well. I recognize there are a variety of views on it so my goal is to provide a balanced yet biblical view on the subject. \n\nWith that being said, the first thing I want to say is that…\n\n1. Divorce is not the unforgivable sin\na. I would argue that it’s not a sin at all in some situations. We’ve taken this one sin and have shunned and shamed people and caused them to feel worse than they already do about the deep pain associated with a divorce. \nb. We need to be about the business of restoring people who are broken and reminding them that if God is big enough to forgive other sins then He is big enough to forgive the sin of divorce. \n2. Grounds for Divorce\na. With that being said I would argue that the Bible provides four grounds for divorce and remarriage.\nb. Adultery – Mt. 19:9 – Jesus says that if a spouse commits adultery then the other spouse has the option to divorce and remarry although reconciliation is always preferred if the offending spouse is truly repentant. \nc. Abandonment – 1 Cor. 7:12-15\nd. Death – 1 Cor. 7:39 – Paul says that if a spouse dies then the living spouse is obviously no longer bound and is free to remarry.\ne. Divorce as an Unbeliever – 2 Cor. 5:17 – When we become Christians God does not hold us accountable for anything we did before we were saved.\n3. The X-Factor\na. With all of that being said I believe there is one x-factor here and that is the heart of God. I am convinced that, although there are consequences to our decisions, GOD ALWAYS RESPONDS TO A HEART OF REPENTANCE WITH GRACE.\nb. We see this in the life of David. We see this with how God dealt with Israel who sinned against God repeatedly and yet God called them back to repentance. \n4. Finally my advice to someone who has experienced the devastating pain of divorce is\na. Go out of your way to shield your children from the pain of the divorce as much as you can.\nb. But more importantly, NEVER WASTE A FAILURE! Take the lessons that you’ve learned [see what part you played, if any, in the breakdown of the marriage] and turn around and help someone else because if you don’t you are allowing the enemy to get the victory on the front end and on the back end by causing you to hide behind your failures and being too ashamed to share your wisdom with someone else. \n\nIf you found this video helpful…",

    "title": "The Four Needs Every Woman Desperately Wants Her Man to Meet",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat are four needs your woman desperately wants you to meet? That’s what we’re going to talk about today. \n\nHey what’s up everybody, welcome back. And so I want to look at just ONE verse and I believe this ONE verse teaches us how we as men can build a 4-sided fortress around our women so they feel totally and completely secure in our love. \n\nAnd so the first need is QUALITY TIME…\n#1 – “Dwell with them…\n• Many men are task-oriented by nature so this doesn’t come natural for many of us but this involves…\n• Conversation that is unhurried and uninterrupted\n• Undistracted listener\n• Creative date nights\n• This means being intentional (you may have to actually schedule it) about carving out time and not giving away all of our time and energy to everyone and everything else that we are too drained to pour into our women.\n\nThe second is UNDERSTANDING. He goes on to say…\n#2 – “Dwell with them in an understanding way…”\n• Every woman wants a man who pays attention to her, understands her and studies her. \n• What are her gifts? Dreams? Desires? Greatest fears? How is God working in her life? \n• Taking a genuine interest in the things that matter to her the most even if they don’t matter to us.\n• This means listening to her more than talking about ourselves, our interests, accomplishments and successes and what matters to us. \n• Paying attention to the things she likes.\n\nThe third is VALUE\n#3 – “Dwell with them in an understanding way, giving honor to the wife…”\n• The Greek word here literally means “to assign precious value to” or to show “preference.”  \n• Think of it like fine china. We don’t treat it the same as regular dishware because it’s special.\n• And in the same way our women have a strong need to know that next to God she is the most important thing in your world. That she is more important than work, school, ministry, your friends, business pursuits, your hobbies, etc. If not she can quickly become insecure and feel as though she is competing for your attention. in the relationship. \n\nThe fourth is PROTECTION\n#4 – “Dwell with them in an understanding way, giving honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel…”\n• Notice here that it doesn’t say she is weaker but Peter instructs us to deal with her as if she was the weaker vessel (this word refers primarily to physical strength)\n• Women in many ways are stronger than men. They live longer. They often times have a higher threshold of pain than we do (they deal with it every month. We’re big babies). \n• But underneath that strength she has a strong, strong need to be totally protected and to have a safe place where she doesn’t NEED to be strong. \n• This involves her need to feel physically protected, financially, and most importantly, emotionally safe which means we must create an environment where she feels safe to express her deepest regrets, failures, insecurities and fears without fear of being judged. \n\nNotice also that Peter adds a motivation here. He says, “so that our prayers won’t be hindered.” So God says, “why would I give you what you’re asking Me for if I know it’s only going to take you further away from loving and honoring the gift I’ve given you?” So perhaps when we put her love on top the breakthrough that we’ve been praying for will come to pass. \n\nSo men, I confess that these are things I’m learning every day about being a husband. So, I want to encourage us to meditate on this verse and let’s build a 4-sided fortress around our women that involves quality time, understanding, honor and protection that is so secure she doesn’t want to get out and predators can’t get in.",

    "title": "The Back Story About How We Really Got Our Bible!",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHow can we be sure that the 66 books that we call the Bible truly is the word of God?\n\nHey what’s up everyone, so one of the most common questions about the Bible is how did we get the Bible we have today? Why 66 books and were there any that were somehow lost or left out? So I hope to answer these questions in this video. \n\nKEY #1 – The church DISCOVERED not DETERMINED which books were inspired. The church leaders merely recognized through a process which ones were already inspired and which ones were not. \n\nNow the question becomes, what was this process that they used to discover which books were inspired and which ones were not. \n1. What did Jesus say about this book?\na. By the time Jesus was born the Jewish community had already accepted 39 books as being inspired by God. \ni. Jesus affirmed it\nii. Jesus quoted from it\niii. Jesus referenced people from it\niv. Jesus taught from it\n2. Was it written by an accepted prophet, apostle or someone closely connected to an apostle?\na. Why was this important? Because prophets and apostles were accredited with miraculous signs, wonders and miracles. So, if they were endowed with the power of God that made their writings credible. \nb. Jesus had predicted in John 17:20 that people would believe THROUGH THEIR MESSAGE!\nc. Always many of them were eyewitnesses to what they were writing about (scripture)\n3. Does this book tell the truth about God and is it consistent with the other teachings that we KNOW are inspired?\na. During the first few centuries there were lots of writings and not all of them were inspired by God. \nb. An example of such a book that was the Gospel of Thomas where it says, “Simon Peter said to them: ‘Let Mary go away from us, for women are not worthy of life.’ Jesus said: ‘Lo, I shall lead her, so that I may make her a male, that she too may become a living spirit, resembling you males. For every woman who makes herself a male will enter the kingdom of heaven.”\nc. So clearly this book did not tell the truth about Jesus and is inconsistent with other scriptures and so they threw this one out and discovered this book was not inspired by God. \n4. Was the book accepted by the early church as being authoritative? Was it used in the church? Did church leaders preach from this book? \n5. Does this book carry with it the power of God? In other words, they asked, “when we read this book do we get a sense that it was written by God with the ability to transform lives?\n\nFinally, just like it takes faith to trust in a God you’ve never physically seen, it takes faith to trust that if God was powerful enough to write His word through flawed and fallible men, He is also strong enough to preserve it and oversee and govern the process by which His word came together. And we trust that God would not have us to live and govern our lives by something that did not correctly reflect who He is.\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nTHE SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT TONGUES\n\nWhat does the Bible teach about this gift of speaking in tongues? That’s what we are going to talk about today on the BEAT.\nHey what’s up everyone my name is Allen Parr and so today we are tackling the touchy subject of speaking in tongues. What is the gift of tongues? What are some misconceptions of tongues? How should it be used in the church?\n\nWhat is the Gift of Tongues?\n\n1) The gift of tongues originally was the supernatural ability to share the gospel in another known dialect without the speaker having previous knowledge of this language (like me speaking Japanese) – Acts 2:1-12\n2) Some also believe it is the ability to speak and/or pray in an unknown language.\n\nSo What are some of the Misconceptions?\n\n1) Everyone can learn to speak in tongues – The Bible teaches that tongues is a spiritual gift. It also teaches that the Holy Spirit is the one who distributes spiritual gifts to believers AS HE WILLS. So just like any other gift you cannot choose your gifts they are given to you. So I don’t how a Christian can learn to speak in tongues any more than they can learn to possess the gift of pastoring of healing or miracles. \n2) The second misconception is…People who speak in tongues have more spiritual power than those that don’t – I don’t see anywhere in Scripture where a person who spoke/prayed in tongues was able to accomplish more spiritually than those that didn’t. \na. This type of mentality merely divides the church more than it already is into the haves and the have-nots and makes those that don’t have the gift feel inferior. \n\n\nHow should this Gift be used in the Church?\n\n1) There must be an interpreter – So if you’re in church and everyone is speaking in tongues Paul says, what if someone who isn’t familiar with the gift or an unbeliever comes in? (Put yourself in their shoes) They will think they’ve just entered into a crazy place.  (14:23) So the question is, “Why would you want to take a chance of offending, confusing or turning off an unbeliever from church simply because you feel the need to speak/pray in tongues in church?” Which is why Paul said, “I CAN speak in tongues but IN CHURCH I would rather speak in a language that EVERYONE can understand.”  So even Paul said he doesn’t speak in tongues in church unless there is a KNOWN interpreter present. \n2) Experience should never contradict Scripture – Sometimes people will say, “well I just felt the Spirit.” Saints, the same Spirit who empowers us to use our gifts is the same Spirit who inspired the writing of the Bible and He cannot contradict Himself by leading you to have an experience in church that goes against the writing of Scripture. \n\n\nFinally, because a Christian’s view on this subject has nothing to do with salvation.\n\nIt is my prayer that your views and experiences with this will be based on scripture\nAlways remember to be sensitive to unbelievers when in a church…\n\nFinally, be careful not to adopt the mentality that people who have the gift are more spiritual or more powerful than those that don’t. \n\nI would love to know your experience with this as it relates to the church so please leave your comments below I’d love to hear them. \n\nWe should be focused more on exemplifying the fruit of the Spirit than we are with the gifts of the Spirit.\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "What to Do when you Feel Disconnected from God",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat do you do when you feel disconnected, distant from God and you feel as though you’ve lost your passion for God and your spiritual life just feels stagnant? Stick around and find out the solution. \n\nHey welcome back everyone my name is Allen Parr and I am SO EXCITED about our word today. Every so often it’s normal to feel disconnected from God so I want to look at two verses today and give you four steps you can take to reestablish that intimacy with God. The author uses the imagery of a runner who is trying to reach a goal. I am excited about our word today! Everything we need to know in order to restore out intimacy can be found in these two verses right here. \n\n1. Lay aside the WEIGHT – “Let us strip off every weight that slows us down”\na. Normally something that is innocent and harmless but it’s something that consistently diverts our attention, drains you of your energy and hinders us from developing intimacy with God. \nb. It could be a particular PERSON or PEOPLE\nc. Busyness – Your schedule is so filled with activities. And if you’re serving in ministry in any capacity the danger is to confuse activity for intimacy. Duty NEVER replaces Devotion. \nd. Disappointment with God and that is blocking your intimacy with Him\ne. Career, overtime, etc. \nf. Social Media\n2. Eliminate the SIN – “…especially the sin that so easily trips us up.” \na. When you and I have some perpetual sin that is reoccurring in our lives it creates GUILT and GUILT creates separation from God. And then you have to break through your own guilt and conviction to try to reestablish that connection with God. But it’s difficult when you find yourself caught in the cycle of sin and confession. \nb. So identify that sin and truly repent of it so you can experience intimacy with God.\n3. Walk in PURPOSE – “And let us run the race…God has marked out for us.”\na. One of the reasons why you are feeling disconnected is because God has a specific purpose or race He intended for you to run. And when you are not running that race it creates an unrest within you because you’re doing one thing but deep within you know you should be doing something else which leads to feeling disconnected. Let me give you a few questions I encourage you to ask yourself if you are trying to find your purpose. \ni. What negative experiences has God allowed in your life that God can recycle to help others?\nii. What do you see wrong that you long to make right?\niii. What gift(s) have other people consistently affirmed in your life? \nb. So I encourage you to figure out what your God-given purpose is and walk in it!\n4. Focus on JESUS – “We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus.” \na. Do the things that foster intimacy (consistent quiet time). Remember, good Christians meet with God when they can; they fit it in when they can. Great Christians meet with God at a set time every day. \nb. There is NO short cut to intimacy. If you want it you must be willing to put in the work and time. \n\nSo if you’re struggling to feel connected with God be encouraged. I’ve been there so many times in my own personal walk and so have so many others. But the good news is that just like in any relationship if you’ve ever experienced intimacy with God you can get it back by following these 4 simple steps.\n\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nBOOK ME TO SPEAK IN YOUR AREA HERE: http://www.allenparr.com/speaking/\n\nTO DONATE TO THIS MINISTRY CLICK HERE: http://bit.ly/1TDPv2K",

    "title": "Should Couples Live Together before Marriage?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nShould Couples Live together before Marriage?\n\nLiving together before marriage, which includes what I call “slick shacking”, is becoming more and more popular as our society becomes more and more skeptical of the institution of marriage.  \n\nAnd so as a result this has led many people including relationship experts to believe that living together before marriage gives the couple the opportunity to “try it before you buy it” so to speak. But, does it really work? \n\nInterestingly the statistics prove otherwise\n\n1. Statistical - Dozens of SECULAR studies have been performed between the 1970s and early 2000s where thousands of couples were carefully observed and they all consistently report the following.\na. One study showed that couples that live together before marriage have a 46% higher likelihood of separating than those who wait to get married. \nb. Another study showed that only 60% of couples who live together before marriage will actually get married. And of the remaining 40% who do, 5 out 6 of them will be divorced within 3 years. \nc. Higher level of adultery\nd. Finally studies show that there is a lower level of sexual satisfaction in their marriages\n\nBUT, the real question that we MUST answer is WHY when it makes so much logical sense to live together (test drive, try before you buy it, etc.) before marriage? One of the reasons why there is a higher likelihood that the relationship will end in divorce is…\n\n2. Sociological\na. Often times a man sees moving in as a more convenient way to get sex and an opportunity to test out the relationship. Whereas women tend to see it as the next step towards marriage. And what happens is over time the couple has made such an investment financially and emotionally that it’s harder to get out than they think and so the couple ends up “sliding, not deciding” into marriage.\nb. A second reason is that often times the people who move in together are generally the type of people who have a lower view of the institution of marriage as a whole (SCREEN: “I mean it’s just a piece of paper”) which means they may be more likely to bail when the relationship goes through difficult times.\nc. Finally, couples that live together are entering into marriage with a different foundation than those that don’t. \n \n3. Spiritual – What does the Bible have to say about this topic? Well, it really doesn’t say anything directly related to the topic but like many other things there are principles that should guide our decision.\na. Do not be conformed to the world – So when we live together we are living and acting just like the world. \nb. Not put ourselves in situations that are sexually tempting – Flee immorality (grk. be a fugitive)\nc. Avoid the very appearance of evil – 1 Thess. (see also Eph. 5:3) – So even if you are living together and not having sex it will appear to those looking on that you actually are. \nd. Which leads to the final reason why it’s not a good idea and that is the fact that you are sending the message to the world that it is okay to have sex before marriage whether you are or aren’t which could cause others to follow your behavior and stumble into sin.",

    "title": "What to do When you're Worried about Money!",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat do you do when you’re worried about MONEY?\n\nHey what’s up everyone, my name is Allen Parr and today we are talking about what to do when we are worried about our money and so I want to give you 4 practical steps to apply and the first is to…\n\n1. Check your priorities\na. There is a beautiful passage of scripture in the book of Haggai (the book is only one chapter…please read) where God says, “I want you to think about what is happening around you. You’re planting so much but you’re not seeing much in return. And the reason he says is because all of y’all are living in these luxurious homes while the temple you were supposed to build for me lies in ruins (nice home vs. ruined home on screen).  \nb. IMPLICATION: You are SO concerned about pushing your agenda forward that my priorities continue to lie on the back-burner. \nc. Two things that happen when we don’t put God first\ni. So God says, “I have a way of making the money you bring in fall through the holes in your pants. \nii. He even says, “whatever you bring in I’m going to blow it away.” Then He says…\niii. There are some blessings that I want to release in your life but I’m going to withhold them until you make my agenda a priority in your life. \nd. It so it could very well be that God desperately wants you to put Him first in some area of your life and He’s using this frustration with your finances to get your attention (see also Mt. 6:33).\n2. Assess what you CAN control\na. This one is huge. Many of us are worried about money when our mismanagement of it is the source of our own stress. \nb. Paul said, we are supposed to be content “with food and clothing we should be content.” \ni. BUDGET: (Prov. 27:23-24 – SCREEN) – So I want to I challenge you if you are stressed out about your finances to look closely at your current budget and you may find a few hundred dollars each month that you can save that will relieve some of the financial stress you are under. \nii. Secondly, we as Christians love to say, “well I’m just trusting God for my finances.” \niii. SECOND JOB: But the same Bible says “faith without works is dead.” In other words, it’s more than just trusting God. You may have to work a second job in order to relieve ourselves from some of the stress that we’re under. \niv. The Bible has a lot of positive things to say about work and a lot of negative things to say about laziness.\nc. And so I love to think of it this way, “work as if everything depended on you and trust as if everything depended upon God.” \n\n3. Stop worrying & Trust God – It’s been said that “worrying pulls tomorrow’s cloud over today’s sunshine.” Jesus had a lot to say about this subject in Matt. 6 so I want to give you 6 quick facts about worrying.  , “ \na. Statistics prove that over 90% of what we worry about never comes to pass. \nb. Wastes time\nc. Unproductive\nd. Adds tension to your relationships\ne. Hinders you from enjoying life as God intended\nf. Leads to more worrying and stress\n\nSo my encouragement to you is to stay present and resist the temptation to allow the enemy to steal your joy and wreak havoc in your mind with the proverbial what if game.\n\n4. Accept your financial difficulty as a tool God uses to develop your faith\na. Jesus said, “In this life you WILL have trouble.\nb. Peter said, “Stop being surprised when these difficulties come because Christians all over the world are experiencing the same troubles.”\nc. And James said, “God is using this difficulty to develop perseverance in your life.\nd. And so if you’re struggling with your finances today, you’re stressed out and frustrated, just know that God may be using this difficulty in your life to elevate your faith from middle school faith to high school faith so that the next time these difficulties come you will be able to look back and see how faithful God was in your past which will give you the confidence you need to know that if He’s done it in the past He’ll do it again. \nSCREEN: Worry has been described as “a thin stream of fear trickling through the mind. If encouraged, it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained” \n\nIf you enjoyed this video please share it with a friend.

    "title": "Is Drinking Alcohol a Sin?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nIs drinking alcohol a sin? That’s what we’re going to talk about today. \n\nAlright so this question comes up ALL the time. “Is it a sin to drink alcohol?” To answer this question people tend to go to one of two extremes. Either they will say, “A Christian should not drink wine under ANY circumstances.” Or they will say, “it’s not a sin; I can drink as much as I want as long as I don’t get drunk.” But what does the Bible have to say about this? \n\nThe quick answer to that is NO. (SCREEN: Wine is like money: Neither are inherently evil but it’s how you use it or abuse it that matters)\n\nInterestingly enough the Bible has a lot of positive things to say about the use of wine. \n\n1. Celebration – Jesus drank wine with His disciples but He made wine from scratch – Mt. 11:19; Lk. 7:34 – So if it’s a sin then Jesus sinned and caused a whole bunch of other people to sin. (they actually accused Him of being a drunkard)\n2. Enjoyment – Wine was created by God simply to be enjoyed – Eccl. 9:7 (read with emphasis)\n3. Wine was used for communion (represents Jesus’ blood – some use grape juice others use actual wine) – (see 1 Cor. 11:21) – So if it was a sin that means we could potentially sin each time we take communion. \n\nBUT, there are times when it may not be wise to drink. The Bible says, “All things are permitted but not all things are profitable. Let me suggest to you 3 questions to ask yourself before you drink. \n\n1 Cor. “All things are permitted but not all things are profitable.” \n\n1. Will this damage my Christian image? \na. Non-believers – 1 Pet. 2:12 – “Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors…” Could my drinking in public cause other non-Christians to get the wrong impression about my lifestyle? People are looking for any reason to say, “You Christians are hypocritical! There’s no difference between you and me!” And so…\nb. Even though you are drinking in moderation it could be perceived that you are getting drunk which sends the message that you are no better than them. \nc. We must always be aware that we are a representation of Christ and Christianity \n2. Will this encourage someone else to sin? Paul says in 1 Cor. 8:13, “I know I have the personal freedom to eat meat. But if I’m around someone who’s conscience convicts them about eating meat then out of respect for them I’ll refrain from eating meat.” \na. Let’s say you’re out with your friends…\nb. Believers – Could believers who look to me for their example stumble into sin? You’d be surprised how many people look up to us and pattern their lives after watching ours. 1 Cor. 8. Let’s say you’re at a party and you’re drinking and someone with you who used to struggle with alcohol sees you drinking a lot. Because they look up to you they will see that as acceptable behavior and then may end up drinking too much because it’s a struggle for them. So out of respect for them, you refrain from drinking in that situation. \nc. Are you causing someone else to stumble because they are watching you?\n3. Is this becoming an addiction? “…even though I am allowed to do anything I will not become a slave to anything.” (explain this…)\na. But…when you get to the point where you can’t go very long without it…\nb. Every time you go out you HAVE to have that wine or that beer…\nc. You start to use this as a way of escape…It could be the early signs of an addiction.  \nd. (If you can’t drink in moderation it destroys blood vessels and brain cells.) \n\nSo, can a Christian drink alcohol? The quick answer to this question is NO! There is no scripture in the Bible that prohibits drinking but it does teach that getting drunk is a sin (Eph. 5:18). These questions can be applied to a list of questionable activities. Use wisdom as to when you should or shouldn’t drink.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nHow many people's lives will be changed forever because they met you? Today I want to show you exactly how you can have that kind of impact on someone’s life.  \n\nHey what’s up everyone welcome back my name is Allen Parr and we are often told that as Christians we are to make disciples (SCREEN: Mt 28:19-20). But we are seldom told how to do it. So today I want to share with you 4 principles on how to make a lifelong impact in someone else’s life.  And the first principle is…\n\n#1 – Intentionality – Jesus was intentional about selecting the men and women He wanted to pour Himself into. He invited them rather than waiting for them to ask Him. In the same way…\n• Be intentional about finding some people to reproduce yourself into…\n• Make sure they want to be discipled and they see the long-term value in it and they are appreciative of the opportunity to be discipled by you. Faithful and one day will reproduce themselves in other people\n• If you aren’t intentional then it will seldom happen\n\n#2 – Time – This is probably the main hindrance to people making disciples is that it takes “too much time.” \n• Jesus spent over 3 years pouring Himself into 12 men. And as a result after He died these 12 men singlehandedly changed the world. \n• A wise person said if you want to IMPRESS people spend little time with them. If you want to INFLUENCE them spend more time with them. But if you want to IMPACT them spend much time with them. \n• Over TIME you’ll develop their TRUST and once you develop their TRUST you’ll then be able to share TRUTH with them. Once you get to this stage your not just filling their HEAD (how they think) with knowledge you’re impacting their HEART (how they believe) and their HANDS (how they live). \n• SCREEN: One of the best ways to do this is to simply take them along with you to different places that you are already going. \no This will allow them to observe you\no It will allow you to observe them\no Provide teachable moments along the way\n\n#3 – Teaching – Not only did Jesus invest time into his 12 disciples but he taught them while spending time with them. John 17:8\n\nThere are several ways you can do this.\n• Go through a book of the Bible\n\nBut if you’re not confident in leading someone through a book of the Bible…\n• Read a Christian book together and meet each week to discuss it\n• You can share with them wisdom from your own personal experience (but this introduces the principles of TRANSPARENCY)\n• Find interesting articles online for them to read and discuss together\n\nDon’t worry about what you don’t know. Simply teach them what you do know.\n\n#4 – Integrity – Jesus’ disciples followed Him because He modeled everything He was asking them to do (prayer, teaching, Bible study, serving others, etc.) – Nothing will destroy a discipleship relationship quicker than a lack of integrity. The people God has given you are looking up to you as their example (Eph. 5:1). (SCREEN: We will reproduce what we are). \n\nCLOSING\nPeople will forget a sermon and a song but when you have this type of impact on their life they will remember you for a lifetime and then they will then be able to later reproduce themselves in someone else all because you were willing to invest a little of your time.  Never forget that by investing some of your time into even just one person you are making a impact on eternity.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nCareer vs. Calling: What’s the Difference?\n\nDo you have a career or a calling? What’s the difference? That’s what we’re going to talk about today. \n\nI want to talk today about the difference between a career and a calling because a lot of people are very confused about this. And I hear people say “my calling is to be an artist” or “a musician” or a “doctor.” They are mistaking what could be a hobby, passion, talent, side hustle or career for a calling. And so first I want to highlight some differences between the two. Then give some biblical examples of a calling. Finally I want to provide a clear biblical definition of a calling. \n\n#1 – Differences between a Career and a Calling\nCAREER VS. CALLING\nCAREER CALLING\nNatural talents Spiritual Gifts\nPlease your employer Please your God\nCAN do MUST do\nChanges Doesn’t Change\nBenefits for this life ONLY Benefits for Eternity\nAdvance the company Advance the kingdom of God\n\n\nFulfillment that does not compare to your career\n\n#2 – Examples of Careers & Callings\n\nJesus was a carpenter – Career – Calling was to be the Savior of the world\nPaul was a tentmaker – Career – Calling was to be an apostle to the Gentiles\nDisciples were fishermen – Career – Calling was to be “fishers of men.” \nMatthew was a tax collector – Career – Calling was to be a disciple of Jesus\n\nAll of these men used the resources from their careers to support themselves and others. And even though their careers took up a considerable amount of their time they stayed focused and never lost sight of what they knew God had created them to do. \n\n#3 – What is a calling?\nSo what exactly is a calling? A calling is not always some mystical thing that God reveals to only a select few people. \n\nJesus made it very clear that every Christian has the same calling. He said, “Go…make disciples…baptize…teach…” If you are not going, making disciples, baptizing (new Christians) and teaching people how to obey God’s commands then it may be a hobby, a passion, a talent, side gig/hustle but I hesitate to call it a calling. \n\nAnything that an unbeliever can do just as well as a believer can’t be considered a calling. Because if God’s main focus is to advance His kingdom then why would God call you to advance something else? \n\nKEY QUESTION: How does what I do for my calling DIRECTLY IMPACT the advancement of God’s kingdom?\n\nIf you can’t answer that question, then I would hesitate to label it as a calling. \n\nThis is a very controversial and subjective topic so I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject so please leave them in the comments section, tag your friends and invite them to join in the discussion as well and let’s talk about it. If you are struggling to find your specific purpose/calling I encourage you to head over to my blog where I give 7 questions you can ask yourself to discover your specific purpose.

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nWhat is the purpose of fasting? That's what we are going to talk about today.\n\nHey everyone welcome back my name is Allen Parr and today I want to ask and answer three questions…\nRead Isaiah 58:1-9 (3 times in the video)\n1. What is fasting? (sum (hbr) means “to cover” the mouth and nestuo (grk) means “to abstain”)\na. Fasting is when we voluntarily (the Bible doesn’t command it) choose to sacrifice something of value for the purpose of seeking God with more intensity. \nb. Usually it’s food because for most people food is the most difficult thing to give up. However, if food is not it for you (e.g. sex (in marriage), social media, entertainment, etc.)) then you may want to fast from food and something else that you know would be a sacrifice to give up (put some on the screen) and instead dedicate that time to God. \n2. Why should we fast? (many of the great saints in the Bible practiced fasting (Paul, David, Elijah, Jesus, Moses, Esther, etc.)\na. Major Decision – To petition God for direction before making a major decision (Judges 20:26; Acts 14:23)\nb. Personal Revival – To rekindle your passion for God and experience personal revival\nc. Spiritual Strength – When people in the Bible fasted they felt spiritually stronger after the fast (Mt. 4; 17) (If you can’t overcome the power of your belly how can you overcome the power of a demon?)\nd. Health benefits (longer life, resistance to diabetes and other illnesses)\ne. Spiritual leaders encourage it (repentance, mourning, spiritual revival)\n3. How should we fast?\na. Privately – Mt. 6: - Jesus says when you fast don’t walk around with a long face because you’re so hungry in hopes of someone asking you why you’re hungry. \nb. Regularly – (Luke 2:37) – Fasting is not meant to be done once at the beginning of the year and never again. It is supposed to be an ongoing part of your Christian life like prayer and Bible study. \nc. Intimately – In other words, don’t focus so much on what you’re giving up (that’s called a diet vs. fasting) instead focus on developing intimacy with God as a replacement but rather focus on putting your attention completely and totally upon God. \n\nOne of the greatest benefits of fasting is that it exposes the idolatry in your life. When you fast if all you can think about is what you’re giving up instead of focusing on God, it could be that is an idol in your life.",

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nDo you want to have the type of faith that releases God’s fullest blessings on your life? That's what we're going to talk about today on the BEAT.\n\nHey what’s up everybody welcome back my name is Allen Parr and today we are talking about how to increase your faith. Our story today comes from Numbers 13 where Moses had sent 12 men to explore this land that God had already promised to give them. 10 out of the 12 came back and said, “The land is too FORITIFIED the people are like GIANTS in the land. There’s NO WAY that we can get that land!” But 2 of them said, “The land is OURS!” Today I want to share with you the secret to increasing your faith. And the first is…\n\n1. REMEMBER God’s PAST faithfulness\na. God had done some AMAZING things in their past (Red Sea, water from the rock, clothes & shoes grew) (SCREEN: manna, battle victories, etc.). Had they had just remembered what God had done for them in the past it would have given them the confidence to trust God in the present.\nb. So the next time your faith is tested go back and recount all of the times in your past when your back was up against the wall and your faith was tested and God delivered right on time (which is why you should write them down and keep a log. If you don’t do this you will yourself working yourself up into a frenzy every single time your faith is tested which could be every day.) \n\nThe second thing we need to do if we want to see our faith increase is to…\n\n2. REJECT the thinking of negative PEOPLE\na. Notice here in verse 32 it says that these 10 spies “and they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored…” As a result the whole nation of 2 million Jews were filled with fear instead of faith. Why? Because they allowed themselves to be influenced by the 10 spies that had no faith rather than the 2 that did.\nb. In the same way, if you surround yourself with people are who negative and struggle to trust God and have very few testimonies of seeing God’s power work in their lives, that negative thinking will influence you to live in fear rather than faith and you’ll miss out on what God had already intended to give you. \nc. Instead, surround yourself with people who are where you believe you want to be. And let their contagious faith rub off on you and influence you to live in faith rather than fear. \n\nThe third and final thing we need to do to increase our faith is to…\n\n3. RECOGNIZE God’s POWER\na. Notice here that the 10 NEGATIVE spies said, “WE can’t attack those people, they are stronger than WE are…” \nb. But the 2 POSITIVE spies said, “If the LORD is pleased with us, HE will lead us into that land…and HE will give it to us.” \nc. Many of us are like the first group of spies who only considered what THEY could do and totally disregarded God’s POWER. \nd. And when you fail to recognize God’s power you will always struggle with your faith because in many situations your resources, your intelligence, your abilities, your influence and your connections will not be enough and you forget that God is involved and invested in our lives and has power beyond what we could imagine! \n\nNow as a result the Bible says that this generation of Israelites did not receive the blessing of the Promised Land that God intended for them to receive because they had no faith. And in the same way as we transition into a new season there may be some blessings (opportunities, open doors, etc.) that God wants to release in your life and the only key that will unlock them is faith. So I want to encourage you to remember God’s past faithfulness in your life, reject the thinking of negative people and recognize God’s power and that you are not in your situation by yourself.",

(You may need to know the answer to this or you are wondering yourself. That stats are in. 56% of all professing Christians believe there is another way to get to heaven other than Jesus. \nI mean you have Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, JW’s Mormons to name a few. So how can Jesus and Christianity be the ONLY way? Today I want to share with you 4 things that totally set him apart from every other religious leader that has ever lived. \n\n1. Power – No other religious leader DID what He DID\na. Miracles, Resurrections, raised Himself from the dead, He walked on water (even the Holy Qu’ran mentions Jesus’ miracles)\nb. The greatest miracle in the history of time is His own resurrection 3 days after He was crucified in which He showed Himself alive to over 500 people as proof that the resurrection indeed was an actual historical event (add scripture).\nc. Jesus Himself said, “if you don’t believe in my message then fine. But at least believe in the works that I do.” In other words, Jesus didn’t just say He was the only way He backed it up by doing things that no other religious leader has ever done. Not only did Jesus raise Himself from the dead but He prophesied He was going to do it beforehand which leads me to my second reason…\n2. Prophecies – No other religious leader FULFILLED prophecy\na. He was the only religious leader who was able to fulfill prophecies written about Him hundreds of years before He came to the earth – No other leader can boast of that (the odds of 1 man fulfilling 8 prophecies in a lifetime is 1 x 10^17). Virgin birth, prophecies about the exact date when Jesus would die and exactly how He would die. And Jesus fulfilled these prophecies and many others with perfect accuracy.  \n3. Preaching/Message – No other religious leader TAUGHT what He TAUGHT\na. Jesus is the only religious leader who provided a genuine solution for the problem of sin. \nb. Every other religious leader teaches that you must DO something in order to earn salvation & forgiveness which puts you in a very insecure and uncertain state because you never really know if you’ve done enough righteous works to earn God’s favor. \nc. Jesus teaches that He’s already done the work for you. All you have to do is to BELIEVE one thing and you are saved. \nd. All nine of the founders of religions except Jesus admit to going through a period of uncertainty where they were searching for truth and enlightenment. \n4. Perfection – No other religious leader LIVED how He LIVED\na. Some of the other religious leaders even to their own admission led very sinful lives. Some of them were polygamists, others were murderers, some of them made countless prophecies that never came to pass. But Jesus is the only religious leader who lived a sinless perfect life even to the point where the very people who crucified Him admitted that they could find no fault in Him. \ni. Jesus (Jn. 8:46), His followers (Heb. 4:15) and His enemies (John 19:6) all asserted His perfect life\nb. Mohammad confessed his sin and was a man like us – Surah 18:110 – Killed many people who disagreed with him. (also said majority of people in hell would be women)\nc. Siddhartha Gautama, founder of Buddhism abandoned his wife and son to achieve “enlightenment.” \nd. Joseph Smith the founder of Mormonism made prophecies and claims that never came to pass making him a liar and supported polygamy and took on extra wives. \n\nNow for the Christian who says that there is another way to heaven besides Jesus you are saying that the Bible is false (Acts 4:12) and Jesus was a liar (John 14:6) because He said very clearly that He was THE way, THE truth and THE life and that NO ONE can come to the Father except through Him.",

If you’re anything like me you can’t stand waiting in traffic. I can’t stand waiting for people to change and most of all I can’t stand waiting on God to do something in my life. And yet over and over again in the Bible we are encouraged to WAIT! And so today we are going to talk about what it looks like to be patient. \n\nHey everyone welcome back my name is Allen Parr and today we are talking about patience. Now we all know we should be patient at all times but I believe there are 3 specific times in our lives where we need an extra dose of patience and in James 5:7-12 he gives us 3 illustrations to help us better understand patience. \n\n1. Patience with your Circumstances\na. ILLUSTRATION: For this first illustration James uses the example of a farmer. This refers to being PATIENT WITH YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. A farmer as we know has no control over whether or not it’s going to rain, the amount of sunshine, whether or not people will buy their crops or not and yet they still have to plant seeds. \nb. GREEK WORD: Wait – “to look with anticipation” – The reason why a farmer could be patient is because of how faithful God had been in their past. Even though it may take longer than expected a farmer can look back and see that God was faithful to send rain each year.\nc. In the same way…\nd. EXAMPLES:\ni. Unemployment – continue to fill out applications and submit resumes \nii. Business growth/Ministry growth\niii. Promotion on your job – continue to plant seeds\ne. These are all situations that you have absolutely NO control over and yet you have to keep sowing seeds in anticipation that one day your situation will change. \nf. And so in the same way we can be patient and continue to plant seeds \n\nThe second illustration James uses is that of a prophet and this refers primarily with being…\n2. Patience with PEOPLE\na. Prophets – They had to continue to share God’s word with stiff-necked stubborn people who refused to change year after year. \nb. The Greek word he uses here is the word Macrothumeo\nc. Perhaps God has placed some people in your life that refuse to change. (family member, spouse, a child, a boss or coworker). \nd. No matter what you do this person refuses to change. You have clearly shown them what they need to do and the route they need to take and yet they refuse to change. You’ve shared God’s truth with them. It’s clear to you what they need to do and yet they can’t see what you see. For whatever reason they aren’t changing as fast as you would expect them to. This is the second time when we need to make sure we are being patient. \n\nThe third illustration James uses is from the life of Job and this refers primarily to being patient when your PAIN IS UNEXPLAINABLE\n3. Patience with God\na. Job – Lost everything, health, wealth and his family and to his knowledge there was no apparent reason for why he was experiencing this pain. \nb. Hupomeno \nc. You can’t figure out WHY you are experiencing the pain that you’re going through\ni. Physical illness\nii. Unemployed\niii. Loved one who is sick\niv. Spouse who is mistreating you\nd. When we read the story of Job we notice that even though he could not see it God was behind the scenes working things out that Job had no idea about. \ne. In the same way God is encouraging you to remain under the pressure when you don’t understand why you are experiencing pain and what God is doing behind the scenes. \n\nEncourage you to study this passage on your own time or look up other scriptures that will encourage you as you wait on God.",

    "title": "How to Handle Discontentment",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat do you do when you are discontent with where you are and you’re trusting God to promote you to where you want to be? \n\nHey what’s up everyone, welcome back my name is Allen Parr and today we are talking about how to be the type of person that God wants to promote. So I want to give you 3 qualities that I believe that Bible teaches that God is looking for and the first is to…\n\n1. Be Present – Resist the temptation to see where you are now as simply a stepping stone to get to where you think you want to be. \na. In Genesis 39 a man named Joseph finds himself working as a slave out of all positions but yet there is a word that is repeated throughout the chapter which is that despite being a slave God gave him success. In other words, he “bloomed right where he was planted.” \nb. The tendency is to think that because where you are right now is not where you want to be that you can coast and then turn it on later. But God says, “If you’re not faithful in the small things it’s unlikely that you’ll be faithful in the big things.” \nc. Resist the temptation to see where you are now as simply a stepping stone to the next thing in your life because if you do you will often times miss the lesson that God may God want to teach you in the current season you are in. And that lesson may be the very lesson you need to be successful in your next assignment. For this season God has strategically placed you where you are and He can give you success right there. \n2. Be Positive – One of the reasons why God never promoted the nation of Israel to the Promised Land was because of their complaining.  When you find yourself in a position that you feel for whatever reason you shouldn’t be in the tendency is to complain to whoever will listen. Here are 4 reasons why you should limit complaining. \na. Sin – 1 Thess. 2:14\nb. People don’t want to hear it because they have their own problems\nc. It’s contagious\nd. It gets around and often times it gets back to your superior which is the worst thing they can hear about you.\nSo when you are frustrated & discontent in the position you are in resist the temptation to complain. Stay positive and keep a good attitude. \n3. Be excellent – Col. 3:23 says, “whatever you do, work at it with ALL YOUR HEART.” When you’re in a position that you feel is less than ideal the tendency is to do a mediocre job because you lack the passion for it. Often times the bad habits you develop in this season follow you to the next one. \na. Now how do you do this? You do it by Shifting your focus – The Bible says, “whatever you do, work at it with ALL YOUR HEART, as WORKING FOR THE LORD, not for human masters.”\nb. Be dependable – Jesus said, “Let your ‘YES’ be ‘YES’ and your ‘NO’ be ‘NO’” In other words, be the type of person that people can depend on. Develop the reputation of being a person of your word. When you commit to something your teammates can be confident that it will get done on time and with excellence.  \n4. Be Submissive – Resist the urge to take over\na. Start thinking that you can do it better\nb. The key here is to remember that as long as you are in this position your function is to make your superior look better which means you can support with a smile even when you don’t agree with the decisions that are being made. \nc. Joshua/Moses, Elisha/Elijah, Timothy/Paul – God uses and promotes submitted people.\n\nThese are the attitudes that I believe God is looking for. Essentially He says, “He who is faithful in the SMALL (small font) things will also be faithful in the BIG (big font) things.” \nSo, be POSITIVE, be EXCELLENT and be PRESENT and trust God to promote you to the next assignment He has planned for you in His timing.",

    "title": "Why Do We Have Four Gospels?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHave you ever wondered why there were 4 gospels written instead of just one? Stick around and find out why. \n\nHey everyone, welcome back my name is Allen Parr and today we are answering the question, “Why do we have 4 gospels instead of just one?” \n\nThe first thing we have to realize is that each gospel was written by a different person for a difference purpose to a specific group of people. \n\nDuring the time when these Gospels were written there was all sorts of information circulating around written about Jesus. There were healings, miracles, sermons, teachings, parables. Stories about His life, etc. \n\nEach gospel writer carefully selected from this group to convince their particular audience that Jesus was indeed God. \nSo let's look at Matthew\n\nPURPOSE: To convince the Jewish people that Jesus was the promised Messiah whom THEY had just crucified.\n\nHow does he do it? Knowing that the Jews believed in the authority of the OT, Matthew used more OT Scriptures than the other writers to show how Jesus was the fulfillment of over 330 prophecies written about Him in the OT. \nii. Focuses more on how Jesus was the fulfillment of over 330 prophecies written about Him in the OT. \n5. Mark\na. PURPOSE: To convince the Romans that Jesus was the promised Messiah. So Mark had to get into the mind of a Roman and ask, “What is it that would convince me to believe that Jesus is indeed God?” \nb. How does he do it?\ni. His gospel is the shortest because he omitted things about Jesus’ life that would probably not convince a Roman to believe in Jesus.\nii. If you’re a Roman you don’t care where Jesus was born and who His great, great granddaddy is? Just tell me what He can do for ME!\n1. Genealogy & Nativity\n2. Jesus’ long teachings\n3. Omits most OT references\niii. Mark knew that a Roman would be impressed with a God who performed miracles, healings and raised people from the dead. So Mark focused moreso on what Jesus did rather than what Jesus said.  \n6. Luke – Luke was a Gentile (non-Jew) who was writing primarily to a Gentile audience. When Jesus was alive there were all these groups that the Jews considered to be rejects (lepers, prostitutes, Samaritans, Gentiles, Tax Collectors, sinners, etc.) So, Luke says, you know what, “I’m going to write a gospel that will show people that Jesus didn’t just come for the good people, the religious people, the highly aristocratic Jew.” No, Jesus came for people like you and I who messed up our lives, made poor decisions, etc. And so Luke wrote to convince these people that Jesus came for them. \na. Luke includes stories in his gospel that are not found in any of the other 3 gospels to prove that Jesus came not just for the religious Jewish people but for people who messed up their life. (Prodigal Son, Thief on the cross, prostitute, ten lepers, etc.) \nb. So next time you read Luke I want you to notice how Luke wrote to convince people that if you’ve messed up your life, if you need grace or you feel like you’ve made too many mistakes, Luke writes a gospel focused on grace! \n7. John – John’s gospel is unique in that 93% of its content is not found in the other three gospels. John was writing to a general audience and his purpose was to prove that Jesus was God. He did this by focusing on 7 statements that Jesus made about Himself and 8 miracles that Jesus performed during His earthly ministry in hopes of convincing his audience that Jesus is indeed God.",

    "title": "Are Christians Still Required to Tithe?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nIs the OT tithe still required for the NT Christian? \n\nINTRODUCTION:\nFACT #1 – Jesus never taught on tithing even though the subject He taught on more than any other was money. \nFACT #2 – No percentages are given in NT for giving\nFACT #3 – Jesus’ teachings is ALWAYS to go beyond what the law required (lust, love, murder, etc.) (see also, “unless your righteousness exceeds…”\n\nSo, what does the NT teach about giving? \n\nThere are a lot of questions surrounding the question, “Should Christians tithe.” \n1. Don’t limit yourself to 10% – 2 Cor. 9:6\na. Paul introduces us to the simple law of sowing and reaping\nb. God is saying, “I want to bless you far beyond where you think I want to but because you don’t trust you me give reluctantly.” \nc. God wants you to grow – so that just as you are growing in other areas you are growing in your giving as well (make a goal to give one more percentage a year). \nd. God doesn’t promise that His blessings to you will be financial. He just promises that He will bless you according to what you give. \ne. God says, “I’m giving you a blank check where you determine how much you’ll be blessed.” \n\n2. Attitude is more important than the Amount – 2 Cor. 9:7\na. Personal not prescribed – If you want to give 10% then that’s great. \nb. Don’t give because you are afraid if you don’t God will punish you. This passage doesn’t say God will punish you. Rather, it says that the more you give the more God will bless you in return (the law of sowing and reaping).  \nc. Reluctantly – In other words if you are giving a certain percentage because you’ve been taught or pressured to give it but you’re giving it RELUCTANTLY, God says \nd. Don’t give because you were made to feel guilty by a church leader if you didn’t give. \ne. Don’t give because you think it will cover up something bad you did. \nf. When God decides to bless you He is looking at the condition of your heart not your checkbook. \ng. \n3. Giving should be an sacrificial act of faith\na. 2 Cor. 8:1-2 – Paul is speaking here of one of the poorest churches that gave liberally in the midst of a severe trial. \nb. The point here is that even in times of lack we can still be liberal because giving is a sacrifice. David said, “I will not give to the Lord that which costs me NOTHING.”\nc. In the next chapter Paul reminds us that we can give trusting that He is…\n\nSUMMARY\nSo I want to challenge you today not to limit yourself to a 10% blessing, secondly to focus more on your attitude when you give and to give sacrificially even when it hurts trusting that God can bring that and more back to you.",

    "title": "What Happens to People who have Never Heard the Gospel?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWhat happens to people who have never heard of Jesus Christ? \n\nIn order to answer this question I want to separate humanity into 3 groups. The first is the largest group and that is…\n1. Those who HAVE heard of Christ – (Heb. 4:12; John 14:6); Jn. 12:48; Mt. 10:33 – Concerning this group Jesus said, \"There is a judge for those who reject me and do not accept my words. My very words will condemn them at the last day.\" Also elsewhere He says, \"If you deny me before men I will deny you before my Father in heaven.\" (Mt. 10:33; Jn. 12:48). These are going to be the group of people that are going to be punished the most. The emphasis here seems to be on the conscious choice to REJECT Christ and persist in disbelief. And so from these verses and others it is very clear here from these verses that people who make the conscious choice to reject Christ will spend eternity apart from Christ.  \n\n2. Those who have NOT heard of Christ\na. Creation – Rom. 1:20\nb. Conscience – Rom. 2:15\nc. In other words, because God is fair He judges humanity according to the light they have been given which explains why there are different degrees of punishment in hell. \nd. Paul is saying that within every human being lies a conscience. We are created with it. And only God knows how much or how little a person violates their conscience.\ne. Because of this God is going to judge mankind based on how they responded to the light they have been given and the sins they’ve committed (Rev. 20:12).  \nf. For this reason the Bible teaches that there are different levels of punishment in hell (Luke 12:47)\n\n3. Those UNABLE to hear of Christ\na. Babies, mentally ill, etc. – It seems logical to believe that God would be compassionate towards a group of people who were not exposed to creation, did not violate their conscience and were not introduced to Christ because this group is unable to make the decision to reject Christ. \n\nNo one deserves to go to heaven and if God so chooses to allow some to enter that’s His decision. ILLUSTRATION: Dollar bill: For example if I choose to give this $10 bill to one person and not the other I’m not wrong for doing so because it belongs to me AND I don’t have to give it to anyone in the first place. \n\nCONCLUSION: I encourage you not to be too dogmatic on this issue or any issue for that matter that the Bible does not CLEARLY speak about. Instead do your part to make sure as many people as possible have heard about Christ. \n\nIf this video has blessed you in any way I do want to encourage you share it with someone.

Finally, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this issue so please leave them in the comments section below. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time on the BEAT.",

    "title": "How to Manage Your Stress",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nWe live in a time that everyone is overwhelmed, burned-out, and STRESSED OUT! So how do you manage stress……That’s our topic today on the Beat!\n\nHey Everybody, My name is Allen, Today I’VE GOT 4 PRACTICAL TIPS ON HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE STRESS. AND THE FIRST IS……..\n\n1. Master the power of NO or Not Now – (it’s not a sin to say NO…some of us need to get that revelation quick!) (JUST SAY NO).\n\nA major reason why we often feel overwhelmed and stressed is because we struggle saying NO to people. In John 11 – A woman named Mary comes to Jesus and says, “Jesus, my brother, your boy Lazarus is about to die! We need you RIGHT NOW!” To which the Scripture says, “So when He heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.” \n\nNotice that what was an emergency for Mary did not have to become an emergency for Jesus. (EVERYONE’S EMERGENCIES DON’T NEED TO BE YOURS). Often times we allow other people’s deadlines to dictate our schedules and we struggle to say NO or NOT now because we are often driven by our intense desire to gain the approval of people. \n \n2. Be clear on your Purpose and Priorities – Mk. 1:35-39\n\nWhen you’re not clear on your purpose, what ends up happening is that you get pulled in 100 different directions, none of which are related to your purpose or your priorities. \n\nIn Mark 1, Jesus is healing people and casting out demons left and right. And one morning he sneaks away to pray and his disciples find Him and say, “Everyone is looking for you” (in other words, they wanted Jesus to heal them). To which Jesus essentially said, “I’m not here just to heal people I’m here to preach the word of God” and they went to another town. (Jesus performed miracles often times to get people to pay attention to His message)\n\nJesus was clear that His primary purpose was to preach. The more you know your specific purpose the more your life can be focused in one direction. \n\nACTION STEP: Make a list of your top 3 priorities and then assess how much of your life is spent accomplishing your top 3. If it’s not much then you will quickly experience burnout, you’ll feel out of control, which naturally creates stress. \n \n3. Identify your help – Mt. 14:13-21 \n\nOne of the MAJOR reasons why many of us are so stressed out/burned out is because we don’t tap into the help that we have around us. In Matthew 14 the disciples are like, “There’s too many to feed we need to send them away.” And Instead of Jesus trying to feed over 5000 people Himself (even though we know He could have) Jesus says, “(Don’t send them away…YOU all feed them.”) \n\nOur natural instinct at times is to start feeding 5000 instead of looking at ways other people can help us feed 5000. (because we don’t trust people to do it as well as us) And as a result we end up not doing much of it very well.\n\nACTION STEP: Identify the people God has placed around you that can lighten your load; educate them, equip them and then empower them. Train them and then trust them to do it.\n\n4.Schedule your REST – Mark 6:3\n(have you ever been so busy you’ve not even had enough time to eat?) Jesus and His disciples were so busy that at times they didn’t even have time to EAT! And so Jesus’ solution for this is not to grab a red bull, man up and keep it moving. Instead He says to come away WITH ME and rest. You need to be INTENTIONAL about setting aside specific times each week designed for you to rest, relax and recharge. When we consistently fail to have these times we feel depleted, overwhelmed and burned out. Put them on your calendar because if not these times will get replaced with other conflicting activities. If you don’t you will always be giving out and not experiencing a recharge which leaves you feeling depleted, overwhelmed and stressed. \n\nI want to encourage you to apply the 30-day principle – If it’s not going to matter 30 days from now then it’s not worth stressing about today. \n\nIf this video has helped you in any way please feel free to share it with a friend.

    "title": "Can a Christian Lose their Salvation?",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nCan a Christian lose their salvation? In other words, once saved are you saved NO MATTER WHAT…YOU…DO?\n\nHey what’s up everybody? My name is Allen Parr and today we’re asking and answering the question, “Can a Christian lose their salvation?” Now on the surface this may appear to be nothing more than an interesting theological debate, but it actually has very practical implications that can affect the way you live your life on a daily basis. \n\nOn one hand people tend to go to the extreme which is called license. And license says, “I have the license (freedom) to do whatever I want to do. I can live like a heathen because I can’t lose my salvation anyway.” The other extreme is called legalism. And legalism says, “I’m not sure if my salvation is really secure, if I can lose it tomorrow or maybe I’ve already lost it.  So I must work; I must do certain things every day to earn God’s favor and earn His forgiveness. \n\nSo I want to give you 3 reasons why I personally believe that once we are saved we are ALWAYS saved. \n\n1. Our Salvation is ETERNAL - Eternity Past – Eph. 1:4 – This scripture clearly says that before God even formed the world He chose us to be saved. In other words God looked down and saw every mistake you and I were going to make past, present and future and yet He still chose us. So when we say a Christian can lose their salvation what we are saying is that I can do something so bad that is going to catch God off guard to where now God is going to change His mind which implies that God did not know beforehand that I was going to do it. \n\n2. Our Salvation is not based on WORKS – Eph. 2:8-10 – So whenever we say a Christian can lose their salvation what we’re saying but we don’t realize that we’re saying it is, “Jesus whatever you did on the cross wasn’t sufficient. It wasn’t good enough. It was good enough to cover some of my sins but not all of them. So what I must do is take what you did on the cross which wasn’t good enough to cover ALL of my sins and add it to my good works (church going, tithing, abstinence, good deeds, etc.) (CROSS + LIST OF WORKS = SALVATION) and if I obey enough, give enough, serve enough, resist my sinful urges enough then between what I do and what you did I’ll get into heaven. The Bible says our salvation is a GIFT which means it’s FREE! We did NOTHING to earn it therefore there is nothing we can do to lose it. Why? Because if it were by WORKS that we were saved then when we get to heaven we could boast and say that we got there because of something we did. \n\n3. Our Salvation is secure because of God’s POWER\na. John 6:39 says, “And this is the will of God, that I should not lose even one of all those he has given me, but that I should raise them up at the last day.”\nb. John 10:28-29 – These verses indicate that if God has enough power to save someone He has more than enough power to keep them saved and to preserve them. \nc. Love – Rom. 8:38 – When we say a person can lose their salvation what we are saying is that God’s love is like ours. It’s conditional. It’s conditioned upon what we do. And that reduces God’s love from being unconditional to human love which is conditional.\n\n(There’s nothing in the Bible that clearly states at what time you lose your salvation or what you have to do in order to lose it.)\n\nSo, can you lose your salvation? I believe for these 3 reasons and many others I would argue that the Bible teaches that a Christian cannot lose their salvation. \n\nThe biggest argument is…\n\n(Instead of using eternal security as a license to sin and take advantage of God’s grace, instead use it as motivation to praise and serve God more because God didn’t have to choose you but He did in His grace and mercy.)\n\nNow this is a VERY controversial subject and one that I would LOVE to hear your thoughts on so please drop me a comment below either on YouTube or Facebook and let’s talk about it.",

    "title": "HOW TO CONTROL YOUR MOUTH!",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHOOK: This hole and this little red thing inside this hole gets us in more trouble than any other part of our body. So, how do we control it? That’s what we’re gonna talk about today. \n\nINTRODUCTION:\nHey what’s up everyone welcome back to the BEAT. Today we are talking about how to control our mouth (the same advice goes for our communication on Facebook too). And in James 3 the Bible gives us some very practical advice on how to tame our tongue. \n\n#1 – Be AWARE of the PITFALLS\nJames says we ALL stumble in MANY ways and ANYONE who says they are not at fault is PERFECT. The reason why we ALL struggle with our mouth is because there are so many different ways we can sin with our tongue.\n\nSlander, gossip, lie, complaining, critical spirit, cursing, exaggerate, discourage, curse, not following through, dirty jokes, outbursts of anger (aka “go off on folk”), half-truths, sarcasm, boasting, complaining, etc.\n\nAnd so James says because there are so many ways we can STUMBLE we should be mindful of how our mouths can be used to tear someone down.   \n\n#2 – Be INTENTIONAL and Speak positivity – Notice here by using the illustration of a horse to illustrate how something small can a very to make a HUGE positive impact.  \n\nOne of the reasons why this is so critical is because when you praise and encourage people you earn the right to correct them when they are wrong. TRUTH is best received when TIME is invested and TRUST is established and one of the ways of doing this is to be known as an encourager; someone who makes small deposits into people’s lives over time by encouraging them, complimenting them, offering constructive criticism designed to make them a better person and add value to them. And so for many of us because it’s not our nature we need to be INTENTIONAL about speaking LIFE into other people’s lives. \n\n\n#3 – Be CAUTIOUS and THINK before you SPEAK – James says, “consider” or “think about” the fire you could start simply by not filtering what comes in your mind so that it doesn’t come out of your mouth. (Some people have no filter between their mind and their mouth.) I want to encourage you to use this acronym on a daily basis (maybe even a minute by minute basis depending on how bad it is) before you prepare to blast this person with venom. This acronym alone will help many of your relationships thrive. \nT – Is it TRUE?\nH – Is it HELPFUL?\nI – Is it INSPIRING\nN – Is it NECESSARY?\nK – Is it KIND? \n\nJust this acronym alone will save us a world of trouble in our relationships. \n\n#4 – BE GENTLE and Check your Tone – v. 6 – James says here our tongue has the power to “stain the whole body” (ESV) – Wedding dress Illustration: Many of us have really good things to say but it’s never received by others because what we’re saying is not packaged right. People will hardly notice the dress because their focus will be on the stain. Prov. 15:1 – “A soft answer turns away wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger.” Our presentation immediately turns people off so that people don’t receive what we’re saying.",

    "title": "Christians and Pornography | 4 Reasons Christians Should Not Watch Porn",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nVisit my website at www.allenparr.com\nConnect with me on facebook at www.facebook.com/allenparr\nFollow me on twitter at www.twitter.com/allengparr\nSubscribe today at www.youtube.com/thebeatagp\n\nChristians and pornography? The two should not go together. This video provides 4 reasons why Christians should not watch pornography. \n\nWhat’s the big deal about watching a little porn every once in a while? \n\nThe world will say, “There’s nothing wrong with it. You’re not hurting anybody. It’s better than committing adultery or fornication.” But today I want to share with you what I believe are 4 problems associated with watching porn and the first is what I’m calling the…\n\n#1 – The Inverse Effect – The inverse effect says, “The more I look at porn the less our desire will be for my spouse.” This one you can take to the BANK! \n• For example, if you’re married without even thinking about it, you will subconsciously compare your spouse to a world of fantasies and because your spouse may not be able to replicate your fantasy created through watching porn then over time your desire for them will decrease. \n• Why does this happen? (It’s because SATAN TEMPTS US WITH SEXUAL BOREDOM!) Our human nature is naturally attracted to that which is new. And every time we watch porn there is the possibility of being exposed to newness, novelty and variety which could be the antithesis of what you’re experiencing with your spouse which ultimately causes your desire for them to go down.\n\nThe second major problem with pornography is that it creates insecurities. \n\n#2 – Creates insecurities – Watching porn can create insecurities both within yourself and in your spouse. \n• If you’re watching pornography you will subconsciously begin to compare yourself with the people you see on the screen leading you to believe that if I don’t look this way, if I don’t sound this way, if I don’t perform this way then I may not be satisfying to my spouse leading you to feel insecure with how God created you. \n• On the flip side if your spouse knows you are watching pornography, it can cause them to feel like they have to measure up and compete with all the fantasies you are creating in your mind which isn’t fair to them because they are being compared to something that not’s reality. \n\nThe third problem with watching porn is that it…\n#3 – Hinders your spiritual life – Watching pornography is conducive to living in shame and secrecy which is exactly the place where the enemy wants you to be. He wants you to be secretive, embarrassed, ashamed so that you don’t feel comfortable sharing with other people the things that are going on in your life. Not only that, but we can sometimes feel too ashamed to even come to God because we feel dirty (Prov. 28:13). We feel unworthy to pray to God; unworthy to read our Bibles; we feel unworthy to get our prayers answered; we sometimes don’t feel worthy to come to church and we stay away from community because we think if people only knew what I’m dealing with they wouldn’t accept us. For the Christian who is being convicted by the Holy Spirit it hinders us from creating that intimacy with God that we so desire.  \n\nThe fourth problem with watching pornography is that it…\n#4 – Is an insatiable desire – One of the biggest problems with pornography is that it can lead to other forms of sexual sin. In other words it’s only a matter of time before we get bored with the fantasy and want to make our fantasy a reality which means it can lead to \na. Fornication, adultery (married), maybe even swinging, coveting someone else’s spouse.\nb. (Now you tell me…if you’re thinking about this (arrow) all day aren’t you going to want  to eat one sooner or later?) \nOne of the major problems with pornography is that it invites you, it entices you to think that, “Oh if I just watch a little bit of porn I’ll be okay or I just need a little bit more to get by” deceiving you into thinking that it provides relief, when in actuality it slowly enslaves you to the point where before you know it, the more you do it the more you want to do it. \n\nNow I know this is a sensitive subject and in this video I surfaced the problem but stay tuned for my blog this Friday where I provide practical next steps we can take to attack this issue of pornography.

    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHave you ever run out of things to pray for when someone asks you to pray for them? In this video I provide 10 things that every person needs prayer for. \n\nHow do you pray for someone who just says, “I need you to pray for me.” Today I want to introduce you to the BEST prayer that you could ever pray for anyone, at any time in any situation, no matter what. \n\nIn the NT book of Colossians 1 Paul prays this beautiful prayer for the church and you can use this same prayer as you pray for other people and I want to break this down into three categories. First of all you are praying for…\n\n1. Wisdom\na. SCRIPTURE: “We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of His will through all the wisdom and understanding the Spirit gives.” So here you are praying that this person views life through the same lens that God views it and filters every decision through the wisdom found in the word of God. \ni. Family – lead their families in a way that would honor God\nii. Finances – Make good decisions, good stewards, generous\niii. Friendships – Choose the right relationships, and have wisdom to know when to sever the wrong relationships\nb. And so here you are praying that they would apply the WISDOM found in the word of God and that they would know very clearly what God’s WILL is for their life. \nc. Intellectual and Experiential\n2. Walk\na. Paul says here I’m praying “…that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please Him in every way…”\nb. So here you’re praying that a person’s \ni. CONDUCT (how they LIVE)\nii. CONVERSATION (how they TALK)\niii. CHARACTER (integrity) – be CONSISTENT with how Jesus lived His life. So you’re praying that there be no hypocrisy in their life. Here you’re praying that their private life match up with their public life. \nc. How do you do that? Paul says by “increasing in the knowledge of God.” As we grow in our knowledge of God our CONDUCT, our CONVERSATION and our CHARACTER changes because now we are being CONVICTED by the word of God. \nd. You’re praying that they would live their lives in such a way where others can emulate them and follow in their example.  \ne. SCRIPTURE: “…bearing fruit in every good work…”\n3. Weaknesses\na. SCRIPTURE: “…being strengthened in all power…”\ni. Physical weaknesses – physical illness, \nii. Emotional weaknesses (depression, anger, discouragement, loss of hope, low self-image)\niii. Spiritual weaknesses (temptation, if they are feeling and experiencing temptation in a given area where they feel weak and are prone to yield you pray for God’s power to strengthen them. \nb. And to be even more specific you can pray that…“…may have great endurance and patience…”\ni. Difficulty – Loss of a loved one, divorce, broken relationship, financial stress, loss of a job, wayward child, etc. \nii. Hardship\niii. Trial\nc. Endurance – Greek word\nd. God whatever trials they are facing right now I pray you give them the ability to endure and to remain steadfast up under the pressure of the situation. \n\nSo, I want to encourage you today to go out and pray this simple but effective prayer over the lives of your children, your spouse, your loved ones even your enemies. Make it a part of your daily prayer to pray that they would use WISDOM but not just any wisdom but WISDOM found in the word of God and that they would know God’s perfect will for their life. Second, pray for their walk (integrity, etc.). And finally pray for their weaknesses. We all have them and we all need prayer.",

    "title": "How To Get Answers To Your Prayers",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nDo you want to see more of your prayers being answered? Are you tired of praying and not seeing any results? Today I want to share with you how you can pray more effectively. \n\nOkay so today I want to share with you 3 practical ways you can improve your prayer life and hopefully see more answers to prayer (that’s what we all want right?)\n\n1. Pray with a PURE HEART – There are at least 5 reasons that the Bible teaches you can pray as hard as you can and God won’t answer your prayers. \na. Marital conflict – 1 Pet. 3:7 – God is like, “if you’re not treating your spouse right don’t come asking me for anything.”\nb. You’ve offended someone – Matt. 5:23-24 - So if you’ve offended someone and you haven’t sought that person’s forgiveness then God says don’t come asking me for anything. \nc. Unforgiveness – Matt. 6:14-15 – Also if you’re unwilling to forgive others God won’t answer your prayers because you’re not willing to do the very thing that opens up the door for you to even pray to God.\nd. Unconfessed sin – Ps. 66:18 – Also if you have any known sin in your life you should ALWAYS confess it before asking God for anything.\ne. Wrong motives – Jam. 4:3 – You’re asking God for something but it’s really a selfish motivation God may not answer that prayer.  \nf. So make sure to check the condition of your heart before you ever ask God for anything.  \n2. Pray Persistently – Now this is where many of us fail. Do you know why many of our prayers aren’t being answered? It’s because we don’t PERSIST in prayer. We pray one or two times and then when God doesn’t answer we give up. But notice that even Jesus encourages us to pray repeatedly. \na. Matt. 7:7 – He said, “The Bible says, “ask, seek, knock.” When you go to someone’s house you don’t knock one time and expect them to open the door. You keep on knocking until they open the door. Why because you know they are home. In the same way, God is inviting us to keep on knocking on heaven’s door until it opens or until God clearly shows you that it is not His will for your life.   \nb. You may ask, “why won’t God just give me what I want the first time?” It’s because persistent, repeated prayer demonstrates that we truly believe in our heart that the God we are praying to has the ability to bring to pass that which we are praying for.  And faith always pleases the heart of God. Maybe God is waiting for you to continue to persist in prayer before He answers your request.\nc. Luke 18  \nd. ENDING QUESTION: What prayer have you given up on praying for because God hasn’t answered it in your timetable? I encourage you to persist in prayer until you get a clear answer from God no matter how long it takes. \n3. Pray Precisely/Specifically – Have you ever noticed how many of our prayers are basic? I’m reminded of the story in Mark 10 where a blind man is crying our repeatedly, “Jesus have mercy on me” (persistent but not specific) so much so that the people around him told him to shut up. Finally, Jesus invited him to come to him and asked him, “WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO FOR YOU?” And the man said, “I want to see.” And he received his sight. The point is not that the man was healed but rather that Jesus is INVITING us to be more specific with our requests.  It forces you to really think about what it is you are trusting God for. HOW WILL YOU KNOW YOUR PRAYER IS ANSWERED IF IT’S NOT SPECIFIC? If God were to pose this question to you, how would you answer?\n\nSo if your prayer life has gotten a little stale, I want to encourage you starting today that when you pray to make sure that first of all your heart is pure before God, secondly no matter how tired you get to persist in prayer and finally, don’t be afraid to ask God specifically for what you want. God in His word is inviting us to pray this way.",

    "title": "How to Resist Temptation as a Christian",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nAre you feeling strongly tempted? This video provide 3 helpful tips on how to handle temptation. \n\nwww.facebook.com/allenparr - Facebook\nwww.twitter.com/allengparr - Twitter\nwww.allenparr.com - Ministry Website\nwww.youtube.com/thebeatagp - YouTube channel\n\nWhat do you do when you are being strongly tempted and everything in you wants to just give into the temptation? \n\nOkay so temptation is a part of our every day life and there is no sense in praying for it to go away. So in this video I want to give you 3 strategies for how to handle temptation. \n\n#1 – Anticipate the TEMPTATION – Prov. 27:12\n“A wise person foresees danger and takes precautions. The simple go on blindly and suffer the consequences.”\nIn other words if you’re waiting until you are tempted to decide how you’re going to respond often times that’s too late. There are certain seasons in our lives when we can EXPECT to experience high levels of temptation. For example when you’re…\n\n• Hungry (attention, physical touch, affirmation, etc.) – Esau – Gen. 25:34 - When there is something in your life that you strongly crave but you can’t have you’re going to be strongly tempted. \n• Angry – Numbers 20\n• Lonely – David - 2 Sam. 11:1-5\n• Tired – Elijah - 1 Sam. 19\n\nThese are seasons when we need to HALT. We need to slow down and get some people around us to make sure that we don’t do anything foolish! \n\nSecond of all if it’s an area that you feel like you are one bad decision away from giving in to an area that you feel extremely weak in I want to encourage you to take some time to…\n\n#2 – Ask yourself some very HARD QUESTIONS \n\n• How is this going to hurt me? Financial, career, business, reputation, ministry, spiritual life, ability to share my faith with others are who waiting for me to prove to them that my faith is not real, etc. \n• How is this going to hurt the people I love the most? How are the people who look up to me the most going to see me not if, but when I’m exposed? This could be your children, people you are mentoring, people at your job, etc.  \n• How will I feel about this tomorrow? We know how you feel about it right now but…will I regret this tomorrow? \n\nSo, my third and final point is to…\n#3 – Stop playing around with TEMPTATION – One of the main reasons why many of us continue to fall into temptation is because we think we can leave it hanging around and our willpower is strong enough to resist. (late night Facebook chat, “innocent” lunch with co-worker you think is fine, etc.)\n• Jesus said, “If your right hand is causing you to sin then cut it off!” He didn’t say put your hand down. In other words, He was suggesting for us to take radical action. In order to win the battle over temptation you may need to take some radical steps. Because the more we entertain the temptation the more comfortable we get with ignoring that voice inside that is telling us to stop. \n• Delete phone numbers\n• QUESTION: What radical steps are you currently taking or are you willing to take to greatly reduce the chances of you giving in to temptation? I’m not saying to cut your hand off but how can you expect to consistently scoop fire into your lap and not get burned? (PROVERBS 6:27)\n• If someone paid you a million dollars would you stop? \n \nSo, if for whatever reason you do fall into sin and yield to the temptation, don’t punish yourself by getting depressed about it for 3 days. Confess your sin immediately before God, accept His forgiveness, repent and and move on. \n\nThanks so much for watching. The support has been great.

    "title": "How to Handle the Guilt of your Past",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nDo you struggle to accept God's forgiveness? This video provides 4 things that God would say to someone who is struggling with the guilt of their past. \n\nAre you struggling with guilt from your past and do you believe that God has truly forgiven you for it? Are you struggling to believe God has forgiven you because of the guilt of your past?  \n\nWhat would God say to a person who is struggling with the guilt of their past? \n\nOkay so our story today comes from Luke 22 where Peter fails Jesus in an area that he never imagined he would. Peter was the most outspoken of all 12 of the disciples and yet when given the opportunity to take a stand for Jesus he denied that he ever even knew Jesus. And the Bible says that at that very moment their eyes locked and Peter felt so horrible that he began to weep bitterly because he knew he had failed. \n\nWhat would God say to someone like Peter? \n\n1. God specializes in using people who have failed\na. Abraham – Liar – Father of the Jewish Nation\nb. Moses – Murdered a man – Led 2 million Jews free from Egyptian slavery\nc. Rahab – Prostitute – She was in the lineage of people that gave birth to Jesus.\nd. David – Adulterer/murderer – Greatest king of Israel\ne. His son Solomon – 700 wives - Built the first Jewish temple\nf. Fast forward to the NT you have…Paul – Killed Christians – Greatest apostle who ever lived and the one whom the Holy Spirit used to write half of the NT.\ng. Peter – Denied he ever even knew Jesus\n \nQUESTION: Now if God can not only forgive but use murderers, adulterers, prostitutes, polygamists, liars and cowards like Peter what could you have possibly done that would somehow disqualify you from receiving God’s forgiveness? \n\nAnd the first thing He would say would be that He specializes in using people who have made an absolute mess of their life. \n\n2. God already knew about your failures before you did – Lk. 22:34\na. Notice that Jesus predicts that Peter is going to fail him.\nb. God saw every mistake that you have ever made and some future ones you don’t even know about yet and in spite of that He still chose to save you. \nc. You cannot catch God off guard which is the reason why you can displease God but never disappoint Him. \n\n3. God would invite you to turn towards Him – “So when you have repented and turned to me…” – Notice that Jesus is inviting Peter to turn towards him instead of away from him. Our tendency when we fail…again…and again…is to turn away and lock ourselves into a prison of pity. But the best thing you can do when you are experiencing guilt is to turn towards God through prayer, journaling, worship, Bible study, small group community, etc. \n\n4. Use your failures as the fuel that ignites your purpose – Lk. 22:32 – What the enemy wants to do is to influence you to fail and then to be so ashamed of it that you don’t share your mistakes with others and as a result no one else gets the victory. Sometimes the place of our greatest failure can be the place of our greatest ministry. Every time you fail God gives you two gifts (a heart of humility and a heart of compassion). And because of that we are the most qualified to help other people who are struggling in the same ways we previously struggled in. \n\nSUMMARY:\nI want to encourage you today to truly embrace God’s forgiveness and recognize that because you did nothing to earn it, there is absolutely nothing you can do to lose it. \n\n\nwww.allenparr.com\nwww.youtube.com/thebeatagp\nwww.facebook.com/allenparr\nwww.twitter.com/allengparr",

    "title": "How to Forgive When it Hurts",
    "description": "Please watch: \"The ONE Thing Every Christian Should Be Doing But Most Are NOT!\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slK6HI8tUTY --~--\nHow do we forgive those who have hurt us? This video teaches what forgiveness is NOT, how we should forgive and why we should forgive others who have hurt us deeply.\n\nHow to Forgive When it Hurts\nHow do you forgive someone who’s hurt you when everything in you wants to hold on to the pain? \n\nOkay, so before we answer the question “how do we forgive” I want to quickly suggest that…\n• Forgiveness does NOT mean the absence of pain (Joseph and his brothers). When you’ve been hurt it’s absurd to think that you will no longer experience the pain of what happened. The pain can and often times still will be there without the bitterness. \n• Forgiveness does NOT mean reconciliation – When God says forgive it doesn’t mean you need to get back into a relationship with this person. It doesn’t mean you have to give them more chances to hurt you.  \n\nNo, forgiveness simply means “to let go of the anger towards someone who has done something wrong: to stop blaming” \n\nBut the real question is, “how do we do that has hurt us?” \n\n1. Trust God to Deal with them – Rom. 12:17 – Forgiveness is actually an act of faith (most people don’t connect the two) –  – When we choose to hold on to anger, bitterness and thoughts/plans of revenge what we are saying is that that we don’t trust that God is going to deal with them fairly and so I must maintain control and take matters into my own hand and make sure they get what they deserve. (God I don’t trust that you saw the injustice that was done to me and that you are going to do anything about it. So because you aren’t or you’re taking too long I must punish this person myself…making sure they get what they deserve)   \n\n2. Clearly communicate how the person has hurt you (this is not always possible) \no Releases you of this heavy weight that you’ve been carrying inside of you \no You may be helping the other person from committing the same offense to someone else because the truth is they may not even be aware of how deeply they’ve hurt you because they’ve moved on with their life (relationship, marriage, city, church, etc.)  \no Opens the door for possible reconciliation. \n\n3. Pray for them – Matt. 5:44 – If you can get to the point where you can pray for them that means that you have gotten to the point where you want the absolute best for this person’s life which means you no longer secretly wish evil upon them. It means you can celebrate when God blesses them instead of hating on them (Prov. 24:17). One of the ways of helping you get there is to start praying for them (and don’t pray that God curses them…lol). \n\n4. Stop talking negatively  about them – James 4:11 – This is the EASIEST way for you to tell that you have NOT yet forgiven someone. Because when we are angry towards people we want everyone we know and everyone they know to also be angry with them and so we defame their character without them being present to defend themselves. And the Bible calls this slander which is a sin. \n\nI’ve heard it said before that …“Unforgiveness is like drinking a poison and expecting someone else to die.” Finally, realize that you are only hurting yourself when you don’t forgive. In other words…if someone has hurt you, don’t allow them to continue to hurt you by giving them control over your own happiness, your own joy and your own peace of mind. Forgiveness is NOT for the other person, forgiveness is for YOU!\n\nIf you’re watching this on YouTube I’ve got some scripture passages in the comments section below that you can read that will help you \n\n\nAdditional scriptures on forgiveness:\n\nMark 11:25; Matthew 6:14-15; Eph. 4:32; Matthew 18:21-35; Col. 3:13; Matt. 5:23-24; Philemon\n\nLet's connect on Facebook @ www.facebook.com/allenparr\n\nLet's connect on Twitter @ www.twitter.com/allengparr\n\nAlso if you want more on forgiveness please check out my full sermon on this topic on my website at http://www.allenparr.com/audio-sermons/freedom-through-forgiveness/",
