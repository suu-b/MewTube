    "title": "The Case Against Theism - Refuting the Resurrection Argument",
    "description": "I discuss the argument for the resurrection of Jesus, arguing that even when  assuming a maximal set of facts about God and the gospels, naturalistic explanations still account for the evidence far better than the resurrection hypothesis. I discuss a range of evidence from psychology, sociology, and comparative religion, arguing that the resurrection appearances were the result of bereavement hallucinations and collective ecstatic religious experiences, combined with memory distortions and cognitive dissonance. I also discuss explanations for the empty tomb, and highlight problems with the traditional Christian explanation that Jesus was resurrection to vindicate his divine mission to humanity.",

    "description": "An interview with Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, author of the book 'The Future Loves You: How and Why We Should Abolish Death'. We begin by discussing how best to define death, focusing on the idea of death as the permanent disruption of psychological identity, and how such identity is constituted by our personality, desires, and memories. We then consider the science of brain preservation, including the recently-developed technique of Aldehyde-Stabilized Cryopreservation, and how it could be used to indefinitely preserve the brain structure that encodes or personal identity. Ariel argues that such a preserved brain could potentially be used to construct a digital simulation of our brains, essentially allowing us to survive the biological death of our bodies. We conclude by considering some potential challenges of implementign such a technology, and whether it would achieve widespread social acceptance.\n\nAriel's book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Future-Loves-You-author/dp/0241655897\n\nMore on brain preservation:\nhttps://www.brainpreservation.org/how-much-protein-structure-loss-is-there-following-glutaraldehyde-crosslinking/\nhttps://www.brainpreservation.org/large-mammal-announcement/\n\nMapping the Drosophila brain:\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add9330",

In this video I argue that the fine-tuning argument fails for three reasons. First, the argument unjustifiably focuses exclusively on constants while ignoring the equations that give relevance to those constants. Second, we do not know what possible conditions life could exist in if the constants of nature were different. Third, apologists have failed to provide clear and convincing reasons why god would be likely to fine-tune a universe for embodied life. I show how apologetic responses are undermined by lack of imagination and double-standards, rendering the fine-tuning argument an unconvincing argument for theism.",

Rather, I argue that one’s opinion should receive no greater weight in constituting beliefs than does the opinion of any other equally informed person.
