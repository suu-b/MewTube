The \"Last Man\" is here. #nietzsche #philosophy #modernity #dopamine #meaning #nihilism \n\nNietzsche's concept of the 'last man' describes a person consumed by superficial pleasures, a state of being that leads to deep-seated nihilism. This video explores how modern society, with its constant entertainment and dopamine hits, fosters this kind of human psychology, leading to a prevalent sense of emptiness. It serves as a cultural criticism of our current state, arguing that this constant pursuit of shallow 'happiness' is a form of addiction rather than genuine fulfillment, ultimately impacting mental health and leaving us feeling that 'god is dead'.\n\nWatch the full dismantling here: https://youtu.be/OLYeUwiGZl8\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon for deep-dive philosophy: https://www.patreon.com/TheDrDerek\n\n#Aquinas #Nietzsche #Philosophy #Dopamine #MentalHealth #Stoicism #Existentialism #Shorts #Psychology #Truth #SelfImprovement",

Lewis's \"The 3 Parts of Morality\" from his book \"Mere Christianity,\" originally radio talks given by Lewis during World War II between 1941 and 1944. The BBC had invited Lewis to speak to the nation during a time of crisis, and Lewis rose to the occasion to deliver a rational, cogent case for Christianity.\n\nThis short landmark piece is important for at least 3 reasons: \n• (1) it offers a balanced, three-dimensional view of morality (external harmony, internal harmony, and final destination) not often seen or appreciated in modern accounts of moral philosophy/ethics, \n• (2) it underscores the necessity of inner virtue (the 2nd part), which is tied essentially to interpersonal relations (the 1st part), and \n• (3) it connects morality to ultimate purpose and religion (the 3rd part—the general purpose of human life), which grounds why we do the other 2 parts at all.\n\nIt is my view that Lewis is borrowing this framework from earlier ancients and medieval philosophers, prominently among them St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\n⚠️NOTE: I'll answer questions from the chat periodically, so please ask good ones!⚠️\n\nLINKS TO DOCUMENTS:\nThree Parts of Morality:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gdujzk1gkt6fw3c88ii8v/3.Lewis-C.S._Three-Parts-of-Morality.pdf?rlkey=fmvv2mnn0qfjvrzfr8010f2rd&st=1b2bl6h9&dl=0\n\n\n👉See when I'm LIVE:\nyoutube.com/@DrDerekMcAllister/streams\n\n➡️Check out my PLAYLISTS for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@DrDerekMcAllister/playlists\n\n❤️‍🔥FOLLOW ME on Social Media!❤️‍🔥\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallister\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallister\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith,  #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemic, #evidence, #proof, #support, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #Whatistruth, #journey, #seek, #believe, #true, #truth, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics,#disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #Ontology, #Axiology,  #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts,#hope, #relativism, #Christian, #godless, #engineering, #engineer, #Jesus, #God, #Bible, #Reaction, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #Sikhism, #Zoroastrianism, #Shintoism, #Confucian, #Bahai, #Jainism, #Unitarian, #Orthodox, #orthobro, #philbro, #Oriental, #Prostestant, #Presbyterian, #Reformed, #Anglican, #Baptist, #Lutheran, #Episcopal, #Evangelical, #Calvinist, #Methodist, #Adventist, #Pentecostal, #nondenominational, #Mennonite, #Quaker, #Brethren, #Pietist, #Anabaptist, #Keswickian, #Charismatic, #bornagain, #Irvingian, #Oneness, #denomination, #Education, #YouTube, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism,  #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #debate, #discussion, #destroy, #communism, #leftist, #left, #right,  #pagan, #socialism, #socialist, #Marxism, #Marxist, #proletariat, #freedom, #propaganda, #radical, #fascism, #fascist, #totalitarian, #government, #DeconstructionZone, #PraiseIAM, #AlexOConnor, #CosmicSkeptic, #MattDillahunty, #AtheistExperience, #CameronBertuzzi, #CapturingChristianity, #BartEhrman, #Hermeneutics, #fyp, #foryoupage, #foryourpage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant. This isn't just about ancient Greece, of course; it is a problem that still resonates today in discussions about morality and religion.\n\n➡️ ➡️ ➡️Check out my Playlists for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/playlists\n\n👉See when I'm live:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/streams\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT) \n(But it's summer and school is out)! \n\n❤️‍🔥Dr. Derek McAllister on Social Media❤️‍🔥\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallisteryoutube\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallisteryoutube\n\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #Apologetics, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #worldview, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Goodness, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Universe, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #Reason, #Purpose, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Education, #YouTube, #Plato, #Euthyphro, #Socrates, #AncientPhilosophy, #GreekPhilosophy, #fyp, #foryourpage, #foryoupage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant. This isn't just about ancient Greece, of course; it is a problem that still resonates today in discussions about morality and religion.\n\n➡️ ➡️ ➡️Check out my Playlists for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/playlists\n\n👉See when I'm live:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/streams\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT) \n(But it's summer and school is out)! \n\n❤️‍🔥Dr. Derek McAllister on Social Media❤️‍🔥\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallisteryoutube\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallisteryoutube\n\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #Apologetics, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #worldview, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Goodness, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Universe, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #Reason, #Purpose, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Education, #YouTube, #Plato, #Euthyphro, #Socrates, #AncientPhilosophy, #GreekPhilosophy, #fyp, #foryourpage, #foryoupage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

    "description": "Taken from LiveStream 11.The Euthyphro Dilemma: Is Morality Real, Or Just God's Opinion? https://youtube.com/live/Fs5swh6uE2s\n\nThe Euthyphro Dilemma is a common challenge posed by atheists regarding the nature of morality and divine commands. The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant. This isn't just about ancient Greece, of course; it is a problem that still resonates today in discussions about morality and religion.\n\n➡️ ➡️ ➡️Check out my Playlists for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/playlists\n\n👉See when I'm live:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/streams\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT) \n(But it's summer and school is out)! \n\n❤️‍🔥Dr. Derek McAllister on Social Media❤️‍🔥\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallisteryoutube\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallisteryoutube\n\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #Apologetics, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #worldview, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Goodness, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Universe, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #Reason, #Purpose, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Education, #YouTube, #Plato, #Euthyphro, #Socrates, #AncientPhilosophy, #GreekPhilosophy, #fyp, #foryourpage, #foryoupage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant.

    "description": "Taken from LiveStream 11.The Euthyphro Dilemma: Is Morality Real, Or Just God's Opinion? https://youtube.com/live/Fs5swh6uE2s\n\nThe Euthyphro Dilemma is a common challenge posed by atheists regarding the nature of morality and divine commands. The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant. This isn't just about ancient Greece, of course; it is a problem that still resonates today in discussions about morality and religion.\n\n➡️ ➡️ ➡️Check out my Playlists for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/playlists\n\n👉See when I'm live:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/streams\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT) \n(But it's summer and school is out)! \n\n❤️‍🔥Dr. Derek McAllister on Social Media❤️‍🔥\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallisteryoutube\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallisteryoutube\n\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #Apologetics, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #worldview, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Goodness, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Universe, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #Reason, #Purpose, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Education, #YouTube, #Plato, #Euthyphro, #Socrates, #AncientPhilosophy, #GreekPhilosophy, #fyp, #foryourpage, #foryoupage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

    "description": "Taken from LiveStream 11.The Euthyphro Dilemma: Is Morality Real, Or Just God's Opinion? https://youtube.com/live/Fs5swh6uE2s\n\nThe Euthyphro Dilemma is a common challenge posed by atheists regarding the nature of morality and divine commands. The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant. This isn't just about ancient Greece, of course; it is a problem that still resonates today in discussions about morality and religion.\n\n➡️ ➡️ ➡️Check out my Playlists for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/playlists\n\n👉See when I'm live:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/streams\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT) \n(But it's summer and school is out)! \n\n❤️‍🔥Dr. Derek McAllister on Social Media❤️‍🔥\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallisteryoutube\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallisteryoutube\n\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #Apologetics, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #worldview, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Goodness, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Universe, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #Reason, #Purpose, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Education, #YouTube, #Plato, #Euthyphro, #Socrates, #AncientPhilosophy, #GreekPhilosophy, #fyp, #foryourpage, #foryoupage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

    "description": "Taken from LiveStream 11.The Euthyphro Dilemma: Is Morality Real, Or Just God's Opinion? https://youtube.com/live/Fs5swh6uE2s\n\nThe Euthyphro Dilemma is a common challenge posed by atheists regarding the nature of morality and divine commands. The Euthyphro Dilemma directly touches upon God's nature and the source of moral values, the nature of morality, meta-ethics, and different ethical frameworks. Anyone who is interested in the areas of Philosophy, Ethics, Theology, and Apologetics will find this topic highly relevant. This isn't just about ancient Greece, of course; it is a problem that still resonates today in discussions about morality and religion.\n\n➡️ ➡️ ➡️Check out my Playlists for more Philosophy training:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/playlists\n\n👉See when I'm live:\nyoutube.com/@TheDrDerek/streams\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT) \n(But it's summer and school is out)! \n\n❤️‍🔥Dr. Derek McAllister on Social Media❤️‍🔥\ntiktok.com/@dr.derek.mcallister\nderek-mcallister.com\nx.com/DerekMcAllister\ninstagram.com/drderekmcallisteryoutube\nthreads.com/@drderekmcallisteryoutube\n\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #MoralRelativism, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #Apologetics, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #worldview, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Goodness, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Universe, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #Reason, #Purpose, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning, #MoralRealism, #MetaEthics, #MoralFacts, #Atheism, #Atheist, #Education, #YouTube, #Plato, #Euthyphro, #Socrates, #AncientPhilosophy, #GreekPhilosophy, #fyp, #foryourpage, #foryoupage\n\n🎙️ New to streaming or looking to level up?

Bring your questions!\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #reasoning, #pragmatism \n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g",

Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #reasoning \n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g",

Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

He is not the originator of the 5 Ways; that we owe to Aristotle!\n\nWays 1-3 here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n\nThis LiveStream 6 and 7 are a continuation of LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason and all the topics below\n- Is belief in God merely based on Faith? \n- Or can I use my Reason to know that God exists? \n- Aquinas's view on the harmony between Faith & Reason\n... \nPlease watch that LiveStream in conjunction with this one!\n\nChat is open.

Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other.

    "description": "@DerekLMcAllister  Taken from LiveStream 8.Why You Should Believe in God (Pascal's Wager): https://youtube.com/live/QpZbHQBNKBw\n\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)! Chat is open. Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

    "description": "@DerekLMcAllister  Taken from LiveStream 8.Why You Should Believe in God (Pascal's Wager): https://youtube.com/live/QpZbHQBNKBw\n\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)! Chat is open. Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

    "description": "@DerekLMcAllister  Taken from LiveStream 8.Why You Should Believe in God (Pascal's Wager): https://youtube.com/live/QpZbHQBNKBw\n\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)! Chat is open. Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

    "description": "@DerekLMcAllister  Taken from LiveStream 8.Why You Should Believe in God (Pascal's Wager): https://youtube.com/live/QpZbHQBNKBw\n\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)! Chat is open. Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

    "description": "@DerekLMcAllister  Taken from LiveStream 8.Why You Should Believe in God (Pascal's Wager): https://youtube.com/live/QpZbHQBNKBw\n\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)! Chat is open. Bring your questions!\n\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

    "description": "@DerekLMcAllister  LiveStream 8.Why You Should Believe in God (Pascal's Wager).\n\nUsual time: THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)! Chat is open. Bring your questions!\n\n0:00 Introduction & Common Objections\n1:30 Pascal’s Life and Scientific Legacy\n6:30 Pascal’s Religious Conversion\n8:00 \"The Memorial\"\n11:30 From Reason to Faith\n13:00 Pascal’s Religious Writings & Lifestyle\n14:30 Setting Up the Wager\n18:00 The Conditional Framework\n21:00 The Wager: Infinite vs. Finite Consequences\n26:30  Decision Matrix Explained\n33:00 The Many Gods Objection\n37:30 Response: Probability Matters\n42:00 Live Chat Critiques & Clarifications\n45:00 Does the Math Work?\n48:00 Pragmatic vs. Evidential Arguments\n52:00 Can You Choose to Believe?\n1:01:00 Voluntarism & Belief Formation\n1:02:51 The Impossibility Objection\n1:05:00  Final Q&A & Objection Handling\n1:13:28 What is your definition of Atheism?\n1:24:08 What grinds my gears...\n1:26:41 The Irrationality Objection\n1:27:18 I'm Liberal with respect to Evidence\n1:34:09 The Impossibility Objection 2.0\n\n(0) Discover the reasoning behind Pascal's Wager and why you should believe in God. This video explores the concept of taking a leap of faith and the philosophical arguments that support belief in a higher power.\n\n(1) Here, in this current LiveStream 8, we examine Blaise Pascal's famous \"Pascal's Wager\": \n- \"Yes, but you must wager. There is no choice, you are already committed. Which will you choose then? Let us see: since a choice must be made, let us see which offers you the least interest. You have two things to lose: the true and the good; and two things to stake; your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to avoid: error and wretchedness. Since you must necessarily choose, your reason is no more affronted by choosing one rather than the other. That is one point…\" \n\n(2) We'll also be examining in particular this controversial passage: \n- « Naturellement même cela vous fera croire et vous abêtira. »\n- \"Naturally, even this will make you believe and will stupefy you.\"\n\n\n(3) See also my last LiveStreams on Thomas Aquinas's 5 Ways (or arguments for the existence of God):\n- LiveStream 6 (Ways 1-3) here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n- LiveStream 7 (Ways 4-5) here: https://youtube.com/live/klp4_mqRr24\nThese two are a continuation of \n- LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason.\n\n\n(4) See also my recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\nTags: #Philosophy, #Metaphysics, #Epistemology, #Ethics, #PoliticalPhilosophy, #Morality, #Goodness, #HistoryofPhilosophy, #IntrotoPhilosophy, #Faith, #ReasonvsFaith, #ReligiousRelativism, #MoralRelativism, #Whatistruth, #philosophy, #Christianity, #Catholicism, #Catholic, #faith, #journey, #seek, #believe, #belief, #religion, #religiousbelief, #epistemology, #epistemic, #freedom, #TrustingGod, #Apologetics, #DefenseofChristianity, #DefenseofFaith, #ChristianApologetics, #Hinduism, #Buddhism, #Islam, #Judaism, #disagreement, #worldview, #science, #technology, #philosophy, #worldview, #true, #truth, #Ontology, #Axiology, #Morality, #Goodness, #Whatisphilosophygoodfor, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Cosmos, #Cosmic, #CosmicReality, #CosmicRays, #CosmicUnderstanding, #Universe, #Universespeaks, #Whydoscientistsdisagree, #Scientificstudies, #FlatEarth, #MoonLanding, #Aristotle, #Aristotelian, #AristotlesFourCauses, #4Causes, #FourCauses, #Teleology, #FinalCause, #Purpose, #Reason, #Aristotle, #Purpose, #Reason, #SciencevsPhilosophy, #Scientism, #Whatisphilosophy, #Religiousfaith, #faithinGod, #Aquinas, #FaithorReason, #WhattoBelieve, #LeapofFaith, #Pascal, #Stupid, #Stupefy, #Soul, #PhilosophyofReligion, #HistoricalPhilosophy, #Logic, #Reasoning",

He is not the originator of the 5 Ways; that we owe to Aristotle!\n\nWays 1-3 here: https://youtube.com/live/LJoLjdusi54\n\nThis LiveStream 6 and 7 are a continuation of LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason and all the topics below\n- Is belief in God merely based on Faith? \n- Or can I use my Reason to know that God exists? \n- Aquinas's view on the harmony between Faith & Reason\n... \nPlease watch that LiveStream in conjunction with this one!\n\nChat is open.

    "description": "​@TheDrDerek  LiveStream 6.God's Existence: Aquinas's Ways 1-3.\n\nWeekly at THURSDAY 5:00pm (EDT)!\n\n0:00 Introduction to Aquinas's First 3 Ways\n0:48 Clarifying \"Proving God's Existence\"\n2:10 Historical Context: Enlightenment & Postmodernism\n6:41 Sources & Historical Endorsement of the Arguments\n11:01 Navigating Aquinas's Summa Theologiæ\n14:16 The 1st Way: Argument from Motion - Premise 1\n16:30 The 1st Way: Argument from Motion - Premise 2\n17:41 The 1st Way: Argument from Motion - Premise 3\n19:02 The 1st Way: Argument from Motion - Premise 4\n21:40 The 1st Way: Argument from Motion - Conclusion\n27:52 The 2nd Way: Argument from Causation\n37:55 Proof of God?\n43:19 Attributes of the First Cause\n48:30 Addressing \"God Needs a Cause\" Criticism\n52:50 The 3rd Way: Argument from Possibility & Necessity\n1:10:25 Aristotle's Arguments for a Creator\n1:14:20 Debunking Explanations for Religion\n\nMy recent interview with Elijah Moore:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLGoYVxqE4g\n\n\"Does God Exist?\" Join in as we discuss Ways 1-3 for God's existence: \n- (1) the Cosmological Argument from Motion, \n- (2) the Cosmological Argument from Efficient Causes, and \n- (3) the Argument from Possibility & Necessity. \nWe find these three arguments (and the 5 Ways in general) in Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologiæ I.2.3.co (https://www3.nd.edu/~afreddos/summa-translation/Part%201/st1-ques02.pdf) and his much longer Summa Contra Gentiles (https://basilica.ca/documents/2016/10/St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas-The%20Summa%20Contra%20Gentiles.pdf). He is not the originator of the 5 Ways; that we owe to Aristotle!\n\nThis LiveStream 6 is a continuation of LiveStream 5 (https://youtube.com/live/a15uctOT5sY), in which we laid the groundwork for these arguments for God's existence when we discussed Faith vs. Reason and all the topics below\n- Is belief in God merely based on Faith? \n- Or can I use my Reason to know that God exists? \n- Aquinas's view on the harmony between Faith & Reason\n... \nPlease watch that LiveStream in conjunction with this one (and future ones on the remaining 5 Ways)!\n\nChat is open.

He earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Baylor University, a M.A. in Philosophy from University of Arkansas, and M.A. in Philosophy of Religion and Ethics from Talbot School of Theology. His academic work centers around depression from a philosophical perspective, in particular, examining the modern-day concept of depression in comparison with many other symptomatically similar historical conditions—e.g., sloth/acedia, immoderate sorrow, melancholy, Kierkegaardian despair, the dark night of the soul, etc. His research draws upon themes in St. Thomas Aquinas, Søren Kierkegaard, St. John of the Cross, and the Desert Fathers.\n\n\nMedia Coverage:\nhttps://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/259219/mother-teresa-s-spiritual-darkness-was-not-depression-or-loss-of-faith-scholar-explains\nhttps://www.catholicworldreport.com/2024/09/10/mother-teresas-spiritual-darkness-was-not-depression-or-loss-of-faith-scholar-explains/\nhttps://cathnews.com/2024/09/12/mother-teresas-spiritual-darkness-was-not-depression-or-loss-of-faith-scholar-says/\n\nMother Teresa Center website: \nhttps://www.motherteresa.org/\n\nMother Teresa Institute website: \nhttps://www.motherteresainstitute.org/\n\nPlease like, subscribe, and share! :)",
