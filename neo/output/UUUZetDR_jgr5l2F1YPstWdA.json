    "description": "In his interaction with the rich young ruler, Jesus is recorded saying \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone\" (Mark. 10:18). This is red meat for skeptics and Muslims who understand this verse to be a refutation of the Christian claim that Jesus is divine. This video will show you why the exact opposite is the case. With that response, Jesus is actually implying his divinity, not denying it. Check out this video to learn more about how to defend the divinity of Jesus, a key topic in Christian apologetics.

    "description": "Is our universe an incredible accident—or is there something more behind its design?\nThe odds of our universe being just right for life are astronomically small. Yet here we are. How did this happen? In this video, we explore the fascinating concept of fine-tuning—the idea that the laws and constants of nature are precisely calibrated to allow life to exist.\n\nWe’ll examine the leading explanations:\n- Pure luck: Maybe we just won the ultimate cosmic lottery.\n- The anthropic principle: Of course we observe a life-permitting universe—otherwise, we wouldn’t be here to notice.\n- The multiverse: With countless universes, at least one was bound to be life-friendly.\n- A fine-tuner: Could the precision of our universe point to a Creator?\n\nBy the end of the video, you’ll see why fine-tuning remains one of the most powerful arguments for God’s existence — and why the competing theories fall short. Check it out to learn more about one of the key topics in Christian apologetics.\n\n0:00 What is fine-tuning?\n1:05 Example #1\n2:08 Example #2 \n2:39 Example #3 \n3:23 140+ Parameters\n4:08 The anthropic principle\n5:44 The multiverse hypothesis\n8:25 A designed universe",

If so, doesn’t that mean that Jesus knew perfectly well that he wasn’t going to sin anyway? It sure seems so, which, in turn, suggests that Jesus’s temptation wasn’t really a temptation.

How many blind men did Jesus heal – was it 1 or 2? And where did the healing happen – as Jesus was entering Jericho or as he was leaving?

All he did was explain what he believes to be right and wrong. The truth is, however, that a description of one’s beliefs about morality is not at all the same thing as grounding morality within one’s worldview.

    "description": "Bart Ehrman offers us the following case against the historicity of Jesus' resurrection: In Mark, we may well find the claim that Jesus rose from the dead. However, the story abruptly ends with the women not telling anyone about the risen Christ because they’re afraid. Nor is there any mention of Jesus appearing to anyone. Mark is the earliest of the four gospels. Thus, the accounts we find in the later three gospels, where the women tell others about the risen Christ, and where the risen Jesus appears to them, don’t represent what actually happened. Instead, they are theologically motivated embellishments of the story, smuggled in by Matthew, Luke, and John in order to bolster the made-up narrative of a risen Christ. This video is my response to Ehrman's claim.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:22 Ehrman's Case\n1:54 Saying nothing?\n3:33 The silent leper?\n4:07 Appearances expected\n5:03 The fall of Troy\n5:59 Conclusion",

    "description": "Genetically Modified Skeptic recently published a Shorts where he claims that Christian education (or Christian PhDs in particular) is bigoted. He adds that religious apologists aren't properly informed about how atheists think or what they believe. This, according to Drew aka Genetically Modified Skeptic, should suffice to call their arguments into question. Interestingly enough, in another video, Drew complains about Christians who stereotype others in an attempt to serve the biases of their in-group. Well, could it be that Drew's rant at \"bigoted Christian PhDs\" is exactly such an act of \"brazingly stereotyping others?\" Here's my response.\n\nLink to Drew's original video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VXNgLpo_Ig0\nLink to Drew's comment about stereotyping others:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5_wQFiL7dc&t=136s at 2:10",

    "description": "We are often told, especially on the internet, that Christians hold on to their belief out of their need for some magical skydaddy. This is essentially the modern rehashing of Sigmund Freud's claim that \"belief in a personal God is psychologically rooted in the notion of an exalted father figure.\" However, what most atheists don't realize is that Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, didn't just link belief, but also disbelief in God, to psychology. It was Freud's assessment that tipped off Stanford psychologist Paul Vitz to look into the psychological factors that may lead people to atheism. Studying the lives of prominent atheists (such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Feuerbach, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Arthur Schopenhauer) Vitz concluded that one of the key reasons behind disbelief is related to people's relationship with their father, something he came to call the \"Defective Father Hypothesis.\" This video will look at Vitz's study and show why atheism is rooted by far not only in science and reason, contrary to what internet atheists want you to believe.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:42 Atheist Voices\n1:29 Freud's Key Analysis\n2:51 Vitz's Hypothesis\n4:30 Feuerbach, Freud & Co.\n5:58 Fathers of Prominent Theists\n6:36 Vitz's Findings\n7:12 Objections\n9:04 Final Thoughts\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE ---\nTiktoker: Jesus NEVER Claimed to be God! https://youtu.be/jMOv2davpvA\n\nOn Idolatry of the Supernatural, Feelings & Truth (with  Melissa Dougherty) \nhttps://youtu.be/-KuWiqluQGs\n\nThis is why the Cause in the Kalam is PERSONAL https://youtu.be/mbQTuqxuc9o\n\nThe WEIRDEST Argument Against Eternal Life https://youtu.be/G-85HiL9_sM\n\nAnimal Pain isn’t THAT BIG of a Problem\nhttps://youtu.be/ir9eUQonbnY\n\nThis Atheist TikToker Just OWNED Herself! https://youtu.be/Lm9mlx4D-sg\n\nLet's get to know the REAL Whaddo You Meme?? https://youtu.be/ij8HsdDS_8g\n\nYour Beginner’s Guide to Learning Apologetics https://youtu.be/X-WraiScbaY\n\nIs God Hiding from Alex O'Connor? https://youtu.be/V-WVboyyrH0\n\n3 Reasons Why You CAN Trust the Gospels https://youtu.be/W6bxUK-PI2A\n\nGenetically Modified Skeptic’s WILD View on Evil https://youtu.be/AAAqIgcRrIM\n\nAre the Gospels RELIABLE?

    "description": "The issue of hell, talking snakes, or the lack of evidence for Jesus are reasons why Apostate Ashley, a famous Tiktoker, moved from being a pastor to an atheist. In this video, I look at some of the reasons she mentions for her deconversion and offer a response. So, this is like a quick apologetics run through a couple of popular objections against Christianity This video comes with a portion of sarcasm and humor. It's not something I usually do, but I wanted to give this a try. I'm aware that some people might get offended by this which is why I pre-emptively mention this here to clarify that it is not my intention to offend but to simply mix argumentation with humor/sarcasm. Again, I consciously gave the pushing of boundaries a try and based on the reactions I'll get, I'll decide whether this was a good idea or not.

    "description": "The claim that Jesus didn’t think of himself as being God isn’t a new one. Here is YouTuber and Tiktoer Morgue who tries his best to rehash the age-old case for a nothing-but-human Jesus of Nazareth. He quotes texts from both the Old and the New Testament, but in doing so, he misses what the doctrines of Christ’s incarnation and of the Trinity actually teach. While Morgue thinks that the Bible remains entirely silent on the claim that Jesus is divine, the exact opposite is the case. This video is my response to Morgue and explains why the conclusion of a divine Jesus follows naturally from the Biblical text.\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE ---\nOn Idolatry of the Supernatural, Feelings & Truth (with  Melissa Dougherty) \nhttps://youtu.be/-KuWiqluQGs\n\nThis is why the Cause in the Kalam is PERSONAL https://youtu.be/mbQTuqxuc9o\n\nThe WEIRDEST Argument Against Eternal Life https://youtu.be/G-85HiL9_sM\n\nAnimal Pain isn’t THAT BIG of a Problem\nhttps://youtu.be/ir9eUQonbnY\n\nThis Atheist TikToker Just OWNED Herself! https://youtu.be/Lm9mlx4D-sg\n\nLet's get to know the REAL Whaddo You Meme?? https://youtu.be/ij8HsdDS_8g\n\nYour Beginner’s Guide to Learning Apologetics https://youtu.be/X-WraiScbaY\n\nIs God Hiding from Alex O'Connor? https://youtu.be/V-WVboyyrH0\n\n3 Reasons Why You CAN Trust the Gospels https://youtu.be/W6bxUK-PI2A\n\nGenetically Modified Skeptic’s WILD View on Evil https://youtu.be/AAAqIgcRrIM\n\nAre the Gospels RELIABLE?

    "description": "The Kalam Cosmological Argument is arguably one of the most mentioned ones in debates between Christians and atheists. The former frequently mention that the cause which the Kalam deduces must not only be spaceless, timeless, and immaterial, but also personal. While the reason for the first three characteristics can be apprehended fairly easily, it is not immediately clear why the cause talked about in the Kalam should refer to a personal agent also. This lack of clarity seems to play a significant role in the contention put forward by atheists who say that the Kalam may, if granted, get you to some cause behind the universe, but it would get you nowhere close to a personal God. However, upon closer inspection, it turns out that the opposite is the case. This seems to have been conceded by Alex O'Connor aka @CosmicSkeptic  in his conversation with William Lane Craig from @ReasonableFaithOrg. Check out this video to find out why the Kalam cosmological argument, if taken to be sound, does indeed imply a cause that is not only spaceless, timeless, and immaterial, but personal as well.",

    "description": "Is the amount of suffering animals have to endure compatible with the belief in an all-loving and all-powerful God? Many skeptics would say that it isn’t. The problem of animal suffering has gained prominence on YouTube especially after @CosmicSkeptic released his Biggest Case Against Christianity a while ago (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KDnnp0sDkI&t=429s). I have already responded just after Alex’s video came out. This video is a basic and general consideration of the problem of animal suffering. Its purpose is to lay out and critically consider the key assumptions that are typically brought to the table when the problem of animal suffering comes up.

    "description": "Here's an important note: When I say \"... since [the laws of nature] were as inexistent BEFORE the beginning of the universe as the universe itself, to which they apply, was inexistent\" this wording isn't quite accurate for the following reason: Time only came to exist with the beginning of the universe, and so with the universe not existing, there is no \"before\" because there is no time in the first place. What would be more accurate to say is that the laws of nature are inexistent WITHOUT the universe and its beginning. Though I'm fully aware of that,  I chose the \"before\"-wording since a 1-min short only gives you a limited amount of time to make a point. By default, most people think that there is a \"before\" the beginning of the universe, though, again, this notion is not coherent. I chose to go with that since I would have had to explain why \"without the universe\" is a more accurate way of talking (and again, 60 seconds aren't quite enough to mention all of this). Thus, my explanatory note here. Also, I will have a longer video come out on the topic of the personality of the cause which the Kalam cosmological argument deduces, and there, I will mention the very issue described here.",

    "title": "Is God Hiding from Alex O'Connor?",
    "description": "Why does God not reveal himself to skeptics and atheists who are genuinely open to a relationship with him but simply don’t find the evidence for his existence convincing? That's the question Alex O'Connor (aka @CosmicSkeptic), Justin Brierley (@PremierUnbelievable) and I discussed in person at Wycliffe Hall in Oxford on July 11, 2022). The issue is known in philosophy as the problem of divine hiddenness and it has been phrased as a formal argument against God by JL Schellenberg in 1992. In its basic form, it looks as follows:\n\nP1: If God exists, there are no nonresistant nonbelievers.\nP2: There are nonresistant nonbelievers.\nC: Therefore, God does not exist.\n\nBy resistant non-belief, Schellenberg describes the attitude of those atheists, agnostics, or skeptics who are not opposed to the notion of entering into a personal relationship with God. However, they simply don't find themselves believing in him. Resistant non-belief, on the other hand, describes the attitude of those who would refuse to enter into a relationship with God even if they believed that he exists.\n\nAlex O'Connor describes himself as a non-resistant non-believer and has said that he would happily worship God if he believed that he existed. For him, the problem of divine hiddenness is, therefore, not just another philosophical argument to be intellectually assessed. Instead, it's a matter that is directly relevant to his personal life. That's why our conversation was not so much a technical back and forth over the issue at hand as much as it was a reflection on it in light of Alex's experience. I hope you enjoy it!\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:37 Chatting & Warm-Up\n6:34 The Conversation\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nLet's get to know the REAL Whaddo You Meme?? https://youtu.be/ij8HsdDS_8g\n\nGenetically Modified Skeptic’s WILD View on Evil https://youtu.be/AAAqIgcRrIM\n\nAre the Gospels RELIABLE?

    "description": "Are the Gospels reliable? There are three lines of evidence that suggest that what we find in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John goes back to eyewitness testimony of people who actually knew Jesus. This video will show you why there are plenty of good reasons to trust the gospel accounts. The reliability of the New Testament Scriptures is a key topic in Christian apologetics and Biblical studies. What you will learn here is that archaeology, the gospels' corroboration by outside sources, and their accurate description of the geography of first-century Palestine make for a strong cumulative case for the historicity of the four gospel accounts.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:09 #1 Corroboration by outside sources\n1:45 #2 Archaeology\n3:03 #3 Geography\n4:26 Luke the Historian\n5:30 The Skeptic's Failed Case\n\nThe link to the source I mention (at 1.39) that talks about very specific details in the gospels (pertaining to technology, politics etc.) which are corroborated: https://ratiochristi.co.za/undesigned-coincidences-in-the-scriptures-an-argument-for-their-veracity-part-2/\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nGenetically Modified Skeptic’s WILD View on Evil https://youtu.be/AAAqIgcRrIM\n\nAre the Gospels RELIABLE?

    "description": "The “pink t-shirt me” represents Genetically Modified Skeptic and the “blue t-shirt me” is, well, me. Just a little disclaimer in order for you to understand the story that’s happening in the background.\n\nNot too long ago, Drew aka @GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic put out a response to Greg Koukl from @STRvideos. As part of that response, Drew discussed the problem of evil. Most atheists claim that the problem of evil is internal to Christianity only, and Drew is no exception as he repeatedly asserts this point in his video. Now, if you, as an atheist, deny moral realism (the view that good and evil exist objectively), you are 100% justified in locating the problem of evil in Christianity (or in theism, in general). However, an atheist who affirms moral realism (i.e. an atheist who affirms that good and evil are objective) has his own problem of evil to deal with as he or she needs to give an account of how good and evil are to be grounded. In this video, I will point out that Drew presupposes, even for his own self-identity, the existence of objective morality. This means that he is among those atheists who face the problem of accounting for evil (and for good), just like Christians do. In other words, it won’t do for him to simply regurgitate the “evil is an internal critique of Christianity” slogan that’s popular among atheists. Yet, it seems that that’s all he’s got to offer. And it’s not even half of it, because Drew goes on to blatantly contradict himself by both affirming and denying the existence of objective moral facts. Enjoy!\n\nLink to Drew’s original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsw-lSp3rq8&t=1224s\nThe three relevant quotes about evil being a problem that’s internal to Christianity appear at 25.11, 26.46, and 29.36. They are part of the greater section in which Drew responds to Greg Koukl’s explanations about the moral argument and the problem of evil (21.45-31.50).\n\nLink to Drew's video about humanism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ1TJ7oUMHg&t=735s\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:19 The Basics\n0:40 Drew’s\n2:39 The Key Issue\n4:12 Drew Contradicts Himself #1\n6:12 Drew Contradicts Himself #2\n8:07 100% Cognitive Dissonance\n9:37 Drew’s Failure Sealed\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nAre the Gospels RELIABLE?

    "description": "Skeptics often raise the following two objections against the gospels and their reliability: First, the authors didn’t identify themselves, which means that these stories might not actually have been written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Second, there are too many differences between the four accounts. These discrepancies supposedly show that the writers got their facts about the story of Jesus wrong or, worse still, that they made things up. This video will respond to both objections and show why they really don’t make for good arguments against the reliability of the gospels.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:13 Anonymous?\n1:36 Differences\n2:16 The Concert\n3:52 Jesus in Jericho\n5:03 Skeptics Debunked\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE ---\nWhy Science & Religion Are NOT Enemies https://youtu.be/1hKGFb8EtIY\n\nWhy it’s 98% Certain That There’s NO Tree of Life: https://youtu.be/dT08h5dhTxM\n\nThis is How the New Testament Teaches the Trinity: https://youtu.be/CSnQszDym_o\n\nAnd THIS is my Solution! https://youtu.be/cqhgflrsF-8\n\n3 Lessons I Learned From LOSING Arguments: https://youtu.be/n3fGhWqJij4\n\nStephen: Still CLUELESS About Free Will & Neuroscience: https://youtu.be/Ov63anUrEv8\n\nA Meaningless Universe?

    "description": "Can a living cell be built by mere chance or the bare necessities of natural law acting on dead matter? How did the genetic code originate? Can naturalistic processes explain the origin of the protein production process in the cell? In this interview, I’m joined by Rob Stadler (Ph.D. Medical Engineering MIT) who has written about the question of the origin of life in his book “Stairway to Life.” He sheds light on several biochemical phenomena which elude naturalistic explanations and raises the question of whether the methodological naturalism prevalent in the sciences is still justified. The truth is that various aspects of the cell machinery resemble the kind of systems human engineers come up with. Accordingly, the question of whether biochemical structures have been engineered or designed is raised naturally.\n\nCheck out Rob’s work here: https://www.scientificevolution.com/\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:39 What got you into science?\n2:18 Why study the origin of life?\n5:54 Widespread misconceptions\n7:25 Plausibility of naturalistic processes?\n10:00 Stadler’s case in summary\n11:30 Homochirality of building blocks\n15:05 Consistent linkage of building blocks\n18:11 Biopolymer reproduction\n 22:15 Self-defeating experiments?\n24:54 Repairing biopolymers\n28:56 Cell membranes\n33:49 Harnessing energy\n38:32 Why do naturalistic hopes persist?\n40:51 Methodological naturalism\n44:19 Objections to Rob’s case?\n47:35 God or naturalism of the gaps?\n51:43 The Urey-Miller experiment\n52:58 Changing philosophy of science?\n56:46 Polarization\n57:59 Harold Urey’s article of faith\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE ---\nWhy Science & Religion Are NOT Enemies https://youtu.be/1hKGFb8EtIY\n\nWhy it’s 98% Certain That There’s NO Tree of Life: https://youtu.be/dT08h5dhTxM\n\nThis is How the New Testament Teaches the Trinity: https://youtu.be/CSnQszDym_o\n\nAnd THIS is my Solution! https://youtu.be/cqhgflrsF-8\n\n3 Lessons I Learned From LOSING Arguments: https://youtu.be/n3fGhWqJij4\n\nStephen: Still CLUELESS About Free Will & Neuroscience: https://youtu.be/Ov63anUrEv8\n\nA Meaningless Universe?

    "title": "Rationality Rules Does NOT Understand Christianity",
    "description": "Why does God punish people infinitely in hell for the finite amount of sins they committed during their earthly existence? Stephen Woodford aka @rationalityrules recently critiqued hell as he responded to a discussion on the topic of hell between Cameron Bertuzzi from @CapturingChristianity and William Lane Craig from @drcraigvideos. The problem of hell is a serious one, for sure, and one that repeatedly comes up in Christian apologetics and debates between Christians and atheists or skeptics. Unfortunately, however, various misconceptions about what Christian doctrine actually teaches about the afterlife cloud people’s understanding of hell, and Stephen Woodford is no exception. In this video, I will show why Rationality Rules’ has essentially attacked a straw-manned version of hell that isn’t taught by Christianity. I hope that this video will help you grasp the basic Christian teaching about heaven and hell as well as help you understand why the notion of God’s love is perfectly consistent with it.\n\nStephen's original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp1drSc8gfU&t=1s\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:38 Cameron, Craig & Carlin\n1:06 Carlin’s Clip\n1:42 Stephen’s Case\n3:26 It’s NOT Christian Doctrine\n3:55 A Small Advice\n4:28 Actual Christian Doctrine\n5:54 Infinitely Unrepentant?\n7:03 Hell vs. God’s Love and Power?\n10:50 Hell is Unpleasant\n12:22 Non-Resistant Skepticism & Hell\n14:22 Deal with the Data\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE ---\nWhy Science & Religion Are NOT Enemies https://youtu.be/1hKGFb8EtIY\n\nWhy it’s 98% Certain That There’s NO Tree of Life: https://youtu.be/dT08h5dhTxM\n\nThis is How the New Testament Teaches the Trinity: https://youtu.be/CSnQszDym_o\n\nAnd THIS is my Solution! https://youtu.be/cqhgflrsF-8\n\n3 Lessons I Learned From LOSING Arguments: https://youtu.be/n3fGhWqJij4\n\nStephen: Still CLUELESS About Free Will & Neuroscience: https://youtu.be/Ov63anUrEv8\n\nA Meaningless Universe?

    "description": "Paleontology poses an insurmountable challenge to the theory of evolution. Charles Darwin himself predicted that countless intermediate animal forms must exist within the fossil record, given that organisms gradually evolved from one species into the next. However, what the fossil record actually shows is the exact opposite, namely, that whenever new species appear, they do so suddenly and without evidence of precursory forms in the geological record. The most prominent example is the so-called Cambrian explosion which happened around 530 million years ago, when about 20 animal phyla suddenly showed up on the stage of life out of the clear blue, as it were, but with no intermediate forms from the Precambrian strata. Given that no attempt to reconcile paleontology with evolutionary theory has succeeded, Darwinian evolutionists have come to admit that the fossil record doesn’t fit with their theory, as we will see at the end of this video. For the same reason, they’ve started to turn their focus towards another field of study in their search for support of evolution: Homology and phylogenetic trees. This episode assesses these efforts and shows why neither homologous structures nor tree of life studies support evolutionary theory.\n\nThis series is a partnership between my channel and Discovery Institute, the main think tank on the topic of Intelligent Design and the interface between science and religion. \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:27 Recap\n1:23 Homology and Phylogenetic Trees to the Rescue\n1:59 The Basics of Homology\n4:15 From Homology to the Tree of Life\n7:06 General Assessment\n8:00 Gene-Gene Comparisons\n9:53 Gene-Morphology Comparisons\n11:01 Morphology-Morphology Comparisons\n12:14 Discarding Paleontology?\n14:21 The Verdict\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE ---\nThis is How the New Testament Teaches the Trinity: https://youtu.be/CSnQszDym_o\n\nAnd THIS is my Solution! https://youtu.be/cqhgflrsF-8\n\n3 Lessons I Learned From LOSING Arguments: https://youtu.be/n3fGhWqJij4\n\nStephen: Still CLUELESS About Free Will & Neuroscience: https://youtu.be/Ov63anUrEv8\n\nA Meaningless Universe?

    "description": "The word “Trinity” cannot be found in the New Testament (nor in the Old Testament, for that matter). This is part of the reason why skeptics and unitarians sometimes claim that the Trinity isn’t actually a concept that the Bible teaches. Instead, it’s a pagan invention that was added to Christianity long after the time of Jesus and the apostles. In this video I will lay out why the teaching of the New Testament implies that God is three persons in one nature and that the notion of God being triune is right there in the text.

    "description": "Are the days in the Genesis creation account meant as literal 24-hour days? I believe there are very good reasons to believe that they are NOT primarily because the Old Testament writers frequently use the word “day” (yom in Hebrew) in a generic sense to speak about a period of time, just as we do when we say, for example, that in this day and age, most people have an Instagram account.”\n\nFor example, in Joshua, it says that “Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua” where the word “days” is clearly not meant to be understood as 24-hour periods. Even in the creation account itself, yom is used in a non-literal fashion when the writer summarizes what God did during the entire creation week by talking about “… the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.” [Gen. 2:4]\n\nThe Bible offers us good reasons to hold that the days in Genesis are not literal 24 hour periods, and I hope this video gives you a good reason to subscribe so that you get my videos in days to come. Check out this video to learn more about a key apologetics issue at the interface between science and faith.",

    "description": "Do Christians really follow Christ or not? Do they actually care for others, as Jesus told them to, or are they self-centered? Joe Rogan and Jim Gaffigan recently talked about this issue, claiming that most Christians don't seem to apply the teachings of Jesus as recorded in the Bible. I uploaded a Youtube short in response to that and got a lot of great comments in return. Unfortunately, however, I didn't find the time to reply to these which is why I decided to make a video in which I take up some of the feedback I got. Thus, this video is both the story of my struggle to keep up with everything that's happening on my channel and my response to some of the comments I got.

    "description": "What do you do when you go blank in a discussion? What when you lose an argument or don’t know how to answer a question? If you’re involved in apologetic, philosophical, or theological conversations with skeptics or atheists, you will probably know what it feels like when things don’t go as you expected them. I believe that anyone who’s involved in Christian apologetics and engagement with non-Christians does well to actually think through the “loser scenario” and wrap his head around how to deal with it. In this video, I share from my own experience what these rather uncomfortable moments have taught me and offer a few simple reflections based on the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. No matter whether you’re a Christian, atheist, or skeptic, I hope this video encourages you for your engagement with “the other.” Enjoy!\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:31 My Story\n1:51: It's Normal\n2:18 Honesty\n3:55 Being a Disciple\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY —\nStephen: Still CLUELESS About Free Will & Neuroscience: https://youtu.be/Ov63anUrEv8\n\nA Meaningless Universe?

The Joe Rogan Podcast  recently hosted comedian Jim Gaffigan as the two of them challenged followers of Jesus to ACTUALLY follow him, rather than just claiming to do so. I’m aware that it may be difficult for some of us to accept such criticism. But the Bible offers us plenty of examples in which God used the most unlikely people outside the community of faith to challenge those who claim to be his servants. Thus, let’s not too quickly dismiss what non-Christians have to say about us.",

    "title": "Stephen: Still CLUELESS About Free Will & Neuroscience",
    "description": "The claim that neuroscience has debunked free will has become fairly widespread. Rationality Rules, one of the most prominent atheist YouTubers, is at the forefront preaching this exact message. He proclaims that “science is telling us loud and clear and unequivocally that while our feelings of free will are real free will itself is an illusion.” His case is based on what are arguably the two most often-cited studies in neuroscience which presumably showed that determinism is true and free will doesn’t exist (which means that by watching my video you’ll not only get to see my response to @rationalityrules but you’ll learn about the nuts and bolts that are behind the popular claim that neuroscience has debunked free will). The first one is the work of Benjamin Libet, a pioneering neuroscientist who published a groundbreaking study in the early 1980s. The second one is the work of Chun Siong Soon. This video is part #2 of my response to Stephen’s case (part #1 is here: https://youtu.be/RYUV5DyQxH4). It continues with the analysis of Stephen’s treatment of Libet’s work and looks at his utilization of Soon’s work, too. One of the most eye-opening lessons you will learn is that neuroscience doesn’t show that we form our decisions before we become aware of them, contrary to the claim that’s at the core of Rationality Rules’ argument. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg… I hope you will enjoy this video which deals with a key theme in Christian apologetics and in debates between skeptics and Christians.\n\nStephen's original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Oyi1T-HmU&t=375s\n\nFor most of my criticism, I follow Albert R.

The reason for this is the following: Only actions that are consciously chosen are morally relevant, which doesn't apply to homosexuality, according to Alex. However, in his case for determinism and against free will, Cosmic Skeptic tells us that none of our actions are undergirded by choice. This would mean, however, that morality, as Alex himself defines it, doesn't even exist. And yet, Cosmic Skeptic happily moves on to try and educate us on all sorts of ethical issues.

    "title": "A Meaningless Universe? The Peterson-Krauss Conversation",
    "description": "Jordan Peterson and Lawrence Krauss recently talked about the beginning of the universe and its meaning. Krauss believes that there is no objective purpose to our existence, adding that “we create our own purpose.” Peterson, on the other hand, holds that meaning isn’t something that you create. Instead, it’s “out there” and it “bursts on you,” particularly in the form of scientific discoveries which reveal the structure upon which the universe is built. Krauss’s argument against an objective meaning behind the universe comes from his observations as a physicist. He states that while the universe fundamentally operates in ways captured by quantum physics, we render our day-to-day description of the world around us in the terms of classical physics. He takes this to mean that the world around us is not only an illusion but also devoid of any purpose. This conversation really caused me to wrestle personally with the question of meaning. I believe that philosophically speaking, Krauss’s argument fails. If we’re just a “momentary accident,” as he puts it, we cannot also be “special,” as he moves on to assert. Christian theism as well as atheist thinkers such as Sartre, Camus, and Russell have argued that without eternity as part of your worldview,  you end up with nihilism and your existence is meaningless. However, in everyday life, people don’t constantly think about eternal life, and yet they feel that their existence is meaningful. This is why the Peterson-Krauss conversation caused me to wrestle personally with the question of how useful the discussion about meaning actually is. Check out the video about a key topic in Christian apologetics and debates between atheists, skeptics, and Christians. I hope you enjoy it and look forward to hearing your feedback.\n\nLink to original convo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF_SwujfiYk&t=6115s\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:33 Quantum Physics, Classical Physics & Illusions\n2:32 No Purpose?\n3:46 Leaping into Purposelessness\n4:28 A Momentary Accident?\n5:59 Meaning & The Comparison of Numbers\n7:52 The Wrong Timescale\n10:04 Meaning: Discovered or Created?\n12:24 Can You Be A Special Accident?\n13:30 Eternity\n15:41 The Ultimate Tension\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Messing with Darwin: https://youtu.be/wvtIGXcKpnM\n\nStephen Has NO CLUE About Neuroscience & Free Will: https://youtu.be/RYUV5DyQxH4\n\nThe Trinity in the Old Testament: https://youtu.be/nBOnFI7VaGY\n\nMy Cumulative Case Against Cosmic Skeptic: https://youtu.be/i44EOOtiAes\n\nCosmic Skeptic EXPOSED: He's Got NO ETHICS At All! https://youtu.be/L117Iw9Gh4M\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Still NO Fossils!!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-F8NJgLAkA&t=2s\n\nDoes the Trinity Make Sense? https://youtu.be/VUJm0ga424Q\n\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "title": "Basics of Intelligent Design: Messing with Darwin",
    "description": "In the 1970s and 1980s, two American paleontologists came up with a revolutionary attempt to reconcile Darwinian evolution with the fossil record. Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge called their hypothesis “Punctuated Equilibrium.” This theory holds that evolution doesn’t happen slowly, gradually, and continuously, but rather rapidly and in limited periods of time. The key argument with which Gould and Eldredge backed up their unconventional theory is known as allopatric speciation. Punctuated Equilibrium created significant noise in the scientific community as it challenged the key tenets of Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism, and it came to be referred to as “evolution by jerks” and “Punk Eek.” The hypothesis fails in various respects, however, and even Gould himself, recognizing the significant shortcomings and inconsistencies of Punctuated Equilibrium, later started to reconcile his theorizing again with Neo-Darwinian orthodoxy. This means, that the Cambrian explosion and the lack fo intermediate forms in the fossil record persists as a serious challenge to evolutionary theory. This episode in our series on Intelligent Design and critical thinking about evolution will cover all the basics and relevant aspects you need to know about Punctuated Equilibrium. Punctuated Equilibrium is the last major attempt of Darwinists to reconcile paleontology with evolution and its failure seems to seal the incompatibility of Darwinian theory with the fossil record once and for all. Join me for this episode which lays another important foundation upon which the argument for Intelligent Design will later be built.\n\n0:00 Intro & Recap\n2:58 What is Punctuated Equilibrium?\n4:51 What led to Punk Eek?\n6:18 Allopatric Speciation\n8:40 Species Selection\n10:32 No Pool Available\n11:28 Large Populations Needed\n14:25 No Complex Traits\n18:12 Punk Eek Retreats\n19:47 Back to Square 1\n\nThis is the third video of an ongoing series on the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design debate. My aim is to make the basics of Intelligent Design and of critical thinking about evolutionary theory available to the uninitiated viewer. I will unpack, in a step-by-step fashion, why the complex, specified information we find in organisms of the animal kingdom is better explained by the theory of Intelligent Design than by Neo-Darwinism.\n\nThe videos in these series are based on the New York Times bestseller “Darwin’s Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design” by Stephen C. Meyer (Revised ed. Edition, San Francisco: HarperOne, 2014). In fact, the videos can be thought of as summaries of the most essential points of Meyer’s book.\n\nThis series is done in partnership with the Discovery Institute, the leading Intelligent Design think tank (https://www.discovery.org/). The Discovery Institute is sometimes accused of advancing Biblical creationism disguised as science. This is an ad hominem attack that does nothing to address the actual arguments that are being put forward by Intelligent Design theorists. Besides, the accusation reveals ignorance of the fact that there is a wide range of atheist and agnostic scientists who consider Intelligent Design a legitimate scientific hypothesis. Nevertheless, one of my videos will talk about how the hypotheses advanced by Intelligent Design and creationism are fundamentally different.\n\nI have not received formal training in evolutionary biology. However, I have spent a great amount of time studying Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design over the last three years. I am mentioning this for two reasons: First, this is simply a matter of transparency and intellectual honesty, which are, I believe, key, as we’re dealing with a controversial topic. Second, I’m aware that the fact of me not being an evolutionary biologist will be used by critics in the attempt to undermine the credibility of the arguments I offer here. However, the validity of an argument is not affected by the question of who advances it. Therefore, questioning my content because I’m not an evolutionary biologist (or, a scientist, for that matter) is logically fallacious. In addition, the following may be pointed out: Unless the person who offers such criticism is him or herself an evolutionary biologist, advancing such criticism is at best hypocritical and at worst self-defeating. For if the credibility of my arguments is supposedly questionable due to me not being an evolutionary biologist, why should the critic’s criticism of my arguments be any more credible, given that he or she isn’t an evolutionary biologist either?\n\nAs always, I'm thankful for feedback!",

    "title": "Stephen Has NO CLUE About Neuroscience & Free Will",
    "description": "The claim that neuroscience has debunked free will has become fairly widespread and Rationality Rules, one of the most prominent atheist YouTubers, is at the forefront preaching this exact message. He proclaims that “science is telling us loud and clear and unequivocally that while our feelings of free will are real free will itself is an illusion.” His case is based on what are arguable the two most often-cited studies in neuroscience which presumably showed that determinism is true and free will doesn’t exist (which means that by watching my video you’ll not only get to see my response to @rationalityrules but you’ll learn about the nuts and bolts that are behind the popular claim that neuroscience has debunked free will). The first one is the work of Benjamin Libet, a pioneering neuroscientist who published a groundbreaking study in the early 1980s. The second one is the work of Chun Siong Soon. This video is part #1 of my response to Stephen’s case (part #2 will follow later) and it deals exclusively with Stephen’s treatment of Libet’s work. One of the most eye-opening lessons you will learn is that Benjamin Libet himself never thought of his work as providing evidence for determinism and against free will. Quite the opposite, actually. This means that Rationality Rules has essentially hijacked and abused Libet’s work for a case that Libet himself would never have supported. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg… I hope you will enjoy this video which deals with a key theme in Christian apologetics and in debates between skeptics and Christians.\n\nStephen's original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Oyi1T-HmU&t=375s\n\nFor most of my criticism, I follow Albert R. Mele’s work “Free: Why Science Hasn’t Disproved Free Will” (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014).\n\nA big THANK YOU to my friend Dan Miller who helped me a great deal to think carefully about the issues pertaining to free will and determinism.\n\n0:00 Intro & Disclaimers\n2:37 Libet's Study\n6:01 Problem #1: Libet vs Stephen\n8:44 Problem #2: Random vs Non-random Decisions\n12:11 Problem #3: 50% Data Missing!\n15:56 Preview\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nThe Trinity in the Old Testament: https://youtu.be/nBOnFI7VaGY\n\nMy Cumulative Case Against Cosmic Skeptic: https://youtu.be/i44EOOtiAes\n\nCosmic Skeptic EXPOSED: He's Got NO ETHICS At All! https://youtu.be/L117Iw9Gh4M\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Still NO Fossils!!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-F8NJgLAkA&t=2s\n\nDoes the Trinity Make Sense? https://youtu.be/VUJm0ga424Q\n\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "title": "How Progressive Christians Butcher the Bible",
    "description": "Brandan Robertson is a famous progressive Christian TikToker, busy telling everyone that God is fine with a sexually liberal lifestyle. According to him, homosexual relationships are fully in line with the Bible. And so is polyamory. In a recent video, he talked about polygamy and polyamory (the two are not the same, btw). He claimed that the former is an oppressive form of relationship that's not widely practiced today, and yet, it's condoned in the Bible. Polyamory, on the other hand, is not talked about in Scripture but is still sanctified as holy. Clearly, Brandan got things upside down because the creation account in Genesis, Jesus, and the Old, as well as the New Testament, teach that sexuality is meant for one man and one woman united in marriage as husband and wife. Progressive Christianity, however, is ready to twist Scripture for its agenda and so, it is really no surprise to see Brandan Robertson, arguably one of the most well-known progressive Christians, doing exactly that. Watch this video on one of the most pressing cultural issues facing the church and contemporary Christianity today!\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:50 PolyGAMY & PolyAMORY\n1:20 Brandan's Case\n2:55 His Core Claim\n3:36 My Critique\n5:25 Brandan trumps Scripture?\n6:42 Polygamy in the Bible\n8:05 Double-Twist\n8:44 Follow Christ & Your Desire?\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nThe Trinity in the Old Testament: https://youtu.be/nBOnFI7VaGY\n\nMy Cumulative Case Against Cosmic Skeptic: https://youtu.be/i44EOOtiAes\n\nCosmic Skeptic EXPOSED: He's Got NO ETHICS At All! https://youtu.be/L117Iw9Gh4M\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Still NO Fossils!!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-F8NJgLAkA&t=2s\n\nDoes the Trinity Make Sense? https://youtu.be/VUJm0ga424Q\n\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "description": "God is three in one — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This is one of the most fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith. However, how do you derive the Trinity from the Bible? In particular, can the Trinity be found in the Old Testament or is it only present in the New Testament? This video will look at a range of different OT passages, starting from Genesis, to the Psalms, Ezekiel, and Isaiah, and show you how they point to God being triune. The truth is that the Old Testament is full of passages that cannot be reconciled with unitarianism (the view that God is one in nature and one in person), but they make perfect sense against the backdrop of Trinitarianism, which tells us that God is one in nature and three in persons.

    "title": "My Cumulative Case Against Cosmic Skeptic",
    "description": "Here's to a deep dive into Alex O'Connor's worldview! Over the past months, I've put out several responses that are either directly or indirectly related to his moral philosophy. In this video, I'm combining all of my counter-arguments into one cumulative case against @CosmicSkeptic. I will show how his case against free will essentially eradicates morality as he himself defines it, thus depriving all of his moral reasoning of a proper ontological foundation. We will also see how his meta-ethical framework doesn't even qualify as an ethical theory, properly speaking. Even if it did, however, it would still have to be rejected for its absurdity as it condones rape as the moral option in a wide variety of cases. In addition, Alex's biggest case against Christianity based on animal suffering directly contradicts his quasi-utilitarian ethical theory which puts the pursuit of pleasure at its center. These are, I suggest, some of the biggest inconsistencies within Alex's worldview. Even so, as I point out in the end, I believe we have a lot to learn from Cosmic Skeptic, not simply because he is a sharp thinker, but much more because he takes the question of how we ought to live very seriously on a personal level. Enjoy!\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:56 Case #1: Free Will vs. Morality\n6:10 Case #2: He's Got No Ethics\n12:40 Surprise: A Tough Contradiction!\n13:44 Case #3: Animal Suffering vs. Alex's Ethics\n20:49 Case #4: The Absurdity of Condoning Rape\n22:56 Summarizing Alex's Problems\n25:13 Case #5: The Personal Stuff\n\nHere are the links to Alex's videos:\nOn homosexuality and the moral sphere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgHl2KcadEU&t=202s\nHis meta-ethical theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htdDaHAhR-s&t=3888s\nAlthough it's a couple of years old, Alex still stands by the views expressed there as he links this video in more recent videos when making reference to his meta-ethical theory.\nMost of the quotes I use are taken from this video. However, due to the low audio quality of the video, I decided to relay these quotes in writing rather than to offer video inserts.\nHis biggest case against Christianity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KDnnp0sDkI&t=28s\nThe video in which he condenses his ethical theory (used in my vid at 17:10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAwG4h8NQgI&t=448s\nEach one of my individual responses has further disclaimers that are more specific to the issues Alex and I raise. However, I didn’t include them here lest the vid description becomes too long. Check the video description or pinned comment under my responses for more info.

    "title": "Cosmic Skeptic EXPOSED: He's Got NO ETHICS At All!",
    "description": "Alex O’Connor, arguably the most influential YouTube atheist, believes that there is a way to set up objective morality within a naturalistic worldview simply by talking about the science behind and our beliefs about pleasure. His claim is that his ethical framework does face the problem of crossing the is/ought divide as he argues in a utilitarian-like fashion that true beliefs about pleasure establish what is morally right whereas false beliefs about pleasure establish what is morally wrong. However, this simply doesn’t work and in this video, I’m going to point out why @CosmicSkeptic seems to be misled by a fatal equivocation. In addition, he himself actually admits that his ethics is not actually ethics, properly speaking. Thus, one wonders: How can Alex continue to talk about animal rights, charity, and other moral issues, taking an objectivist moral standpoint, given that he himself pronounces his ethics as unviable? Ethics is one of Alex’s favorite subjects and it’s certainly a key topic in Christian apologetics and debates between atheists and Christian theists. My hope is that this video will help you think critically about the key issues involved in that discussion.\n\nLink to Alex's video in which he lays out his meta-ethics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htdDaHAhR-s&t=3888s\nAlthough it's more than old years old, Alex still stands by the views expressed there as he links this video in more recent videos as well whenever he makes reference to his meta-ethical theory.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:06 Summarizing Alex's Case\n2:59 Right-Wrong or TRUE-FALSE?\n4:21 The Issue of Language\n5:20 A Fatal Equivocation\n6:25 He's Got No Case\n8:39 Alex's Epiphany Explained\n10:17 \"It's not Ethics!\"\n10:59 \"Coming close\"\n11:52 A Bitter Pill\n12:24 Conclusion\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Still NO Fossils!!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-F8NJgLAkA&t=2s\n\nDoes the Trinity Make Sense? https://youtu.be/VUJm0ga424Q\n\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "description": "Hey, thanks for watching! My #shorts aim to tackle popular issues in Christian apologetics and theology with simplicity and brevity. I'm passionate to bring atheists, skeptics, and theists together to debate and talk about the question of God and ultimate reality. Good philosophical arguments matter, but people matter even more.\n\nSome people believe that you as a human being are nothing but matter, 100% physical and that the idea of an immaterial soul is superstition.\n\nIf that’s true, it has some rather weird implications: It means that after cutting your hair you’re not identical anymore to who you were before you cut your hair. You see, if who you are is defined exclusively in terms of matter it means that as your physical make-up changes, the “you” changes.\n\nAlso, consider that your body renews all its cells every 7-10 years. If you’re just matter, this means that you become a different person every decade. In fact, our physicality constantly changes, we lose around 30,000 skin cells every minute which means that you are now not the person anymore who clicked on this video 30 seconds ago.\n\nNow, clearly, this is absurd. But while it’s absurd it’s nevertheless the consistent outworking of saying that we’re nothing but matter.",

    "description": "Are you familiar with the basics of evolutionary theory? Then you might know that the fossil record actually puts evolution in real trouble. You might also know that various theories have been put forward by Darwin’s advocates in an attempt to fix that problem. In this video, I’m going to show you why these attempts not only fail but even amplify the Darwinian dilemma. This is my second video in my ongoing series on Intelligent Design. In the previous episode, I talked about how Darwin was painstakingly aware of the fact that his theory was diametrically opposed to the fossil record which, then as now, shows that new animal forms show up SUDDENLY and without any intermediate forms preceding them. Darwin was hoping that as paleontology would progress, later discoveries would produce those forms and vindicate his theory. Yet, the exact opposite happened: Paleontologists have found EVEN MORE evidence of new animal forms suddenly appearing for the first time out of the blue as it were, in the era called “the Cambrian,” without any precursory forms in the preceding geological era. This phenomenon is called “the Cambrian explosion” and it completely defies the Darwinian idea of gradual change over time. Check out my first video to get a better idea of the details. In this video, I’m gonna walk you through three of the most important theories (artifact hypothesis, Ediacaran fossils etc.) that have been proposed in the attempt to plug the hole, and what you’ll get to see at the end is that these theories not only don’t close that gap but actually widen it significantly.\n\n0:00 Intro & Recap\n1:44 The Artifact Hypothesis\n2:46 Too Soft & Too Small?\n4:18 The Ediacaran Fauna\n6:18 Evaluating the Ediacaran Fauna\n9:29 80% Unexplained\n12:35 An Even Bigger Problem!\n14:07 Conclusion\n\nThis is the second video of an ongoing series on the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design debate. My aim is to make the basics of Intelligent Design and of critical thinking about evolutionary theory available to the uninitiated viewer. I will unpack, in a step-by-step fashion, why the complex, specified information we find in organisms of the animal kingdom is better explained by the theory of Intelligent Design than by Neo-Darwinism.\n\nThe videos in these series are based on the New York Times bestseller “Darwin’s Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design” by Stephen C. Meyer (Revised ed. Edition, San Francisco: HarperOne, 2014). In fact, the videos can be thought of as summaries of the most essential points of Meyer’s book.\n\nThis series is done in partnership with the Discovery Institute, the leading Intelligent Design think tank (https://www.discovery.org/).\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nDoes the Trinity Make Sense? https://youtu.be/VUJm0ga424Q\n\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "description": "Materialists and atheists like to talk about the supposedly “emergent properties” of consciousness. What they mean is that the mind is fully reducible to matter, and that there is, therefore, nothing immaterial to a human being, and certainly no soul either. Materialist often cite neuroscience and the newest neuroscientific findings in support of their position. Their view can be described as physicalism and it opposes dualism which holds that human are both physical and non-physical, that we have a body and what has traditionally been called a soul. The philosophy of mind deals with the question of the origin and nature of consciousness, a mystery that has haunted philosophers since the time of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. I did a one-hour interview with philosopher of mind JP Moreland. This video is an excerpt and it deals with the question of whether emergent properties exist and what they are. Enjoy!",

    "description": "Hey, thanks for watching! My #shorts aim to tackle popular issues in Christian apologetics and theology with simplicity and brevity. I'm passionate to bring atheists, skeptics, and theists together to debate and talk about the question of God and ultimate reality. Good philosophical arguments matter, but people matter even more.\n\nThis video is about the often-heard claim that the creation account in Genesis supposedly degrades women for two particular reasons. First, because it says that Eve was made from a piece or a rib taken from Adam and second because Eve is described as Adam’s helper. Here’s my response:\n\nFirst, just because Eve is taken from Adam does not mean that she is inferior to him. By the same logic, it would we would have to conclude that Adam is inferior to dirt because it says that God formed HIM from the dust of the ground. But clearly just because the Bible says that something is made from something else, it doesn’t follow that the “raw material” is more valuable than the final product, and this applies as much to dirt and Adam as it does to Adam and Eve.\n\nSimilarly, just because Eve is described as Adam’s helper it doesn’t follow that she is inferior to him, or simply his servant. In fact, the Hebrew word for ‘helper’ applied to Eve is applied to God himself when the Bible describes him as the helper of his people. But clearly, it doesn’t intend to tell us that God the helper is inferior to the people he helps. That would be absurd.\n\nI hope this clears things up. Thank you for watching!

    "title": "Christ HIJACKED by Progressive Christianity!",
    "description": "Is Jesus fine with us doing whatever we wanna do? According to progressive queer pastor Bailey Brawner, the answer is ‘yes.’ She claims that Jesus of Nazareth was queer and that God doesn’t find anything wrong with us living out our authentic selves. Progressive Christianity essentially turns the teachings of the Bible upside down. Nowhere does Scripture tell us that we are to follow our hearts or live out our true selves. Instead, it tells us that our self is corrupted by sin and in need of rebirth. Christ calls us to follow HIM, not our hearts. A great many progressive Christians in general and progressive clergy, in particular, seem to be primarily concerned with finding Biblical and theological support for homosexuality, queerness, or a sexually liberal lifestyle in general. This video will show how progressive Christianity diametrically opposes the teachings of historic Christianity as it preaches the pursuit of self instead of the pursuit of Christ.\n\nLinks to Bailey Brawner’s videos:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@baileynbrawner/video/6979407575779413254?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@baileynbrawner/video/6978479443484445958?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nDoes the Trinity Make Sense? https://youtu.be/VUJm0ga424Q\n\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "title": "Does the Trinity Make Sense?",
    "description": "What does it mean to say that God is three in one? The Trinity is one of the most mind-boggling Christian doctrines, and yet, it is also among its most fundamental ones. This video will introduce the basics every Christian needs to know when it comes to the Trinity. We will look at the difference between the concept of nature and the concept of personhood. This is crucial because to say that God is triune is to say that he is three “in persons\" but one in nature. In contrast, it would be a self-contradiction to say that God is three persons and one person or three gods and yet one god at one and the same time. Three persons, one nature, that’s the bare basics to be grasped when it comes to the Trinity and it’s an absolutely fundamental concept to be understood by anyone who is into theology, Christian apologetics and philosophy. If you want to defend your faith against skeptics or atheists, you better know who the God is you actually believe in. He is one in nature, but three in persons — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This video will not yet look into Scriptural support for the Trinity. In two upcoming videos, however, I will show you how a Trinitarian view of God clearly emerges from the Old Testament and the New Testament. These episodes will show that unitarianism (the view that God is one in nature and one in person) cannot be reconciled with the Bible. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves… Check out this video and get a basic understanding of how to think about the triune God who revealed himself in Jesus Christ.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:55 What it Doesn't Mean\n1:22 The Definition\n1:33 Nature & Person\n1:55 Nature\n2:33 Person\n3:35 The Difference\n4:07 The Trinity\n4:44 Relating to God\n5:24 Boggling your Mind?\n6:32 Conclusion\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nA Lovely Conversation with Apostate Prophet: https://youtu.be/c-xXUcYzZo4\n\nBasics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare: https://youtu.be/KZpIXDjXzHw\n\nThe Reason Why The Christian Story MUST Be TRUE (The Peterson-Fry Conversation): https://youtu.be/egjZxQ2E9ow\n\nCosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD! https://youtu.be/1Zc4zHI6_6k\n\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "title": "Basics of Intelligent Design: Darwin’s Nightmare",
    "description": "When Charles Darwin published “On the Origin of Species” in 1859, he was painstakingly aware of the fact that the fossil record diametrically opposed his theory. Ever since Darwin’s time, paleontologists have put their finger on the so-called Cambrian explosion. The term describes the fact that within one single geological era called the Cambrian era, a wide variety of fossilized animal forms shows up suddenly and without any evidence of intermediate forms preceding them in Precambrian strata. This state of affairs is hard to reconcile with Darwin’s idea that species evolved slowly and gradually over long periods of time. Darwin himself acknowledged this problem and admitted that if we assume the theory of evolution to be true, we should find an interminable number of intermediate forms in the fossil record. However, at Darwin’s time, those countless transitional forms were nowhere to be found. The leading figures of paleontology didn’t hold back with their criticism of Darwin, who, in turn, described their objections as potentially fatal to the entire theory of evolution. Yet, instead of dealing with the paleontological evidence as it presented itself to him, Darwin explained away the absence of paleontological evidence for evolution by asserting that future discoveries by paleontologists would eventually unearth those countless intermediate forms that his theory needed in order to be vindicated. Have his hopes come true? No, they haven’t. In fact, as the science of paleontology has, like any other scientific discipline during the 20th century, made huge leaps forward, the evidence that has emerged has put the theory of evolution into even greater trouble. Find out why in this very first episode of my new series on the basics of Intelligent Design.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:52 Darwin's Theory\n2:16 A Troubling Conundrum\n4:42 A Milestone Discovery\n5:09 Phyla and Fossils\n6:38 The Blink of an Eye\n7:28 Amazing Trilobite\n8:22 Stubborn Paleontology\n9:05 Darwin's Problem Amplified\n11:23 Wrapping Up & Looking Ahead\n\nThis is the first video of an ongoing series on the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design debate. My aim is to make the basics of Intelligent Design and of critical thinking about evolutionary theory available to the uninitiated viewer. I will unpack, in a step-by-step fashion, why the complex, specified information we find in organisms of the animal kingdom is better explained by the theory of Intelligent Design than by Neo-Darwinism.\n\nThe videos in these series are based on the New York Times bestseller “Darwin’s Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design” by Stephen C. Meyer (Revised ed. Edition, San Francisco: HarperOne, 2014). In fact, the videos can be thought of as summaries of the most essential points of Meyer’s book. This video in particular relates to the content of chapters 1-2.\n\nThis series is done in partnership with the Discovery Institute, the leading Intelligent Design think tank (https://www.discovery.org/). The Discovery Institute is sometimes accused of advancing Biblical creationism disguised as science. This is an ad hominem attack that does nothing to address the actual arguments that are being put forward by Intelligent Design theorists. Besides, the accusation reveals ignorance of the fact that there is a wide range of atheist and agnostic scientists who consider Intelligent Design a legitimate scientific hypothesis. Nevertheless, one of my videos will talk about how the hypotheses advanced by Intelligent Design and creationism are fundamentally different.\n\nI have not received formal training in evolutionary biology. However, I have spent a great amount of time studying Neo-Darwinism and Intelligent Design over the last three years. I am mentioning this for two reasons: First, this is simply a matter of transparency and intellectual honesty, which are, I believe, key, as we’re dealing with a controversial topic. Second, I’m aware that the fact of me not being an evolutionary biologist will be used by critics in the attempt to undermine the credibility of the arguments I offer here. However, the validity of an argument is not affected by the question of who advances it. Therefore, questioning my content because I’m not an evolutionary biologist (or, a scientist, for that matter) is logically fallacious. In addition, the following may be pointed out: Unless the person who offers such criticism is him or herself an evolutionary biologist, advancing such criticism is at best hypocritical and at worst self-defeating. For if the credibility of my arguments is supposedly questionable due to me not being an evolutionary biologist, why should the critic’s criticism of my arguments be any more credible, given that he or she isn’t an evolutionary biologist either?\n\nAs always, I'm thankful for feedback!",

    "title": "No, it’s Alex’s Problem: He DEBUNKED His ETHICS!",
    "description": "Animal suffering is, according to Cosmic Skeptic, “Christianity’s Biggest Problem.” Alex argues that the existence of an all-loving and all-powerful God is implausible given the amount of suffering and pain wild animals have to endure in nature. @CosmicSkeptic’s motivation behind his case does not seem to be purely philosophical. Instead, he genuinely cares for animal well-being. Nevertheless, his case is fundamentally flawed. I have shown in a first video already that according to both evolutionary theory and Alex’s very own line of reasoning, his supposedly biggest case for atheism and against Christianity completely turns the tables in favor of the Christian worldview. In this video, I point out that Alex’s case is diametrically opposed to his very own ethical theory. His case for objectivist ethics is built on the utilitarian notion that human beings (and indeed all sentient creatures) are driven by the desire for the maximization of pleasure. However, the way in which Comic Skeptic lays out sentient existence in his biggest case against Christianity means that they cannot be driven by that desire, as even Alex himself admits. This leads to a dilemma that forces Cosmic Skeptic either to renounce the foundation of his ethical theory or to modify his supposedly biggest case against Christianity. I hope you’ll enjoy this video. Animal suffering is a topic that has become increasingly popular in debates between atheists and theists. Accordingly, Alex O’Connor’s video has received quite some attention.

    "description": "Are the stories told by religions any good? Yes, affirm both Jordan Peterson and Stephen Fry. In a recent conversation on the @JordanBPeterson Podcast, the two gentlemen discussed why religious stories, rituals, and ceremonies are powerful tools to unlock truth. What made their conversation fascinating is the fact that Peterson and Fry have two completely different worldviews: Peterson has opened himself up to Christianity and affirms objective morality while Fry calls himself an atheist and a moral relativist. Their conversation led them to explore a narrative view of modern science, the fine-tuning of the universe, the question of the multiverse, history, ancient religions, and the origin of Western culture. The discussion culminated in Peterson posing a challenge to Fry which exposed not only the incoherence of Fry’s atheistic and relativistic worldview but also the fact that moral relativism isn’t actually livable.

    "title": "Cosmic Skeptic’s Ethics is Utterly ABSURD!",
    "description": "Alex O’Connor loves to talk about ethics, as he himself says. However, the ethical theory he has built sanctifies as good that which we all know to be outright evil, as I point out in this video. The first part offers a summary of  @CosmicSkeptic ’s ethics and lays out the key foundations on which it stands. The second part takes a critical look at Alex’s ethics and reveals its absurdity. Alex's primary inspiration for his ethics is taken from the utilitarian tradition, which focuses on pleasure. In fact, many atheists and skeptics follow the same path in trying to account for our moral awareness. And, similar to Alex, they may refer to science in trying to back up their position. However, while Alex certainly talks about science in making his argument from pleasure, he doesn’t actually offer scientific evidence for it. Given that various forms of utilitarianism are popular among atheists, this video will be helpful for anyone who is involved in apologetic discussions and debates with them. My video does not offer an actual theory of Biblical ethics, nor does it explain how Christianity or the existence of God can ground moral values. The singular aim of this video is to point out that the ethical framework Cosmic Skeptic has built is worthless. Enjoy!\n \nDISCLAIMERS:\n1) There is a bit of background noise in the first 5 minutes - I’m sorry!\n\n2) Alex speaks about ethics in a lot of different videos and contexts. Some of those videos are quite old and no longer represent his views, as he himself clarifies in more recent videos. As far as I’m aware, there are two key videos in which Alex lays out his case for objective (or quasi-objective) ethics. One is a conversation with  @Rationality Rules, found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrYLvaXCokg&t=3357s. In his conversation with Stephen Woodford, Alex mainly reiterates the case he presented to a group of humanists which is found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htdDaHAhR-s&t=3888s. It’s in this presentation that Alex offers his case for objective ethics most concisely and clearly, as far as I’m concerned at least. He also references this presentation in subsequent and quite recent videos where he clarifies his stance on ethics. This is why all citations and quotations in my video are taken from there. The quality of that video is, however, quite bad, which is why I didn’t include the original footage when quoting Alex.\n\n3) Many people seem to be confused about Alex’s ethics and this seems to stem from either of two facts (or a mixture of both): First, they hold on to their ideas taken from Alex’s older videos in which he may have questioned the existence of morality. Second, they assume that, as an atheist, Alex fits the atheist stereotype of explicitly denying the existence of a moral realm. I hope (and believe) that my video is an accurate representation as well as a helpful engagement with what Alex actually believes about morality.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:15 Alex’s Goal\n2:24 The Pleasure Argument\n3:16 Alex’s Illustrations\n5:17 Evidence, Intuition & Knowledge\n11:04 Alex’s Ethics at its Core\n14:29 Simple Problems\n15:39 The Main Objection\n19:06 Rape, Pleasure & Intuition\n22:39 Killing the Pleasure Argument\n26:49 The Absurdity Revealed\n30:27 Final Comments\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nDo Churches Influence You Emotionally?

    "title": "Do Churches Influence You Emotionally? Yes & No.",
    "description": "If you've ever visited a church service on Sunday, you will know that music and rituals play a rather important role. Drew from @GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic claims that church leaders utilize these tools intentionally, creating an emotionally charged atmosphere that makes people more receptive and impressionable. According to him, Christianity simply isn't intellectually compelling which is why the church must revert to what he calls \"emotional priming\" in order to convert people and maintain membership. Many skeptics and atheists will probably share his opinion. But they are not alone. In this video, I talk about why Drew is actually spot-on with some of the things he says. While his critique isn't flawless, Drew has managed, I believe, to successfully point out that much of contemporary Christianity has fallen prey to the cultural lie that what you feel is more important than what you think. Some people will even use the Bible and Jesus' teaching to support their heart-over-mind approach to belief in God. In response, I'm trying to offer a theologically more healthy way of considering the mind and the heart, which is a core issue for apologetics, theology, and Christianity's engagement with culture.\n\n0:00 Intro & Disclaimers\n1:08 Overview\n2:47 Music & Emotions\n3:25 Rituals & Repetition\n4:24 God's Presence\n4:53 What are Church Rituals?\n6:21 Drew is Spot-On\n9:36 Clarifications\n10:48 Emotions and God's Presence\n12:48 Conclusion\n\nGenetically Modified Skeptic's original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7btz0ocXDeg&t=27s\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\n\nNo, It's ALEX's Problem: He DEBUNKED Atheism! https://youtu.be/g2S-oWzk-Ns\n\nTHIS Is Why People Are Leaving the Church!

    "description": "Is the suffering of wild animals \"Christianity's Biggest Problem?\" @CosmicSkeptic thinks so. He recently published a video in which he claims that the problem of animal suffering is even bigger than the problem of human suffering and that atheism makes far more sense of it than Christianity ever could. In this video, I am going to show you that Alex’s case is essentially an emotional appeal that directly contradicts Darwin's theory of evolution. But that's not even half of it. You are going to witness how Alex’s biggest shot AGAINST Christianity actually turns into Alex’s most convincing argument FOR it. If you are into Christian apologetics, philosophy, and the debate between atheism and Christian theism, this video is for you! Enjoy!\n\nAlex's original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KDnnp0sDkI&t=897s\n\n---- Clarification (Darwinian Evolution, Intelligent Design & Alex's Case) ----\nMy personal position on Darwinian evolution is NOT relevant to my case against Alex in which I intentionally decided to accept and assume all of ALEX's presuppositions. I happen to believe that Darwinian evolution is not an accurate theory of how species originated. In contrast, Alex believes that it is.\n\nWhat IS relevant, however, is the following:  If the theory of evolution is true (and Alex believes that it is), Christianity is, according to Alex's own reasoning, incalculably more plausible than atheism when we consider the natural state animals live in (which is a state of happiness, as evolutionary theory proposes, rather than of torment).\n\nBut just to be clear, if we were to assume Intelligent Design (which represents my personal position), my case against Alex would still stand. And that's because animal existence being predominated by happiness is a claim that can be plausibly maintained against the background of ID theory. Of course, a lot more could be said about this topic. However, I chose not to elaborate on it because, again, my response is committed to working within ALEX's assumptions and ALEX's line of reasoning ONLY, and at no point does my case build on MY presuppositions.\n\nSo, again: If we want to explain the nature of animal existence in the real world while assuming all the tenets of ALEX's argument, Christianity turns out to be incalculably more plausible than atheism. Alex's atheism has been defeated with Alex's own weapons.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Alex's Case\n2:05 Emotions, Emotions, Emotions\n4:11 Taking Alex Seriously\n6:12 The Stakes\n8:30 My Source\n9:17 Evolution = Happiness\n11:39 Turning the Tables\n14.10 Follow the Evidence\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY -----\n\nTHIS Is Why People Are Leaving the Church!

    "title": "THIS Is Why People Are Leaving the Church! (The Peterson-Barron Conversation)",
    "description": "Jordan Peterson and Bishop Barron recently had a conversation in which they pinpointed one particular issue that causes people to walk away from the church. I was pleasantly surprised and inspired by their findings which is why I decided to make a video about it and I hope that you will be encouraged by what I’m about to tell you. Basically, they agreed that the church is making it not too hard but too easy for people. Just as Gandalf summoned the hobbits for an adventure in the wild so are we waiting to be invited to an adventure. Christianity is that adventure as it invites us to become like Christ through suffering. However, the problem Peterson and Barron discern is that the church is preaching a shallow kind of happiness instead of the cosmic drama of transformation into Christ’s image through participation in his suffering.\n\nOriginal video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVrLqpt0APo\n\n0:00 Intro & Disclaimers\n1:00 The Cross\n1:50 Demanding Everything\n3:09 Take Responsibility!\n5:03 The Cosmic Drama\n6:31 Preaching Toxic Relevance\n8:17 Self-Indulgence or Adventure?\n10:50 Confession and Conclusion\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY -----\n\nNo, It's ALEX's Problem: He DEBUNKED Atheism! https://youtu.be/g2S-oWzk-Ns\n\nHow Women & Coca-Cola Prove the RESURRECTION: https://youtu.be/yNaVLNSrB_A\n\nYOUR STORY and MY STORY Converge HERE! https://youtu.be/rumE_KN1TI8\n\n  @CosmicSkeptic  : TORN between FREE WILL, HOMOSEXUALITY & MORALITY: https://youtu.be/2mJi7uhJSGQ\n\nWhy Neuroscience CANNOT Debunk the Immaterial Soul – Interview with JP Moreland: https://youtu.be/Phu8yMOUzAY\n\nWhy Being Skeptical Proves that God Exists: The Free-Thinking Argument with Dr. Tim Stratton: https://youtu.be/pSs0xhyvniU\n\nAtheism REALLY IS a BELIEF according to PHILOSOPHERS (\"Atheism is NOT a Belief\" – DEBUNKED #3): https://youtu.be/XeiXA10U96c\n\nSLAVERY in the BIBLE: THIS is what you NEED to KNOW – Interview with PAUL COPAN: https://youtu.be/-CIeBCv_h2A\n\nWhy ATHEISM Really IS a BELIEF (and the LOGICAL Problems of Saying it’s NOT)!: https://youtu.be/730ZdM-k1vk\n\nAtheism is NOT a LACK of Belief in 40 Dictionaries!

    "description": "Would you be willing to die for a cause you really believe in? Up until recently, I used to live in a neighborhood where many people actually WOULD give their lives to their cause, and in this video I’m gonna show you why looking at their stories and mindset offers compelling raw material to build a case for Christ’s resurrection.\n\nThe resurrection of Jesus is the key event upon which Christianity is based. Arguing for its historicity is therefore of paramount importance in apologetics. From the New Testament and other sources, we know that Peter, Paul, and most of the other apostles were killed because they proclaimed Christ as Lord. The fact that the apostles were willing to lay down their lives for the sake of the gospel makes for a compelling argument that Jesus really did rise from the dead. Of course, all sorts of people are willing to die for their faith, even today, and the most well-known example is probably that of Muslim fundamentalists. However, why the martyrdom of the apostles is an entirely different case is what I will point out in this video.\n\nDISCLAIMER: @SeanMcDowell's study describes the historical probability of martyrdom for the apostles only verbally but doesn’t quantify it. I’ve added the percentages to make the concept of probability more tangible for the viewer. However, I presented my numbers to Sean and he agreed that if he were to quantify the findings of his study, he would go for very similar figures.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:26 My Martyred Neighbors\n1:26 Lessons from Martyrdom\n2:00 The Apostles\n2:23 Historical Study\n3:50 Belief and Knowledge\n6:06 Conclusion\n6:40 The Women\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY -----\n\nHow Women & Coca-Cola Prove the RESURRECTION: https://youtu.be/yNaVLNSrB_A\n\nYOUR STORY and MY STORY Converge HERE! https://youtu.be/rumE_KN1TI8\n\n @CosmicSkeptic : TORN between FREE WILL, HOMOSEXUALITY & MORALITY: https://youtu.be/2mJi7uhJSGQ\n\nWhy Neuroscience CANNOT Debunk the Immaterial Soul – Interview with JP Moreland: https://youtu.be/Phu8yMOUzAY\n\nWhy Being Skeptical Proves that God Exists: The Free-Thinking Argument with Dr. Tim Stratton: https://youtu.be/pSs0xhyvniU\n\nAtheism REALLY IS a BELIEF according to PHILOSOPHERS (\"Atheism is NOT a Belief\" – DEBUNKED #3): https://youtu.be/XeiXA10U96c\n\nSLAVERY in the BIBLE: THIS is what you NEED to KNOW – Interview with PAUL COPAN: https://youtu.be/-CIeBCv_h2A\n\nWhy ATHEISM Really IS a BELIEF (and the LOGICAL Problems of Saying it’s NOT)!: https://youtu.be/730ZdM-k1vk\n\nAtheism is NOT a LACK of Belief in 40 Dictionaries!

    "description": "Did the Resurrection really happen? “No,” says the skeptic. Instead, the gospel authors must have made up the story. Admittedly, it is possible that they made it up. However, what matters is not possibility but plausibility, because a whole lot of things are possible if you just give it enough thought. For example, it is really possible that Coca-Cola’s management is trying to sell us the healthiest drink on the planet. We don’t know everything that’s going on in their minds. However, for all the facts we do know, the idea simply isn’t plausible.\nSimilarly, the claim that the gospel authors made up the story of the resurrection isn’t really plausible, and that’s because women feature as the key witnesses in the story. In the first century, the testimony of women was considered so unreliable and untrustworthy that they were not to testify in a Jewish court of law. This means that if you wanted to make up a story aimed at convincing people that Jesus rose from the dead the one thing you would definitely NOT do is make women your key source. Yet that’s what all four gospel authors did. Watch this video about a key topic in apologetics and Christian theology — the resurrection of Jesus Christ — and found out why it is plausible to think that the first Easter really did happen!\n\n--- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ---\nBe CHALLENGED By This Story About Prayer!\nhttps://youtu.be/tEdcCN6p1Nk\n\nYOUR STORY and MY STORY Converge HERE! https://youtu.be/rumE_KN1TI8\n\n @CosmicSkeptic : TORN between FREE WILL, HOMOSEXUALITY & MORALITY: https://youtu.be/2mJi7uhJSGQ\n\nWhy Neuroscience CANNOT Debunk the Immaterial Soul – Interview with JP Moreland: https://youtu.be/Phu8yMOUzAY\n\nWhy Being Skeptical Proves that God Exists: The Free-Thinking Argument with Dr. Tim Stratton: https://youtu.be/pSs0xhyvniU\n\nAtheism REALLY IS a BELIEF according to PHILOSOPHERS (\"Atheism is NOT a Belief\" – DEBUNKED #3): https://youtu.be/XeiXA10U96c\n\nSLAVERY in the BIBLE: THIS is what you NEED to KNOW – Interview with PAUL COPAN: https://youtu.be/-CIeBCv_h2A\n\nWhy ATHEISM Really IS a BELIEF (and the LOGICAL Problems of Saying it’s NOT)!: https://youtu.be/730ZdM-k1vk\n\nAtheism is NOT a LACK of Belief in 40 Dictionaries!

    "description": "My friend, a skeptic, used to think that prayer was nothing but a mental exercise that would help people feel better about themselves. That God, if he existed, would actually intervene in response to prayer, was unthinkable to him. Until he went through an experience that rocked his world. This video tells his story and if you or your friends are not sure whether prayer works, this video is for you. The issue of prayer is one that comes up frequently in debates between Christians and skeptics or atheists, and I guess that’s understandable. I mean, if God exists, his visible intervention in response to prayer would make for a great apologetic. Well, check out this video and find out that this kind of stuff does actually happen.

    "description": "If you are into debates, there is a real danger of thinking, while you’re engaging the “other side,” that you’re dealing with arguments only. But the truth is that behind each argument stands a real person with real struggles, real emotions, real joys. In this video, I share how one of @CosmicSkeptic's videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMp0WLLrFng&t=35s) \"hit\" me. I realized that he has wrestled on a very personal level with an issue that’s been very important to me, too, namely, the question of whether we should give away our possessions to help more people in need. It was Alex’s sincerity in wrestling with this issue that sparked my interest in his moral philosophy. And that’s because some of the things he mentions in that video really \"smack\" of objective morality. So, I delved into the videos in which he carves out his ethics. I found, and unsurprisingly so, that I disagree with almost everything he lays out. However, I thought that before I move on to offer my critique, I want to put the following out there: @CosmicSkeptic’s sincerity when it comes to the issue of charity touched me personally as I could very much identify with the struggle of working through this question. And so, it is Alex’s commitment to walking the walk instead of just talking the talk that sparked my interest in his moral philosophy. So, if you’re into Christian apologetics and into debates with atheists (or with Christians, or Muslims, or others), never forget that it’s ultimately not about arguments, but about people. I hope you enjoy this video, and let me know what you think. Also, if you agree with me, please share it with someone who is dear to you, even if you disagree with their views.

    "title": "@CosmicSkeptic: TORN between FREE WILL, HOMOSEXUALITY & MORALITY",
    "description": "Alex denies that free will exists. He also denies that homosexuality has anything to do with morality. In order to make that latter claim, however, he has to define the criteria which turn something into an issue related to morality. And this is where things get interesting. @CosmicSkeptic  tells us that in order for an act to fall within the moral sphere it has to be consciously chosen. But contrast that with Alex’s case against free will which culminates in the affirmation that “you just can’t choose what it is that you want.” In other words, @CosmicSkeptic's worldview is riddled with an outright self-contradiction. On the one hand, Alex tells us that choice is off the table, given that free will doesn’t exist. On the other hand, Alex resurrects choice in order to establish his notion of the moral sphere. Now, there is more that could be said as @CosmicSkeptic  relates free will and choice to an illusion that is beneficial to our evolution as a species. These issues make Alex’s case even more problematic. To find out why, watch this video and let me know what you think. This is a video about several key topics in Christian apologetics and debates between atheists/skeptics and Christian theists. I hope it will give you a helpful insight into the conversations that are happening around those topics in general.\n\nAlex’s video on free will: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaXqep-bpk\nAlex’s video on homosexuality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgHl2KcadEU&t=33s\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:40 Preliminaries\n1:48 Alex on Free Will\n4:05 Alex on Homosexuality\n7:17 Putting it Together\n9:44 The Illusion Argument\n12:37 An Epistemological Dilemma\n15:44 The Last Resort\n16:34 In a Nutshell\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ----\n\nWhy Neuroscience CANNOT Debunk the Immaterial Soul – Interview with JP Moreland: https://youtu.be/Phu8yMOUzAY\n\nWhy Being Skeptical Proves that God Exists: The Free-Thinking Argument with Dr. Tim Stratton: https://youtu.be/pSs0xhyvniU\n\nAtheism REALLY IS a BELIEF according to PHILOSOPHERS (\"Atheism is NOT a Belief\" – DEBUNKED #3): https://youtu.be/XeiXA10U96c\n\nSLAVERY in the BIBLE: THIS is what you NEED to KNOW – Interview with PAUL COPAN: https://youtu.be/-CIeBCv_h2A\n\nWhy ATHEISM Really IS a BELIEF (and the LOGICAL Problems of Saying it’s NOT)!: https://youtu.be/730ZdM-k1vk\n\nAtheism is NOT a LACK of Belief in 40 Dictionaries!

    "description": "A lot of people think that neuroscience has done away with the dualist “myth” of the soul. Consciousness is reducible to the material brain and if not, it’s merely an “emergent” property of the brain – that’s what we’re being told. JP Moreland is one of the most respected philosophers of mind and his research has led him to engage with the world’s most top neuroscientists. In this interview, he will explain why neuroscience is not vested, not even in principle, with the authority to tell us whether consciousness is material or immaterial and whether the soul exists or not. Beyond that, he will point out why the dualist view (i.e. that a person consists of both a material body and an immaterial soul) is philosophically far more satisfying than physicalism (i.e. the view that everything about human beings is physical). The “battle” for the soul is a key topic in Christian apologetics, Christian theology, and our view about it directly impacts the way we think of human dignity, human rights, gender, and other cultural hot topics. Watch this interview and get informed about the key issues to be aware of when it comes to debating the relationship between neuroscience and dualism.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:08 Defining Terms\n4:40 The Authority of Neuroscience\n12:15 The Split-Brain Phenomenon\n19:28 Memories Aren’t in the Brain\n22:15 Do We Decide to Act AFTER we Act?

    "title": "The Unlikely Story Behind This YouTube Channel",
    "description": "This is my first live stream in which I tell the story which led to this apologetics YouTube channel. A couple of years ago, I kicked off a Bible study for skeptics and seekers in Starbucks Beirut a couple of years ago. The idea behind this group that has become called “The Infinite Cake” is to offer both an authentic community and space for everyone to ask any question they may have towards the Christian faith. At some point, one of our most faithful members, co-planted a discussion club for atheists. I joined their meetings (which took place in the same café where we held our Bible study) and became very good friends with the leader. He and I decided to bring our groups together for a discussion about the relevance of religious faith and this happened in my living room. The event was a great success. Atheists, Christians, and Muslims came together to discuss their worldviews in a friendly and thoughtful manner. There was plenty of both deep conversation and laughter. We decided to do this on a regular basis and so, every other Saturday, 25-30 people would gather in my living room for what we simply called “discussion nights,” which usually lasted until the early morning hours. When the leader of the atheist club left the country, he asked me whether I’d like to become the organizer/admin of his group and I happily assumed that role, and so I’m now in charge of an atheist social media profile. Ever since “The Infinite Cake” and those “discussion nights” in my living room got going, people encouraged me to start a YouTube channel in order to offer my arguments for the Christian faith online. This is how my YouTube channel Deflate got started. Here, I present online the things I’m talking through with my atheist friends offline in Starbucks Beirut and my living room. I’m passionate to offer high-quality apologetic video content to empower Christians, challenge skeptics, and to spark awesome discussions.",

    "description": "Do you pride yourself on being a skeptic? Or a free-thinker? Good. But did you know that the claim that one thinks freely and rationally lends itself to a very powerful argument for God’s existence? Or to put it differently, if our ability to make rational inferences to knowledge is real, it is very unlikely that naturalism is true. Join me and my friend, Tim Stratton, for this interview in which we talk about the so-called Free-Thinking Argument Against Naturalism. Tim has spent a considerable amount of his Ph.D. developing and refining this argument and he presents it to us here in very clear and easy-to-understand terms. Many atheists claim that free will is an illusion. Yet, they also claim to be skeptics and interested in weighing evidence. However, if we don’t have free will in the libertarian sense, what good is skepticism and the considering of evidence? Against naturalism and the denial of libertarianism, skepticism and rationality itself are of no value whatsoever, and Tim will point out why this is so. This interview will touch on various topics that are paramount in Christian apologetics and the debate between atheists and Christian philosophers.\n\nCheck out Tim’s website and channel:\nhttps://freethinkingministries.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjoJHrgHyjBgOiSTxFT0Dag\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:07 What is Libertarianism?\n3:02 The Origin of the Free-Thinking Argument\n4:15 The Final Free-Thinking Argument\n5:14 Defense of the Premises\n7:23 Epistemic Problems for Naturalistic Atheism\n11:23 Plantinga’s Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism\n13:37 Why Freedom is Needed for Knowledge\n17:24 Calvinism, Freedom and Knowledge\n20:20 Rationality Separates us from Animals\n21:26 The Computer Objection\n28:53 Why the Christian God?\n35:08 Objections by Christians\n38:52 What Does Your Wife Think?\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ----\n\nAtheism REALLY IS a BELIEF according to PHILOSOPHERS (\"Atheism is NOT a Belief\" – DEBUNKED #3): https://youtu.be/XeiXA10U96c\n\nSLAVERY in the BIBLE: THIS is what you NEED to KNOW – Interview with PAUL COPAN: https://youtu.be/-CIeBCv_h2A\n\nWhy ATHEISM Really IS a BELIEF (and the LOGICAL Problems of Saying it’s NOT)!: https://youtu.be/730ZdM-k1vk\n\nAtheism is NOT a LACK of Belief in 40 Dictionaries!

    "description": "Atheists claim that atheism is merely a lack of belief. With this move, they try to rid themselves of the responsibility to back up their position with evidence and arguments. What they don’t seem to know, however, is that philosophical scholarship does not agree with their lack-of-belief definition. On the contrary, in this video, I will show that the world’s most authoritative dictionaries and encyclopedias of philosophy define atheism as an actual belief, an actual claim. Not only that but they even actively argue against the notion of atheism as a mere lack of belief. The definition of atheism is a perennial topic in apologetics and debates between atheists and Christians. So, check out this video and find out why atheism really does make a claim!\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: With the help of my friend Gergely Nagy (a Ph.D. student in theology), I realized that the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy does, in fact, include the lack of belief definition, contrary to what I express in the video. I realized that when accessing the Oxford Dictionary online (I have a subscription) the Dictionary does not immediately open up its full definition. The immediate definition given is the one rendered in the video. However, the lack of belief definition is also added and I didn’t take not of that when doing my research. This means that my claim that the Oxford Dictionary of Atheism and the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy are at odds with each other is wrong. It also means that Oxford scholarship and the two dictionaries mentioned do endorse the lack of belief definition. I sincerely apologize for this mischaracterization and thank Gergely for helping me put the record straight.\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ----\n\nSLAVERY in the BIBLE: THIS is what you NEED to KNOW – Interview with PAUL COPAN: https://youtu.be/-CIeBCv_h2A\n\nWhy ATHEISM Really IS a BELIEF (and the LOGICAL Problems of Saying it’s NOT)!: https://youtu.be/730ZdM-k1vk\n\nAtheism is NOT a LACK of Belief in 40 Dictionaries!

The definition of atheism is a perennial issue in YouTube apologetics and debates between Christians and atheists. This is why I have dedicated a whole trilogy to this topic. For this second video in the series, I have looked at the definition of the word “atheism” in 47 dictionaries from 16 different languages, together with a bunch of awesome friends around the world.

    "title": "RELIGIOUS Beliefs: The Result of EVOLUTION!?",
    "description": "Atheists sometimes claim that religious beliefs emerged as a result of evolution, that is because it gave our ancestors an advantage in the fight for survival. In other words, religions are all about utility for survival, but not about truth. In this video, we will examine this claim and you will learn why it fails completely on several levels.\n\nCheck out Daniel Apologetics here! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3wnAOBnbF2f6LJB2SXMkg\n\n---- Content and Structure ----\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:31 Evolutionary History\n1:41 The Case\n2:17 Scientific Data\n2:52 Natural vs Sexual Selection\n5:28 A Circular Argument\n7:08 Dawkins's Hypothesis\n8:00 Dawkins's Failure\n8:47 The Genetic Fallacy\n10:03 The BIGGEST Problem\n13:11 Summary\n\n---- Summary ---\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that can justifiably be cited to locate the origin of religious belief in evolution. Instead, all the data and studies tell us refers to the beneficial effects of religious belief. This in itself renders the atheist claim an act of blind faith from the very start and it may thus be dismissed with the zero evidence with which it was asserted in the first place, as the late Christopher Hitchens advises us. Richard Dawkins offers a somewhat more sophisticated case, claiming that religious beliefs are the mere by-products of other dispositions. However, his case, too, is based on circular reasoning and therefore a logical non-starter.\nBut the worst is yet to follow: The claim of the atheist is completely and utterly self-undermining. That’s because underlying the argument is the rather significant implication that the thoughts generated by the human brain are aimed not at what is true but at what is helpful for survival. Sam Harris, John Gray, and many others confirm this aspect of Darwinian theory. So, if it’s true, as atheists tell us, that belief in God arose not because of its truth but because of its utility in survival, then the same thing applies to ALL our thoughts and beliefs. But now, what are we to make of the very thought that our thoughts are not aimed at truth but at survival? Is there any reason why this thought should still be taken seriously?\n\n---- YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY ----\n\n@Rationality Rules is WRONG About MATH and GOD: https://youtu.be/dC7UAMwLfqE\n\nOn the Crusades, Corruption in the Church and other Religious Evils - https://youtu.be/5TAYu8RM1jM\n\nBelief in God is just a Psychological Crutch - DEBUNKED: https://youtu.be/9sfhMGwOl1k\n\nRationality Rules and the Great Cost of the Kalam - DEBUNKED: https://youtu.be/TeWCOLbUTVw\n\nThe Problem of Evil Assumes God's Existence: https://youtu.be/nwCtgQ71KV4\n\nWhy Evolution Does NOT Support Atheism: https://youtu.be/-jYFtVIXXhA\n\nWhy There is No Meaning in Atheism: https://youtu.be/IbY8JyhFY0s\n\nWhat is Deflate: https://youtu.be/fwkK1C7Cfmw",

    "description": "+++ The talk about the topic starts at 2:25 (with disclaimers) and at 3:35, the real arguments get tackled. +++\n\nWilliam Lane Craig from @drcraigvideos recently presented an argument for God from the applicability of mathematics to the sciences. He claims that naturalism cannot explain why math works, other than by saying \"it's coincidence.\" Stephen Woodford from @rationalityrules ationality Rules responded to Craig, arguing that there are a plethora of viable naturalistic explanations for the effectiveness of mathematics. Rationality Rules essentially argues that mathematics is a human invention which we created to come to terms with our immediate environment. And since the universe and the laws of physics are fairly consistent, it is no wonder that what we designed to come to terms with our own lives, also applies in the world of nature at large. He also claims that people like Steven Weinberg, Sabine Hossenfelder, or George Lakoof offer further examples of valid naturalistic explanations for the effectiveness of mathematics. This video is my response to Rationality Rules. What I will show is that once you examine Stephen Woodford's case, Craig's claim turns out to be true as the naturalist is indeed left with chance only to account for the effectiveness of mathematics. Who would have thought that Dr. Craig's argument for God from mathematics would pick up such momentum! Be that as it may, check our this video if you're up for exploring a very hot topic in Christian apologetics which is likely to spark further conversations between atheists, agnostics, and theists in the future.

    "title": "Christianity is responsible for Too Much EVIL!?",
    "description": "People sometimes complain about the evil that has been committed in the name of Christianity, citing religious wars, the Crusades, abuse in religious institutions, corruption, and other misfirings. It's for this reason that the late Christopher Hitchens opined that \"religion poisons everything,\" while Sam Harris and other atheists have expressed similar sentiments. However, when you actually look at history, things look far more complex than that. First, there's quite a bit of human suffering which has ensued from atheist ideology. The campaigns of Stalin in the Soviet Union and Mao Tse Tung in China are only two cases in point. Second, even though a lot of evil has been committed in the name of atheism, it's pretty hard to actually judge these things as evil on the assumption that atheism is true. Richard Dawkins tells us that there is no good and bad in the universe, but \"only blind, pitiless indifference.\" But things look different if we assume Christian theism to be true. If God has imposed a moral order of objective rights and wrongs on the universe, whatever evil has been committed, be it by the church or an atheist regime, can be called out as such. In other words, while the church can be held accountable against the moral standard of Christianity, such a standard doesn't even exist in atheism. That's why a range of atheist philosophers such as Richard Rorty, Jurgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida admit that the notion of the inherent dignity of every human being, as endorsed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is a fundamentally Judeo-Christian concept, rooted in the Bible.

    "title": "DEBUNKED: Stephen on the Kalam & Free Will",
    "description": "The Kalam Cosmological Argument is arguably one of the most discussed topics in apologetics and debates between atheists and Christian theists. William Lane Craig is its key defender and has first brought the case to the public with his book “The Kalam Cosmological Argument” in 1979. @Rationality Rules, on the other hand, is a well-known YouTube channel run by atheist Stephen Woodford (it’s also the channel first recommended to me by my atheist friends). Stephen has talked about the Kalam Cosmological Argument in his own videos as well as in interactions with others (such as with Cameron Bertuzzi from @Capturing Christianity).\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:33 Stephen's Case\n2:21 Stephen's Definitions\n2:32 Stephens' Confusion About Cause and Determinism\n6:18 Causation and Libertarian Free Will\n7:32 Defining Free Will\n9:30 The Core Claim\n11:28 Debunking Stephen\n13:20 Cause ≠ Determinism!\n14:48 Free Will Is Not Uncaused!\n16:09 Conclusion\n\nRecently, Stephen published a video under the title “The Great Cost of the Kalam” in which he claims that both the Kalam Cosmological Argument and libertarian free will cannot be affirmed consistently at one at the same time. The concept of free will, according to @Rationality Rules, does not allow to state the first premise of the Kalam Cosmological Argument without perpetuating a self-contradiction. And yet, according to @Rationality Rules, the majority of theologians, Christian philosophers, and apologists such as William Lane Craig or Frank Turek who affirm the Kalam Cosmological Argument also affirm libertarian free will. Stephen Woodford from @Rationality Rules does not hold to libertarian free will (or libertarianism), but he is a determinist instead. However, this is immaterial to the case he has offered since it’s not about whether determinism or libertarian free will are true, but rather whether libertarian free will AND the Kalam Cosmological Argument can be true at one and the same time. Stephen from @Rationality Rules answers this question in the negative. However, in his video, he openly asks for a response from those who disagree with his claim about the incompatibility of the Kalam and libertarian free will, and this video is a reply to that invitation.\n\nMy video will show is that @Rationality Rules’ case is based on a fundamental confusion between the concept of cause and the concept of causal determinism. The latter is but a particular theory of causation, that is, a theory of how causes work out in reality, so to speak. Rationality Rules, however, claims that the term “cause” and the term “causal determinism” refer to one and the same thing. He further holds that on libertarianism, acts of free will are essentially uncaused, which is another misunderstanding. Libertarians do not claim that acts of free will are uncaused, all they claim is that they are not determined. Yet, @Rationality Rules seems to believe that “not having a cause” is the same as “not being determined.” It’s based on these misconceptions that Stephen builds his case against the compatibility of the Kalam Cosmological Argument and libertarian free will. In my response, I attempt to clear up @Rationality Rules’ confusion and show that there is no problem whatsoever with affirming both the Kalam Cosmological Argument and libertarian free will.\n\nI’m open to pushback from Stephen and hope that this will spark fruitful conversations. Enjoy!\n\nThe link to @Rationality Rules’ video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm_6eB5bcos&t=3s",

    "title": "Did You Know that Evil DISPROVES Atheism?",
    "description": "Oftentimes, you’ll hear atheists claim that if God existed, there would certainly be no evils such as massacres, wars, child abuse, cancer, and what have you. Now, the problem of evil is a serious and complex one, and I will certainly not be able to cover all its aspects in one single video. But the one thing you will learn in this video is why it is the height of inconsistency for an atheist to even talk about the problem of evil. That’s because, on the assumption of atheism, the notion that there is a dichotomy between good and evil is as delusional as the notion that green unicorns and pink dragons race against each other around planet earth. Watch this episode to find out why any coherent discourse about the problem of evil has to assume the existence of God.

    "description": "Many people think that because evolution is a fact, God does not exist and atheism wins. But if you read Darwin's The Origin of Species, you'll find that Darwin himself never thought so. And yet, Richard Dawkins continues to preach that \"Darwin has made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.\" Check out this episode to find out why evolution, even if it was true, would do nothing to disprove the existence of God.
