    "description": "What's special about church? For this final episode, Glen Scrivener and Andrew Wilson are joined by Rebecca McLaughlin, author of \"Confronting Christianity\" and \"The Secular Creed\". \n\nThey discuss the unique nature of the in-person church as the place where the vertical dimension of worship meets the horizontal dimension of embodied community. Reflecting on the long history of Christianity, they acknowledge that the church simply 'doing its thing' has a transformative leavening impact on the world.\n\nMcLaughlin offers a critique of some of our attitudes towards church and personal evangelism, and some encouragements to keep proclaiming Christ even when it feels fruitless. Scrivener examines how our fear of being labeled 'bigots' can sometimes lead us to disqualify ourselves from sharing the gospel, even though our friends might be more receptive than we imagine. \n\nThe podcast ends on a hopeful note, in that we are actually living in pre-Christian times: Jesus is Lord, he is returning, and summer is coming.\n\nOriginally released 5th December 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://youtu.be/X-XwixfQBJo?si=a_lUi2UxEM1AkqOT\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

    "description": "How can Christians offer grace, freedom, and truth in this current cultural moment? In this episode, Glen Scrivener and Andrew Wilson get practical. \n\nIf their books are correct in diagnosing the 21st-century West as post-Christian, what impact can this have on our approach to everyday evangelism, preaching, and parenting? They return to the observation that it is refreshing to be able to say to people, \"Here's why you're right,\" rather than, \"Here's why you're wrong.\" \n\nThey tease out the unique challenges of our current context and the need for Christians to offer counter-catechesis. Scrivener shares some examples of fruitful conversations he has had with friends and strangers, and Wilson reflects on how to engage with casual visitors in our churches—people who might not call themselves Christians but are recognising the radical and foundational nature of Biblical teaching.\n\nOriginally released 28th November 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://youtu.be/g6eKUw8qh00?si=0tbreKvzKzbmCPZj\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

    "description": "“Be true to yourself” is a dominant refrain in the Western world, but how has individualism come to be such a prominent feature of Western thought? To what extent is that individualism Christian? \n\nGlen Scrivener and Andrew Wilson are joined by Carl Trueman, author of \"The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self and Strange New World\", to answer those questions and continue their discussion of our post-Christian world. \n\nBeginning with Rousseau, they trace the ways in which our idea of the modern self has transformed and shaped our understanding of anthropology. Particularly touching on the transformations which have happened in our understanding of marriage, divorce and sex, they ask in what ways the church has become complicit in these changes and to what extent these individualistic assumptions have come to shape both the church and the world.\n\nOriginally released 21st November 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpvFZ4tuZ1s&t\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

Is there something inherently post-Christian baked into the pie from the founding of the nation? \n\nIn this episode, Andrew Wilson and Glen Scrivener continue their discussion of how the year 1776 has shaped our world. They trace the story forward to today, as they discuss slavery, human rights, the civil rights movement, and the sexual revolution. They talk about the apparent inevitability of progress in the 19th century and how those hopes were dashed by two world wars. \n\nWilson and Scrivener also consider how these huge cultural and societal changes interact with the gospel, and conclude by discussing the extent to which Christianity cannot be forced into the neat political categories of right and left, liberal and conservative.\n\nOriginally released 14th November 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://youtu.be/WjTZhwGJObU?si=VJCXbQw423w0Kxgf\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

They compare and contrast ancient, Christian, and secular virtues to explore the inherent inconsistencies of today’s culture, question how relativistic our society really is, and describe how we’ve arrived at a new pharisaism where those who don’t get on board with the modern program are the new heretics of our secular age.\n\nOriginally released 31st October 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://youtu.be/C196v9KNdgY?si=r6ArEk-7cPEoOquF\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

    "description": "How did Christianity come to shape Western culture? History is often told as the story of great men and events. But did Christianity come to shape Western culture simply as a “great idea” that carried the day? \n\nIn this episode, Glen Scrivener and Andrew Wilson explore the role of geography, technology, and coincidence in the spread of Christianity, which has so fundamentally shaped our assumptions about the world. Geography, geology, ecology, and economics are not the topics you would usually consider in a Christian podcast, but Glen and Andrew observe how those factors—along with the fundamental goodness of the gospel—combine to create an environment in which the worldview of the West was formed.\n\nOriginally released 24th October 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://youtu.be/F8Ob_VI1QwI?si=2HuiWfreFPGcyc-p\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

    "description": "“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,” says the Declaration of Independence. But is it really self-evident? What is the basis of equality? How have we come to think the way we do about the world? \n\nGlen Scrivener and Andrew Wilson discuss the making of the Western Mind and discuss how we became WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) as they trace the history of the West up to 1776. They make the case that far from being neutral, or self-evident, the values which many hold dear in the West today can be traced back through figures like Luther, Augustine, Paul, and ultimately to Jesus. \n\nThey show that in spite of its secular pretensions the West remains a place thoroughly shaped and marked by a Christian worldview. So are we really post-Christian? Or is Christianity the only framework that can really make sense of the things we value most?\n\nOriginally released 18th October 2023 on The Gospel Coalition: https://youtu.be/0-TuWKmkLvw?si=fuYIh3y3okvWXePP\n\nPost-Christianity Podcast: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/podcasts/post-christianity/\nThe Gospel Coalition: https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/\n\nDo the 321 course now, it's completely free.

We both opt out of the God that you doubt.” \n\nBut have you considered what Easter’s about?\n\nThere’s this Doubter called Thomas — a little like you, \nHe too had a TEST. He said: “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands,\nand touch the wound where the spear was rammed,\nI will not believe.”\n\nHe soon received his demand. \nThe butchered God arose to stand,\nand stretch again his hands, \nAnd say: “Look! \nSee! Reach out! Believe and do not doubt!” \nAnd Thomas knew, THIS is the FOUNT. \nNOW he was seeing the Source of all being, \nfor HERE was life poured out.\n\nHe was spent for the cursed, he was parched for the thirsty.\nAnd spilled every drop of his blood.\n\nOf COURSE Thomas cried—seeing hands and side—“YOU are my Lord and my God.”\n\nSo in the end, I say to my friend: HERE is the faith-giving sight— \nMaimed and magnificent. Wounded, omnipoten\nA warrior back from the fight.\n\nDo you have suspicions\nForget cosmic magicians; \nSee this battle-scarred conquering Knight.\n\nYou look for God, but you’ll fail to see if you raise your gaze to the stars,\n\nEaster would teach us to lower our sights: his story he writes in the scars.\n\n\n\nLINKS//\n\nSubscribe to this channel for videos that see all of life with Jesus at the centre:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/SpeakLifeMedia?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSubscribe to our other YouTube channel, Reformed Mythologist, to explore how the stories we love point to the greatest story of all:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@ReformedMythologist?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThe Speak Life Podcast is available wherever you get your podcasts:\niTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-speak-life-podcast/id626198781\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6RTY21mbOb3G0ywyXvowqy\nAmazon: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/e037fe1a-ba0d-4d1b-b419-36d4f0509cf3/the-speak-life-podcast\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world.\nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk\n\nCONNECT//\n\nWould you like to join us in person for an intensive?

    "description": "We are excited to bring you this series of videos to accompany Glen Scrivener's new book, The Air We Breathe: How We All Came to Believe in Freedom, Kindness, Progress, and Equality\n\nChapter 7: Freedom\n\nDISCUSSION QUESTIONS:\n\n1. What stood out to you from this chapter?\n2. Prior to the abolition of the slave trade, what were general attitudes toward slavery in the church and in the world?\n3. How do you make sense of the centuries that it took for abolition to happen and the church’s very mixed record on the issue?\n4. What drove abolition, and what has been the significance of it for the moral assumptions of the world?\n\nREAD GALATIANS 3:26-4:7\n1. According to these verses, what kinds of things keep people enslaved and unequal and how does Christ address this?\n2. What are the implications of these verses for equality and freedom in the church, and in the world?\n\nWatch the other videos, download the discussion guide and buy the book (in paper, e-book or Audible versions) here: https://www.thegoodbook.co.uk/the-air-we-breathe",

We haven’t always.\nThe Bible starts with evening then,\nAt dawn, the dark’s devoured again.\nBut these days we appraise the blaze as a phase.\nAnd midnight to midnight frames our ways.\nWe begin in the dark and end in the gloom\nAs though the sun could be entombed.\nAs though the light could be consumed\nAnd with that thinking all assume\nOur onward march is surely doomed.\n\nBut what if it’s gonna be alright?\nWhat if the future’s blazing bright?\nAnd we’re headed fierce to dawning light?\n\nWhat counts when we count our years?\nThis here’s the number to calm our fears:\nTwenty Twenty Three AD, or to make a full record:\nThe two thousand and twenty third year of our Lord. \n\nWhat we count is HIS domain. \nThe One best known for being slain,\nIs One that death could not contain.\nAnd he begins the clocks again.\nHe’s the driver of this train.\nAnd nothing — Nothing! — will stop his reign.\n\nThrough the nighttime into day,\nResolute his onward way.\n\nAnd so with him you need not fear:\nIt’s always and forever a Happy New Year.\n\nLINKS//\n\nSubscribe to our main YouTube channel for short reaction videos, storytelling and podcast clips:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/SpeakLifeMedia?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSubscribe to The Speak Life Podcast YouTube channel for our long-form content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TheSpeakLifePodcast?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThe Speak Life Podcast is available wherever you get your podcasts:\niTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-speak-life-podcast/id626198781\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6RTY21mbOb3G0ywyXvowqy\nAmazon: https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/e037fe1a-ba0d-4d1b-b419-36d4f0509cf3/the-speak-life-podcast\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world.\nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk/\n\nCONNECT//\n\nAre you a creative Christian?

Eternity unfurled!\nAnd He will call the age to be on that exquisite dawn\n\"Come in\" He says \"I'll give you shelter from the storm.\"\n\n----\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world. \nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk/\n\nSocial Media\nfacebook.com/speakLifeuk/\ntwitter.com/speaklifeuk/\ninstagram.com/speaklifeuk/\ntiktok.com/@speaklifeuk",

In the church calendar it's a time to remember the appearance of Christ to those eastern magician-astrologers, the Magi (Matthew 2:1-12). Incidentally it was on this day last year that the Capitol in Washington DC was overrun. What kind of 'appearance' was that, and how does it relate to the appearance of Christ?

    "description": "After 2020, we thought things could not go any lower. Then came 2021. There was the pandemic. And beyond Covid, there were other forces going viral — like tribalism and divisions (see this brilliant interview with Paul Blackham: https://youtu.be/RoAZ7zznkKw).\n\n2021 was also the year we grappled with terrible evil in our midst. At Speak Life we spoke to insiders at Ravi Zacharias International Ministries like Sam Allberry (https://youtu.be/SMA6ZDS7eLc), outsiders breaking the story like Steve Baughman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv4L8k1hs2A). We spoke to survivors like Lori Anne Thompson (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHUU-nVKT-0), and we spoke to healers like Diane Langberg (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvIpQnBpNWU). There are eleven videos in our Church Abuse Playlist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuOoXZ6RSPg&list=PL4zD5797LHdeSKbVtM7_AzOO-4miUyRQo). Please watch because this issue is not going away, and we need to continue to shine a light here.\n\n2021 was also difficult for personal reasons. Our own Paul Feesey spent 3 months in hospital with his one year old daughter who came close to death many times. Paul talking of the sustaining grace of Jesus has been one of the highlights of this year: https://youtu.be/yPIvVA43yZk\n\nThis year has also seen great growth as experienced evangelist and filmmaker Nate Morgan Locke has joined us on the team: https://youtu.be/lOz6GU-1ARE\n\nNate has helped us get ready for our third year of the Foundry. With creative evangelists coming from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the US, it’s been our biggest yet. We’ve also invited people here for our intensive weeks of training where people from all over the country meet the team, catch the vision and learn the craft. And we’ve had regular Friday intensives where we study Scripture, Culture, Creativity and Mission.\n\nThroughout it all we’ve been producing our regular weekly broadcasts as well as our seasonal short films: \n\nCancel Valentines: https://youtu.be/1A1QGrnedlQ\n\nBest Dad: https://youtu.be/JMBl7bzKBtw\n\nMr Thankful: https://youtu.be/lXYy4W5wAfM\n\nChristmouse: https://youtu.be/g0bYPt8Upzo\n\nThe Night Before Christmas: https://youtu.be/6OHYB4bQNl4\n\nWe've made over a hundred videos, with over a million views. Ten million minutes of gospel proclamation have been watched on YouTube alone. Then there's our impact on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, podcasting, face to face and in the ongoing discipleship of young evangelists.\n\nNext year, watch out for a fresh look coming to Speak Life: an all new website; the refilming of 321 our evangelistic presentation; a new book—The Air We Breathe—and a new intake of trainee evangelists. But here’s what won’t change, we will keep on lifting up the name of Jesus however we can to resource the church and reach the world.\n\nWill you help us?\n\nWe cannot do this alone. We have a faithful band of supporters who keep the work afloat here at Speak Life — we are so grateful for them — but they need brothers and sisters alongside them. If you’ve benefited from Speak Life why not consider us a missionary organisation that you support. You give to your local church, perhaps you give to a missionary overseas, would you please consider supporting us as a growing Christian ministry in great need of your prayers and your financial help. All we do is down to the generosity of people just like you. Join the happy band of supporters at speaklife.org.uk/give.\n\nSo whoever you are and whatever kind of year you have had, I pray you know the blessings of Immanuel right here in the midst of this dark valley, and the hope of the dawning light that has broken upon this world. From the whole Speak Life team, we wish you a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world. \nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk/\n\nSocial Media\nfacebook.com/speakLifeuk/\ntwitter.com/speaklifeuk/\ninstagram.com/speaklifeuk/\ntiktok.com/@speaklifeuk",

    "description": "Tonight on the SpeakEasy, Glen Scrivener and Nate Morgan Locke discuss the prevalence of expressive individualism. Modern people focus on ourselves, our journeys, our identities. We minimise the influence of history, family, culture, institutions—even biology. Instead we spotlight our personal experience and individual choices. But why?\n\nThe turn towards the self took a decisive step in 1517 and evangelicals have been treading the path ever since. Are we to blame for this massive emphasis on \"identity\"?",

The dark defy?\nStoke the hearth? Retreat indoors?\nRug up warm with you and yours?\nThe shadow reaches even here,\nBut THIS is the place for Christmas cheer.\n\nIt’s dark, in the bible, when Christmas is spoken.\nAlways a bolt from the blue for the broken.\nIt’s the valley of shadow, the land of the dead,\nIt’s, “No place in the inn,” so He stoops to the shed.\nHe’s born to the shameful, bends to the weak,\nbecomes the lowly: the God who can’t speak!\nAnd yet, what a Word, this Saviour who comes,\nOur dismal, abysmal depths He plumbs.\nThrough crib and then cross, to compass our life.\nTo carry and conquer. Our Brother in strife.\nHe became what we are: our failures He shouldered,\nTo bring us to His life: forever enfolded.\nHe took on our frailty, He took on all-comers,\nTo turn all our winters to glorious summers.\n\nIt’s Christmas now, whatever the weather,\nSome soak in the sun, some huddle together.\nBut fair days or foul, our plight He embraces.\nReal Christmas shines in the darkest of places\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world. \nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk/\n\nSocial Media\nfacebook.com/speakLifeuk/\ntwitter.com/speaklifeuk/\ninstagram.com/speaklifeuk/",

    "description": "Glen Scrivener preached this sermon for Redeemer Church in Delhi, India on 26th July 2020. The passage is Acts 4:1-22.\n\n1 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 2 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 3 They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. 4 But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.\n\n5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. 7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”\n\n8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! 9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Jesus is\n\n“‘the stone you builders rejected,\n    which has become the cornerstone.’\n\n12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”\n\n13 When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. 14 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. 15 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. 16 “What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. 17 But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”\n\n18 Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! 20 As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”\n\n21 After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. 22 For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world. \nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk/\n\nJoin our internship programme here: https://speaklifefoundry.com/\n\nSubscribe to Speak Life and get our regular videos: http://tiny.cc/ecjbgz\n\nSocial Media\nfacebook.com/speakLifeuk/\ntwitter.com/speaklifeuk/\ninstagram.com/speaklifeuk/",

    "title": "Highest Death Toll During Corona || Numbers || Poem",
    "description": "Numbers. \nThat’s what we get, each day we’re beset\nwith numbers. \n\nNumbers doing what numbers do,\nNumbing the me, numbing the you,\nNumbing our sense of the she and the he,\nNumbing the sense that THEY are me.\nWith numbers ‘They’ stay ‘THEY’, \nIt’s what numbers have allowed.\nEach life lost is lost in the crowd.\n\nThe shroud of death enfolds the heap,\nCosts it cheap. We try to weep but numbers can put us all to sleep.\n\nExcept for those who we have known,\nOur flesh and blood, our very own,\nWho, when exhaling final groans, heard our goodbyes on the phone.\nAnd then were buried all alone.\n\nHow can each loss be shown?\n\nEach mum, each son, each dad, each wife,\nEach irreplaceable, iridescent life. \nEach gift a vast amount.\nEach ONE too much to count.\n\nBeware the numbers, our dose each day,\nUntil we’re numbered all away. \nUntil we’re deadened to the toll,\nTill each one’s lost into the whole.\n\nBut no. Awake my soul. \nMake each figure strike,\nLike spurs in my flesh, to stir me afresh,\nTo see galactic worth distilled in each daughter of earth, \nin each son brought to birth,\nAnd near infinite crime in snuffing them out. \nLet me shout to the skies with full-throated cries, \nand, desperate—despise—when the least of them dies. \n\nAnd when COVID is done, \nMay the numbers not numb\nMay we wake from our slumber\nAnd number each one.\n\nBecause some day soon you will hear \nthat the peak is long past and we’ve got the All Clear.\nThe lockdown has lifted and friends can draw near. \nAnd we will cheer. \nBut let’s be clear,\nThe numbers are not \nwhat they appear. \n\nEach year, in this land, understand we have FOUR Covids.\nIn This Nation, 200 000 terminations.\nA four-fold pestilence devours these isles, the dead in piles, a hideous mount.\nBut do THEY count?\n\nIn heaven’s account but what will WE say?\nEach day, 550 slain. They are Abel. We are Cain. \nAnd righteous blood cries out in vain. \n\nIt does not enter our calculation. We deem it beneath our briefing the nation. We only make public explanation of THESE when disEASE is pursuing. But not when the deaths are All OUR doing. \n\nAnd maybe you say, “It doesn’t compare.” \nI say: That’s fair.\n\nCos with the virus we were afflicted, this black death is self-inflicted.\nAre you convicted?\n\nI’ll depict another figure, this one’s bigger. \nAs I bring this number, I hear you numbing, You are. You’re ahhing and umming,\nYou’re drumming your fingers. Your mind is elsewhere. There you go with that thousand yard stare.\nAre you there?\n\nBy June, worldwide, half a million have died of COVID. As I’ve said, each ONE dead is plenty. But if we’re counting in millions, abortion’s killed 20. And that’s just by June.\n\nIt’s not stopping any time soon.\nEvery four days it kills more than the virus. \nLet this truth fire us: in 96 hours it devours just the same. But without the fame. \nThis, friend, is our silent shame. \n\nSo awake my soul. Make each figure strike,\nLike spurs in my flesh, to stir me afresh,\nTo see galactic worth distilled in each daughter of earth, \nin each son meant for birth.\nAnd near infinite crime in snuffing them out. \nLet me shout to the skies with full-throated cries, and—desperate—despise, when the least of them dies. \n\nAnd when COVID is done, \nMay the numbers not numb\nMay we wake from our slumber\nAnd number each one.\n\n\nGlen Scrivener is an Australian author and speaker living in the UK.\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world. \n\nLearn more about us here: https://speaklife.org.uk/\n\nSocial Media\nfacebook.com/speakLifeuk/\ntwitter.com/speaklifeuk/\ninstagram.com/speaklifeuk/",

    "description": "For a louder version of the same video go here: https://youtu.be/ExnQDbfFiGU \n\nAndrew Baughen of Reality Church, London poses Glen Scrivener questions about the faith gathered from many enquirers.\n\n1. Is the God that Jews and Muslims believe in the same as the Christian God?\n\n2. Is it possible to be a Christian and believe in evolution?\n\n3. What would you have said to Charles Darwin?\n\n4. Is the whole of scripture relevant today? \n\n5. How can we trust that the entire Bible was breathed out by God?\n\n6. Why would God allow the Coronavirus? \n\n7. How should we think about all the different denominations of Christianity?\n\n8. Should we pray to \"Our Father...\", or Jesus or the Holy Spirit, or...? \n\n9. How do you pray?\n\n10. Especially during lockdown married relationships are under strain. What help does Christianity give to maintaining good relationships. \n\nFollow Reality Church London on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/realitychurchlondon/\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world.

    "description": "Words by Benjamin Holmes\n\nThe story of all stories\nWritten into nature\nObscured by the furniture\nLies a story unable to be deleted from the history books\nBut no villain can kill\nIt’s echoing still\nWe write our own path within the parameters, \nAnd we wrote in death, disease and the need for the ambulance\nPlaced, purposely for perfection\nMankind chose negation rather than to live as designed creation\nThrough disobedience and rejection, and sullen introspection\nWe’ve turned from light and life, \nWe’ve chosen fire and strife,\nNo longer able to dwell with brightness\nLike sheep gone astray we’ve turned from God’s way\nWe’ve gone off script - created our own devilish ditch\n\nBut    the    Author\n\nHe wrote Himself in when He could have written off humanity \nLike a root out of dry ground, a tender shoot He grew up\nOne mission in His mind to save mankind \nAll who are weary, abandoned, despised,\nBroken, neglected, hard done by and hopeless\nThese are the characters Christ had in focus\nAll who admit to their faults and come humbly\nHe swoops down from heaven and aims for that one tree\n\nUp the hill \nToo weak to carry His own cross\nToo meek to ascend to heaven without gathering the lost\nThe carpenter’s hands outstretched to the world He once carved\nHis body now starved \nDisfigured and dying the Maker pinned down who had hung up the earth…now crying\nWe had no time and made no place but He stepped into time and space to take my place, the place that was meant to be mine to face\n\nBroken, mangled, swollen\nThe ultimate image bearer beaten so badly the image just bears pain with eternal scars\nBut these wounds are from love, healing our wound when we fell from above \nThe author of life, is now authored to die, \nHe met us who failed and entered our tale - accepted the thorns and the spear and the nails\nHe knew how it ended yet still he expended His life like a lamb that was slain\n\nHe shouldered the pain as the Father pressed down, that crown of thorns and sin of the world crushed him as he became an offering for sin\nHe authored this world’s laws yet put His glory on pause \nto die for the sinners cause\nThe sinners who pierced Him\n\n\nAnd then..\nHe ascends, his labours now finished his sacrifice crowned \nThe lamb on the throne as the credits roll down\n\n\nThe tale untwisted, the story rewritten\nThe author turned Hero, to do what we didn’t\nTo do what we couldn’t, to undo the curse.\nThose arms nailed wide span the universe\n\nStretching beyond all the forces that scatter, \nwritten in scars forever\n‘You matter’\n\nThe Hero who dies and rises in glory\nThe author of life rewriting the story\n\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world.

    "title": "The Happyland Nativity: The Meaning of Christmas",
    "description": "Speak Life and Hope Together have recreated the Nativity scene, a summary of the birth of Jesus, with characters from the Happyland nativity set in a stop motion video. This short story comes directly from the Bible to tell the true meaning of the Christmas holiday. Follow with Mary, Joseph, the angels, and sheep as they travel through a quirky animated adventure.\n\nLuke chapter 2:\nIn those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.  He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,\n “Glory to God in the highest heaven,\n    and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”\n When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”\n So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.  When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.\n\nDownload this video for use in your church or school: https://speaklife.org.uk/nativity\n\nCreated by Speak Life in conjunction with Hope Together\n\nHOPE Together is a catalyst bringing churches together to transform communities in villages, towns and cities.\nTo learn more about Hope visit: https://www.hopetogether.org.uk/\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hopetogether/\nTwitter: @HOPEtogether\nInstagram: @hopetogether\n\nSpeak Life is a UK based charity that resources the church to reach the world.  To learn more about us visit: https://speaklife.org.uk/\nTo learn more about the nativity visit: http://speaklife.org.uk/nativity/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SpeakLifeUK/\nTwitter: @speaklifeUK\nInstagram: @speaklifeUK\n\nThanks must also go to Claire, Autumn and Noah Povey for providing our fantastic voiceover!",

Using the latest in neuroscience as well as insights from philosophy and theology Sharon demonstrates how \"reductive physicalism\" cannot account for the latest scientific data, nor the most basic facts of our conscious experience. \n\nIn this conversation with Glen Scrivener, Sharon speaks about the mind-body problem, the latest scientific discoveries and the way Christian faith makes best sense of our world.\n\nGet Sharon's book from The Good Book Company here: https://www.thegoodbook.co.uk/am-i-just-my-brain",

    "description": "It’s the fairy tale we all believe in – connection, completion, love without parting. The merest glimpse of it captures our hearts. But is the fairy tale real? Is there such a thing as endless bliss, unconquered love and a happily ever after?\n\nCountless failed relationships and a beckoning grave cry out No. Love does not seem to have the last word in our lives – decay, disease, divorce, depression and death does. Can we really believe in love?\n\nThe answer is Yes, but only because there is a love despite our deserving, a love stronger than death, a love beyond this world. Jesus makes the fairy tale true – not just for bright-eyed young couples on their wedding day. Because of his blood-earnest, death-defying love, Jesus can bring us all into the ultimate romance. Whatever your relationship history or status, this bliss is for you!\n\nYou\nbeside me.\nMe: beside myself with you.\nBeyond myself in you,\nBecome myself anew,\nBelongs, this self, to you.\n\nYou\nbehold me.\nMe: behold the world in you.\nBesotted with the view,\nBewitched by all you do,\nBeguiled by guileless you.\n\nWe\nbelieve this:\nThis bedtime tale\nThough countless fail\nThough pride derail\nThough death curtail\n\nWe believe this.\nThis bliss\nBesieged by hatred’s hiss\nBeset by graves’ abyss\nBetrayed despite our kiss\nWe believe this.\n\nBut is this bliss true?\nOr only for the few\nAnd then sinks from view\nIs it true?\nBeneath the tale,\nBefore we fail,\nBeside what’s frail,\nBeyond death’s vale?\nIs it true?\n\nNot only for the few\nAnd then sinks from view\nIs it true?\n\nHe\nBeheld me.\nMe: deep held in my disgrace.\nHe bends now face to face,\nBecomes me in His grace,\nBefriends me, takes my place.\n\nHe\nBetrothed me.\nMe: bestowed the world for free.\nBequeathed by royal decree,\nBeloved eternally,\nBecome as one: He with me.\n\nThis, beneath all other glories\nThis, beyond the bedtime stories\nThis, beside your marital station\nThis, love’s sweetest consummation.\n\nThis is true.\nNever to sink from view.\nNot only for the few.\nThis bliss is for you.\n\n#Valentines #ValentinesDay #Love",

    "title": "In the beginning by Glen Scrivener",
    "description": "\"In the beginning\" is the first of 12 phrases that can take you through the Bible in Glen Scrivener's latest book, \"Long Story Short.\"\n\nhttps://www.christianfocus.com/products/2758/long-story-short\n\n“In the beginning”, ink still wet,\nPrimeval paths, positioned, set.\nCreation’s canopy clipped in place,\nPotential fixed in time and space.\n\nWhat force began that first beginning?\nWhat set the world and galaxies spinning?\nWhat weight subsists beneath all things?\nWhat source from which this splendour springs?\n\nIt seems to me you have four choices,\nFour competing primal voices.\nSomething calls the tune above:\nNothing, Chaos, Power or Love?\n\nNow nothing is a strange head-waters,\nAs old King Lear said to his daughters,\n“Nothing will come of nothing”, and yet\nSome think nonentities beget.\n\nUnless their “nothing”s an ancient rumbling,\nA giant, cavernous, black, old something,\nBut if in every sense it’s nought,\nThen life’s a miracle, absurdly wrought. \n\nAnd all our days are spent suspended,\nOver the abyss to which we’re tended.\nLaughing, learning, living, loving,\nBut push beneath, it’s really nothing.\n\nLife’s a breath and soon exhaled,\nThe darkness wins, the light has failed.\nWe burn our lamps but night is crowned.\nFrom blackness born, to blackness bound.\n\nAnd so to chaos some will turn.\nPrimeval punch-ups their concern:\nBangs and Blasts and Battles, War,\nThese begot us in days of yore.\n\nThe myths of old saw earth deriving\nFrom the deities conniving.\nWarring gods began the trouble,\nWe are just the cosmic rubble.\n\nStill today we have our clashes,\nLife emerges from the ashes,\nOf stars exploding, species striving,\nThe weak devoured, the strong surviving.\n\nAnd if we live with this regime,\nThen selfishness must reign supreme.\nIt’s dog eat dog, you get ahead,\nUntil your toppled, then you’re dead.\n\nBut maybe you think life is more\nThan endless struggle, pointless war.\nPerhaps above the chaos towers,\nSome all-controlling cosmic powers.\n\nAnd “In the beginning...” there was the LAW\nOf gravity or something more.\nThis power reigns, all must succumb\nAnd dance to its relentless drum.\n\nAnd then the faith-head comes along,\nStarts to sing the same old song.\n“There is a sovereign, we are awed,\nLet’s call this boundless power: God.”\n\nAnd “in the beginning”, imagine a throne.\nPower personified, all alone.\nNo back and forth, no give and take,\nThis Self exists for Self’s own sake.\n\nIf such a god decrees creation,\nCreatures have but one relation.\nGod’s a cosmic Chairman Mao,\nDefined by might his world must bow.\n\nAnd so religious folk are sated,\nRendering reverence unabated.\nFrom nothing and from chaos saved,\nYet under Power now enslaved.\n\nIs this how Christians see the matter?\nGod a narcissist to flatter?\nIf this were true all hope’s bereft,\nBut there is another option left.\n\nWe read in Genesis and John,\nA life of love before the dawn.\nA Father, Son and Spirit bound,\nIn self poured out and, losing, found.\n\nIn back and forth these Three delight,\nAnd share one life of radiant light.\nBehold: This deferential dance,\nThis ancient and profound romance. \n\nThis is the bubbling brook that burst\nthe banks of endless love immersed,\nTo flood all else with light and longing,\nSoak our souls with true belonging.\n\nThis: the pulse of all creation,\nThis: the primitive vibration,\nThis: all nature’s explanation,\n“In the beginning”: Adoration. \n\nWhere are the well-adjusted minds?\nWhich faith to deepest truth aligns?\nFor all will hold that love is first,\nBut in their creed the rank’s reversed. \n\nWe live as though self-giving’s best,\nWe deem a life of service blessed.\nWe spend our lives as loved and lover,\nAnd then conclude it’s all a cover?\n\nFor if nothing’s our source, then life’s absurd.\nIf chaos, then war’s the final word.\nIf power, then all of us are slaves.\nAnd yet it’s love the whole world craves.\n\nSo what’s our “beginning”?  Our answers count.\nBoth ‘now’ and ‘next’ spring from this fount.\nWhich sovereign ruler reigns above?\nNothing, Chaos, Power, or Love?",

    "description": "All 3 \"Funny Thing\" Easter poems: \n\nA Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Tomb\n\nThis’ll make you smile, \nSo God’s dead.\nNot the most fertile ground for comedy,\nBut stick with me a while.\nGod’s dead, he bled out on Friday before dusk, a husk of a God, \nBuried in sod, planted in a virgin tomb,\nAn unpromising womb but I guess that’s his style.\n\nNow Saturday was a holy day, and anyway everyone needed a rest after killing God,\nSo they put a day aside to recover from the deicide,\nWhich brings us to Sunday. \nAnd there are some women who really want to attend to God’s corpse,\nbecause of course it’s bad manners to have God rotting in the tomb. \nYou should at least perfume the cadaver, \nso they have a journey ahead.\n\nAnd as they tread this path they disregard pretty much all he said,\nBecause he told them he was God and death could not hold him. \nSo if any were believing they would not be grieving,\nThey’d presume that service would soon resume. \nThey’d camp beside the tomb and wait for God to self-exhume. \n\nBut no, no-one believed God, not even his believers.\nWe can’t conceive a Higher Power really.\nNot higher than the grave which will devour,\nThat’s the One to make us cower.\nThat glowering conqueror of light.\nIt’s never lost a fight.\nEach extinguished breath, \nDeclares that death is Lord.\nIt’s scored a victory over every rival.\n\nAt God’s arrival we briefly entertained a doubt: ‘Maybe Life’s in with a shout,’ \nBut on Friday he was out for the count, \nand we went back to perfuming our cadavers. \nCos all we have, it seems, is corpse preservation regimes.\nAnd so these women resign themselves to a truth alarming:\nEven God requires embalming. \n\nAnd then, it’s empty. \nHe is not there. \nNot in the place where he lay, \nNot in the domain of decay. \nDeath made its play, \nBut God made a bolder move.\n\nHe’s won. \nThey’re stunned. \nNone dared believe it, \nBut now, NOW they’re crying.\nLife has killed death by dying.\nHe’s Devoured the beast that swallowed him, \nCrushed the abyss by falling in,\nDestroyed destruction from within. \n\nThe Seed’s burst out on Easter morn\nThe Son from the virgin tomb is born\nThe valley of shadow receives its dawn\nAnd a hole through death is forever torn.\n\nAnd these mourners look through, to see Him.\nAnd to see Him is to view Home. \nHome shorn of thorns, \nHome reborn, Home adorned with golden hue.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, this the view:\nIt’s country walks and heart-warming talks,\nMind-blowing preaches and breakfast on beaches,\nFeasting and family and peace and grace,\nAnd Jesus our Battle-Scarred Brother, face to face. \n\nMaybe we came to the tomb to pretty a corpse and honour the dead. \nBut today instead we meet a living God. \nAnd so, with a tremor in our voices but steel in our bones, \nWe dare to step on the monster’s neck,\nAs it writhes under a Victor’s blow. \nAnd in the face of hell we bellow: \nO Grave, Where is your victory, \nO Death, Where is your sting? \n\nWe sing the happily ever after. \nHere begins the Easter laughter.\n\n\nspeaklife.org.uk",

    "description": "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Execution - some Easter themed stand-up poetry.\n\nDid you hear the one about the God who croaked? \nIt’s kind of a joke. \n\nHe’s this bloke, shows up broke, \nAmong downtrodden folk\nSpoke truth, full tilt, words spilt, \nHe’s a Jew doing stand up with a northern lilt.\nBuilt worlds with his words, provoked laughter, stoked rage,\nAwoke guilt in the powerful then to assuage,\n\nBut his schtick uncloaked the crowd, pricked the proud,\nHe ploughed dangerous and deep. To the core.\nAnd history saw that when Truth is so uncouth as to speak, we freak. \nIn frenzied violence.\nWe’re proud to be woke but when God spoke, we choked him to silence.\nThat’s the joke.\n\nHeaven came preaching, earth would not hear\nWe said “Shut the hell up”, \nWhich was his whole idea.\nHe said: “I’ll set you free”, so we put him in chains,\nTo teach him who or what on earth really reigns.\n\nSo God goes on trial, \nthe file against him’s thin, but they pile in.\nAccusers line up through the night, \nyet none turn out to line up right,\n\nAnd all the while God pleads the fifth,\nAn Adamantine monolith.\nHe will not baulk.\nThey knock, they mock, they hurl their mud against the rock,\nNothing makes him talk.\nAnd not one accusation sticks,\nExcept, the one he fixed upon from the start: He’s God.\nImplacably so. \n\nWell case closed, he has to go.\nWhat’s he done? None can say\nBut for who he is, God must pay.\nHere’s the shock: the Judge is put in the dock\nThe guilty sit on high\nAnd make their verdict: Life must die.\nThe Truth is held in contempt of reason.\nThe King convicted of high treason,\nAnd to cap it all, their genius trick,\nGod’s declared a heretic.\n\nSo the Mover of worlds is pinned to a stake,\nHis thirst unslaked, \nHis life-blood taken\nEarth shaken,\nGod forsaken.\n\nHe turned his cheek, earth clenched its fist\nAnd hammered heaven’s Pacifist.\n\nAnd the man who drove the nails, the soldier who impales his Maker with a spear,\nTo him it’s suddenly clear, however odd:\nThis is what it looks like to be God.\nNot a thunderbolt hurled, \nArms wide open to the world, \nForgiveness unfurled to his murderers.\nThis is God. Covered in blood.\nThis is Good.\nGood Friday, if you credit it, \nGood news, if you let it. \nA good joke, if you get it.\n\nspeaklife.org.uk",

    "description": "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Jerusalem - some Easter themed stand-up poetry.\n\nSo there’s this guy who says that he’s God. \nRepeatedly. \nAnd he’s not a fraud. He is the still centre of sanity\nNo sliver of vanity, Purest humanity.\nBut he’s God.\nAnd he needs you to know that he’s God — \nGod on a mission —\nHe’s got a real Messiah complex. \nThe original condition. \nA messiah complex with a death wish and that’s the joke. \nCos when he spoke his claim, all would complain, crying “Prove it!” \nAnd he says: ‘I’ll show you I’m God, Watch me die.’ Which is odd as a sign of deity. \nBut he doesn’t just say it, he hurls himself fierce at the grave,\nDeclaring that this is the behaviour of divinity.\n\nHe’ll assert his infinity by choking to death, to croak his last breath in rasping benediction.\nHe’s the Fountain of Life and the clearest depiction His conviction’s non-fiction is a cry of dereliction. One hell of a crucifixion.\n\nThere’s this guy and he’s God and he must die, on this he’ll insist.\nIt’s the item on his bucket list.\nHe’s Messiah with a death-wish and\nWhile for us the goal of “Dying” would represent a distinct lack of ambition,\nFor him it’s his mission.\nTo be slain as a Lamb:\nHe said “When I’m lifted up, then you’ll know that I AM.” That I AM WHO I AM. \nThen you’ll know it’s not a scam. \nTo see him damned by earth, hell and heaven\nThen comes recognition: here’s the definition of glory.\n\nSo in the story this King marches to his throne, \nhis face set like stone, \nto ascend the hill, and assert his will, to reign in state.\nProtocol dictates he should ride a steed, \nOf noble breed, perhaps a stallion, and, behind, his battalion and so to his office accede.\n\nBut here’s the thing. This King rides a donkey. Or two –– \nSo Matthew reckoned, he remembers a second,\nAn old cloak laid astride these poor brutes side by side.\nSo picture the scene. Lining the road: Israel’s people and priests, \nAnd God all-precarious atop these two beasts.\nA royal charade,\nA half-assed parade.\n \nAnd they’re hailing him King,\nAnd he looks like a fool, And still he rides on, the irony cruel\nCos he knows that the crowd enraptured in praise\nWill bay for his blood in a matter of days.\nBut still he rides down this road, he cannot be slowed,\nOn this trajectory locked, he will be mocked and forlorn,\nHis figure torn, \nmajesty shorn, \nCrowned by thorns, \nWith nails adorned, \nEnthroned in scorn,\nHis kingdom borne across trembling shoulders.\nAnd yet on he soldiers.\n \nFor this is his divine vocation, \nDecidedly not an assassination,\nSomehow it’s his coronation,\nBecause here the Fountain is comprehended \nWhen we see it full-expended,\nIn death the Life-Spring, crimson poured\nBecomes the proof that He is Lord.\n\nSo on he rides in asinine glory.\nEaster is a funny story.\n\nspeaklife.org.uk",

Like Will, the boyfriend, she too feels estranged – from the heart of the family and from the joy she's \"meant\" to feel at this most wonderful time of the year. It's not a wonderful time for Ruth. In fact Christmas is particularly hard for her. And she copes the only way she knows how, by taking control of her immediate circumstances – the house, the food, the decorations – becoming a whirl of frenzied activity. She's doing her best but feeling far from Christmas joy.\n\nRuth's story reflects the story of so many. We feel we need to be full of Christmas cheer yet, for any number of reasons, it may be a particularly hard season for us. How do we cope? Perhaps we try to take control, to order the chaos, to \"tidy things up a bit.\" It never works. We end up feeling fed up, under-appreciated and surrounded by mess.\n\nBut Ruth 'meets the nativity', and there she discovers a Christmas joy that enters into our chaos. \"That baby should not be here\" she cries and she's right. God the Son ought not to stoop to such circumstances. He belongs on a throne, not wriggling on straw in a cold and hostile world. But there he is. And he's offered to Ruth.\n\nShe objects: \"My hands are dirty\", but he doesn't seem to mind. He's given anyway. And finally, as Ruth receives this ultimate Christmas gift, she is still. As she had exclaimed in exasperation to the vicar, now she says to Christ: \"Welcome to the mess.\" What mess?

His whole mission is to enter our mess, to be received by dirty-handed failures like you and me, to take that dirt on himself on the cross and to offer us true peace.

    "description": "For the last 6 Christmases, Speak Life has had Christmas campaigns that have reached millions online. This Christmas, we've got a wonderful idea, it's basically, 'Meet the Parents' meets 'The Nativity'. Are you intrigued? We hope so! We've got the perfect location for it as you can see. We've got professional people infront of the camera & behind the camera. Professional people working on the social media outreach but we really need your help to make this fly. We've got 4 quality episodes to drop on the 4 Mondays before Christmas Day, and then on Christmas Day itself, we've got a 12 minute 'super-cut', a wonderful short film. Can you help us with our crowdfunder? Can you help us get behind this project? And as the films come out, can you really help us by liking, subscribing and sharing with all your friends. This year, we really want to tell Good News of Great Joy for all people.",

    "description": "In John chapter 11, Jesus' best friend lies ill. His family beg Jesus to come and heal him. Jesus does not respond right away. When he shows up, Lazarus has been dead for four days. It seems he's too late.\n\nBut to this tragedy Jesus brings two surprising gifts - tears and triumph. He cries at the grave then raises his friend from death. It's these tears and triumph that we need in the face of our own tragedies.\n\nFind out more and get a free book by heading to: http://speaklife.org.uk/here/\n\nWritten & Performed by Glen Scrivener. \n\nKairos Film & Media, in association with Speak Life. \nMusic: Josh Lucas  |  Video & Edit: Luke Aylen",

    "description": "For more resources: speaklife.org.uk\n\nWORDS:\n\nThe Israelites in thirsty lands, trod burning sands with desperate craving,\nno longer slaving for Egyptian masters, now by grace they're free to face\nthis fresh disaster -- starving in a barren place.\n\nUntil the Bread of Heaven fell like morning dew each day anew,\nand to these folks complaining, every day the Bread sustaining,\nto lead them all their journey through.\n\nFast forward 1500 years: a Man appears, stands tall among His peers,\nAnd feeds the desert crowds without ado,\nA supernatural déjà vu.\nAnd having won the mob's attention then He makes His bold contention: \nHe IS the Bread of old, the One foretold to feed us and through our wilderness to lead us. \nCould His claim be true?\n\nIt's Thursday Night, an upper room, a supper strewn with broken bread,\nThen Jesus stands, a loaf in hand and says:\nTHIS IS MY BODY - and tears it like a lion tearing prey, \na raw dissection on display. \nIn pieces rent and ragged, edges jagged, now laid bare in disarray.\nHe'll feed His people in THIS way.\n\nHe the LORD for we the least, Him devoured so we can feast.\n\nAnd so to Friday - by a highway\nRivals gloating, Soldiers joking, mobs provoking, Jesus choking, \ntorment spoken, HERE the Bread of Heaven BROKEN.\n\nHe the LORD for we the least, Him devoured so we can feast.\n\nTHEN... Come Sunday and, like Bread, He rises, \nsurprises all His friends, extends the dinner invitation:\n\"COME ALL FROM EVERY NATION: This is the meaning of salvation:\n\nHe the LORD for we the least, Him devoured so we can feast.\"\n\nThis God served up upon the cross, \nHis posture still arms-open willing ALL to come and eat\nThis Bread is sweet and free - served up anew. \nAvailable like morning dew,\nTo lead you all your journey through,\nMy friend, this broken Bread's for YOU.",

Come Sunday and, like Bread, He rises,\nsurprises all His friends, extends the dinner invitation:\n\"COME ALL FROM EVERY NATION: This is the meaning of salvation:\n\nHe the LORD for we the least, Him devoured so we can feast.\"\n\nThis God served up upon the cross,\nHis posture still arms-open willing ALL to come and eat\nThis Bread is sweet and free - served up anew.\nAvailable like morning dew,\nTo lead you all your journey through,\nMy friend, this broken Bread’s for YOU.",
