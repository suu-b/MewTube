    "title": "Can Catholics Believe That Hell is Empty?",
    "description": "Full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNvx4u3sq_c\n\nCaller: Locally, here in Detroit recently, the Archbishop dismissed three seminary professors. There was no public comment, but apparently it was because of comments they made about the late Pope Francis questioning his teaching.\n\nI’ve looked into this a little bit, and I’m a little taken back by the dismissals because none of the comments that they made publicly seem to be, you know, in dissent or heresy. One of them was really about the doctrine of hell. Pope Francis had made some comments about he had hoped that hell was empty. When he was asked for clarification, there really wasn’t much clarification.\n\nSo what is the view of apologists?\n\nJimmy: I don’t speak for all apologists. I don’t even speak for all Catholic apologists. And frankly, apologists have different opinions about hell. Some apologists are very convinced that hell exists and that people really go there. Other apologists are hopeful that hell may be empty and that maybe some people have really long purgatories, but ultimately everybody makes it to heaven.\n\nI know apologists of both stripes and I know theologians of both stripes in terms of the ultimate population of hell. This is something that I would point Steve and other interested parties to a work that was written by Cardinal Avery Dulles a number of years ago called *The Population of Hell*. He goes through the various arguments of those who are convinced that hell is real and that people really go there.\n\nHe also goes through the arguments of what are sometimes called hopeful universalists, meaning people who would say, well, I can’t assert that hell is empty, but I could hope that hell is empty. I wouldn’t be quick to dismiss that as an unacceptable opinion in Catholic circles, because Hans Urs von Balthasar, who was a hopeful universalist, was appointed by John Paul II as a cardinal precisely because of his theological contributions to the Church.\n\nSo when you have John Paul II appointing someone as a cardinal because of his theological contributions and one of his ideas is hopeful universalism, that means we shouldn’t be too quick to say, oh, this is incompatible with the Catholic faith.\n\nNow, my own personal view is, although I would love hell to be empty, I think that there is a basis for saying that hell is real and that at least some people go there. I’m cautious about who that is. As both John Paul II and Benedict XVI said, the Church has not taught any specific individual is in hell, not even Judas.\n\nYou might think that Judas is in hell based on Jesus’s comments about Judas, but those comments presuppose that Judas never repented. And Matthew is explicit in saying Judas repented. So I agree with Pope Benedict that rather than insert ourselves into God’s place, we have to leave the fate of Judas open to God and entrust that question to him, because ultimately we don’t have the data needed to settle it conclusively.\n\nBut other apologists are going to have different opinions. Some are going to say Judas is definitely lost. Others are going to say Judas is definitely saved. The opinions among apologists aren’t in principle different than the opinions among other Catholics who study these issues and try to figure them out.\n\nSo I would say there is a diversity of opinions here. But I would also say that even though I think there is significant evidence from Scripture for the idea of people going to hell, there is also reason to not say that’s mandatory for the Christian faith.\n\nWhat Cardinal Avery Dulles does in his piece *The Population of Hell*, which was published in *First Things*, and you can find it online if you just search for Avery Dulles, *Population of Hell*, what he ends up concluding is we don’t know what the proportion is of people who go to hell versus the proportion of people who go to heaven.\n\nHe thinks that’s a good thing. Avery Dulles, by the way, is another theological cardinal, that is someone who was appointed a cardinal because of his profound theology. But he concludes it’s a good thing that we don’t ultimately know the answers, because if we knew that only a very few people make it to heaven and a large majority of people go to hell, we’d be tempted to despair of going to heaven and not even make the attempt.\n\nWhereas if we knew the reverse, if we knew that a very large number of people go to heaven and only a tiny number go to hell, we’d be tempted to get presumptuous. And it’s neither good for us to be presumptuous nor to despair.\n\nSo actually, not knowing the answer to this question provides a kind of healthy motivation for us to take the possibility of being lost seriously and thus avoid mortal sin, while simultaneously not being tempted to utterly despair and give up.",

Wouldn’t we notice their absence and grieve?\n22:15 - What is the Church’s current teaching on evangelizing Jewish people?\nDoes God’s promise of the land to the Jewish people still apply under the New Covenant?\n29:45 - Why is the Eucharistic cup often withheld from the laity? Jesus instructed us to eat His body and drink His blood. If the host contains both, why does the priest still consume both species separately?\n34:58 - Why are the dogmas of the Immaculate Conception, Bodily Assumption, and Perpetual Virginity necessary for salvation from a theological standpoint? What core gospel truths are denied if these are rejected?\n43:43 - If someone nearing death sees and speaks to deceased family members, does that mean those individuals are in Heaven or could they still be in Purgatory?

It seems there isn’t any case, but as it gets brought up so often, what could be a strong man case for it? \n35:02 - Hello from the UK, Jimmy. What exactly is a Doctor of the Church, and why are their views held in higher esteem compared to any other theologian or apologist?

He steel-mans them to give them the best possible chance of working, but do they? Are they consistent with the evidence we have from the Bible? Has James White finally provided a compelling proof that Mary does not know people are asking her to intercede? Or does James’s position actually conflict with Scripture?

    "description": "The Jimmy Akin Podcast | Episode 024 (March 3, 2025)\n\nFor millennia, people assumed that the heart is the seat of our thoughts and emotions. Even the Bible and Church documents use this language. But more recently, medical science has suggested that the head—not the heart—is where our thoughts and emotions come from.\n\nIn this episode, Jimmy Akin looks at how we can understand the heart-centered language in the Bible and Church documents in light of head-centered science. He also throws up several cautions about taking the head-centered science too strictly and why we have reason to think that neither the heart nor the head is the ultimate cause of consciousness.\n\nTimecodes\n00:00 – Coming Up\n00:29 – Intro\n01:03 – 1 The Head-Centered Model\n02:03 – 2 The Heart-Centered Model\n03:08 – 3 Biblical History\n05:02 – 4 Post-Biblical History\n06:32 – 5 How the Head-Centered Model Began\n07:06 – 6 Heart-Centered Language in Church Documents\n08:12 – 7 Heart-Centered Language in the Bible\n10:21 – 8 Reasons for Caution\n12:28 – Closing/Outro\n13:23 - End",

Gavin claims that there was no bishop of Rome (pope) until well into the second century and that—even if we grant that Peter was the first pope—so much hangs on the idea that there are later popes that, if this were true, it needs to be taught in the New Testament.

    "description": "The Jimmy Akin Podcast | Episode 021 (February 10, 2025)\n\nIn this episode, Jimmy explores an idea that is seldom proposed in Protestant circles—the claim that their core principle of sola scriptura (“by Scripture alone”) is not actually a doctrine. Instead, it’s an interpretive principle.\n\nThe motivation for this claim is that, if sola scriptura is a doctrine then—since it holds that all doctrines have to be proved by Scripture alone—sola scriptura itself must be proved by Scripture alone, and it can’t be. It’s thus self-refuting.\nThis has led a few Protestants to propose that sola scriptura is not a doctrine but an ordinary rule of interpretation that should be justified by reason alone rather than by passages of Scripture.\n\nOne of the most sustained treatments of this idea is from Austin Suggs of Gospel Simplicity, and in this episode Jimmy interacts with Austin’s proposals and sees how well the idea of sola scriptura as an interpretive principle rather than a doctrine holds up.\n\nTimecodes\n00:00 – Coming Up\n00:25 – Intro\n01:00 – Who Is Austin Suggs?\n01:45 – Sola Scriptura\n05:00 – Objection 1: Sola Scriptura Isn’t in Scripture\n06:35 – Objection 2: Sola Scriptura Couldn’t Work Before the Canon\n11:06 – Objection 3: The Fathers Don’t Teach Sola Scriptura\n12:50 – Objection 4: We Can’t Agree on What Sola Scriptura Is\n18:29 – Objection 5: Sola Scriptura Makes Everyone the Pope\n25:31 – The Story So Far . . .\n28:10 – What Is Sola Scriptura?\n30:50 – Not the Historic Understanding\n34:27 – Catholics Can Agree!\n36:31 – What To Do?\n38:10 – Doctrine or Principle\n39:39 – Justifying Interpretive Principles\n42:00 – Sola Scriptura as an Interpretive Principle\n44:53 – A Proposed Fix?\n46:18 – The First of Two Paths\n47:24 – Is Scripture Our Most Reliable Source?\n48:32 – Additional Problems\n49:10 – The Non-Canonical Problem\n52:33 – The Canon Ambiguity Problem\n54:42 – The Interior Canon Problem\n1:01:45 – The Underdetermination Problem\n1:05:36 – The Uncertainty Problem\n1:10:27 – Making a Leap of Faith\n1:13:22 – Scripture’s Unique Role\n1:17:12 – Apostolic Traditions Exist Today\n1:22:15 – Scripture’s Attitude Is Different\n1:24:17 – Scripture Endorses a Different System\n1:27:04 – How To Discern Apostolic Traditions\n1:31:46 – Divine Guidance in Later Centuries\n1:33:09 – No Paradigm Change\n1:36:48 – Reflecting on the Leap of Faith\n1:41:56 – Returning to Doctrine\n1:45:43 – Closing/Outro\n1:46:39 - End",

    "title": "When Was Jesus Crucified?  | Ask Me Anything",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | January 13, 2025 Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:52 - What exactly is Paul referring to in Galatians 3:1 when he says Christ was “publicly exhibited/portrayed as crucified”? Is it possible Paul knew of the Shroud of Turin? Or maybe he’s referring to very early iconography of the Crucifixion?\n05:30 - In the story of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5, could it be logically deduced that Peter was exercising the ability to retain sins?\n10:28 - TITLE QUESTION: If Jesus was born in 3 or 4 BC, and lived to be 33, would it be more accurate to say the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension took place in AD 29 or 30, as opposed to the commonly cited AD 33?\n16:25 - Since Mary was preserved from original sin, did she experience sickness?\n19:59 - If St. Joseph had children other than Jesus (as some traditions hold) why wouldn’t they be the legal heirs to David’s throne?\n23:36 - What is your take on Revelation 6:10?\n33:16 - How authoritative are the Pontifical Biblical Commission's early decrees on traditional authorship (for example in 1914 the PBC declared Paul wrote Hebrews)? Now the PBC is not part of the magisterium, but at the time of these declarations it was. It seems like almost no Catholic scholar nowadays thinks Paul wrote Hebrews, but I don't understand why the PBC's earlier declarations are no longer authoritative. (Including supporting Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, supporting Matthean priority, etc)\n37:31 - I was talking to a fallen away Catholic. How do you respond when they say Adam had a first wife named Lilith and Eve was his second wife?\n40:20 - I understand if a couple divorces legally they’re still married in the eyes of the church. If one wanted to get remarried, they would have to get an annulment from the church, but suppose that marriage produced children. What does the annulment mean for the children of that marriage as far as the church is concerned?? Or another way of putting it: if my parents got annulment from the church, does the church still recognize me as a baptized Catholic? or do I suddenly become a bastard child (for lack of a better term)??\n45:08 - How should we understand Jesus \"fulfilling the law\", specifically considering the abandonment of many of the laws of the old covenant?\n49:16 - Prior to the fall --- Did \"Adam and Eve\" have Preternatural Gifts if they existed under the Federal Headship Model or the Polygenism Model?  If they did what would have been the morality of Human Beings, with Preternatural Gifts, mating with human like beings without preternatural gifts.",

In the parable of the sower, why isn't everyone made into good soil, is it simply due to free will that even given all the grace in the world some people for whatever reason would still say no? Thank you for your time, Mr. Akin.\n20:05 - With what level of certainty can we say where someone is in the afterlife apart from extraordinary means like canonization. Secondly what are good ways to communicate this appropriate level of certainty to those grieving the loss of someone they love.\n29:05 - I travel quite a bit. Missing mass and days of obligation happen unfortunately. Should I seek a dispensation from my pastor? What should my approach be?\n34:17 - I understand that the \"Law of the Conservation of Mass,\" applies to chemical reactions. However, when considering the bodily assumption of our Blessed Mother, and the ascension of Jesus into heaven, how is the Law of the Conservation of Mass applied? I understand that heaven isn't \"somewhere else,\" but \"somehow else.\" Then how is Mass conserved between our physical realm to the spiritual realm where our Lord and Lady exist?\n40:25 - How does one justify or condemn the use of nuclear weapons? More specifically how do you weigh the deaths of Japanese children against the potential deaths of American soldiers? (From a Catholic perspective)\n48:30 - Would Jesus' family be considered poor compared to the average family in Nazareth? If so, would that have something to do with not being able to find room at the inn in Bethlehem?\n53:03 - I don't know if this counts as normal or weird, but I've started to get into linguistics and I was wondering how we should think of the Tower of Babel story?

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | January 3, 2025 Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:56 - Where in the Old Testament does it say that the Messiah must rise from the dead as John 20:9 says? Why didn't Peter and John understand that?\n05:13 - How would you explain the difference between animal and human intelligence, specifically as it relates to personhood?\n11:13 - TITLE QUESTION: Some laws in the Old Testament seem random, consider a short dedicated to answering “why boiling a kid in its mum’s milk” is a law or “not shaving the hair of your temples” compared to other cults etc\n19:20 - There is the idea of the Church giving mandated holidays/feasts days during medieval time to give peasants more \"time off\" than we get. Lots of arguing online about this.  Your thoughts?\n22:00 - Hello Jimmy I recently had a Protestant hit me with Psalm 115 specifically verses 4-5 where it talks about idols that have mouths and hands and feet but can’t walk or speak. I had no rebuttal, seeking your wisdom of how to respond. Thanks and God Bless\n28:44 - Can you do a video or explain the concepts of poverty, chastity and obedience for the laity? Thank you and God bless you!\n34:46 - How did Paul have the authority to arrest people outside of Judaea (like in Damascus, Syria)? How did the High Priest authorize people to perform arrests outside of Judaea?\n40:53 - Is John the Baptist considered sinless, and are there any other saints that are considered sinless? (aside from Mary who of course is immaculate)\n44:32 - Do we have any insights on the purification process in purgatory? Can our soul split or fracture to remove unclean portions? If it can split, will our souls retain consciousness or, in a sense, will we experience both heaven and hellfire?\n50:15 - Is there really such a thing as the seamless tunic of Jesus?\n53:04 - Can you give some speculation over Christ's coming in the case that man never fell—and Mary's role therein?",

This area is filled with wacky ideas by some Protestants.\n16:21 - If a semi-powerful God is still powerful enough to make the universe out of nothing, what limit to His power might be compatible with that and yet keep Him from being able to prevent evil?\n19:48 - Malachi Martin: Was he a complete fantasist or did some of his claims have grounds?\n23:34 - TITLE QUESTION: Would marital relations with a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle count as beastiality, given the rational nature of the turtles? Would it be morally licit for a Ninja Turtle to be in a romantic relationship with another species, like a human or a mutant salamander?\n28:48 - Jimmy why does it seem like Jesus is against certain laws of Moses (such as stoning) when it was God who directed Moses to implement those laws?\n34:04 - Why is simplicity better than complexity (for God)? Why is infinite regress impossible in the God proofs?\n39:35 - Can you please justify God being so cruel and bloodthirsty in the Old Testament?\n46:12 - Can you please do an episode on the grace of final perseverance ? There is so much there. Why we pray for the hour of death?  Mother Teresa was said to have an exorcism at the end of her life to stop the final demonic attack that happens to us.   I would be very interested to know what you could come up with. Your channel is wonderful.  Thank you and God bless you\n49:08 - Is self-repenting and self-casting out Demons a safe way for Salvation\n52:08 - If absolute zero is the point where there is absolutely no kinetic energy or motion in an object, making it the coldest possible temperature, can God freeze an object below absolute zero?",

    "description": "During Christmas week, we're bringing you another round of weird questions for Jimmy Akin posed by Cy Kellett of Catholic Answers Live, including time travel and inserting yourself into the Bible, Adam and Eve and belly buttons, lost letters of St. Paul, Jimmy's most wanted lost books of history, and more.\n\nhttps://mysterious.fm/344\n\nList of Questions (approximate time codes):\n• 01:56 - Does Time Travel exist?\n• 05:39 - Granting that I time travel back to the past to Jesus’ crucifixion, I take videos of Jesus to prove he exists, and I join Mary and John in approaching him. Is there a possibility that I will be recorded in the Bible? And will the videos and photos that I have taken will be erased if I come back from the past?\n• 09:31 - Did Adam and Eve have belly buttons?\n• 17:37 - Where are all the cryptid sightings coming from, especially in national parks?\n• 28:05 - Archeologists have discovered that there was a small Christian community in the city of Pompeii before the Vesuvius eruption. What if, by some miracle, a scroll somehow survived in the city, with the text of something that claimed to be a “Letter of Paul to the Pompeians”? It follows the format of the universally accepted Pauline epistles, it doesn’t contradict anything Paul wrote previously, and it ultimately seems to be genuinely from Paul. How do you think the Church would respond to the situation?\n• 40:18 - What are the top three (or any other arbitrary number) lost books you would love to have? Tell us about them, and tell us why you would love to have them. I’d like to read the Gospel of the Hebrews, for example, in its entirety (instead of the fragments left behind in writings by the early Church Fathers).\n• 49:14 - Does the Highlander have a soul since he is immortal? Would an immortal being need a soul?\n• 50:46 - Does baptism apply to a person’s entire body? For example, if technology were such that my body died but one cell remained alive and I was regrown immediately from that cell, is my baptism still valid or does the regrown body need to be baptized? Similarly, if a baptized person’s heart (or other organ) is transplanted into another non-baptized person does the organ from the baptized body transmit its baptismal graces to the new body?",

In this video, we delve into the scriptures and historical evidence to examine if the Pope may be the embodiment of evil. From the prophecies of the Book of Revelation to the mysterious title given to the Pope, we uncover the forgotten secrets that may point to who the number 666 was attributed to. Join, Jay Aruga, ‪@unboxingcatholicism‬ and ‪@JimmyAkin‬ as we uncover the truth behind this controversial theory.\n\nThe Jay Aruga Show is the first conservative podcast and vlog in the Philippines.",

    "title": "REAL Paranormal Investigators vs. \"Ghost Hunters\" | Ask Me Anything",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | December 9, 2024 Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:15 - TITLE QUESTION: Hi Jimmy! What does a real Paranormal investigator do and what methods do they use compared to all “ghost hunter” sensationalist types out there? I’ve had a couple of genuine experiences myself and I don’t fall for the bogus methods (spirit boxes. SLS cameras) out there. I’m Catholic (and certainly don’t think “everything is demons”) and I don’t believe nonsense like tarot or go looking for these encounters. Just curious if there’s any real scientific research in this area. Thanks!\n13:45 - In light of recent studies on psychedelics such as psilocybin or DMT being an effective treatment for depression, PTSD, and smoking cessation, how can Catholics understand this and how does it apply to paragraph CCC 2291?\n20:40 - What are your thoughts on Reverse Speech?\n30:30 - What is the Church’s teaching on usury? On economic injustice?\n33:43 - I’m pregnant with my first child. When I receive the Eucharist, does my baby also receive?\n35:27 - What I get from the online discourse is that the only mood for Mass is reverence. I get that this is because of the sacrifice of Christ at the cross. But then, why can’t I feel joy or excitement? Or if I can, when is it appropriate to show it and how? Also, some resources for learning about liturgy would be nice.\n42:45 - If God picks your time of death, wouldn’t this mean he could choose if you go to heaven or hell? Because your will might be at point A towards God and at point B against God?\n48:58 - If a person is prayed for that may already be in heaven, can those prayers help other family members or someone else who might be in need of those prayers?",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | December 9, 2024 Hour 1\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n03:33 - What are your thoughts on determinism and free will, can they be combined?\n07:20 – How does God know he’s not a brain in a vat?\n08:14 - My 5-year-old asked “Did Jesus’ death on the cross make God the Father sad?”\n12:44 - Where does the idea of “the rapture” come from? I’ve heard that it isn’t actually biblical, but pop culture and many Protestants would claim otherwise.\n19:30 - I am a later in life convert, and I did not baptize my two now young adult children as infants. Is it possible to conditionally baptize them due to their other parent preventing their baptisms? The situation they are in is not typical I gave birth to them within a same sex marriage prior to conversion and then I was radically converted. The same sex marriage ended 10 years ago I am now married to a man in the Catholic Church. Neither of the children desire to attend Catechism classes, and my son is 17 and my daughter is 20. I pray a Novena daily for Baptism for them to occur. It’s the Saint Therese of Lisieux Novena asking for her prayers for my children. Thank you Jimmy and God bless you.\n21:47 - TITLE QUESTION: Hello Jimmy, I am a Catholic from Africa how can I help people around me who refuse to be Christian or Catholic saying it is because it is an invention to keep Africa poor calling it « the white man’s religion »\n28:40 - Hi Jimmy, someone had asked if there would be bacteria in Heaven and you said it’s possible if God allows us to eat and Heaven is like a big banquet with the saints. So if we eat in Heaven does that mean there’s death in Heaven since things would have to die for us to eat it?\n36:44 - What would the Church do to celebrate the Eucharist in the event of a blight that killed all wheat on the planet?\n42:41 - How should Christians understand these words of Jesus: “For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished! Therefore, whoever nullifies one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” Doesn’t this mean the Law of Moses still applies to Christians?\n46:30 - In a previous AMA, you said in response to someone’s question that if a person were assimilated by the Borg, the state of their soul adjacent to confession would remain unchanged. If someone were assimilated, could they conceivably receive anointing of the sick?\n47:55 - To what extent can a priest alter the words of the Mass? For example, a priest at a chapel I go to says “This is Jesus, the Lamb of God” instead of “Behold the Lamb of God”, which I think is quite beautiful, but I am unsure if it’s correct.\n49:17 - Doesn’t the act of naming someone a pope fit the definition of a sacrament? It’s 1-a rite 2-Instituted by Jesus (Matthew 16) 3-to convey grace (infallibility)\n52:59 - Are orthodox bishops and old catholic bishops and sedevacantist bishops real bishops?",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | December 6, 2024 Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:50 - Mr. Akin ….I had my future told to me after I had a staring contest with a guy who had the ability to view my future life like watching a video in fast forward….pausing when he saw things he thought important….this is how he explained it to me…He was able to see all the way to my last day….something he said he hadn’t been able to do with others…. not only could he see my life through my eyes …but could also see what was going on all around me….. I met him at work …. Mr. Akin have you ever heard of this type of ability before…..can you help me understand what happened and why please….\n12:47 - What if the priest doing Mass is really old and suddenly dies during the service? How’s that handled?\n15:50 - Which Church Sui Iuris would extraterrestrial join if they accepted the Faith?\n16:56 - TITLE QUESTION: Has Protestant exorcism ever been validated??? Is Protestant exorcism only the goofy stuff like Bob Larsen and Benny Hinn yelling and throwing invisible spiritual inner chi fireballs at their subjects? Or does it have any credulity like the most severe case I’ve seen with the Warren family helping MAURICE “Frenchy” THERIAULT on camera footage?\n21:58 - Did Jesus have a body before he was born as a man?\n24:54 - How does Odo not turn into a pile of goo when he uses a transporter?\n32:52 - Most people get half of their DNA from their mother and half from their father. I assume Jesus got at least half of his DNA from Mary, but what about the other half? Was he 100% Mary? Did God just “invent” 50%? Do you think God made him resemble St. Joseph?\n35:24 - Could someone be a Catholic atheist?\n39:36 - If we discovered the Creature from the Black Lagoon, would it be permissible to eat it on Lent?\n45:07 - If a ship of volunteers is collected to go to Mars, should the Church insist on sending a Bishop?\n50:05 - I work with a non-Christian lady who used to be a Hindu and claims to believe in the Christian God. She was not a very nice person from what I saw how she treated other people. One day, she told me a story that when she went to a Church to pray because she was having a problem at that time, she saw blood on her palm. The light in the Catholic church was dim so she looked at the palm intensely and didn’t know what it was. After few seconds the blood disappeared. She got spooked and thought that was a spooky Church so she went to the Anglican Church nearby. Before she told me the story, I was listening to the life of St Padre Pio who had stigmata. My question is does stigmata happen to anybody?",

    "title": "Can You Baptize People Made of Anti-Matter? | Weird Questions",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | December 6, 2024 Hour 1\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n02:22 - I heard this as an argument against the body and soul being distinct and advocating strict materialism, i.e. it’s all in the brain: If we consider that memories, emotions, reasoning, consciousness, personality, etc. are distinct from the body in the senses of sight, sound, smell, touch, taste then what accounts for the changes that occur when drinking alcohol or taking drugs for a temporary effect, or the habitual use of psychedelic drugs which cause a permanent effect? A spiritual soul should be unaffected by the chemical changes in the brain, but since behavior is changed passively from ingestion in this and not by an active decision, doesn’t that prove materialism and disprove a spiritual soul?\n13:26 - I have asked multiple priest and exorcists about “perfect possession “and have yet to have anyone give me an answer. I have read about this characterization of complete possession of a person by Fr. Malachi, Martin, as well as a few other exorcists, but no thorough definition or had any current exorcist or priest confirm that perfect possession is true and possible. Could you please expand on this? It seems in these crazy times perfect possession would explain a lot of what we see in the church at large and the world. Example, people openly and flagrantly in the state of mortal sin able to go to mass, receive the sacraments, come into contact with holy objects, receive communion etc., without any adverse reaction or manifestations towards these holy things. I am hopeful and humbly asking that you will answer with clarity about perfect possession\n22:25 - TITLE QUESTION: If aliens made of anti-matter showed up and wanted to become Catholic, how would we accomplish this when the sacraments like baptism, ordination, and the Eucharist involve contact with matter?\n31:30 - Which, if any, pagan gods are real?\n34:46 - Did Neanderthals have immortal souls?\n44:02 - Why does time seem to go by faster as we get older?\n47:26 - How tiny can the Blessed Sacrament be? Many years ago I once asked a priest to clean the paten better because I noticed some particles of the consecrated bread remained on it. He answered that my problem was that I believe that Jesus is present on each of those tiny crumbs. I was very indignant. I like a verse in a Corpus Christi hymn that mentions that Jesus is really present on each of the small pieces of the consecrated bread broken. Now, recently I was reflecting on that indignant moment, saying to myself well, Jesus is present as tiny as a molecule, atoms, fundamental particles or strings, if they exists… until I said wait a minute… at some point on those levels one cannot distinguish bread. There is even a theory that says that all the electrons of the universe are the same thing. So I think the limit is not scientific but philosophical: Jesus is present up to the point when one can still perceive the attributes of bread. But then… maybe that priest was not that wrong at all… Mr. Akin, is Jesus present in the crumbs and if so to which level of smallness?",

Some people—including Calvinists—say that God arbitrarily predestines certain people to eternal salvation and other people to eternal damnation. \n\nBut the same people often go further than that. They claim that God arbitrarily predestines absolutely everything that happens!\n\nIs that true? And can you prove it from the Bible?\n\nIn this episode, Jimmy looks at the most common arguments for the idea—including the most popularly cited Bible verses for it. Together, you’ll see why these don’t prove what a Calvinist needs them to prove.",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | November 1, 2024 Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n0:00 - Introduction\n02:58 - TITLE QUESTION: Do you think God speaks to you?\n07:22 - I’m actively reading and studying my Bible and one of my top concerns is if the Jewish people were given adequate chance to believe that Jesus was God and that his teachings were true? Obviously the Jewish people have continued on and is that not what God wanted? Any discussion on the topic would be appreciated, thank you to Jimmy and his team!\n15:13 - In the Old Testament, people brought animal sacrifices to the priest to atone for their sins, with the size of the sacrifice corresponding to the severity of the sin (If I remember rightly). This is mirrored in the early Church, as confession was a public act, where individuals admitted their sins before the entire congregation. However, this practice evolved into the private, one-on-one confessions we know today, largely due to the influence of Irish monks, who introduced this method in the early medieval period. Some have argued that because the form of confession has changed over time, the Seal of Confession could also be altered. How can I explain this development to non-Catholics (and some Catholics too)? Thank you Jimmy, may God continue to Bless and Guide you all!\n20:18 - Would it be permissible for a Catholic to interpret Genesis as a poetic narrative describing God’s creation of man and culling of the most evil men in our distant past by 1) reading Adam and Eve being earlier hominids when our ancestors became able to reason instead of being driven by instinct and in turn after sinning against God by eating from a possibly metaphorical tree of knowledge, our brain capacity started to expand causing more difficult births? And 2) reading the flood as being a story about God destroying more sinful versions of our ancestors, causing a population bottleneck as far back as 900,000 years ago? I'm converting to Catholicism from a secular background, reading the Old Testament as divinely inspired truths seen and expressed through a lens of the contemporary culture when each part of the OT was written removes all the stumbling blocks to finding my faith, but I don’t know if my interpretation stretches what is written too far.\n34:56 - How is a narcissist saved if he’s in complete denial about being a narcissist?\n37:10 - Is there a philosophical possibility that God exists without omnipotence?\nI heard an argument from a liberal Christian, Dr. Goff, which posits that a semi-powerful God would solve many theological quandaries, such as the problem of evil.\n42:08 - What do you think of religious orders?\n45:20 - Is it a correct understanding of the Catholic Faith to say that when Jesus suffered and died that only his human nature suffered and died and not the divine person?’\n48:06 - How to find the truth in the world of excess information?\n49:55 - I would love to know a breakdown of the evidence for and against global warming and in particular the degree to which human activity plays a role in this. I ask this of Jimmy because he may be one of the only people I would trust to give an unbiased assessment.",

Will our resurrected bodies have abilities like levitation, telekinesis, etc.?\n17:12 - What if the pope breaks the seal of confession? Is he excommunicated? Who would he be excommunicated from?\n21:00 - Is the war in Israel/Hamas prophesied in the Bible?\n24:06 - I’d like to know the church’s view on the union dock worker strike? Is it ok to stop working in this situation/what roles does the union play in society?\n32:22 - After the bodily resurrection, do we live in Heaven, the new Earth, or some combination of the two?\n33:14 - Why were there guards stationed at the tomb of Jesus if Jews only believed in Resurrection at the end of the world? Doesn’t this imply that the Jewish authorities at least thought Jesus’s followers believed Jesus could rise from the dead? Do you think His disciples believed he would rise after 3 days?\n37:35 - Do you think that Jesus received any grace when he ate the Eucharist? I know He is the source of grace, but He was strengthened by an angel in the Agony in the garden. Curious to hear your thoughts on what is happening in both of these instances, on a metaphysical or ontological level.\n42:40 - Are there instructions or limits to cursing? My intuition is that it is bad… but Jesus did curse a fig tree and said woe to whom betrayed Him. Was it OK because He’s God? Furthermore, would it be bad to curse a war and what would be the effect?\n51:09 - TITLE QUESTION: When death occurs suddenly and the incident is faster than the brain can comprehend (as in the case of a submarine implosion) does God give a grace of awareness to the victim, or is it possible for the soul to be confused at the judgment seat of Christ?",

    "description": "In this episode, Jimmy looks at Arminianism—the major rival to Calvinism when it comes to topics like grace, predestination, and free will in Protestant circles. There are actually more Arminians than there are Calvinists, but they aren’t as noisy. They object to Calvinism’s doctrines of Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, and Perseverance of the Saints. So what do they believe instead? And does their theology agree with Catholic teaching? Listen to this episode and find out!",

    "title": "What's Jimmy's Day Like? | Ask Me Anything",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | September 27, 2024 Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED:\n0:00 - Introduction\n01:42 - TITLE QUESTION: What does a day-in-the-life of Jimmy Akin look like? I know so many of us are in awe of your depth and breadth of knowledge. It would be interesting to see how you structure your day with learning etc.\n06:40 - I have a few questions that I have had on my mind for some time now. It is said that Latin is especially efficacious for prayer and exorcisms because it is the official language of the church. My question is this, for an Eastern Rite Catholic, who would be under the authority of their church’s head (although the Pope’s authority is, of course, universal and preeminent) and have their own Codes of Canon Law, would the native language of that church be more efficacious or similar in efficacy to prayers in Latin? Or would this only apply to the ancient languages? E.g. Latin, Greek, Aramaic, Coptic, Hebrew, and possibly Church Slavonic and Arabic.\n14:22 - What’s your thoughts about whether animals and our pets can be in heaven with us or not?\n18:55 - Does the church condone organ donation?\n20:28 - Also should we vote for a candidate who is for abortion, when there is no one who is pro-life. Should we vote for the lesser of two evils?\n21:51 - I have full confidence that you are knowledgeable about the “identity” issue. What would you offer in scripture and the catechism to someone who identified as a furry?\n28:38 - Given the tragic shortage of priests, what would you recommend to someone seeking a spiritual director who is having a hard time finding one?\n32:08 - I’d like your advice on what to tell my 9-year-old about Blessed Imelda Lambertini (the young girl who reportedly died of joy upon receiving the Eucharist). After hearing about Blessed Imelda my 9-year-old is scared that the Eucharist will kill her too. And for my own curiosity, do you know if this is a documented account or more of a pious legend? Thanks!\n37:39 - The strongest challenge I ever heard from a Protestant about the Assumption is, “How can the Catholic Church dogmatically declare that the Assumption was ‘believed at all times by the Church’, when there is literally no evidence anywhere in the Bible, Church Father writings or, apocryphal writings of the first Century?”\n43:05 - What separates the “New Atheists” from the old Atheists?\n45:26 - If there are many other planets with life, then how would they be saved? Did Christ death and resurrection count for them also and if so, how would they know. Or did God save each planet with aliens differently?\n48:14 - What are some of the best ways to practice becoming as humble as possible, like Our Lady?\n50:13 - Is it possible for your guardian angel to not like you or something about you? For example, maybe your guardian angel doesn’t like the same kind of music you listen to. I wonder if a guardian angel ever feels like they preferred getting someone else to guide.\n52:38 - Who would win in a fight, the Incredible Hulk or felony tax evasion? Asking for a friend ️\n53:43 - Why was it necessary for the Church to make the Immaculate Conception and Assumption into dogmas (vs leaving them as non-mandatory for belief teachings)?",

    "title": "Why Would God Create Someone to Go to Hell? | Jimmy Akin Podcast",
    "description": "This week, Jimmy takes on a tough subject! The question of why God would create someone he knows is going to hell is a common one, with various attempts to address it online. Most responses tend to either talk around the issue or simply dismiss it as a mystery. While we may not have definitive answers due to the infinite nature of God's mind, we can still offer informed proposals rather than just claiming ignorance. \n\nWhen focusing on the specific scenario of God creating Bob, who will freely choose to go to hell, we can consider different possibilities to explain this decision. One possibility is that there is a competing good that justifies God tolerating Bob's choice. This could include factors like preserving free will for the sake of authentic love, showcasing God's glory, or achieving some other unknown good. \n\nAlternatively, it's also possible that God's decision is just, respecting Bob's free will choice while ensuring fairness. However, this alone may not fully resolve the issue of why God would still create Bob despite knowing his eventual fate. \n\nAnother perspective suggests that God's act of creating Bob, even with the knowledge of his damnation, might actually benefit Bob in some way. This could involve the belief that existence, even in hell, is preferable to non-existence. Ultimately, the plausibility of this explanation depends on personal views of hell and existence. \n\nFurthermore, some theologians have proposed the idea that God might not create individuals who would reject salvation, potentially leading to an empty hell. This notion has been explored throughout history, with differing interpretations of biblical passages on this topic. \n\nConsidering the initial assumption that God knows Bob's choice before creating him, theologians have distinguished between God's knowledge of all possible and actual things. This distinction challenges the idea of God knowing the outcome of a free will decision that is never made, potentially questioning the concept of middle knowledge. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mystery surrounding God's decisions remains, there are multiple perspectives and interpretations that attempt to shed light on the issue. Whether through competing goods, considerations of justice, potential benefits to the individual, or reevaluation of theological assumptions, the question of creating someone destined for hell reveals the complexity of divine decision-making.",

    "description": "In this episode, Jimmy explores the the \"Golden Chain\" of salvation. Based on this concept, Calvinists claim that if one enters a state of grace, one will never leave it. Calvinists often appeal to a passage in Romans 8 as laying out the steps in salvation, which they believe refers to God unconditionally choosing certain people to be saved, predestining them to salvation on the last day, and their final glorification. However, Jimmy shows that there are serious problems with the Calvinist interpretation of this passage and that it does not prove what the Calvinist wants it to prove.",

The only questions are whether they paid attention and whether they remember.\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00 – Coming Up\n00:58 – Intro\n01:31 – Frank Turek’s Cross Examined\n02:31 – Never Hearing About Grace?\n04:19 – Poor Homilies\n05:00 – The Church Steps In\n06:36 – Interpreting Our Past Experiences\n08:17 – What You Hear and Say at Mass\n09:21 – Mass Begins\n13:33 – The Creed\n16:20 – The Lord’s Prayer\n18:02 – Before Communion\n18:51 – Language Differences\n20:29 – The Church’s Concern for You\n22:40 – Closing/Outro",

    "description": "The Jimmy Akin Podcast | Episode 002 | September 23, 2024\n\nHere Jimmy Akin explores how God’s foreknowledge works. Many people believe that if God knows our future actions, then we lack free will, but this is a misconception. Classical theism asserts that God is omniscient and knows everything, including the future. However, the Bible's references to foreknowledge are limited and can also mean intellectually knowing something in advance or making choices ahead of time. Some theologians suggest that foreknowledge may refer to God's love for those he foreknows. The concept of foreknowledge is closely linked to the idea of God being outside of time and knowing all moments in history simultaneously. While humans interpret God's foreknowledge as knowing the future in advance, from God's perspective, all times are equally real, leading some theologians to assert that it's merely knowledge to God and not foreknowledge. This understanding of foreknowledge has significant implications for the discussion of free will, as God's knowledge of our future actions does not negate our ability to freely make choices. Overall, the concept of God's foreknowledge does not undermine the existence of free will.\n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00 – Coming Up\n00:14 – Intro\n01:36 –  Foreknowledge in the Bible.\n03:16 – Foreknowledge = Love?\n04:31 – Foreknowledge as Knowledge and Choice\n06:49 – Time and Eternity\n08:40 – Anthropomorphic Language\n 11:17 – God and Foreknowledge\n13:44 – God’s Foreknowledge = His Knowledge\n15:14 – Foreknowledge and Free Will\n17:21 – Closing/Outro",

    "title": "What Does God REALLY Want?",
    "description": "In the inaugural episode of the Jimmy Akin podcast, Jimmy delves into the fundamental Christian principle of love, as emphasized in the Bible. \n\nHe explains that love is the highest priority for God, citing scriptural references that describe God as love and that highlight the importance of loving God and one's neighbor. Akin discusses the two greatest commandments—loving God with all one's heart, soul, mind, and strength, and loving one's neighbor as oneself. He elaborates on the unconditional and conditional aspects of love, emphasizing that while we must always be willing to forgive, actual forgiveness is contingent on repentance. \n\nAkin also addresses common misconceptions about the commandment to love God and the purpose of prayer, clarifying that these practices are meant to foster love for God and others. \n\nUltimately, he concludes that love is essential for salvation and living a life aligned with God's will.\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00 – Intro\n01:09 – Ch 1. What God Really Wants?\n03:16 – Ch 2. Love and the Ten Commandments\n04:27 – Ch 3. Who Is My Neighbor?\n09:05 – Ch 4. What Does It Mean to Love Someone?\n11:03 – Ch 5.

    "title": "Neanderthals in Genesis? (Weird Questions) - Jimmy Akin's Mysterious World",
    "description": "It's a fifth Friday, so Cy Kellett of Catholic Answers Live is asking Jimmy Akin weird questions from listeners, about topics like mechanical telepathy; Neanderthals in Genesis; aliens in the afterlife; convert popes; and more weird questions.\n\nhttps://mysterious.fm/327\n\nThe Questions (time codes are approx.):\n• 04:55 - Imagine a technology developed that gives two people the ability to share feelings, emotions, physical sensations, etc., with each other as if they were truly experiencing the other person in the exact state that they are in at that moment in time. I’m thinking of a situation where John is trying to explain how he feels about something important, but he just can’t put it into words for Jane to understand. To solve the problem, they both connect their minds with the technology and for a brief moment, Jane knows exactly the how’s and why’s of John’s emotions, even his physical sensations or pain or pleasure. She is now able to understand him on a level that is too complex for words, resulting in greater intimacy and love between them. If we apply this to Church teaching on marriage, would a husband and wife be obligated to participate in this activity as a means of total giving of oneself to the other? If not, could you think of some variation of this technology or scenario that the Church would promote or even require? For the purpose of this thought experiment, assume that you wouldn’t be able to abuse this technology or generally use it in a negative way.\n• 14:55 - Is there competition in heaven? It seems to be part of human nature.\n• 18:14 - Assuming that there is life on other planets and that they have been given the same immortal souls as we have, and assuming that they are susceptible to death as we are, does that mean that Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory are currently comprised of human souls and the souls of what we would consider aliens, too?\n• 22:08 - Has a convert ever been Pope?\n• 23:49 - Are the proposed alien sightings aliens or angels and/or demons?\n• 32:30 - My understanding is that the soul is the life principle. When stem cells are removed from a body and cultured, do they receive a new sensitive soul but not rational soul?\n• 38:56 - Some writers through history have depicted multiple “levels” of hell and heaven (e.g. Dante). Is there any biblical support for distinct experiences of heaven and hell?\n• 48:06 - Could the other people mentioned in Genesis be the Neanderthals? (See Genesis 4 and the reference to the people who might kill Cain)\n• 52:03 - What happens to your soul if you get assimilated by the Borg?",

    "title": "How Did the Bible Get Chapters and Verses? | Internet Ask Me Anything",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live August 15, 2024 | Hour 2\n\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n02:05 - TITLE QUESTION: How did the numbering of the chapters and verses in the Bible come about? \n04:54 - If you could meet any three Egyptian pharaohs for dinner - and they wouldn’t try to kill each other, guaranteed - who would you choose and why? \n14:42 - Father Spitizer believes that God first created a group of proto human beings starting with 2 non-ensouled pre-hominids, (1 man and 1 woman). These were Y-chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve. And God created them 200,000 years ago. These 2 spawned many humans and from those humans came several different subspecies of man wikipedia lists 19, though some of these are disputed, and if I recall there may be more. Then around 70,000 years ago God created our ensouled ancestors Adam and Eve. And their descendants began migrating all over the world. All homosapiens today descend from these 2, and all other non ensouled homosapiens or human subspecies eventually died out. \n34:49 - In the early church, when a bishop was elevated to a diocese, it was understood that he was to hold the position for life, and bishops, transferring diocese was explicitly forbidden by the canons. But by the time we get to the early modern period, we see Bishops routinely leave being moved around, getting only more common into the 20th century. When exactly did this practice change and why? \n36:55 - I have heard that some people believe Melchizedek and Shem (son of Noah) are the same person. Please explain why some think so and share your opinion on the matter. \n39:58 - If the church doesn't recognize a secular marriage as valid, why does one need an annulment if they're divorced, and looking to remarry? \n43:10 - If usury is a sin, how can we move to lessen or eliminate it from our (United States) society? \n46:39 - Your takeaways from the book of Job? \n48:01 - I just saw a clip from 7 years ago where you compared Jesus’ sacrifice to that of a soldier who jumps on a grenade to protect his fellow soldiers. Thus a similar but heavily contrived scenario would be a man who threatens to kill your family unless you end your own life. If he is an immediate threat, could it be acceptable to comply with his demand? \n50:45 - 1. Does Lazarus being raised from the dead provide a counter-example to the idea that our souls become immutable after death? From what I understand, souls that are in Heaven and Hell are set there for eternity and cannot decide to ‘change their mind,’ because of both their judgement being final and their soul being ‘locked’ in whatever they chose their ultimate good to be after being separated from the body. So what exactly was the state of Lazarus’ soul after being brought back to life? Assuming he went to the place that is called Abraham’s Bosom or the Limbo of the Fathers, he was already prepared for Heaven. In fact Lazarus is now a Saint. So does that mean he remained completely sinless throughout the remainder of his life? Or was he still able to fall into sin and never repent and instead be judged into Hell? \n53:25 - This is a hypothetical scenario. Let’s say that Lazarus was married. Now if the marriage bond ends at the death of one of the spouses, what does that mean when Lazarus comes back to life? What would be the state of their relationship then? Would he and the woman who was his wife have to go through the whole process of marrying again if they wanted to continue in their relationship? If so, would that mean it is technically possible to marry the same person twice? Also, if Lazarus and his “wife” didn’t know about marriage ending at death, would they be committing adultery were they to engage in relations?",

    "title": "Death Before the Fall of Man? | Internet Ask Me Anything",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live, August 15, 2024 | Hour 1\n\nQUESTIONS COVERED:\n00:00 - Introduction\n04:00 - Is King Solomon in Heaven, after committing so much adultery and idol worship? If not (I know we don't know for sure), then how can his writings be in our bible? \n06:34 - Is it proper/correct to suppose that any significant suffering a person experiences, when offered up to God in prayer, might be rewarded by His grace when a person passes away, in consideration of their salvation? Is there an article you wrote (or something you read and liked) about that? \n10:51 - What does the Catholic Church say about the salvation of those who, either because they were born too early or because they live in a completely remote part of the world, were unable to hear the Gospel? I find it difficult to believe that a good Buddhist man living in 300BC India would be immediately damned just because he happened to be born too early and in the wrong part of the world. Also, what does the Church say about the noble pagans and teachers who lived before Christ, such as Buddha, Confucius, and Aristotle? Does the Church believe they are divinely inspired, that they are treacherous and demonically influenced, or something in between? \n17:35 - I recently saw a quote showing Archbishop Viagno saying good things about the Pope but I don’t understand what did he do that irked the Vatican to the point of excommunicating him after finding him guilty of a schism charge did he let his attachment to the Latin Mass and his displeasure at the Pope’s 2021 document on that get the better of him or is it possible his situation is being blown out of proportion? \n20:53 - Is Revelation 12 a good prooftext? \n24:11 - What will happen to the relics when comes the Resurrection? How they hold up today? \n29:00 - What was going on at this particular point in time in history, if anything, that led the Pope to dogmatically define the Assumption? \n30:32 - What do you think is the most likely form of space exploration and colonization for humans? Would we build domes on Mars? Terraform Venus? Build large space colonies? What makes the most sense\n to you? \n35:09 - TITLE QUESTION: My 15-year-old son Luke has one! \"My question was, before humanity committed its first sin, according to the theory of evolution which I am assuming is true, because we have seen it happen, if everything was in “perfect harmony” however we define it, then why did animals have to suffer, consuming one another for sustenance? If that’s how things were meant to be, suffering would be included in the world long before original sin even took place, and pre-historic apes before Adam and Eve would have to have suffered from this also. If suffering is from the devil, then why did it exist before original sin? The devil is a spiritual being that was probably created before the earth, so does that mean suffering is entrenched due to existence itself? That it is a logical consequence of existing?\" \n43:37 - Why is it called \"assumption\" when we are taught that the last thing we should do is assume? \n45:57 - Why don’t you use my questions? \n49:13 - I take the doctrine of the Assumption on Faith but find it difficult to understand \n50:52 - Where then is Mary’s body physically - I trust and have faith in the Assumption but where her body physically is puzzles me. \n51:41 - Why is Mary generally depicted with blue garments?",

I am conflicted by the different messages that seem contradictory. \n00:28:54 - Christ said he had to go to the Father or the Holy Spirit would not come. Did Divine Procession effectively change due to the hypostatic union? \n00:34:55 - Will we eat food in Heaven? Jesus in His resurrected and glorified body asked the apostles if they had something to eat. \n00:40:25 - Can one who obeys the Natural Law be saved even if he doesn't explicitly affirm Christ and his Church? \n00:44:07 - We have consecrated virgins. My understanding is in the Latin rite we don't have consecrated widows. Is it just the Latin rite, or all Catholic Rites? \n00:45:27 - Was it a condition of the rich young man's salvation to sell all he had and follow Christ? Was it an invitation he could morally decline? What about Mary when she was asked to be the mother of Jesus? \n00:51:01 - Why is Boethius not viewed as a Saint and Martyr? \n00:53:10 - “1 Peter 3:21 says that baptism is ‘an appeal to God for a clear conscience.’ Therefore, babies cannot get baptized because they cannot make appeals.”",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live June 27, 2024 | Hour 2\n\nThe animal in the thumbnail is a Maned Wolf. It is a canine native to South America and is a possible candidate for tall, bush-tailed, red hyena-like creature that was reported on Skinwalker Ranch in Utah. See Episode 36 of Jimmy Akin's Mysterious World for more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdUg6e7YPc0\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:27 - What is the history of the use of the tetragrammaton/divine name in worship, particularly as it relates to Jehovah's Witnesses? \n07:44 - I heard your show where you mentioned a study in India on near death experiences where the people in India would see some spirits that were either good or evil spirits. Christians see angels, good or bad. So non-believers could argue that the fact that people don't see the same thing is proof that these visions are due only to chemical reactions of a dying brain. How would you respond? \n13:52 - What would be the best way for us as Catholics to answer some Protestants who claim what’s happening in Israel right now has to do with the 2nd coming of Jesus that in there minds is gonna happen soon or at any moment? \n17:49 - Which allegedly evidential NDE do you think is the strongest? \n23:57 - If the Pope has the keys to heaven and hell, could the Pope/Church canonize someone that God would not have allowed into heaven by ordinary means, but since the church/pope utilized the authority of those keys they now get in? what about the reverse a just person going to hell because the church invoked the keys of authority to condemn them? \n28:25 - From what I understand, the Jesuits are not allowed to hold positions of Authority or power. Is this true? And if so, did it change to permit Pope Francis to be Pope? \n29:55 - Maybe better for a weird questions episode but I recently had several blessed, holy objects go missing around the house and it occurred to me, if it WAS demons, is there   \n34:53 - From my 15 year old : Is God alive both scientifically as well as theologically? \n39:30 - TITLE QUESTION. In the Skinwalker Ranch episode of Mysterious World there were three wolf- like activities and one of them was a wolf-like creature running around in the horse pen. Do you think the beast could have been a skin walker? \n43:51 - I remember a very helpful episode where you discussed the career of Dr. Steven Greer. I have been very curious about what you know about the legitimacy of the UAP claims by Bob Lazar and David Grusch? \n48:56 - How can we better understand the word “Belief” with regards to God and our faith, and do Catholics and Protestants (specifically Lutherans, understand this idea of belief in God differently)?",

How will we interact, then, with our loved ones who we hope are in heaven and we long to see again? What does that even look like? I believe the Church does not have definitive teaching on this, but what has been the speculation? \n00:17:46 - TITLE QUESTION. Do you think there were sasquatches on the Ark? \n00:19:56 - We say the Trinity is three Persons. I have been told, on inquiry, that these are not three \"selves\" as we would normally understand \"persons\", but I'm also told that the Holy Spirit is the \"love\" between the Father and the Son, and that the Holy Trinity is a \"community\". But only distinct selves can love each other or be in community; both of these, it seems to me, cannot be true. Can you elaborate? \n00:23:54 - Is there any equivalent to Eucharistic Adoration for the Precious Blood? If so, why? If not, why not? \n00:28:43 - What is the difference between feasting and gluttony? \n00:31:49 - Someone w/ surname of Murray said the name meant they are descended from Mary, after she moved to France.\n00:33:49 - Make or dismiss the case that after the Resurrection, Jesus appeared to Mother Mary first and in private. \n00:34:40 - What’s a good book that talks about how the apostles died rather than denying the Resurrection? \n00:40:10 - What's all this about the red heifers being prepared for slaughter in Israel as fulfillment of a prophecy? \n00:46:24 - Please give your feedback on this statement: “Receiving on the tongue is the default option.” \n00:46:56 - What really is sleep? \n00:50:35 - What does the Church state about forcing men to take psychological exams before being accepted to seminary?",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live, June 14, 2024 | Hour 2\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n03:44 - In the Transformers, there are a team of Constructicons where 5 robots can combine to make one giant robot. According to the official character bio, the giant robot, Devastator, has a unique consciousness that is also a composite of all 5 unique, individual robot personalities. Do you think this is a good illustration of how God works, albeit being a Quintessence as opposed to a Trinity? \n08:40 - Chiropractic. Religion? New Age woo? Scam? \n13:15 - Most Christians I know would say “light as a feather, stiff as a board” is demons. Because, you know… If it’s not demons, is there a natural explanation for why it works? \n16:50 - What do you think the likelihood is that we will meet beings from other realities that God created when we get to heaven? Or should we expect that this is the only reality, and the sole occupants of heaven will be from this space-time continuum? \n18:23 - TITLE QUESTION: Why did Jesus ascend into the sky and what happened to His body? Did it disappear or do he go to other planets or outer space? \n21:14 - Was it not a good idea for Johnny to take the bet with the devil in the song “Devil went down to Georgia”, given that the Church strongly encourages not conversing with the devil or demons, even though he won the bet? \n24:03 - If humans evolved from different humanoid species in the past, at what point did we gain a soul? \n29:07 - Why did Peter put on his clothes before jumping in the water? \n31:05 - In Tobit, Archangel Raphael states that it only seemed to Tobias that he was eating, but really did not. So did Raphael atomize the food he touched when having meals with Tobias or is there another explanation? \nHow would someone be able to explain that Jesus really ate with his Apostles when Archangel Raphael only made it seem like it? \n36:35 - I wonder is it a sin to be psychic?

    "title": "What Is Baphomet? | Weird Questions",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live June 14, 2024 | Hour 1\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n02:30 - I mean no disrespect with this question…. I noticed a few weeks ago that Jimmy was leaving the “g” off of words like “teachin” or “reasonin” and others. I can only assume that this is the normal dialect in Arkansas? Question. Is this change due to a conscious effort to return to his “roots” or is this an outcome of being immersed back into the Arkansas dialect through local conversations? Love Mysterious World and Cy’s awkward Dad joke sense of humor.\n08:17 - In the very first Weird Questions I listened to, Jimmy answered a question asking if a man was teleported back in time to 5 BC, what obligations he would have to do in order to worship God properly. Now, let me ask the reverse of that. Suppose a man from 500BC was in stasis for thousands of years and wakes up when a group of archaeologists discover him. I imagine the option to be baptized and confirmed would be just as open to him as to any other man (provided he knows what the sacraments and the Gospel mean), but if the man were to die after his waking up in the 21st century without having done these things, what would be the state of his soul?\n11:31 - We have a ghost where I work….and I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen and heard it with my own eyes. A coworker recently got a spirit box and it has picked up some interesting things but I wasn’t there when they were using it. Do those things (spirit boxes} have any legitimacy to them?\n16:40 - Just wondering if you can address something that kept coming to my mind while listening to Mysterious World (AA 1025) If so thanks. My question is not directly related but it made me think about Bella Dodd and her impact related to infiltration in the church along with her conversation. I just want to hear your thoughts on this. On a side note I really enjoy your work but I particularly enjoy Mysterious World!!!\n19:31 - Are there any conditions that must be met for the devil to possess someone? In Other words, are there any characteristics of a person that would need to be present in order for that person to be possessed by a demon?\n28:57 - Did Jesus ever get bitten by mosquitos, ticks! Lice or other blood-feeding pests? And if so what would the implications be of these creatures potentially being the first among creation to receive the precious blood of Christ? I tend to think about this when hiking in deep quiet woods and swarmed by a fog of billions of mosquitos with nothing apparently to eat but me. Perhaps they cannot starve to death and are in a sense immortal?\n33:25 - So I read a book about a guy that whenever he dies he is reborn but with all the memories of his previous lives.\nMy question is that if he became a priest in one of his lives would that end at his death, or would he technically still be a priest in every life after that?\n35:16 - Who invented smoking? More importantly, how did people discover that inhaling burning fumes from various herbs feels good?\n39:27 - Can the belief in djinn be incorporated into the Catholic worldview? And if so, how would this affect the categories of alien and demon by adding a third possible explanation of unexplained phenomenon?\n44:35 - TITLE QUESTION: What is Baphomet?\n48:45 - My son, Jonathan would like like a deep dive on Angelic swords (Genesis 3:24) Did the angels forge them? Are they still around? Did God invent swords?\n51:42 - Would it be a stretch or not from a Catholic perspective to say that both Multiple Personality Disorder and Rabies are different ways in which demonic activity can manifest? I.e. The Personalities of those with MPD actually being demons in disguise waiting for the right moment to strike or rabies being a disease that could evolve into a form of demonic possession that can manifest in various animals",

An actual angel?\n20:24 - Do you think the Jewish faith was reinterpreted after Jesus’s death and resurrection \n25:10 - Why is the word Holy Ghost said instead of Holy Spirit?\n28:25 - Why are there so many people who say that the Catholic Church is evil? The red shoes are evil. The room that looks like a serpent, at the Vatican. And other claims…?\n32:43 - I was recently challenged on the papal bulls allowing conquest and enslavement, followed by the bull Sublimis Deus forbidding enslavement, which I take as an abrogation of the prior. The interlocutor asked 1) how can one infallible bull overrule another one; and 2) how was anyone supposed to know when Sublimus Deus doesn’t mention the prior bulls or say they were abrogated? What do you say?\n35:24 - Can you explain how the Godhead and the Trinity are not conflicting ideas or doctrines. I get SO MANY people who challenge the Trinity and say that Catholics try to replace the Godhead with the “false doctrine” of the Trinity.\n44:50 - Let’s say a person was properly baptized as a child but didn’t remember. They grow up and live a secular life until finding the faith later. They go through RCIA and, not remembering that they had been already baptized, are baptized and confirmed into the church.This person thinks that their recent baptism washes away the sins to that point and so does not go to confession for those sins. Is this person in trouble spiritually? Can they, since they are ignorant of the situation, receive the Eucharist?\n48:08 - ANTI-RACISM: Jimmy Akin, what’s your most recent and thorough reflection on Numbers 12? (Bible condemns racism)\n51:57 - Do we have one guardian angel for our whole life?\n53:11 - What are your thoughts on the “manna machine”?",

One day, she was laying on the floor with the turtle. The turtle looks at her, then at a piece of fence about a foot or two tall, and back at her a few times. The turtle then runs to the fence, pushes it over to create a ramp (inclined plane) onto my daughter, then climbs the fence onto my daughter’s back. That would appear to be a lot of thought going on in the turtle’s brain to figure that out. What evidence do we have for the extent of intelligence in animals? Does she just have a really smart turtle?\n45:41 - What’s your take on original monotheism?\n49:28 - Will we continue learning in heaven? Or will we just instantaneously *know* everything we can know?\n51:14 - Did Jesus drink wine, or was it just grape juice?\n53:12 - If Jesus submitted his DNA to 23&Me would it prove that Joseph was his Father?",

    "description": "In a recent interview with 60 Minutes, Pope Francis expressed hope in humanity, highlighting the goodness he sees in people despite acknowledging the reality of sin. This sparked controversy among some Evangelical circles, with critics like James White accusing the pope of promoting humanism. However, others like Gavin Ortlund emphasized the importance of addressing sin in the context of presenting the gospel. While the Catholic Church acknowledges the reality of sin, there's a difference in how Protestant traditions often focus on presenting the \"bad news\" before the \"good news.\" This approach isn't universal and can sometimes be off-putting or inappropriate depending on the context. Drawing from the example of St. Paul, who engaged with the Athenians by starting with points of common ground before discussing sin and repentance, the article suggests a more nuanced approach to preaching that considers both the message and the context. Ultimately, it advocates for a broader perspective beyond traditional preaching tropes and a sensitivity to the context in which statements are made.",

    "description": "It's a fifth Friday, so Cy Kellett of Catholic Answers Live is asking Jimmy Akin weird questions from listeners, about topics like getting married after civilization collapses; what is Sh'ol; can Padre Pio still absolve living penitents; and more weird questions.\n\nhttps://mysterious.fm/314\n\nQuestions Asked:\n• 03:21 - Can St. Padre Pio still give absolution?\n• 06:48 - If a faithful Catholic couple who are not yet married (but want to be) were able to find each other, or happened to already be spending time together, during a cyberattack or catastrophic natural disaster that ended modern society as we know it, how would they go about getting married? If they had no way to find a priest, would they just have to wander around the wasteland until they found one? Or could they make their vows in the presence of whatever witnesses they could find?\n• 10:20 - In Psalm 139 in the New American Bible, it says ‘If I ascend to the heavens, you are there; if I lie down in Sheol, you are there too.’ [Psalms 139:8] So, what exactly is Sheol?\n• 21:00 - I heard a priest created a machine allowing him to see the events of the Crucifixion as they happened. Then the Vatican excommunicated him. Is this a true-ish story?\n• 22:23 - Speaking in tongues and resting in the spirit—are they always legit or are they sometimes psychological?\n• 29:24 - Mystics who claim to live without food for years. There are a few in the Catholic tradition but there are also claims of Prahlad Jani, an Indian Hindu. Is it demonic or a hoax?\n• 36:48 – What is your opinion on the concept of Limbo as the eternal home of the souls of unbaptized babies?\n• 42:29 - If they were still around, which human relatives (homo neanderthalensis, homo erectus, homo floresiensis, homo denisova, etc) would we likely be able to baptize if they were so inclined to be received by Christ and His Church?",

    "title": "Did Early Christians Believe in Dragons?",
    "description": "D Is for Dinosaur video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyUYckTo0A8\n\nToday people are fascinated by cryptids—hidden creatures—like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. In the ancient world, the most famous cryptid was the dragon, so did early Christians believe in them?\nThe term dragon (Greek, drakôn) appears in the Greek Bible, but normally it is in a symbolic context—like when the devil appears in the form of a dragon in the book of Revelation (e.g., Rev. 12). So this doesn’t provide good evidence for belief in literal dragons.\nHowever, the term also appears in other contexts. For example, in Daniel 14, the prophet Daniel kills a large drakôn that the Babylonians worshipped. However, in secular Greek, the term drakôn originally referred to a snake or serpent, and it did not always have monstrous connotations. This is clear in Wisdom 16:10, where the author refers back to the snakes that bit the Israelites in Numbers 21 and describes them as “venomous drakontôn.” The author of Daniel 14 may thus have expected readers to imagine a big snake, and some modern Bible translations like the Common English Bible use “snake” in the passage.\nThe Bible thus doesn’t provide a good basis for documenting belief in literal dragons. However, we do find some in the early Church who were open to the idea. St. Augustine writes:\n“As for dragons, which lack feet, they are said to take their rest in caves, and to soar up into the air. While these are not too easy to come across, this kind of animated creature is for all that definitely mentioned not only in our literature but also in that of the Gentiles” (Literal Meaning of Genesis 3:9:13).\nThis passage may not mean what it suggests, however. You’ll note that Augustine says dragons have no feet—which would point to snakes—but he says that they fly. There were—indeed—references to flying snakes in ancient literature. Isaiah mentions them (14:29, 30:6), and so does the Greek historian Herodotus (Histories 2:75-76, 3:109). So Augustine is likely not referring to what we would think of as a dragon but to flying snakes. (Note: flying—or, technically, gliding—snakes do exist in some parts of Asia.) \nThe flying snakes that Herodotus referred to were small, but in another passage, Augustine envisions dragons that are very large:\n“Now dragons favor watery habitats. They emerge from caves and take to the air. They create major atmospheric disturbance, for dragons are very large creatures, the largest of all on earth. This is probably why the psalm began its consideration of earthly creatures with them” (Expositions of the Psalms 148:9).\nAugustine wasn’t alone in thinking about real, enormous dragons. Other Church Fathers did so also, and so did non-Christian thinkers.\nThe reason is obvious when you think about it. Although the term paleontology was only coined in 1822, humans have been running across fossils for as long as there have been humans. When they came across the bones of giant, monstrous animals, they correctly concluded that there used to be giant animals in the area.\nIn her book The First Fossil Hunters, historian Adrienne Mayor insightfully argues that it was the ancient discovery of fossils that formed the basis of the legends of dragons and similar creatures the world over.\nSt. Augustine himself reports finding a giant tooth on a beach, where the action of the waves presumably uncovered it:\n“Once, on the beach at Utica, I saw with my own eyes—and there were others to bear me witness—a human molar tooth so big that it could have been cut up, I think, into a hundred pieces each as big as one of our modern teeth. That tooth, however, I can well believe, was the tooth of a giant” (City of God 15:9).\nI’m not a Young Earth Creationist, but I have to agree with musician Buddy Davis’s fun children’s song D Is For Dinosaur:\n“When dinosaurs first roamed the earth, many years ago\nPeople called them dragons (and just thought you’d like to know)\nSo dinosaurs and dragons are both the same thing\nThe only thing that’s different is we changed the dragon’s name”",

    "title": "What Is Death?",
    "description": "Original Popular Mechanics article (paywall): https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a42216404/is-death-revesible/\n\nPopular Mechanics has run an article with the audacious title, “A Groundbreaking Scientific Discovery Shows that We Can Reverse Death.” Is that true?\nIt depends on how you understand death. In the old days, it was relatively easy to determine whether someone was dead: They stopped breathing and their pulse disappeared.\nThat was a useful way of determining death because breathing is necessary to get oxygen to the blood, and a beating heart is necessary to push oxygen-laden blood to the cells of the body. Without that happening, every cell in the body would die.\nOf course, mistakes could be made. Someone might be breathing really shallowly, and they might have only a faint pulse, but if they really stopped breathing and their heart really stopped, they were dead. End of story.\nThings got more complex in the twentieth century. Techniques became available to keep someone breathing and to restart their heart. \nIn the 1950s, ventilators were introduced. These are machines that act like bellows to move air in and out of the lungs. \nAlso in the 1950s, the first (external) mechanical hearts became available, and by 1960, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could help keep blood moving during a cardiac arrest, adrenaline could encourage the heart to resume beating, and defibrillators could hopefully shock it back into a normal rhythm.\nAll this raised the question of whether people who met the previous definition of death (no breathing and no heartbeat) should be considered dead.\nBy the late 1960s, a new criterion was proposed: absence of brain activity. This could make sense because a functioning brain was needed to keep things like breathing and hearts going without mechanical aid.\nSo perhaps—some reasoned—if the brain was no longer working, if the patient was “brain dead,” you could forego artificial respiration and heart stimulation and treat the patient as dead.\nThis meant you could harvest their organs—if they were an organ donor—including their precious heart. The first successful heart transplant took place in 1967, so maybe someone else could use the organ if the donor was brain dead.\nThere has been a lively debate about whether lack of brain activity should be used to define death, and advocates of brain death as they key criterion have won a lot of converts to their view.\nAt the same time, there have been concerns that doctors have been defining brain death in a loosey-goosey way, such as merely being in a persistent vegetative state rather than truly and permanently lacking brain function. This would let them take more people off life-support—freeing up medical resources—and harvest organs from more people.\nPersonally, I am not at all convinced that the brain death criterion is adequately defined—or applied—today, and so a person who is actually still alive may be killed by the removal of their heart for a transplant. Consequently, I have not agreed to donate my organs on my driver’s license.\nWhile the brain death debate has been going on, the concept of death has begun to be questioned on a new front: the cellular level. Hypothetically, one could argue that a person’s body isn’t fully dead unless all of the cells in it have died, and things like brain function, respiration, and heart action are just things needed to keep the cells alive.\nWe thus might be able to help save more people if we could intervene to keep their cells alive long enough to fix whatever is wrong with their brain, lungs, heart, or other organs.\nPopular Mechanics has discussed a team of researchers who have been working on how to support the cells of the body when critical organs are not functioning. They call this system OrganEx, and preliminary trials on pigs have been successful, though human trials are still years off.\nOther advances are also being made. It turns out that, if a person’s body and brain are cooled down in the right way, they can be brought back to normal functioning as much as six hours after cardiac arrest has occurred (see Sam Parnia, Erasing Death: The Science That Is Rewriting the Boundaries Between Life and Death).\nWe also now have implantable artificial hearts, and—though they aren’t yet as convenient and reliable as the one the biological version of Captain Picard had on Star Trek—we’re approaching the point where not having a functioning human heart may no longer be useful as a criterion for irreversible death.\nWhat all of these advances have done is make death—which used to look like a simple either-or state—to look more like a process, and a process that in many cases can be reversed.\nAs medicine continues to advance, we may expect it to become more and more reversible, which will make it more challenging to define precisely when “final” death occurs.",

    "title": "How Would Liturgical Calendars Be Different on Other Planets?",
    "description": "I enjoy fielding questions on Catholic Answers Live about humanity’s forays into outer space, such as this one: “How would the Church adapt its liturgical calendar if we colonized another planet or the moon?”\n\nWell, it’s going to depend on where the planet or moon is and how fast it rotates. Humans are biologically designed to have a wake-sleep cycle that is synced with the day-night cycle on earth. If we’re in an environment where the day-night cycle is radically different from what we’re programmed to work with, we just ignore it.\n\nFor instance, the International Space Station goes around the earth in about forty-five minutes, meaning the astronauts on board get twenty-two minutes of light and twenty-two minutes of dark. There’s no way they want to fall asleep every twenty-two minutes and then wake up twenty-two minutes later for the duration of their mission.\n\nThus, astronauts on space stations ignore their environment’s peculiar day-night cycle. Instead, they keep a regular Earth-based day-night cycle for their sleeping and waking periods.\n\nThe same would be true of any other planet or moon that has a radically different rotation rate. And if humans are keeping a normal terrestrial day-night cycle and ignoring the rotation of the object they’re on, then they would likely keep a terrestrial calendar. They wouldn’t modify the calendar because they’re keeping the same day-night cycle.\n\nNow, what about other planets like Mars, which has a rotational period close to that of earth? Its day is almost the same length as earth’s. It’s a little bit different, but humans there would probably adapt to a Martian day-night cycle, and that means their days and nights would get out of sync with the days and nights on earth.\n\nHowever, I don’t think that on Mars there would be a need to change the liturgical calendar, because Mars is very close to earth. It’s only a few light-minutes away, and as a result it would be very easy to stay in contact with earth and continue to use the terrestrial liturgical calendar. Even if their Sunday slides a few hours from Sunday on earth (because of the difference in the day lengths), you can still approximate that. So, they would still have the same kind of Sunday cycle, they could still celebrate Christmas and Easter at the same times, and so on.\n\nBut what if you go further afield—like out of our solar system? In that case, there’s no easy way to communicate with earth because of the light-speed limit. If you were on a planet with a similar rotation period to earth, I could see the local church in this other solar system developing its own liturgical calendar based on the local planetary rotation period.\n\nHowever, I suspect that even then—even if they came up with new holidays and new liturgical seasons—they would still keep Christmas and Easter at the same time that they’re being celebrated back on earth, because that’s something you could always calculate.\n\nSo, I think that there could, in another solar system, be a different liturgical calendar with some similarities to ours; but here in our solar system, we’re so close that I don’t think we would practically develop different liturgical calendars for other planets—at least not any time in the foreseeable future.",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | April 19, 2024 (Hour 2)\n\nNOTE: IF ANYONE CAN SEND ME TIME CODES FOR THESE QUESTIONS, I CAN ADD CHAPTERS\n\n0:00 - Introduction\nClare \nI'm not questioning the Trinity, but I have a question about the way that is expressed in the prayer of the Collect.\nAlmighty living God, \"who govern\" (multiple) rather than saying \"who governs\" as in (One God).\n\nMark \nWhy do you think Jesus wasn’t more straight forward and left no argument on who he is…. God.\n\nAnastacio \nIs there other meaning of “baptism” other than immersion?\n\nMatt \nWho is (Fr.) Malachi Martin and is there any legitimacy to his prophetic claims - the end of the pontificate (I think) after the 112th pope, or the extension of the third secret of Fatima (which I remember you mentioned in one of your episodes on Fatima), or his covert description of the Church and certain bishops in “Windswept House?” I know it’s a lot, but as a priest I’m often struggling with trying to help parishioners in the more traditional movements concerning this subject.\n\nMark \nHello Jimmy! When God created Adam and Eve, how old were they? Thank you and God bless!\n\n\nBrett \nI've been keeping a list, because I always forget my questions when you ask. Here are two:\n1) Are there any extra-Biblical writings that we possess which we are fairly sure were written by people who knew or interacted with Jesus, or who are mentioned in the Bible?\n2) What programs or books, or where for classes, would you suggest for someone to learn Biblical Greek, Latin, or Hebrew?\nIf you ever consider writing an academic commentary on any of the Books of the Bible (I know you've done one for Mark), please do so. I'll gladly buy two (or three!).\n\nTrey \nIs Frank J Sheed’s explanation of the Trinity good theology?\n\nErin \nDoes blessing something require authority over it? I wondered about this because I'm studying to become a librarian, but I currently work in a library as an assistant. Am I more qualified to bless the library as a librarian (rather than just an assistant)? Or, as a mom, I bless my children. Can I bless other people's children?\n\nJean \nI had a discussion with a Baptist who believed in Baptist successionism. I know that's been debunked, even by other Baptists. But he threw at me a \"Jesuit Oath\", which he claimed showed how bloodthirsty and horrible the Catholic Church is. I looked online for this and found what he was referring to, but it is so over-the-top inflammatory that I can't believe it's anything but a hoax. But he says it's real and is in the Library of Congress (as though placement there imbues the document with authenticity). Could you please tell me more about this \"Jesuit Oath\"?",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | November 17, 2023 (Hour 2)\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n02:28 - What was the thorn in Paul’s side?\n06:48 - When I cited John 20:21-23 as clear evidence for sacramental confession, a protestant made a claim that the power granted by Christ in those passages died with the apostles.\n13:10 - At Pentecost, tongues of fire rested on those present, and they spoke in foreign languages (foreign tongues). Is this a play on words? In other languages, especially in Greek, is the word for an anatomical tongue, the same as the word for a slice of fire? Even without a play on words, the coming (from unknown source) of fire often signified the presence of God, so the point of the phenomenon doesn’t rely on the (at least in English) play on words. Does it?\n16:07 - My husband died in June of brain cancer 5 months after diagnosis. So many good people keep telling me that “he’s in a better place.” Why do they say that when it should be obvious that he should be with me? I understand that we can’t know for certain where a soul goes after death. How do I respond to this? It makes me angry at how easily people toss that cliché out to a woman who is grieving the death of her husband.\n22:04 - Does the Church have a preferred stance on Darwinism vs Lamarckism?\n33:36 - The Bible IS a Catholic book. Right. Besides dropping the Deuterocanonical Books, have Protestants in the English-speaking world “mistranslated” words? Like the word Tradition which, in Spanish versions is translated as tradition when is in a negative sense (tradition of men) and teaching when it’s favorable. Is there any in English?\n40:25 - Jimmy Buffett’s song Coastal Confessions has a line “Bless me father for I have sinned, given the chance I’ll probably do it again.” Would this make the confession null since it seems Jimmy hasn’t fully repented or is it just honestly/humility?\n46:00 - Where did your Mexican serape blanket that you drape over your chair come from?\n50:44 - What do you think about the Gospel of the Hebrews? Later patchwork of reworked quotes from the Synoptics? Something contemporary with the Synoptics? A Hebrew version of Matthew? Could it ever be rediscovered?",

If that made any sense. Like how could you prove conclusively they are not demons? Or would that not be possible?\n35:55 - In the traditional Anaphora of Mar Addai and Mar Mari, the Eucharist is consecrated *without* the words of institution. How do we explain it with Catholic sacramental theology?\n43:30 - There is speculation that the negative response that humans have to the “uncanny valley” is due to some evolutionary development where our ancestors were preyed upon something that looked like humans but wasn’t quite human. What do you think?",

With that being said is the ability to Shine in the movie & book the same thing as prophecy, extrasensory perception, intuition, empathy, precognition, and retrocognition?\n12:10 - What are the historical ramifications if Abraham had never left Ur?\n13:43 - Is it true that the Vatican has one of the best science labs in the world, and if so why and what is it used for?

However, they are an unfortunate genetic match and have certainty that 100% of their children will perish in the womb. Would it be immoral for them to live as husband and wife? And does the Church have any legislation that would prevent them being married in the Church?\n18:46 - Can a priest celebrate Mass if he has no arms?\n22:42 - On May 31, 1985 I was baptized by the fire of the Holy Spirit from the crown of my head, through every cell in my body. See Luke 3:16 Do you think the fire of Purgatory is the same purifying fire I experienced? Meaning, do you think it’s the Holy Spirit that does the purging?\n29:00 - How many times in one’s life can one vow “till death do us part?”\n34:00 - If throughout the Bible angels (who are spiritual, non-corporeal beings) appear with enfleshed bodies as apparitions, could that be true for the Holy Spirit as well? Is it possible that those puzzling times in Scripture when people didn’t recognize Jesus it was because the Third Person of the Trinity was making an appearance? When Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene in the tomb (John 20:14-18), and to the two followers on the way to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35) and to the seven disciples fishing (John 21:1-14), is it possible that they didn’t recognize Him because they were not seeing God the Son at first, but God the Holy Spirit for a brief time? The One who they didn’t recognize consoled, comforted them, revealed truth to them, testified to them, convicted them, taught them, walked along side of them (parakletos), witnessed to them, brought things to their remembrance, and revealed and glorified the Lord to them…all the things Jesus promised the Advocate would do when He came (John 14:15-31, John 15:26-27 and John 16:5-16).\n40:05 - If angel are non-corporeal beings, why do we gender them?\n46:42 - How does one mistake a reconnaissance balloon as an alien space craft?\n48:30 - Where was Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30?\n50:54 - Let’s say that macro-PK is real.

    "title": "What Are a Christian's Obligations If He Time Travels Before Christ? (Weird Questions)",
    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | December 1, 2023 (Hour 1)\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n02:05 - Suppose a modern lay Catholic (baptized, confirmed, etc.) were transported through time and space to the year 5 BC, Jerusalem. Assuming he/she retains his/her knowledge and beliefs from the 21st century AD and is aware that he/she has arrived in a time before the Incarnation has taken place, in what way would this Catholic be obligated to worship God? Would he/she need to live as a Jew under the Mosaic law, given that the New Covenant has not yet been established in their “present” timeline, or would he/she be required to live according to Catholic practices to the best of their ability? Would he/she be morally obligated to be a sort of prophet, proclaiming the coming Lord; or perhaps be obligated not to, lest they affect salvation history? \n06:11 - I’m curious whether Satan can “bless” people and/or things? By “bless” I mean supernaturally enhance in the manner requested by those seeking the “blessing”. \n12:05 - If someone is trapped in a time loop like in Groundhog Day or Edge of tomorrow, is it still a sin to commit suicide in order to reset the time loop? If you already have been trapped for several weeks then it would probably feel annoying to wait out the entire loop if you mess something up. \n14:53 - I write Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fanfiction, mostly action/adventure stories. I am currently outlining a story where the TMNT meet a Catholic Apologist. I have modeled her after Mr. Akin in both personality and intellect. In my story, the apologist is explaining the Catholic idea of the soul to the TMNT. One of the things that has hung me up a little is that I believe all sensitive and rational souls are created immediately upon conception. The TMNT started out as ordinary turtles, so they were given sensitive souls the moment they were created, before they were even born. However, now that they have mutated, they have rational souls. One of the characters questions whether the turtles’ sensitive, animal souls died and a new, rational soul was installed in them when they mutated, or if their souls were changed when they mutated? Initially I had the idea that God “upgraded” their sensitive souls to rational souls upon their mutation, but a friend of mine suggested that maybe they were conceived with rational souls, but as it took 15 years for them to develop from babies to teenagers, they simply didn’t express their rational souls until they were old enough/mutated enough to talk. I’m curious as to what Mr. Akin would say and would be grateful for his perspective. \n21:45 - I have a few questions for you: 1. If angels are spiritual, eternal beings existing outside of time, how can they be created in time if eternity is outside of it? 2.  When we die, our souls survive our mortal bodies. If our souls are eternal, how can we be created in time if eternity is outside of it? 3. How did God create something out of nothing if it is against the nature of nothing to be something? \n31:50 - What is “Burning Man” really about?  It seems to get a lot of media attention each year.  My stepdaughter and her husband have both apostatized from the church, and went a few years back.  They have regional “burns” as well that they attend.  The stories they seem happy to tell people seem very disturbing.  Almost satanic.  Certainly evil.  Nothing at all like what I get from Mr. Google or the media.  Who is “The Burning Man? Do you have any insights on any of this? \n34:02 - I have a weird question (I think). I know in the early 20th century or late 19th century catholic theologians mentioned the desirability to baptize not-yet-born babies in the womb as long as it was safe and possible. My question is, why isn’t this done right now even without medical intervention? It seems to me that the form (I now baptize…) the matter (water, after all the baby is submerged in something like salt water), intent and minister can all be present to administer the sacrament. \n41:41 - If a Priest travels at the speed of light, does he still have mass? \n45:42 - Could it be possible that we prayed for something in our past to be different so maybe God answered our prayer and changed the past event and we are no longer aware of it because it is like it never happened? \n50:26 - Did God give us incisors because he knew that one day we would eat meat, even though he originally forbade it prior to the flood? \n53:09 - Why haven’t we been back to the moon despite the advanced technology?",

If the priest would simply consecrate again, would the procedure change if there’s no more host and/ or wine to consecrate?\n20:28 - Let us make man in our own image? Who is US and OUR? Is this an early indication of the Blessed Trinity?\n24:39 - Why didn’t the Pharaoh at the time of Moses, being a first born, die during the 10th plague?\n28:54 - During his trial, why didn’t Jesus try to stand up for himself? Pilate seemed like he would listen.\n30:52 - 1. What does it mean when the church says that Mary’s virginity remained intact during childbirth? Is this belief Dogma?\n33:59 - 2. Is it appropriate to worship God in Mary due to Theosis? If in heaven the saints are united to the divine nature in a similar way to Christ’s hypostatic union wouldn’t it be appropriate to worship God in the glorified saints? (I know it’s not appropriate but I just need help understanding the distinctions)\n36:42 - Is there a definitive teaching (or even different schools of speculation) on whether or not your guardian angel is specifically assigned only to you (that is, the GA only ever served as a guardian for you) or do they get different assignments when their guardees die? (Asked another way, are there the same number of guardians as there have been/will be human beings; or do the guardians guard different folks throughout their “careers”?)\n41:56 - At what point in attending an illicit or invalid Mass should the laity speak up or choose not to receive communion?\n46:26 - If God doesn’t change (the “God is simple argument”), how does that square with Jesus gaining a human nature?\n47:54 - I have heard people say that the hats that Bishop’s wear symbolize their authority.

Which ones were married, who had children, etc.? \n07:19 - I’m curious about John 10:18 where Jesus talks about having the power to lay down his life and take it up again. Does this mean he could have chosen to die right then, or could it suggest that he had the option to remain on the cross longer before choosing to die? \n11:36 - What sacraments can angels administer?

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | Mar. 26, 2024 (Hour 2)\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n03:11 - Why is there a personal judgment and a general judgment? Doesn’t that seem redundant? \n13:29 - Have any credible remote viewers ever tried to remote view heaven? \n23:15 - How does our doctrine of inspiration interact with 1 Cor 7:29-31? In that passage, Paul seems to assert to his original audience that the end of history was near upon them, and gives them advice which only makes sense in that context. Paul seems to change his mind later on (in other letters). But in that spot, it really seems like an assertion which is untrue. But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives, 30 and those who weep as if they do not weep, and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice, and those who buy as if they do not possess 31 and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it. For the present form of this world is passing away. \n36:57 - How can parishes do better at helping those who don’t drive attend Mass? Or help those would are considering joining the church and don’t drive. \n40:38 - What is the reason behind why the Gospel of Mark has both a short ending and a long ending? \n46:30 - Which Bible translation is the most faithful to the original languages? \n51:40 - Loving and liking are different. We know that in heaven we will love everyone the same. Does this mean that we are still going to have people that are closer to us, people that have a special bond? Or will those relationships become the same in the sense that there are no persons that have a closer friendship?",

In the center is painted “The Seven Church Ages” and at the bottom is the person’s birthdate. Thank you! \n13:20 - How are we to respond to Pope Francis saying that Priests can bless same-sex unions? Is it reconcilable with our Catholic faith being we were taught it goes against God’s teachings? \n17:38 - What does the Church say regarding the things people find funny? There are some things that we find funny that may be dark, edgy, and slightly irreverent but we have little control over our reflex to laugh or chuckle at such things. If we do find something funny that’s seen as “offensive” from a moral point of view, are we to confess it and try harder in the future to process the bit or joke until we no longer find it amusing? \n24:05 - How does a revert get involved in parish life? \n28:32 - Can you explain kenosis? I keep hearing a certain strain of Christians abuse Philippians 2:7 to suggest Jesus gave up his divinity. Their reasoning is that Jesus had to sacrifice himself as a man in order to atone for humanity. Can you please debunk this? 2 Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, 2 complete my joy, so that ⌊you are in agreement⌋, having the same love, united in spirit, ⌊having one purpose⌋. 3 Do nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves, 4 each of you not looking out for your own interests⌋, but also each of you for ⌊the interests of others. \n39:06 - I’ve wanted to hear your treatment of the souls of unbaptized children who die before the age of reason. I’ve researched it a fair bit from the 2008 document approved by Pope Benedict, to Servant of God Marcel Van, to alleged quotes by St Bernard of Clairvaux, to other reasons that suggest they go to heaven rather than limbo, but your research & insights would be of interest too. \n 47:31 - Why was there a bowl of wine/vinegar at the cross? It wouldn’t have been for antiseptic or pain-numbing reasons. What was the reason for it? \n49:22 - Have you ever considered doing any Jimmy Akin’s Mysterious World episode on neurodivergence? \n 52:15 - What are the three secrets of Fatima? Why was one of them never revealed to us?",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | December 15, 2023\n\nHOUR 1:\n\n03:17 - Are there any insights as to when Christ was using His Divine intellect vs. His human intellect or is this a complete mystery or is it incorrect to say Christ was not always using both?\n06:38 - I would love to hear you comment on the theology of numbers.\n18:58 - If God is the God of all, how can he have a “chosen people”?\n21:41 - God gave us the gift of free will. By my understanding, it is the only gift he cannot take back or overrule, otherwise our will would not be truly free. With this in mind, how are we to understand his words in Exodus where he seems to make pharaoh obdurate, as though overriding the free exercise of his will? For example, Exodus 7:3-4: “Yet I will make Pharaoh so headstrong that, despite the many signs and wonders that I work in the land of Egypt, Pharaoh will not listen to you. Therefore, I will lay my hand on Egypt, and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring my armies, my people the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt.”\n30:17 - It seems like miracles are less known than they should be. Example- Fatima, St Pio, Beauraing, and others. Do you think the evil one obfuscates the message?\n32:51 - Questions from a fellow pipe smoker. What’s your favorite pipe and tobacco?\n40:26 - Which is the best government: the United Federation of Planets (from Star Trek) or the United Planets (from Legion of Super-Heroes)?\n44:04 - Is there any chance Our Lady of America is coming back from the disapproval of the diocesan bishops?\n48:55 - Please discuss the metaphor and actuality of new heavens/new earth. Who (will) live there? The need for a new earth and whether it’s metaphorical has been discussed more than a new heavens. What is wrong with the old heavens?\n\nHOUR 2: \n\n1:02:50 - A person wants to be baptized but has a family member who insists they were baptized as children, together (at the same time as they are twins). They do not have anyone living who would know and cannot locate records in places they guess it may have occurred. Do they take the steps toward baptism or assume they are?\n1:04:50 - Is the Protestant Canon of Scripture materially sufficient for salvation? If yes, is the Deuterocanon unnecessary? If not, is there information in the Deuterocanon that is needed for salvation?\n1:11:16 - Jimmy I think the biggest crisis in the Church today is the lack of belief in the Eucharist. I’d like to see you speak on the prefigurement of the Eucharist in the Old Testament and the fulfillment in the new. Also, I’d like to see a discussion on the real existence of hell and what many of the saints have said about it plus the testimonies of modern-day exorcists. Thanks.\n1:18:38 - Why does St. Paul refer to levels of Heaven and what might that mean for Christians? Are the levels multiple steps to God?\n1:22:58 - In Matthew 4 and Luke 4:8, why did Jesus tell Peter to “Get behind me Satan”? Why did he call him Satan? Or did he? Thanks, Jimmy!\n1:28:35 - In your podcast episode where you went through the different possibilities of aliens, I didn’t hear you mention the possibility of an alien race that is ahead of humanity in their salvation journey. What are your thoughts on an alien race that is on their New Earth equivalent? I would assume that alien abduction would be immoral and therefore such a race wouldn’t abduct anyone. Would such a race be able to or even want to interact with humans?\n1:33:18 - It would seem that Judas was the first to receive and leave communion in a state of mortal sin at the Last Supper. What might be the implications of Jesus knowing ahead of time that Judas would receive the morsel with murder in his heart?\n1:42:00 - Why can’t I baptize people with Beer since it’s mostly water? Also, can I baptize with tears?\n1:45:20 - My 15-year-old would like to know why God would choose a 13-year-old girl to be the mother of Jesus instead of a fully grown woman.\n1:51:20 - Is it okay to lie in certain situations like if you were hiding Jews, in Germany during World War II?\n1:53:23 - If I suffer Martyrdom with unconfessed sins, even a Mortal one, do I really go straight to heaven or will I still need to spend time in Purgatory?",

    "title": "Can Your Prayers Change the Past? (Weird Questions)",
    "description": "CAL Weird Questions | December 1, 2023\n\nHOUR 1:\n\n02:05 - Suppose a modern lay Catholic (baptized, confirmed, etc.) were transported through time and space to the year 5 BC, Jerusalem. Assuming he/she retains his/her knowledge and beliefs from the 21st century AD and is aware that he/she has arrived in a time before the Incarnation has taken place, in what way would this Catholic be obligated to worship God? Would he/she need to live as a Jew under the Mosaic law, given that the New Covenant has not yet been established in their “present” timeline, or would he/she be required to live according to Catholic practices to the best of their ability? Would he/she be morally obligated to be a sort of prophet, proclaiming the coming Lord; or perhaps be obligated not to, lest they affect salvation history? \n06:11 - I’m curious whether Satan can “bless” people and/or things? By “bless” I mean supernaturally enhance in the manner requested by those seeking the “blessing”. \n12:05 - If someone is trapped in a time loop like in Groundhog Day or Edge of tomorrow, is it still a sin to commit suicide in order to reset the time loop? If you already have been trapped for several weeks then it would probably feel annoying to wait out the entire loop if you mess something up. \n14:53 - I write Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fanfiction, mostly action/adventure stories. I am currently outlining a story where the TMNT meet a Catholic Apologist. I have modeled her after Mr. Akin in both personality and intellect. In my story, the apologist is explaining the Catholic idea of the soul to the TMNT. One of the things that has hung me up a little is that I believe all sensitive and rational souls are created immediately upon conception. The TMNT started out as ordinary turtles, so they were given sensitive souls the moment they were created, before they were even born. However, now that they have mutated, they have rational souls. One of the characters questions whether the turtles’ sensitive, animal souls died and a new, rational soul was installed in them when they mutated, or if their souls were changed when they mutated? Initially I had the idea that God “upgraded” their sensitive souls to rational souls upon their mutation, but a friend of mine suggested that maybe they were conceived with rational souls, but as it took 15 years for them to develop from babies to teenagers, they simply didn’t express their rational souls until they were old enough/mutated enough to talk. I’m curious as to what Mr. Akin would say and would be grateful for his perspective. \n21:45 - I have a few questions for you: 1. If angels are spiritual, eternal beings existing outside of time, how can they be created in time if eternity is outside of it? 2.  When we die, our souls survive our mortal bodies. If our souls are eternal, how can we be created in time if eternity is outside of it? 3. How did God create something out of nothing if it is against the nature of nothing to be something? \n31:50 - What is “Burning Man” really about?  It seems to get a lot of media attention each year.  My stepdaughter and her husband have both apostatized from the church, and went a few years back.  They have regional “burns” as well that they attend.  The stories they seem happy to tell people seem very disturbing.  Almost satanic.  Certainly evil.  Nothing at all like what I get from Mr. Google or the media.  Who is “The Burning Man? Do you have any insights on any of this? \n34:02 - I have a weird question (I think). I know in the early 20th century or late 19th century catholic theologians mentioned the desirability to baptize not-yet-born babies in the womb as long as it was safe and possible. My question is, why isn’t this done right now even without medical intervention? It seems to me that the form (I now baptize…) the matter (water, after all the baby is submerged in something like salt water), intent and minister can all be present to administer the sacrament. \n41:41 - If a Priest travels at the speed of light, does he still have mass? \n45:42 - Could it be possible that we prayed for something in our past to be different so maybe God answered our prayer and changed the past event and we are no longer aware of it because it is like it never happened? \n50:26 - Did God give us incisors because he knew that one day we would eat meat, even though he originally forbade it prior to the flood? \n53:09 - Why haven’t we been back to the moon despite the advanced technology? \n\nHOUR 2 is too long to enter because of YouTube character count restriction :-(",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live | October 16, 2023: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtJebwwlrA\n\nHOUR 1\n\nTimothy: To reconcile the gift of free will — even the choice to do wrong and thus incur damnation — with the overall plan of God, would it be appropriate to see choice as analogous to a magician doing a card trick where he or she “forces” a hand? The participant IS freely choosing a card, but the skilled magician, desiring and knowing a certain outcome, uses extraordinary and unseen means to “force” the conclusion of the choice. I’ve always thought that this was a good comparison to the overall dilemma of rationalizing a divine “plan” that still worked in the freedom to do evil, since I don’t think God would “plan” for a person to do wrong.\n\nCharbel: What is the Church’s stance on the historicity of Saint Veronica as a person and also on her veil?\n\nMichael: Does the story in Matthew 5:25-26 refer to purgatory?\n\nTaylor: What is Christian doctrine on the number of the levels of Heaven given St. Paul’s reference to three and Paradise. If no doctrine, then why is St. Paul’s statement not considered inerrant?\n\nRuss: Lucid dreaming how to do it. What does the Church think?\n\nPeggy: Who ordained Paul an apostle. The church at Antioch? Acts 25? The entire church ordained priests or was he just sent on a mission? Confused.\n\n\nHOUR 2\n\nCraig: I think it’s important to talk about how the Sacraments are necessary for salvation but that God can and does work outside His sacramental system. ie where does an unbaptized baby go? Certainly not to Hell…. there are some Catholic leaders who don’t make this delineation and it can be confusing. Some people think only Catholics will go to Heaven because they take the Sacraments.\n\nBarbara: Did Adam have scars on his rib cage?\n\nBenet: I read in a Catholic Facebook group that Hindus worship demons rather than just being mistaken. If true, that is a lot of demon worship with plenty of happy people. What would your response to that idea\n\nBarbara: What is the origin of the Glory Be prayer?\n\nMychal: There is the story of Luther throwing ink pots at the devil when he was working on his Bible, and I often wonder, if true, if it was really an angel he was seeing but his pride would not let him acknowledge it.\n\nJeff: Was \"The 12 Days of Christmas\" song a secret Catholic creed devised to communicate the faith under persecution by the English? Pretty sure this is a recent fiction, but it needs the Akin Treatment.\n\nMarty: The Bible only references people in the Holy Land during Bible times. Can we know that God made Himself known to other Nations in the world at that time?",

    "description": "Catholic Answers Live October 6, 2023: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAg03vONnY\n\nHOUR 1:\n\n02:47 - In John 10:16, is it possible that Jesus was referring to extraterrestrial life when He said “And I have sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice.”? \n07:37 - Hypothetically, if there was a global religious catastrophe and all clergy members were killed except one priest, would that priest automatically become the pope? And follow up: if all the clergy were killed, how would the faithful go about rebuilding the church given that there are no priests/bishops left to ordain new members? \n16:00 - Is it possible that my dog is actually my guardian angel who is temporarily in the form of a dog? \n17:51 - I think about the doctrine of Divine simplicity and the afterlife. If God is not made of any parts, what are we going to see when in heaven? Or what is he going to reveal to us if he is so simple. \n19:37 - I heard that Lucifer’s rebellion was that God revealed the Incarnation of the Son, for which he refused to serve a man. Does that mean it wasn’t revealed that God is Trinitarian? I’m assuming that because God is omnipresent, the Son is God and is man. \n21:33 - What are your thoughts on spontaneous human combustion? Is there evidence it’s happened, and what would be a possible explanation for it? \n28:35 - What evidence is there that humans matured earlier in life in Christ’s time? \n33:48 - What would the moral implications be of joining an expedition to colonize Mars or other planet, knowing that there would not be access to any sacraments indefinitely? \n38:44 - If Christ made a visit to all continents together with Joseph, Mary, and the apostles (just like a Papal visit) before He was crucified, would the world have become Christians? \n42:52 - Did Jesus have opinions? Such as having a favorite food or favorite color? Would these be the results of random biology and environment as He grew up? \n48:00 - If an animal (let’s say a dolphin) were artificially made more intelligent, like to a human level, would that dolphin be able to be baptized? Would it be basically a human with regards to the afterlife? If not, what change would be required to make an animal into a person? How would this be the same or different from a scenario where we discover intelligent space aliens? \n52:50 - What happened to the Holy prepuce? \n\nHOUR 2:\n\n1:02:28 - Does the Holy Spirit have chromosomes since the Holy Spirit came over Mary and she became pregnant with Jesus? \n1:03:26 - Did Zoroaster Fulfill all of the prophecies for a savior hundreds of years before Jesus did? \n1:10:55 - Does time always move forward, and is there time in heaven? \n1:18:44 - I’ve been listening to a lot of stories on Bigfoot and aliens lately. What are The Church’s teachings in regard to these types of creatures/sightings? \n1:21:56 - We are not supposed to spread ashes of the deceased, but relics of saints are spread far and wide. Is there a reason for these seemingly illogical practices? \n1:28:17 - What sacraments can Angels administer? And can they confect the sacraments? We know the Angel at Fatima gave the children communion. I’ve also heard of an angel that had heard confession for someone and was disguised as a priest. (Not sure how true that one is though.) \n1:35:57 - Why do Muslim woman cover their heads, and Mary and Elizabeth covered their heads, but CHRISTIAN women these days do not. (I’m certainly not campaigning for Christian women to wear hijabs. I was just wondering.) \n1:51:53 - What are we to make of the “sword of St. Michael” — the straight line of seven monasteries, all of them built on a mountain or tall hill, and stretching from Ireland to Israel? Each monastery was built in a different time by different people, and yet they all appear to line up perfectly, as if by design. *Was* it by design? And if so, whose, and to what end?",

    "description": "It's time for another set of weird questions posed by Cy Kellet of Catholic Answers to Jimmy Akin, including this time: Could an alien be pope; the Omicron variant; could Bigfoot be an alien; conjoined twins and marriage; evolution and morality; ball lightning; and more.\n\nhttps://mysterious.fm/278\n\nQuestions covered in this episode:\n• 03:52 - I love these episodes! I’ve got a question for you – if humanity ever encounters another intelligent species in outer space (or the inner earth or whatnot), would someone from said species be potentially eligible to be elected Pope (assuming they met the other qualifications), or is that office explicitly limited to humans?\n• 06:52 - What are your thoughts on the Omicron Variant?\n• 14:51 - My ten-year-old brother would like to know if it’s possible that Bigfoot could be an alien\n• 21:28 - If you had conjoined male twins, could one get ordained and the other married? Does the extent of conjunction affect the answer?\n• 27:00 - I know that it is fine for Catholics to believe in evolution, and I do. But recently, I have read some academics who argue that human morality is a product of evolution. That is, people who acted in anti-social ways were ostracized by society and more likely to die, and therefore people having our current moral orientation evolved through natural selection. Can this view be reconciled with Catholic understanding, or is it in opposition?\n• 34:30 - What evidence is there for ball lightning? I saw it roughly 20 years ago and was fascinated. But at that time there were no pictures or good theories.\n• 39:43 - IF parents and Godparents can present a newborn child for Baptism…could someone, say a son, ask a priest to forgive the sins of their mother, or father, who are essentially, due to the advanced nature of Alzheimer’s babies?\n• 45:29 – There’s been a lot of talk at my work about Mercury being in retrograde and it makes everything on Earth topsy-turvy. Could this really affect things on Earth? I thought of how the Moon controls tides and people seem to act crazier when there’s a full moon.",

Aren’t the distances between life-supporting planets too vast to feasibly travel? If figures in the government actually knew something, wouldn’t a cover-up involve too many people to keep the secret for long? \n\nI’m joined by Jimmy Akin to answer ten common objections to UFO phenomena and alien visitations. In the wake of recent news stories about unidentified aerial phenomena, I heard the same skeptical talking points trotted out over and over again as if UFO believers had never considered them and had no response to them at all. So I’d like to play whatever small part I can in improving the quality of the discourse by advancing the conversation past the initial thoughts that are commonly offered into more interesting territory. This should make skeptics better skeptics, and help agnostics like myself better appreciate the skeptical position. Right now, the skeptics are not sending their best. \n\nJimmy Akin's Mysterious World https://sqpn.com/podcasts/jimmy-akins...\n\nThe Objections https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.co...\n\nMy Linktree https://linktr.ee/emersongreen\n\n/ timestamps / \n\n00:00 Introduction \n\n01:47 Jimmy Akin's Mysterious World \n\n05:28 The Trump Objection \n\n13:43 The 'Too Many People' Objection \n\n22:47 The Crash Objection \n\n33:50 The Distance Objection \n\n47:39 The Geography Objection \n\n54:48 The Skeptic Community \n\n1:02:05 The Historical Objection \n\n1:16:01 The Motivation Objection \n\n1:38:19 The Low Priors Objection \n\n1:54:43 The Illusion Objection \n\n2:03:27 The Psychoanalysis Objection \n\n2:15:00 Conclusion \n\n2:18:00 Goodbyes\n\nThe ten skeptical objections we respond to: \n\n05:28 The Trump Objection \n\n“If the government knew of alien visitations, Trump would have learned about it. If Trump knew about it, he wouldn’t be able to keep his mouth shut about it. But Trump never said anything about UFOs or aliens. Therefore, the government doesn’t have knowledge of alien visitations.” \n\n13:43 The 'Too Many People' Objection \n\n“There would have to be too many people involved in a cover-up of alien visitations. Someone would accidentally let it slip or blow the whistle eventually. To quote Bill Nye, ‘The government kinda sucks at keeping secrets’.” \n\n22:47 The Crash Objection \n\n“So these super-advanced aliens can build technology that (to us) is nearly indistinguishable from magic, they can travel here with that technology, but then when they get here, they crash? Aliens this advanced wouldn’t crash their ships like that!” \n\n33:50 The Distance Objection \n\n“Alien visitations would require traversing vast regions of space faster than the speed of light, since traveling the necessary distances without faster-than-light travel would require a prohibitively long time. But faster-than-light travel is impossible. Therefore, we are not being visited by aliens.” \n\n47:39 The Geography Objection \n\n“Why are alien abductions and UFO sightings geographically concentrated in the US? Doesn’t that seem to indicate that they are best explained psychologically or culturally?” \n\n1:02:05 The Historical Objection \n\n“Why are alien abductions and UFO sightings temporally concentrated in the present day? Doesn’t that seem to indicate that they are best explained psychologically or culturally?” \n\n1:16:01 The Motivation Objection \n\n“Why would advanced aliens come all the way here just to do the things it’s often alleged they do (e.g., mutilate cattle, make crop circles, or run tests on humans)?”\n\n1:38:19 The Low Priors Objection \n\n“However unlikely it is that abductees, eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, etc. are lying or mistaken, mundane explanations of their testimony are still more probable than the idea that we are being visited by aliens. In other words, the kind of testimonial evidence we have isn’t sufficient to overcome the low prior probability of genuine alien visitations.” \n\n1:54:43 The Illusion Objection \n\n“Many UFO/UAP sightings are produced by illusions: The eyewitnesses are just misjudging how far away the object is. Why couldn’t that explain all the sightings?” \n\n2:03:27 The Psychoanalysis Objection \n\n“Belief in UFOs and aliens as a modern manifestation of the religious impulse. Humans are wired to believe in a power greater than themselves, and this explains why the UFO phenomenon arose as religion declined in the west.”",

Would the validity of the sacraments be contingent on how closely this person stuck to the teachings of the Church i.e. what if he had a suitcase full of Catholic books and was on his way to be ordained as a priest when the plane crashed?\n33:38 - Seeing that “…the Lord opened the mouth of [Balaam’s] ass, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”…And the ass said to Balaam, “Am I not your ass, upon which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so to you?”…..” (Num 22:28, 30) Did Balaam’s ass have a rational soul?\n42:36 - Was it certain or contingent that Adam and Eve would fall or that the angels would fall? If it is certain, could God create other rational beings for whom their fall would be contingent and could they potentially persist perpetually in the state of grace and obedience to God? If it is contingent, could another human couple (same nature, different identity) have persisted in the state of grace and obedience to God perpetually in the Garden of Eden? For the angels, if they transcend space and time, how do we understand “before” and “after”, “in heaven” and “not in heaven” with respect to their fall?\n49:54 - Suppose Middle-Earth really existed. Could God become incarnate as a man, an elf, a dwarf, and a hobbit all at the same time? If yes, could man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit Jesus interact with each other and maybe all go out for a pint?\n\nHOUR 2:\n\n05:21 - I am a bit of a survivalist nut and I am always preparing for the collapse of civilization. I was just wondering, if there was a nuclear war or really any kind of catastrophe that would trigger a societal collapse, and the chaos was so widespread that most of the bishops and all of the cardinals were killed, how would the new pope be elected? Could the surviving bishops (who I would imagine would not be cardinals because most likely they’d all be remote rural bishops) elect the new Pope? Furthermore, what if all the bishops were killed? Could regular priests somehow advance one of their own to the bishopric? If not, could they at least lay their hands on laypeople and continue apostolic succession that way?\n19:12 - When the Magi came, do you think it made the Holy Family wealthy? Enough to travel and stay in Egypt, provide for a 3-year ministry of 13 plus, and for the care of his beloved mother Mary until the Dormition?\n22:43 - Are the laws of logic and thought — identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle — true of all *possible* universes, or only of ours? Would multiverse theories or alternate dimensions modify these rules? And do the laws *certainly* apply even here, or could one argue that maybe an extreme form of Scotistic “haecceity” versus “quiddity” means that maybe they don’t?\n28:19 - Why is most lunch meat round when bread is mostly square?\n36:28 - Jimmy, huge fan of your work, your terminal intellect and towering beard. Or maybe I got that backwards. If we, in the eschaton are given our infallible bodies and the new Jerusalem in essence becomes our planet krypton… can you postulate on what we will do in the eschaton? Saints are generals in God’s army etc? But what will our missions be? Will we go and evangelize the universe of fallen creatures? If so, will Christ have to incarnate on that world to save them or will we as we have been “made Gods” or is that a blasphemous thing? If we do hypothetically have to incarnate for them, would our infallible bodies change to the alien form we incarnate for thus we become aliens only until we go to the next world? Or if only Christ can do the incarnating / saving would be or are there already millions of incarnations of Christ and his form in heaven adjusted to whatever creature he’s interacting with?\n44:40 - Why did Humans take so long to be advanced just recently with agriculture, medicine, economy, infrastructure etc. What were they doing for 200,000 years!?\n52:45 - With admission by the USA of ufos, what do we think about extraterrestrial beings—souls, evangelizing, origin, etc.?",

    "description": "This dialogue originally occurred on the Theology Unleashed channel (6/16/23): https://www.youtube.com/live/4TXV2wwPI3s\n\nThere is a big difference between how Vedantic and Abrahamic traditions conceive of the process and mechanics of salvation. One way the difference can be summarized, is to say that Christian notions tend to talk about something being paid off or amended for, while Vedantic ideas talk about our hearts become clean and out love being directed towards God. These 2 scholars will explore the differences and perhaps pushback on the reasoning for each view.\n\n\"Jimmy was born in Texas and grew up nominally Protestant, but at age 20 experienced a profound conversion to Christ. Planning on becoming a Protestant pastor or seminary professor, he started an intensive study of the Bible. But the more he immersed himself in Scripture the more he found to support the Catholic faith. Eventually, he entered the Catholic Church. His conversion story, “A Triumph and a Tragedy,” is published in Surprised by Truth. Besides being an author, Jimmy is the Senior Apologist at Catholic Answers, a contributing editor to Catholic Answers Magazine, and a weekly guest on “Catholic Answers Live.”\"\n\nDr. Howard Resnick, also known as Hridayananda Das Goswami, has been a spiritual leader in a world-wide bhakti-yoga community for over fifty years. He holds a PhD in Sanskrit and Indian Studies from Harvard, has published many academic books and articles, including several publications with Harvard University, and has lectured around the world on the philosophies of the sacred traditions of India. He has also established bhakti-yoga communities in many countries",

He had two faces--one of which looked to the past and one of which looked to the future. This dance starts with the dancers looking down (to the past) and then they flip to look up (to the future). I'm not a huge fan of waltzes, but I fell in love with the tune (Valse de Pastouriaux) and knew I needed to write a dance to it. At the end, you can hear a dancer saying how good they thought it was, and I was later approached by someone who wasn't able to dance but who said how beautiful he thought the dance was.",

    "title": "Captain America, Time Travel & Marriage (New Years’ Weird Questions) - Jimmy Akin's Mysterious World",
    "description": "It's the New Year, so Cy Kellett of Catholic Answers Live is asking Jimmy Akin weird questions from listeners, about topics like Capt. America; Johnny Cash; St. Patrick and snakes; did Mary have two spouses?; Jesus' wounds; and baby Jesus' umbilical cord.\n\nhttps://mysterious.fm/239\n\nQuestions covered (times approximate):\n• 3:26 - Can you explain the Biblical references in the Johnny Cash song “when the man comes to town” and is it biblically accurate? I’d love to be able to share Jimmy’s thoughts on this on social media.\n• 13:12 - I understand that in devotional language the Blessed Mother is “The Spouse of the Holy Spirit”. But it’s confusing to hear in the same prayer that the Blessed Mother is also the spouse of Joseph.  (Did Mary have two spouses?) Also, I once said that Joseph was the “husband of Mary” and was corrected that he was the “spouse of Mary” and that made a big difference.  She explained the marriage of Joseph and Mary was only “for show” and the “real” marriage was to the Holy Spirit. So what’s the right way to explain this gently – without having to disturb the pious fictions that people have lived with for a long time?\n• 17:40 - I am reading a book “The Rod of an Almond Tree in God’s Master Plan.” Basically, the theory is that God gave Adam a rod from the Tree of Life when He expelled Adam and Eve from Eden.  The miraculous rod makes its way from Adam to Enoch, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, and David.  David thrusts it into the ground while fleeing Jerusalem from his son Absalom.  The miraculous rod grows into the tree that Christ was crucified upon to atone for our sins.  Have you heard of this theory before?  What do you think?  Potential topic for “Mysterious World?”\n• 21:32 - Is it possible the person of the Holy Spirit made brief appearances in the Bible? When Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene in the tomb (John 20:14-18), and to the two followers on the way to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35) and to the seven disciples fishing (John 21:1-14), is it possible that their eyes did not see Him because they were not seeing God the Son at first, but God the Holy Spirit for a brief time?\n• 27:39 - In the Winter Soldier movie, Captain America meets his old love interest from before he travelled into the future and finds out that she married and grew old with someone else after she thought Captain America had died back in the 1940s. In the latest Avengers film, Captain America travels back in time to before Peggy Carter married this other man and marries her instead, thereby pre-empting the unnamed other man from ever marrying Peggy Carter. While Captain America was traveling back in time like this, would it have been adultery for him to have desire for and even make the move to pursue and marry a girl who he knew was married in his own future time but not in the time he was currently traveling to?  Seems like this might be adultery for him, but not for her. What do you think?\n• 32:26 - What’s the deal with St. Patrick and the snakes on the “plain”? I can’t find anything definitive out there.\n• 36:34 - Why does the glorified Jesus not have the wounds of the Scourging at the Pillar or Crown of Thorns while keeping the nail marks and side wounds?\n• 38:07 - Jesus’ nails were in his wrists (according to the Shroud of Turin), why do stigmatic saints have the wounds on their hands?\n• 42:28 - How can genetic mutations cause evolution?\n• 49:14 - Did Jesus bi-locate or multi-locate in the New Testament?\n• 50:14 - Who would have cut Jesus’ umbilical cord? Or did the Virginal Birth not require this to happen?",

I can’t be the only one who wants to hold Him.\n• 16:23 - What’s the deal with Krampus?\n• 18:45 - Would it be morally wrong to invent a fictional character who delivers gifts on Christmas, then convince one’s children that this fictional character exists?\n• 21:02 - Does encouraging belief in Santa make children doubt their faith when they learn the truth?\n• 24:28 - If you live on one of Jupiter’s moons, how do you know which Earth time zone to observe in order to know when to hold midnight Mass on Christmas Eve?\n• 28:47 - Since Jesus inherited no DNA from a human father, why is he not a clone of Mary?\n• 32:51 - Would Jesus already know where Joseph and Mary hid his presents?\n• 36:18 - If a time-traveler were to discover that the Nativity really occurred in 6 BC or 4 BC, would we adjust our calendar system to reflect that?\n• 38:23 - As a Greek speaking Bishop, would St. Nicholas follow the Julian or the Gregorian calendar for his celebration of Christmas?\n• 42:29 - Could the baby Jesus have developed colic? If Jesus was like us in all things but sin, does that mean he got sick?\n• 51:29 - What will they use for Christmas Trees on Mars?\n• 52:16 - Should the church be making a bigger deal about the Feast of the Annunciation rather than the Nativity in order to emphasize that Christ was incarnate on Earth 9 months before he was technically born",

    "description": "The teachings of Jesus Christ have influenced millions of people in the 2,000 years since he lived. But in recent times, many skeptics of Christianity have questioned whether the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—can be trusted as true accounts of his life and teaching. Where do the Gospels come from, and how can we be sure they are an accurate record of historical events?\n\nOn Thursday, March 24 at 7 p.m., Catholic Answers author and apologist Jimmy Akin debated Bart D. Ehrman on the topic “Are the Gospels Historically Reliable?”\n\nAbout Jimmy Akin:\nJimmy Akin is an internationally known author and speaker. As the senior apologist at Catholic Answers, he has more than twenty-five years’ experience defending and explaining the Faith. Jimmy is a convert and has an extensive background in the Bible, theology, the Church Fathers, philosophy, canon law, and liturgy.\n\nAbout Bart Ehrman:\nBart D. Ehrman is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He began his teaching career at Rutgers University and joined the faculty in the department of religious studies at UNC in 1988, where he has served as chair of the department and director of graduate studies.",

In Tobit 5:13 he claims to be the son of a man named Hananiah. Is he lying? It never says that he eats, wouldn’t Tobiah notice that or is just assumed that he does? \n• 06:09 - Could we be living in a rebooted universe? What if in Revelation, John saw a previous universe in which Jesus was born for the first time by Mary as in Revelation 12 and then once he was swept up to God, that rebooted our universe so that in the universe we live in Jesus has existed since the beginning. All the while, the previous universe existed as an alternative timeline which John saw destroyed and wrote it down in Revelation? \n• 10:42 - Why is it in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is clothed with a robe of scarlet then In Mark and John it is purple? \n• 18:26 - On a previous show, you spoke before on the question of whether marriage would be possible between humans and aliens. The answer hinged on whether procreation would be possible. What if procreation were possible but the resulting offspring were sterile (like mules)? Would that affect the possibility of marriage? \n• 21:08 - Is raising your arm telekinesis? Is telekinesis limited to moving our own body? How do pure spirits move objects? \n• 27:32 - If we happen to colonize Mars in the future would we have to update the Missal to replace “Earth” with “Mars”? \n• 30:40 - There are loving Catholics that state the CCC supports a vegan diet. Their reasoning? The CCC forbids us causing animals needless suffering, they say we don’t need to eat them to live, therefore killing them for food is causing them needless suffering. Your thoughts? \n• 37:42 - What are the differences in blessings? I bless myself and my children. How effective is that vs. a blessing done by a priest? \n• 41:23 - What happened to Christ’s foreskin from His circumcision, clipped fingernails, hair He shed, or anything else he left behind containing His DNA? We know that His humanity is sacred, but on a practical level, how far do we take that in our understanding of it? \n\nMYSTERIOUS HEADLINES: Unusual Sounds theme\n• Do the Northern Lights Make Noise?: https://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2021/10/04/can_you_hear_the_northern_lights_797243.html\n• Song Created to Alleviate Pain: https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2021/10/science-creates-song-specifically-to-relieve-pain/\n• Direct Link to Song on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2KEVs9ny3UQzA6HjGJy1bP?go=1&sp_cid=17399472efaffa81f5e018bdbcab2982&utm_source=embed_player_m&utm_medium=desktop&nd=1",

Is Die Hard a Christmas movie?\n• 12:48 - When does Christmas end? The 26th? New Year’s? After the octave? Twelfth Night? Epiphany? The Presentation?\n• 15:44 - Is there any record anywhere of the midwives (if any) who attended Mary?\n• 22:22 - If other planets were colonized, and we had to create a whole new calendar, how would we adjust Christmas?\n• 26:30 - How did the character of Santa Claus evolve and what is its historical connection (if any) to St. Nicholas?\n• 33:35 - Might Santa be a Time Lord? 1. Would Santa need to travel faster than lightspeed to deliver gifts to all nice Christians on Christmas Eve? If so, could that explain his longevity and his increase in mass over the centuries? 2. Does he use shrinking technology to fit through chimneys, teleportation technology to beam into houses, or some sort of quantum phase technology to render himself and his bag of presents temporarily insubstantial to pass through walls? 3. Could he use said technology to conquer the Martians?\n• 50:35 - I know the so-called secret meanings of the 12 days of Christmas and what they are purported to symbolize, but what about the number of days themselves? I was told that if you add up all the days mentioned in each verse that you get on gift for every day of the year until next Christmas.

Would He have allowed Himself, Mary or an Apostle to become sick or hurt?\n• 11:32 - Does the Emily Blunt character in the Tom Cruise movie “Edge of Tomorrow” commit murder every time she kills his character to restart the day?\n• 17:25 - What should we make of the up and coming problem of human composting of bodies vs. Catholic burial? It is being implemented in Seattle and already approved by law there.\n• 21:42 - How was the male seed provided to fertilize the egg which enabled Jesus the Christ to germinate? How was the DNA determined for the male contribution to Jesus’s zygote?\n• 22:41 - What do you think the spiritual state of a Time Lord is?\n• 24:24 - Given that Divine Revelation has provided us knowledge of invisible beings called angels and demons, and given that the fall of Adam is what threw the entire universe into discord, and given that all rational creatures are necessarily disposed to worship of God through the Incarnation of Christ, what possible room could there be for the existence of an unknown, unreached race of intelligent beings on other planets not accounted for by Revelation?\n• 30:37 - In what sense could it be said that unicorns (or dragons or trolls or Captain Picard) exist?\n• 37:01 - A Jewish friend asks me this all the time: How could the wise men have seen the star in the east if they were east of Judea?\n• 39:50 - If Raiders of the Lost Ark was written to have Indy and his girlfriend open the Ark instead of the Germans would they have died in the same way the Germans did or no since they didn’t have any evil intentions with the Ark itself?\n• 41:47 - I would love to hear a layman’s explanation of the immutability of God—how God is unchanging and exactly what that means for a personal God who watches over us changeable beings.\n• 43:38 - What happens when you have two popes and, God forbid, the second one dies first?",

    "description": "It's a fifth Friday so Cy Kellett of Catholic Answers Live is asking Jimmy Akin more weird questions from listeners, including would I need to be re-baptized after going through a transporter; what happens to guardian angels of frozen embryos; what about human-animal hybrids; and more.\n\nhttps://www.sqpn.com/2021/07/transpor...\n\nQuestions Covered:\n• 01:58 - Is it possible that we are made in the image and likeness of God due to the Grandfather Paradox of Jesus assuming human flesh to begin with?\n• 07:20 - My friends came up with a fun weird question for the next show: If I am transporting the Eucharist in my car, can I use the carpool lane?\n• 10:34 - Do frozen embryos make their guardian angels wait with them?\n• 12:03 - Will the bodies of people in hell (or heaven for that matter) need to eat and drink? Will our bodies just, subsist without sustenance?\n• 16:30 - How was the holy house of Loretto transported from Nazareth to Italy.\n• 19:01 - What happens to a person who can’t remember their sins through memory loss from, say, an accident, aging, or a disease like Alzheimer’s? Do they cease being culpable for their sins if they can’t remember them to repent and ask for forgiveness and reconcile with God?\n• 23:43 - What could the physics of the “new heavens and new earth” (new creation) be like, such that this would no longer disintegrate due to entropy, etc.?\n• 29:59 - If the Star Trek style transporter kills the person and creates a clone with that person’s memories, would a person who gets transported in such a manner have to be baptized or confirmed again? Would a priest who gets transported have to be ordained again? What about confession? What if you commit a mortal sin, then get transported, would the clone with your memories have to go to confession?\n• 34:17 - If hell is complete and final separation from God, and God is necessary for existence, how do people and angels exist in hell? Another one – is the devil in hell yet, and if not, are the people in hell waiting for him to get there or are they all waiting until the end and judgement to enter hell?\n• 39:34 - What are the spiritual and perhaps biological implications of combining human and pig or cow DNA? Besides having no justifiable health consideration and being seriously wrong for tampering with trying to create previously non-existing life forms, is it possible that a cow or pig could come to the realization that it will wind up as steak or bacon? If it is well known that trauma from violent wars can be passed down and sudden unknown memories which seem like deja vu do happen, is there enough information here to make human/animal chimeras unequivocally illegal? Who do we call?",

    "description": "It's a fifth Friday so Cy Kellett of Catholic Answers Live is asking Jimmy Akin more weird questions from listeners, including whether the pope would be Bishop of Rome if humans left Earth; the practicalities of sacraments in space; could Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) be baptized?; what are the giants in the Bible?; and more.\n\nhttps://www.sqpn.com/2021/04/baptizing-baby-yoda-popes-in-space-sacraments-in-space-time-travel-giants-more-weird-questions/\n\nQuestions Covered:\n• 2:50 - If humans had to leave Earth and live on spaceships or other planets, would the Pope still be the bishop of Rome? Would the bishops get new dioceses? \n• 7:22 - Is the dog that saved St. Rocco from starving, by bringing him bread, in Heaven? Could the dog have been an Angel? \n• 10:12 - If a priest were to offer Mass on the International Space Station, would the only one to be able to grant faculties for him to preach, hear confessions or witness marriages be the pope since he is constantly traveling over different dioceses at any given time? The more important question is whether a Mass in space with microgravity could even be offered validly. Would the wine be able to stay in a chalice in a valid manner? \n• 16:22 - Why is St Christopher shown with a dog’s head? \n• 18:15 - Let’s say your adult son from the future travels to present day and informs you that he was 1) conceived out of wedlock, 2) was raised by his single mother because you married another woman, and 3) all of that set him on a path to becoming Pope. Question: how obligated would you be to ensure that timeline remain intact, since any slight alteration could result in your son never being born? \n• 22:02 - Could we (or at least the people responsible for it) allow AI to call us (or consider us) their creator-gods? In a sense, AI would be created ex-nihilo and would be imprinted with our humanity without being human. \n• 25:10  - If human technology ever developed Star Trek level matter teleportation, and that technology was used to transport people, would the transported person be the EXACT same upon rematerialization, down to the God-given soul, or would they be just a near-perfect facsimile with a different soul (given that the person is essentially destroyed at the molecular level when transported)? If the latter, would the transporter operator be in any way culpable for the death of the person who was dematerialized (be that person human, Klingon, or even android)? \n• 27:50 - If God exists outside of time and space as we know it here and now, will his existence be different in heaven for eternity after the Final Judgement? We can only assume heaven too will exist in time and space since we will have our glorified bodies…or will it? \n• 31:11 - What if an animal here on Earth evolved to be clearly rational in the same way humans are, would they need to be baptized? Would they be considered made in the image and likeness God as well? And would they have equal/greater/lesser intrinsic worth than us? (Same goes for aliens) \n• 35:50 - Can Baby Yoda receive baptism if the Child were real? \n• 38:46 - If you baptize the Wicked Witch of the West with water, is it an act of charity or an act of murder? \n• 41:48 - I have heard Heaven described as a banquet feast, if this is true, then my question is who will be at our table? My son was adopted, will he be with my husband and I or his birth mother? Thanks! For some reason it saddens me that he might not be with us in this scenario. \n• 45:00 - Do you think Oswald was the lone gunman? \n• 46:42 - I really want to know what’s up with the “giants” in the Bible.",

    "description": "Happy New Year! Jimmy Akin is answering more weird questions, including whether indulgences can be retroactively applied; if UFO aliens could be demons; what happens to cremated saints who should be incorruptible; and whether aliens could have souls.\n\nhttps://www.sqpn.com/2021/01/alien-demons-alien-souls-god-computer-cremated-incorruptibles-unintentional-indulgences-more-weird-questions/\n\nQuestions Covered:\n• 02:42 - There are certain acts which have an indulgence attached to them.  Let’s say that a woman named Mary is in the habit of a particular prayer at a particular place and time.  One day Mary explains her habit to Martha.  Martha exclaims “Did you know there’s an indulgence attached to that”.  “No, I didn’t”, Mary replies. My weird question is: Does Mary receive those indulgences retroactively with this knowledge and desire?  Or has she been unconsciously receiving them all along?  Or is it the case that only going forward, she will receive the indulgence?\n• 07:53 - My understanding is that during the canonization process the body of the potential saint is exhumed and if their body has not suffered corruption that plays a role in their path towards sainthood. The question has to do with cremation. With the rise in acceptance and practice of cremation for Catholics, how would someone being a future incorruptible interact with the act of cremation? Would the body burn at all? If it would, are we destroying future incorruptibles by practicing cremation?\n• 10:34 - I was wondering if Jimmy could speculate on a presupposed notion on the salvation of Erwin Rommel. Rommel was a Catholic German General during WWII and supposedly involved in the plot to kill Hitler. Because of the nature of the cause he fought for, would his Catholic faith have (assuming he stayed true to its tenets) be sufficient for his salvation?\n• 16:55 - If someone went into a church and removed the consecrated Eucharist from the church.  Would it be a matter of kidnapping or theft?\n• 21:20 - Saint Apollonia leaped into a fire. They would have tossed her in anyway, because she wouldn’t renounce her faith. Where do you draw the line between martyrdom and suicide?\n• 32:57 –  I have heard a theory that alien abductions could be demons pretending to be aliens. This is supported by the fact that in a lot of these cases anti-religious messages are given by the aliens. Could this be possible? I have also been intrigued by the theory that gods worshiped in antiquity (specifically Mayan and Sumerian) may have been demons also. Would this fit the Catholic belief system? How would God allow this if true?\n• 39:32 - Are you familiar with Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Last Question”? How do you understand the final sentence with in the whole of the story? And what was the message Isaac was trying to convey?\n• 46:15 - I’ve been trying to read about the theological implications of finding out that aliens exist. How might we determine if any aliens we had met were fallen, once we knew they had souls?",

    "description": "Merry Christmas! Jimmy Akin is answering more weird questions, including whether an insane person confessing sins to a cat could result in forgiveness; whether one could baptize with tea in emergency; and whether some bodily mortification is spiritually healthy.\n\nhttps://www.sqpn.com/2020/12/confessing-to-a-cat-satanic-panic-bodily-mortification-baptismal-tea-mortification-more-weird-questions/\n\nQuestions Covered:\n• 02:51 - I’d like to know about the so-called “Satanic Panic” around Dungeons and Dragons, but also the related panic about D&D and murder/suicide. \n• 14:38 - Does CCC 2290 have anything to say about people’s addiction to coffee? We all seem to give coffee a pass even though people spend lots of money on it and develop significant physiological and psychological dependence on it. Find any humorous coffee meme and substitute the word “heroin,” and suddenly it isn’t so funny. \n• 20:57 - Where would we be today if the Library of Alexandria never burned down? \n• 24:20 – I have questions about bodily mortification. I am reading about the lives of saints who did actual damage to their physical bodies. To me, that seems very wrong, as our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and God created the body as “good,” so much so that burial of the dead is an act of Christian charity. Yet, we still are being advised in some quarters to “subdue” our bodies” with either extreme and unhealthy neglect, or actual harm. \n• 30:33 - Was Jesus dead all day on Holy Saturday and just waiting to come out on Sunday? \n• 32:55 - What would the implications be in terms of philosophy, theology, and morality if animals other than humans were discovered to be sapient? \n• 38:42 - In dire circumstances, can one baptize using tea? It’s mostly water. What if it’s sweetened? \n• 41:45 - In Confirmation class a kid once asked me this: “If there were an insane man who thought his cat was a priest, and he went to Confession to his cat and heard the cat give him absolution, would his sins be forgiven?” \n• 49:50 - I read that Augustine believed that concupiscence is specifically passed down through the act of intercourse of the parents. Would concupiscence still be part of a child if there was artificial Insemination without any sexual act involved?",

Was Jesus the only one to do this?\n* 16:12 - What religion was Jesus?\n* 17:51 - Was Jesus Buddhist?\n* 21:33 – Aliens scare me. If they exist, is there a God? Did He also create them?\n* 26:50 – Is our God is part of a race of gods, like the Gnostics?\n* 28:32 - Is method acting in an evil character role generally seen as dangerous and possibly immoral, perhaps along similar lines as participating in hypnosis?\n* 31:55 - Why does capybara not count as meat during Lent?\n* 35:48 - If we’re not alone in the universe, where is everybody else?\n* 39:09 - Would Luke Skywalker have to denounce his Jedi religion in order to become Catholic?\n* 42:50 - If researchers were to identify a medical cause for hyperfertility, and a treatment could be found which could reduce fertility to “normal levels” (not eliminating fertility altogether) and make it possible for these women to successfully use NFP to avoid pregnancy, would that be a licit treatment?\n* 45:27 - Is it true that Jesus is against self-defense and that Christians are not allowed to defend themselves?",

    "title": "Can Catholics be Jedi? Saying Mass in Klingon? Saved Zombies? ... & More Weird Questions",
    "description": "It’s a fifth Friday of the month, so Jimmy Akin is answering more weird questions, including whether Catholics can be Jedi, saying Mass in Klingon, whether zombies can be saved, whether Elves need sacraments, and more.\n\nhttps://sqpn.com/2020/05/can-catholics-be-jedi-saying-mass-in-klingon-saved-zombies-more-weird-questions/\n\n• 02:55 -I was watching a sitcom on one of the major networks. In this episode, a teenage character was trying to win over a girl by pretending to be as religious as she was. The female character had decided to be baptized in a Baptist church and the young man joined her hoping that the gesture would garner her affections. The pastor character dunked both teenagers in the font and recited the proper Trinitarian form. Now even though they were acting on a set, it seems to me that all the necessary requirements were fulfilled for Baptism. Provided the actors had not previously been baptized, would they now be baptized?\n• 07:10 - As sort of an academic exercise among linguists, there’s a hypothetical language, Anglish, created from a Britain isolated from Latin and French influence. What would the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be sound like if Anglo-Saxon-influenced words were used exclusively in the prayers?\n• 11:11 - Would Tolkien’s Elves, as unfallen humans, require the sacraments?\n• 14:54 - Would a Mass performed in Klingon be invalid or illicit? If it is valid, where can we find a priest who could do that? Could Fr. Hugh be trained to do this?\n• 19:09 - Where did Jesus’s Y chromosome come from?\n• 20:00 - And where did Adam get his Y chromosome? And did Eve have a Y? Could the Y that was withheld from Eve have been preserved and passed down somehow until it was utilized in Jesus, the second Adam?\n• 23:34 - How long did it take to grow your beard and how long is it?\n• 25:32 - Apparently there is a Non-Theistic movement called Jediism that is based on what the Jedi follow. Would it be ok for Catholics to be a part of this even though the “real life Jedi” may not be too quick to admit they are role-players?\n• 28:38 - Can zombies be saved?\n• 30:50 - Are zombies biblical?\n• 34:04 - Does tradition give us any idea if what happened to the saints that rose from the grave and went into the holy city after the crucifixion of our Lord. Did they have incorrupt bodies or glorified bodies? Did they die again? Did they return to the grave? Were they assumed bodily into heaven? Also, is there any record of what the said to people in the Holy City?\n• 37:29 - What is the real point of liturgies where pets are blessed?\n• 38:48 - Suppose you took a single-celled human embryo. You removed the sex chromosomes from this embryo’s DNA and replaced them with chromosomes of the opposite sex. Now the child will grow up to be the opposite sex. What sex will this person be in the Resurrection?\n• 43:12 - In Scripture we read many times that Jesus wept. Yet I can’t think of a single instance to read Jesus laughed. Did he?",

Since the Last Supper hadn’t happened yet in the natural timeline, is it possible to have a valid eucharistic consecration? \n• Why wouldn’t there be marriage in the age to come? Will the sex organs on our resurrected bodies not work?\n• If you can have a nihil obstat for books, why doesn't the Church have a similar system for speakers and Catholic teachers?\n• Can a priest give himself confession if he is in a state of mortal sin and needs to say Mass and receive the Eucharist?\n• How did the animals get to places like Australia after the Great Flood?\n• If we found another sentient species (on earth or on another planet), would it be a violation of natural or moral law for a human to marry and/or procreate with that being?\n• Will God allow a zombie apocalypse possible to happen?

Jimmy Akin and Dom Bettinelli tackle the mystery of the Antichrist, what the Bible says, and what the Church says.\n\nhttps://sqpn.com/2018/10/mys011-the-mystery-of-the-antichrist/\n\nKEY TEXTS:\nCatechism of the Catholic Church:\n675 Before Christ’s second coming the Church must pass through a final trial that will shake the faith of many believers. The persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth will unveil the “mystery of iniquity” in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth. The supreme religious deception is that of the Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh.\n676 The Antichrist’s deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatalogical judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the “intrinsically perverse” political form of a secular messianism.\n \n2 Thess 2:3-4\nLet no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.\n \nRev 13:18\n18 This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six.\n \n1 John 2\n18 Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come; therefore we know that it is the last hour.\n19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out, that it might be plain that they all are not of us. . . .\n22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.\n1 John 4\n3 Every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already.\n2 John 7\nMany deceivers have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.",

    "title": "Lucifer Worship at the Vatican? REALLY???",
    "description": "Some videos on YouTube are claiming that there’s a prayer in Latin where the Vatican invokes Lucifer!\n\nBut here's the truth . . . \n\nThe prayer in question—the Exsultet—is actually referring to Jesus Christ.\n\nThe word lucifer originally had no connection to the devil. It was the Latin word for the morning star (i.e., the planet Venus when it appears in the east). \n\nVenus is the brightest planet in the sky, and because it sometimes appears before dawn, it was referred to as lucifer or the bringer of light (lux = “light” + ferre = “to bring”). It was called the same thing in Greek, where its name was phôsphoros (phôs = “light” + pherein = “to bring”). It also had other names.\n\nThe morning star is so bright and prominent that the Bible uses it as a symbol. In Isaiah 14:12, it symbolizes the persecuting king of Babylon (cf. 14:3). In 2 Peter 1:19, it is a positive spiritual symbol. And in Revelation 2:28 and 22:16, it is a symbol of Jesus.\n\nIt is also a symbol of Jesus in the Exsultet—a prayer sung at Easter by various Christians, including Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, and Methodists.\n\nAfter the Paschal (Easter) Candle is lit, the deacon sings, “May this flame be found still burning by the morning star: the one morning star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever.” \n\n(Latin: Flammas eius lúcifer matutínus invéniat: ille, inquam, lúcifer, qui nescit occásum. Christus Fílius tuus, qui, regréssus ab ínferis, humáno géneri serénus illúxit, et vivit et regnat in sæcula sæculórum.)\n\nWhen this is sung in Latin, the Latin word for “morning star”—lucifer—is used. To make it clear this is not a personal name but just a noun, it is left uncapitalized in the Latin text.\n\nOther Christians use their own versions of this prayer, which also invoke Jesus as the morning star. They just don’t typically use Latin.\n\nThere is no devil worship happening. The prayer merely refers to Jesus as the morning star, in keeping with his own declaration: “I am . . . the bright and morning star” (Rev. 22:16).\n\nThis augmented video was originally taken from Catholic Answers Live, February 1, 2018 (2nd hour)",

How did the Church determine that Linus was Peter’s successor, and how was he elected?  \n\n* How should I deal with a priest who is extremely disrespectful to the pope? He has a podcast and takes time during his homily to criticize the pope. We’ve tried to talk to him and he pulls rank on us. What should I do as a lay person?\n\n* If God is unchanging, did he have a body eternally, and how does the incarnation relate to God being eternal?\n\n* I will be coming into the Church this Easter. How do I go about talking with my parents about my faith, who have been resistant?\n\n* How do we disprove reincarnation through philosophy if that's the best method for resolution?\n\n* What is the best way to explain the Trinity to younger students?\n\n* Is it wrong of me to no longer go to my parish and go to a different parish that seems to have more to offer in the way of women’s fellowship, bible studies, etc? \n\n* I heard that there was a recent article that states Pope Francis said that people need to have fewer children because of overpopulation.

The second is a singing call, in which I take a popular song and put square dance moves in it.\n\nIn both cases, the choreography and the rhymes, etc., are improvisational. I'm making it up, mentally, as I go--ahead of the beat so that I can get the words out in time for the dancers to execute the commands in time with the music.\n\nThis means the dancers do not know what is coming next, which adds to the excitement of the dance.\n\nIt's a challenge to do choreography on the fly, but I've been calling square dances for ten years now, so I've had some practice. :-)\n\nIf you think this looks fun, I hope you'll consider taking a square dance class in your area.

Scripture presents the work of the Creator symbolically as a succession of six days of divine “work”, concluded by the “rest” of the seventh day. On the subject of creation, the sacred text teaches the truths revealed by God for our salvation, permitting us to “recognize the inner nature, the value and the ordering of the whole of creation to the praise of God.” (CCC 337)\n\nOn the role of modern science . . . \n\nThe question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers.

    "title": "Were the Early Christians Pacifists?",
    "description": "There is a persistent claim that the early Christians were pacifists—in the strong sense of being opposed to all use of violence—and that it was not until the time of the Emperor Constantine that this began to change.\n\nAfter Christianity became the official religion of the empire, the Church embraced the use of military force, with St. Augustine playing the part of the enabling villain, who came up with the idea of the just war.\n\nThis story plays with well-worn tropes: the fall from original innocence into corruption, the idea that Constantine corrupted the Church, that the Christianization of the empire was a bad thing, etc.\n\nYou may notice that these same tropes are often used in anti-Catholic apologetics stemming from the Protestant Reformation. \n\nThat’s not surprising, since these tropes were needed to justify separation from the Church at the time of the Reformation.\n\nIt’s also not surprising that, relying on these same tropes, the denominations that historically have been strongly pacifistic stemmed from the Protestant community.\n\nMost Protestants, of course, are not pacifists and recognize the legitimate use of military force, and there is a good reason for that: \n\nProtestants are the majority in many countries, just as Catholics are in others, and so they have been confronted with the task of ensuring the safety of their nations.\n\nNo nation can be safe if it is unwilling to use military force to defend itself. If, in the present, fallen state of the world, a nation were to suddenly renounce the use of military force and beat its swords into ploughshares, it would suffer a dire fate.\n\nEither:\n• It would be conquered by its external enemies,\n• Its internal, criminal element would overrun it and turn it into a failed state,\n• Its more sensible-minded citizens would stage a coup and re-establish a government willing to use force to defend the nation, or\n• It would depend for its defense on another country that is less scrupulous about the use of force.\n\nAny way you go, pacifism is not a stable, self-sustaining enterprise. It’s a dangerous world out there, and pacifists depend for their safety and security on the generosity and good will of non-pacifists.\n\nPrior to the Christianization of the Roman empire, many Christians were not faced with the responsibility of defending the public and ensuring public order. As a result, some authors of this period had the luxury of entertaining pacifistic ideals without having to worry about keeping people safe.\n\nBut were they all in this condition? What about those Christians who were in the military?\n\nWhat about the era of the New Testament itself? What attitude toward military service did it take?\n\nIs the idea of a uniformly pacifist early Church accurate? Or does it distort what actually happened?\n\nHere’s a video in which I take on the subject.",

    "description": "Here are is the Catechism’s discussion of the conditions necessary for mortal sin.\n\n\"1857 For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must together be met: \"Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.\"\n\nAnd here is the passage from the Catechism of the Catholic Church on suicide:\n\n\"2280 Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to him. It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life. \nWe are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor and the salvation of our souls. We are stewards, not owners, of the life God has entrusted to us. It is not ours to dispose of.\n\n\"2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his life. It is gravely contrary to the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which we continue to have obligations. Suicide is contrary to love for the living God.\n\n\"2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example, especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of scandal. Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law. Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide.\n\n\"2283 We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. the Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives.\"\n\nAs I said in the video, let’s pray for all those who are tempted to commit suicide, for all those who have committed it, and for all those who have lost someone to suicide.",

    "description": "http://www.SecretInfoClub.com You sometimes encounter the charge that the Catholic Church wrongly \"changed the sabbath\" from Saturday to Sunday. This claim is often made by Seventh-Day Adventists, for example. But even if one isn't accusing the Church of wrongdoing, the question can still arise: Why do Catholics worship on Sunday rather than Saturday? Here's the story . . .\n\nWhat Day the Sabbath Is\n\nFirst, let's clear away a potential source of confusion. While it's true that people sometimes speak of Sunday as \"the Christian sabbath,\" this is a loose way of speaking. Strictly speaking, the sabbath is the day it always was--Saturday--though it should be noted that traditionally Jewish people have celebrated the sabbath from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. Sunday is a distinct day, which follows the sabbath. The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains:\n\n2175 Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared for the mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some aspects of Christ.\n\n \n\nWhy We Celebrate Sunday\n\nThat same paragraph explains why we celebrate on Sunday. For Christians the ceremonial observance of Sunday replaces that of the sabbath. Properly speaking, we're not celebrating the sabbath on Sunday. We're celebrating something else, but it's something that the sabbath points toward. As the Catechism says, the Jewish sabbath announces man's eternal rest in God and prefigures some aspects of Christ. Sunday thus fulfills what the sabbath pointed toward.",

    "description": "http://www.SecretInfoClub.com One of the distinctive Protestant principles is expressed in the slogan sola scriptura, which is Latin for \"by Scripture only.\" The idea is that every teaching on faith or morals must be directly or indirectly based on the Scriptures.\n\nThat leads to the common question, \"Where's that in the Bible?\"\n\nIt's an important question. In fact, it's a question that needs to be asked about the doctrine of sola scriptura itself. Because if every teaching on faith or morals has to be based on the Bible then sola scriptura must be based on the Bible.\n\nIf it's not, then it is a self-refuting claim and is false.\n\nSo what passages do Protestant Christians appeal to in support of sola scriptura?\n\nOne that is sometimes cited is Acts 17, which deals with an incident that happened when St. Paul preached in the Jewish synagogue in the Greek city of Berea.\n\nSt. Luke writes:\n\n\"[11] Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\"\n\nMany in the Protestant community have found this an inspiring story, and some have even named their ministries after the Berean Jews. If you go online you can find all kinds of Berean churches, schools, ministries, and bookstores.\n\nThe idea is that we should imitate the Berean Jews and take a skeptical attitude of theological ideas we are presented with. Instead of just accepting them, we should search the Scriptures daily to see if what we are being told is true or not. If it's not, then we should not accept it.\n\nIf that's what the passage means—if it is commending the Bereans for their skeptical attitude and refusal to believe a teaching unless it can be found in Scripture—then this would be good evidence for sola scriptura.\n\nBut that's not what it means, and it's easy to show that.",

    "description": "To get more great information, you should sign up for Jimmy's Secret Information Club. You should sign up for FREE at http://www.SecretInfoClub.com\n\nIf you read some older English translations of the Bible, like the Catholic Douay-Rheims (pub. 1609) or the Protestant King James (pub. 1611) you come across some passages that seem a bit mysterious. For example in the Douay-Rheims, in Psalms 91:11 we read: \"But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn.\"\n\nIn the equivalent verse in the King James 92:10 we read: \"But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn.\"\n\nIn reading such passages, you might think, what on earth does that mean? Well in these cases, the horn is being used as a symbol of strength or vigor. The Psalmist is saying that thanks to God, I'm going to be given a lot of strength and vigor so praise God.\n\nFine, but what's this stuff about unicorns? Does this mean unicorns are real? \n\nIn this video Jimmy Akin goes to the heart of the matter and reveals the startling truth about what the Bible might be referring to in these passages.\n\nFor more great information, you should join Jimmy's Secret Information Club at http://www.SecretInfoClub.com",

    "title": "\"To Be Absent from the Body Is to be Present with the Lord\"?",
    "description": "To get more great information, you should sign up for Jimmy's Secret Information Club. You should sign up for FREE at http://www.SecretInfoClub.com\n\n\nThere is a common argument used against the idea of purgatory in some circles which goes like this: \"St. Paul says that 'to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord' (2 Cor. 5:8). It's that simple: If you're a Christian and you aren't in your body then you are with Jesus in heaven. There is no room for purgatory in St. Paul's view. Purgatory is just a Catholic fable--a 'man made tradition.'\"\n\nIs this true?\n\nIt turns out that if you examine what St. Paul really said, the whole argument is based on a misquotation. St. Paul said nothing of the kind.\n\nFurthermore, if you look elsewhere in St. Paul's writings--to the very same church he was addressing in his \"absent from the body\" passage--you find strong evidence for purgatory.\n\nFar from being a Catholic fable, purgatory is rooted in the thought of the Apostle Paul himself.",

    "description": "For more great information, you should join Jimmy's Secret Information Club at http://www.SecretInfoClub.com\n\nIf God is all-good and all-loving, how could he send someone to hell?\n\nAt first glance, it seems that he would not. But God is infinitely higher than we are, and our finite minds can only grasp a tiny bit of his infinite mystery.\n\nTherefore, we need to check our intuitions about what God would or would not do against what we know.\n\nIn particular, we need to check them against what God himself has told us in his word.\n\nIn this video, Jimmy Akin takes on the question of whether God would really send someone to hell and shows that we must reject the simple answer, \"No, God would never do that.\"\n\nBut he also shows that the matter isn't as simple as saying that God \"sends\" people to hell.\n\nDrawing on the teaching of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, he reveals the real reason that people \"go to hell\"--and the fact that we can avoid this faith as long as we open ourselves to God's love.\n\nNo matter what we've done, no matter how bad our sins, we can--as long as we live--always be saved if we turn back to God and embrace his love.",

It was in its own day, and it is in ours as well.\n\nSome try to draw lessons from it like everyone should speak in tongues upon their conversion to Christ . . . or that baptism is merely a symbol that does not convey God's grace.\n\nHow can one respond to these claims, and what are the *true* lessons that one can learn from this turning point in the history of Christianity?\n\nIn this video, best-selling author Jimmy Akin discusses the arguments and reveals both surprising and reassuring facts about the conversion of Cornelius. \n\nThis must-see video will prove eye-opening for Christians of all persuasions.",
