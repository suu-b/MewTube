    "description": "Ukrainian engineers are not saved from the dangers of the invasion. Excavators are by combat engineers to dig trenches for infantry to burrow in as shells fly overhead, which would otherwise take much more time and manpower to dig. These excavators are often directly targeted by the enemy, with FPV, artillery, and more targeting these machines as soon as they are spotted. This motivates defending engineers to only operate this heavy equipment when it's too windy or cloudy for drones to effectively work, while flanked by crews with drone jammers and shotguns. You must be on the lookout for those hunting you if you wish to dig.\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nPlease Subscribe, Like, Comment & Share the videos as much as possible, \nIt helps the channel more than you know \n ► https://www.youtube.com/c/DylanBurnsTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFind me on Twitch (Monday to Friday at 6PM EST) \n ► https://www.twitch.tv/dylanburnstv\n\nYou can also support the channel by donating\n ► https://streamlabs.com/dylanburnstv/tip\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCORD\n ► https://discord.io/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Official account) \n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Personal Account)\n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurns1776\nTIKTOK \n ► https://www.tiktok.com/@dylanburnstv\nINSTAGRAM \n ► https://www.instagram.com/dylanburnstv/\nPATREON\n ► https://www.patreon.com/dylanburnstv\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n#DylanBurnsTV #ukraine #ukrainewar",

    "description": "In the Ukrainian city of Kherson,  the \"Human Safari\" as many have started calling it, continues to take its toll. While some thought the Russian withdrawal from the city would mean the end of the worst the war has to offer, since Moscow retreated over the Dnipro river, the community has been attacked on a regular basis with semi-constant shelling. Before long, buzzing sounds dominated the air, as drones, grenade dropping and FPV, swarmed the skies above residents homes. These drones would dive at and eliminate not only military targets, but civilian as well. Video after video, often released by Russian drone pilots themselves, show people riding bikes, driving civilian cars, city workers, ambulances, firetrucks, and those walking down street, getting targeted by drones seemingly on the hunt for any signs of life. In order to better understand the \"Human Safari\" I traveled to Kherson to speak with those caught in the middle of these \"Safari\" hunts. Including victims of drone attacks, drone pilots, city workers, ambulance crews targeted during rescue missions, engineers preparing the cities defense, and more. \n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nPlease Subscribe, Like, Comment & Share the videos as much as possible, \nIt helps the channel more than you know \n ► https://www.youtube.com/c/DylanBurnsTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFind me on Twitch (Monday to Friday at 6PM EST) \n ► https://www.twitch.tv/dylanburnstv\n\nYou can also support the channel by donating\n ► https://streamlabs.com/dylanburnstv/tip\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCORD\n ► https://discord.io/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Official account) \n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Personal Account)\n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurns1776\nTIKTOK \n ► https://www.tiktok.com/@dylanburnstv\nINSTAGRAM \n ► https://www.instagram.com/dylanburnstv/\nPATREON\n ► https://www.patreon.com/dylanburnstv\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n#DylanBurnsTV #UkraineWar #HumanSafari\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:52 The Occupation Of Kherson\n3:34 Church Workers Interview - Kirill\n10:45 Russian Persecution Of Christians\n14:31 What Is The Human Safari?\n15:43 The Road Of Death\n17:03 City Worker Interview - \"Witch\"\n19:58 Store Clerk Interview - Natalia\n23:31 Second Witness Interview - Valentina\n26:46 Property Owner Interview\n27:58 The New Reality In Kherson\n28:42 Fighting Across The Dnieper\n30:02 Engineering Commander Interview - Sergey\n41:06 Drone Pilot Interview - Denis\n46:29 Medic Interview - Yuri\n58:38 Russian Videos of Attacks\n59:52 Drone Attack Survivor - Zoya\n1:06:35 Conclusion\n1:08:52 Credits",

He actively supported the attack on the first days through fire support roles, and crossed the border in order to press on the offensive. After being injured, and going on a short leave to spain, he still yearned to be back with his family. And so shortly after this interview, he deserted while on another leave in Spain to stay with his family there. While discussion this desertion with one Ukrainian solider that knew him, he said he was worth many men, and had done immense damage to the enemy while in service.

    "description": "The Battle for Bakhmut lasted a good deal longer than the Battle of Stalingrad, despite the relatively low strategic importance of the small city. But in the time the city was fought over, it became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. But for those who fought for the city, it was more than a symbol. It was one of the most vicious battles the war has seen. Now that the battle for Bakhmut's Urban center has largely ceased, but clashes continue on its outskirts for its surrounding villages, it's a good time to reflect on the battle with those who fought it first hand. So I sat down with Yaroslav, an Ultra Nationalist Right Sector fighter who fought in Bakhmut first hand. In this interview he talks about his thoughts on western analysts wanting Ukraine to withdraw from the city, what it was like fighting the Wagner Group and its prisoner soldiers, Russian tactics, and more.\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nPlease Subscribe, Like, Comment & Share the videos as much as possible, \nIt helps the channel more than you know \n ► https://www.youtube.com/c/DylanBurnsTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFind me on Twitch (Monday to Friday at 6PM EST) \n ► https://www.twitch.tv/dylanburnstv\n\nYou can also support the channel by donating\n ► https://streamlabs.com/dylanburnstv/tip\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCORD\n ► https://discord.io/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Official account) \n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Personal Account)\n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurns1776\nTIKTOK \n ► https://www.tiktok.com/@dylanburnstv\nINSTAGRAM \n ► https://www.instagram.com/dylanburnstv/\nPATREON\n ► https://www.patreon.com/dylanburnstv\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n#DylanBurnsTV #UkraineWar #bakhmut \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:46 What is fighting in Bakhmut like?\n4:32 Wagner Group and fighting tactics\n14:43 Weapons needed to fight Russia\n18:28 The cost of war and Post-war Ukraine\n22:16 Closing credits",

They allow for donors to write custom messages of their choosing on shells fired at the Russian army. This has led to a lot of Internet memes, jokes, holiday messages, and more being written on deadly packages launched towards Russian soilders. This has been very successful, and has led to the NGO raising over 1.4 million dollars for Ukraine and it's defenders. So I decided to travel to central Ukraine, where the operation is based, in order to interview the people behind the operation. We explored the history of signing shells, how the operation started, read some of the funniest messages, and even asked about detractors who oppose the fundraising method.\n\nSignmyrocket website: https://signmyrocket.com/\n\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nPlease Subscribe, Like, Comment & Share the videos as much as possible, \nIt helps the channel more than you know \n ► https://www.youtube.com/c/DylanBurnsTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFind me on Twitch (Monday to Friday at 6PM EST) \n ► https://www.twitch.tv/dylanburnstv\n\nYou can also support the channel by donating\n ► https://streamlabs.com/dylanburnstv/tip\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nDISCORD\n ► https://discord.io/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Official account) \n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurnsTV\nTWITTER (Personal Account)\n ► https://twitter.com/DylanBurns1776\nTIKTOK \n ► https://www.tiktok.com/@dylanburnstv\nINSTAGRAM \n ► https://www.instagram.com/dylanburnstv/\nPATREON\n ► https://www.patreon.com/dylanburnstv\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n#DylanBurnsTV #SignMyRocket #ukrainewar \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nEdited by @highprogressive \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nTimestamps\n0:00 What is SignMyRocket?\n3:29 To Meme Headquarters in Cherkasy\n7:59 Anton Starts His Deadly Postal Empire\n14:10 The Commercialization of Violence\n19:01 Ukrainian Message to the World",
