    "description": "Buy The MANSCAPED® Skin Ultra Advanced Kit Today: https://www.manscaped.com/products/mens-advanced-skincare-set\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSFOWOgB_s52kkhzRaCS2gQ\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/manscaped/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/manscaped/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/manscaped/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/manscaped/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@manscaped\nOur Blog: https://www.manscaped.com/blogs/\n\nSay goodbye to basic skincare and hello to the Skin Ultra™ Advanced Skincare Kit – the latest innovation from MANSCAPED®, made specifically for the modern man.\n\n💥 What’s Inside the Kit?\n✔️ Face Wash – Deep-cleansing, hydrating, and perfect for daily use\n✔️ Face Moisturizer – Lightweight, non-greasy hydration that lasts\n✔️ Face Buffer Pro – A powerful electric face scrubber that exfoliates and deep-cleans\n✔️ A complete skincare routine designed to fight oil, dirt, and dullness\n\nWhether you're new to skincare or leveling up your routine, this all-in-one system is your go-to for a cleaner, fresher, healthier-looking face.\n\n✨ Why It Works:\n• Dermatologist-tested, made for sensitive skin\n• Helps reduce breakouts and irritation\n• Designed for men’s unique skin needs\n\n🔔 Don’t just wash your face — treat it. Watch now to learn how to use each product for maximum results.\n\nHow To Use The New Advanced Skincare Kit:\n\n0:00 Welcome to the world of skincare with MANSCAPED, we’re in the business of man care. Introducing our new Skin Ultra™– Advanced Skincare Kit for Men.\n\n0:09 Step #1: First we cleanse, and by that I mean we wash our face with Skin Ultra™ Face Wash. This gentle exfoliating AHA complex removes dead skin cells, revealing brighter, smoother skin. Trust me, that’s a good thing. \n\nApply one pump to damp hands, OR for a deep clean, apply it directly to The Face Buffer Pro. Thanks to testosterone, men have thicker skin then women. This premium electric face scrubber allows you to choose from 3 cleansing modes: 1.) Dual Action Cleanse Mode, 2.) Daily Cleanse Mode, and 3.) Exfoliating Cleanse Mode. Choose what feels best for your skin.\n\n0:48 Massage The Face Buffer Pro in circular motions across your face and neck and then rinse thoroughly. \n\n0:58 Step #2: Use our powerful Brightening Serum formulated to help illuminate and improve skin tone while reducing the appearance of fine lines and rings. Side effects = turning heads.\n\nAfter cleansing, apply 1-2 pumps to your face, then wait about 30 seconds for it to dry before continuing with the remainder of your skincare routine.\n\n1:17 Step #3: Now it’s time to moisturize, hydrate, and improve the look of your skin without the shine. \n\nApply 1-2 pumps of Face Moisturizer to freshly cleansed skin, all over your face and neck. That’s it, you’re done. You’re a skincare guy now!\n\n1:33 How to power on and clean your Face Buffer Pro:\n1.) Press and hold for 3 seconds to engage and disengage when the device is off.\n2.) Toggling between the 3 cleansing modes by quick pressing the power button.\n3.) To charge the device use the included USB-C charging cable which will bring the device to a full charge in about 90 minutes (for up to 75 minutes of runtime at full charge). If you run out of juice early, your Face Buffer Pro only needs a quick 5 minute charge to get you through a cleanse. \n\n#MANSCAPED #MaleGrooming",

How perfect? The two ball-loving, ball-saving, ballerific organizations came together to create a new special edition trimmer, The Lawn Mower 5.0 Ultra TCS Edition. Let’s dive into the new colorway and device features!\nHow To Use The Lawn Mower 5.0 Ultra TCS Edition:\n\n0:00 Intro to MANSCAPED + Testicular Cancer Society Partnership for The Lawn Mower 5.0 TCS Edition Ball Trimmer \n0:18 Get a glimpse into the updated colorway for the TCS edition to get a glimmering reminder to check yourself for testicular cancer (every month)\n0:38 Two-interchangeable blade heads for trimming or shaving your balls in whatever way you see fit along with comb attachments in purple. This allows for 7 possible length settings to get your ideal shave.\n0:53 Step #1: To attach a comb, slide it over the front of your trimmer with the notches sliding into the grooves. For adjustable combs, adjust the length by moving the notches up or down. To remove each blade head, push the bottom of the blade head with your thumb in the direction of the arrow. To install each blade, insert it blade side up into the slot at the top of the trimmer, then press down until it snaps in place.\n1:21 Step #2: Use the one-touch start/stop and easy to use multifunction button. Quick press the multifunction button to toggle between multiple LED light settings that are designed to match different skin tones to help illuminate where you’re mowing. Lastly, if you’re on the go, you can press and hold the button to set the travel lock so it doesn’t turn on in your bag.\nWhen you’re good to groom, just press start.\n1:50 Step #3: Once you start trimming, keep the flat side of your trimmer pressed flush against your skin and glide gently with your body for total control. (Pro tip, when you’re boys are extra clean, it’s time to do a self-test for testicular cancer.)\nWhen you’re shaving, try to prevent raking, instead move against the grain for a closer shave. Whether you’re shaving your chest, underarms, legs, or balls, slowly glide until you’re satisfied. \n2:26 Step #4: To clean the device, power it off and pop off the blade head and combs attached. This waterproof trimmer doesn’t mind getting a little wet. So with everything detached, rinse each piece under the faucet until all the hair is gone. When you’re done, shake off the excess water and lay them out to air dry.\n2:47 Step #5: Once dry, plug the included USB-C charger into the device and set your future self up for a full charge with up to 60 minutes of runtime. When charging, the LED indicator will blink and the meter will start to light up. A completely solid light bar indicates a full charge.\n3:06 Get The Lawn Mower 5.0 Ultra TCS edition at XXX today!

Because they’re magnetized, you can easily pull them off and put one of the other blade heads on effortlessly.\n0:26 Step 2: While The Chairman™ Plus can be used wet or dry, we recommend going in with a little Power Shave Gel before you start shaving for the best experience. Apply it directly on your face, or onto the blade head for some self-lathering action.\n0:39 Step 3: Turn on The Chairman™ Plus by pressing the power button once.\n0:46 Step 4: Grip the ergonomic handle in whichever way feels more comfortable to you. Some like to grip it like a dumbbell, while others prefer the paintbrush grip.\n0:52 Step 5: Once you’ve found the sweet spot on your grip, gently stroke your face in up and down movements. Let the blade head glide across the natural contours of your face while maintaining even pressure.\n1:02 Step 6: Get your final touches in with the precision blade (ideal for cleaning up lines for your neckline, jawline, and sideburns). Use the precision lock and tilt the blade head at a 90-degree angle to take advantage of the precision trimming edge. \n1:18 Step 7: After all that shaving, you’re going to need a cooldown. Grab Face Shave Soother and give yourself that post-shave reward. When you’re satisfied with your look and feel you can power down your shaver!\n1:27 Step 8: After powering down, remove the magnetic blade by gripping the device and pulling the blade head away from the grip. Gently shake out the hair from inside the blade head. After that, rinse the blade head under running water to get the remaining hairs. You can even power the device on while under running water to give it a more thorough rinse. Once you’re done rinsing, set it aside and let it air dry.\n1:44 Step 9: After your device is done air drying, reassemble it and charge it again before your next shave. When charging, the LED indicator will blink and you’ll be back to a full charge in 60 mins. If you run out of battery early, your shaver only needs a 5 minute quick-charge for a full shave. \n\nWhat is The Chairman™ Pro?\nStroke your chin with a new-found accuracy.

In this video, we’ll show you how to use The Chairman™ Pro Foil Shaver. Follow our step-by-step guide to get the most out of your shaver, ensuring a smooth, close, and comfortable shave every time. Discover tips and techniques to elevate your grooming routine with The Chairman™ Pro.\nHow To Use The Chairman™ Pro \n0:06 Step 1: Choose your blade head (foil vs. stubble). Whether you’re looking for a smoother, closer shave or you’re into leaving a little stubble behind. One of these interchangeable blade heads will have you covered. \n0:30 Step 2: While The Chairman™ Pro can be used wet or dry, we recommend going in with a little Power Shave Gel before you start shaving for the ultimate experience. Apply it directly on your face, or onto the blade head to get started.\n0:43 Step 3: Turn on The Chairman™ Pro by pressing the power button once.\n0:47 Step 4: Grip the ergonomic handle in whichever way feels more comfortable to you. \n0:55 Step 5: Once you’ve found the sweet spot on your grip, gentle stroke your face in up and down movements and repeat as necessary until you’ve perfected your shave.\n1:23 Step 6: Get your final touches in with the precision blade. Use the precision lock and tilt the blade head at a 90-degree angle to take advantage of the precision trimming edge. Turn on the LED spotlight to help see any hard to reach areas or flat laying hairs.\n1:41 Step 7: After all that shaving, you’re going to need a cooldown. Grab Face Shave Soother and give yourself that post-shave reward. Power down your device once you’re done!\n1:50 Step 8: Remove the magnetic blade by gripping the device and pulling the blade head away from the grip. Gently shake out the hair from inside the blade head. After that, rinse the blade head under running water to get the remaining hairs. You can even power the device on while under running water to give it a more thorough rinse. Once you’re done rinsing, set it aside and let it air dry.\n2:05 Step 9: After your device is done air drying, reassemble it and charge it again before your next shave. When charging, the LED indicator will blink and you’ll be back to a full charge in 60 mins. If you run out of battery early, your shaver only needs a 5 minute quick-charge for a full shave. Last but not least, The Chairman™ Pro can also be charged wirelessly!\n\nWhat is The Chairman™ Pro?\nStroke your chin with a new-found accuracy. Two interchangeable blade heads give you a gentle, precise shave, whether you want a smooth face or perfectly chiseled stubble.

    "description": "In an effort to uniquely showcase MANSCAPED's ethos and promote good male hygiene, our unmatched creative talent designed a takeover of attention-grabbing and perfectly comedic signage that is now displayed in several men’s restrooms throughout Levi’s Stadium. A series of wall posters are positioned above over 250 urinals, as well as large scale wall signage at the entrance and exit of the restrooms’ interiors. The concept of these collective 265 designs? An enthusiastic and seemingly stern football referee calling out an important area of concern: grooming violations. Text overlays of original catchphrases accompany the captivating stills; think: “Holding. The wrong trimmer.”; “Offensive patch interference.”; “Too many hairs on the field.”; and “Delay of groom.”",
