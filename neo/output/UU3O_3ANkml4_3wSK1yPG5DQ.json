    "description": "Watch part 1 here: https://youtu.be/itRV2jEtV8Q\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Here, every pixel is also \"next to\" itself, and we are counting ordered pairs of neighboring pixels whereas in the previous video we counted unordered pairs. This is just to make the formula nicer, but if we counted unordered pairs here (and multiplied by 4/V instead of 2/V) then we would get the same result in the end, since the discrepancy would be of constant size (much smaller than log V).\n\n2. This version of Stirling's approximation actually follows from a stronger fact which was first discovered by Abraham de Moivre. Stirling's contribution was to find the exact constant in the previously-known approximation (which only posited the existence of some constant).\n\n3. Technically, O(log V) is a stand-in for some quantity which is bounded above and below by A log V and -A log V, for some fixed constant A which does not depend on V.\n\n4. To be precise, it is exponentially unlikely to observe any density which is greater than some fixed epsilon away from the maximizing density. To prove this using the result from the video, it's important that there are only polynomially-many different values that d can take, since dV must be an integer.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nResources:\n\nAnother recent video which goes more in-depth on the definition of temperature and even derives the heat capacity of an ideal gas is the following video by Joseph Newton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRPv4rd_6O4\n\nFor a rigorous and accessible introduction to this subject, check out the book \"Statistical mechanics of lattice systems\" by Sacha Friedli and Yvan Velenik: https://www.unige.ch/math/folks/velenik/smbook/\n\nTo go much deeper into the lattice case (i.e. not the mean-field version in this video) and get an idea of how to actually do mathematical analysis in this case (which was mostly skipped in this video series), look at the notes \"Lectures on the Ising and Potts models on the hypercubic lattice\" by Hugo Duminil-Copin: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00520\n\nFor more on on the algorithms used in this video series, a good primer is the book \"Markov chains and mixing times\" by David Levin, Yuval Peres, and Elizabeth Wilmer: https://pages.uoregon.edu/dlevin/MARKOV/mcmt2e.pdf\n\nGenerally, the resources linked above assume some familiarity with the basics of probability theory at the graduate/advanced undergraduate level. Some good textbooks on probability include \"Probability: theory and examples\" by Rick Durrett: https://sites.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf, and \"Modern discrete probability\" by Sebastien Roch: https://people.math.wisc.edu/~roch/mdp/index.html\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nChapters:\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:22 - Forgetting the geometry (mean-field approximation)\n4:12 - MCMC simulation of mean-field model\n5:10 - Setting a goal for the video (finding the most likely density)\n6:28 - Deriving the probability of a particular density\n8:24 - Stirling's approximation\n10:40 - Writing the phase diagram as an optimization problem\n11:47 - Seeing how optimization can lead to phase transition\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis video was made by Vilas Winstein",

    "description": "[CLARIFICATIONS AND CORRECTIONS]\n\nClarification at 2:50 – \"probability mass\" just means the probability of a particular outcome.\n\nClarification at 6:41 – This is also because the events which bear witness to the distance being high after only a few shuffles are complicated, like the one described in the skit, and so they can’t really be seen in the gameplay of most games (I don’t have a good source for this unfortunately). Also, the point of this message is not to say that you shouldn’t shuffle more if you want to, but that you should not be too upset if someone else only shuffles a few times in a casual context. \n\n\n[CREDITS]\n\nVilas Winstein: black nails, script, animation, voiceover, editing.\nAnisah Awad: blue and green nails.\n\nSpecial thanks to Alistair Sinclair for teaching me about this subject.\n\nCard Decks used in the video:\n\"Playing Arts: Edition One\" (http://www.playingarts.com)\n\"Wildflowers of the Rocky Mountains\" (http://www.adventurepublications.net)\n\"Bees & Butterflies\" (http://www.adventurewithkeen.com)\n\n\n[SOURCES]\n\nBayer, Dave, and Persi Diaconis. \"Trailing the dovetail shuffle to its lair.\" The Annals of Applied Probability (1992): 294-313.\n\nMartin, Aigner, and M.

The Tracy-Widom distribution being discussed here corresponds to GUE, not GOE, but I found that a matrix of complex numbers wasn't as nice to look at so I cheated a bit with the animation.\n\n* Not every optimization problems over independent random noise is expected to have Tracy-Widom fluctuations, but many of the models that are expected to have such fluctuations can be phrased as optimization problems.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis video assumes that the viewer has taken a course in probability theory. I hope it is still somewhat understandable and enjoyable even without that prerequisite, but for brevity I needed to take for granted many of the concepts usually covered in such a course.\n\nFor more details, check out \"The Surprising Mathematics of Longest Increasing Subsequences\" by Dan Romik.

    "title": "Percolation: a Mathematical Phase Transition",
    "description": "—————SOURCES————————————————————————\n\nPercolation – Béla Bollobás and Oliver Riordan\nCambridge University Press, New York, 2006.\n\nSixty Years of Percolation – Hugo Duminil-Copin\nhttps://www.ihes.fr/~duminil/publi/2018ICM.pdf\n\nPercolation – Geoffrey Grimmett\nvolume 321 of Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences]. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, second edition, 1999.\n\n\n—————NOTES—————————————————————————\n\nNote at 10:42 – The uniqueness of the infinite cluster is known for the d-dimenional lattice since the works of Aizenman, Kesten and  Newman - [Uniqueness of the infinite cluster and continuity of connectivity functions for short and long range percolation (1987)] and Burton and Keane - [Density and uniqueness in percolation (1989)]. It does not hold in general: when the graph in question is a regular tree for example, there are always infinitely many clusters during the supercritical phase. \n\nThe two last results shown here are only known for site percolation (in which vertices are open or closed instead of edges) in the triangular lattice, where a scaling limit for the boundaries of critical clusters was proved to exist (more on that in the third note). It is believed that these results are universal, that is, valid in great generality for planar percolation processes near criticality.\n\nThe third result is from an appendix by Gábor Pete in the paper [Scaling limits for the threshold window: When does a monotone Boolean function flip its outcome? (2017)] by Ahlberg and Steif. Consider an n by n box, and the event where there exists a left-right crossing of said box. Recall the uniform coupling from the video: intuitively, the result is saying that the point at which this crossing emerges in the uniform coupling is with high probability inside an interval of size n^{-3/4} around 1/2.\n\nThe fourth result is saying that the average size of the cluster of the origin (or any other given point) goes to infinity as we let p approach the critical parameter like a specific power of the distance between  p and p_c. This power is called a critical exponent. The existence of these exponents was proved by Smirnov and Werner in the paper [Critical exponents for two-dimensional percolation (2001)].\n\nNote at 10:52 – Hugo Duminil-Copin has several major contributions to the study of processes arising in statistical physics, including Bernoulli percolation. Among his works on Ising and Ising-like processes we can cite [Random Currents and Continuity of Ising Model’s Spontaneous Magnetization (2015)] with Aizenman and Sidoravicius and [Sharp phase transition for the random-cluster and Potts models via decision trees (2019)] with Raoufi and Tassion.\n\nNote at 12:38 – In the triangular lattice site percolation, Stanislav Smirnov proved the conformal invariance of crossing probabilities at criticality (see https://www.unige.ch/~smirnov/papers/icmp-final.pdf for an overview), which led to the proof of the existence of scaling limits of exploration curves as  Schramm–Loewner evolution processes. See [Critical percolation in the plane (2009)] by Smirnov. This provided a deep understanding of the critical phase in the triangular lattice site percolation, which to this day is not extended to the square lattice.\n\nNote at 17:52 – It is not at all obvious that the probability of being connected to infinity is continuous above criticality. This result can be proved in the d-dimenional hypercubic lattices using the uniqueness of the infinite cluster, and more generally it was proved for transitive graphs (intuitively, graphs in which all vertices look the same) by  Häggström, Peres and Schonmann in [Percolation on transitive graphs as a coalescent process: Relentless merging followed by simultaneous uniqueness (1999)].\n\n\n—————SECTIONS———————————————————————\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:37 Definition – Bernoulli Percolation\n5:23 Definition – Uniform Coupling\n7:56 Exploration – High-Resolution Square Grid\n9:40 Exploration – Questions and Kesten's Theorem\n10:58 Exploration – Ising Model\n11:54 Exploration – Critical Percolation\n12:50 Exploration – Three-Dimensional Cubic Lattice and Beyond\n14:13 Proof – Theorem Statement\n15:14 Proof – Simplifications\n16:29 Proof – Definition of Critical Parameter\n18:41 Proof – Critical Parameter is Greater Than Zero\n20:44 Proof – Duality Definition\n21:56 Proof – Critical Parameter is Less Than One\n25:16 Proof – Summary and Idea for Kesten's Theorem\n26:11 Conclusion\n\n\n—————CREDITS————————————————————————\n\nCaio Alves – writing, 3D animation\nAranka Hrušková – writing, clarinet\nVilas Winstein – writing, 2D animation, editing, voice-over\n\nSpecial thanks to Anisah Awad, Gábor Pete, Jyotsna Sreenivasan, Angie Zavala\n\nThis video is an entry in the second Summer of Mathematics Exposition (#SoME2)\n\nThe photographs used in this video are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en",
