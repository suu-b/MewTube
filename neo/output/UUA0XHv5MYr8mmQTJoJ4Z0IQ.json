Among its many controversial and heretical claims, there is one that stands out: Nietzsche says Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who oversaw the trial of Jesus and his crucifixion, is the only character in the New Testament worthy of honor. \n\nWhy is that? Because in Nietzsche's view, he enriched the New Testament \"with the only saying that has any value\"; his famous question to Jesus: \"what is truth?\"\n\nFor Nietzsche, this sentence is at once the destruction of Christianity. And in light of Nietzsche's later philosophy, it is also an indictment of philosophy itself. \n\nFirst, Nietzsche has an idiosyncratic view of the person of Jesus and the composition of the Gospels. In short, he believes that much of the Gospels consists of additions and mythologizations by the disciples of Jesus, who, in their quest for revenge against those who crucified their Master, ascribed to Jesus attitudes and ideas that were absent in Jesus himself. Most notably, Jesus never speaks in terms of absolute truth but always exists in the strange space between yes and no, such as when he says to render undo Caesar what is Caesar's. But it's with the Apostles that terms like reward, punishment, saved versus damned, sinfulness versus blessedness... truth versus lie come into the fold. It's Nietzsche's conviction that Jesus never intended to start a religion or to relay dogma, but to bequeath to mankind a new way of life. His disciples however, greatly misunderstood him. \n\nHence Pilate's question, is at once a kind of pre-emptive destruction of what Christianity became under the influence of the Apostles: a new religion was created, with a set of dogmas to follow. Pilate pre-emptively sowed the seeds of its destruction with his quip, asking would-be Christians \"what is truth?\"\n\nSecond, Nietzsche sees in Pilate a fore-runner for himself. Pilate took a local, historical, political quarrel (\"should I sentence this Jesus fellow or not?\") and turned it into a philosophical quarrel. What is truth? For Nietzsche, this is a deeply profound statement, as Nietzsche more and more starts to question the value of truth itself, just like Pilate seemed to do 2000 years ago. For Nietzsche, the \"will to truth\" is the last \"prejudice of the philosopher\", the last unquestioned presupposition that we all uncritically accept as self-evidently true. It's worthwhile to pursue truth, that's what all philosophy tries to do, after all. But Nietzsche asks: is it really? Why do we prefer truth? Why not rather untruth? In this, he sees a kindred spirit in Pilate, who utters the only \"philosophical phrase\" in the whole New Testament, and for added dramatic effect, he asks the question to the personification of Truth himself: Jesus Christ.",

He had over 100 books on ghosts, magic, hypnotism, sleepwalking, dreams, etc. in his personal library. \n\nThis fascination he wisely kept out of his main work of philosophy, The World as Will and Representation, but in his collection of essays, we find a veritable philosophy of \"spirit apparitions.\" \n\nSchopenhauer is characteristically modest in this essay and offers a first step towards a more complete philosophy of the paranormal. Because he is convinced that belief in ghosts is innate in humans, and therefore, if a philosophy claims to explain the whole world and every possible experience, these human, all-too-human experiences must find a place in it also.\n\nHe makes a connection with dreams, and posits that ghosts could potentially have an ideal existence (ideal as in, from transcendental idealism) as opposed to a materialist or spiritualist existence.\n\nHow does that work? Through an organ in the brain that he calls the dream organ... Because dreams prove that the brain is capable of generating images without any external stimuli. In going to sleep, the brain switches between modes: it goes from dealing with the external world, to dealing with the internal world. \n\nThere is an in-between moment though, when this switch happens. And there is were ghost apparitions come in. You make the room dark and quiet, the brain directs energy away from the processes that take care of the external world, and it focuses on the internal world... Sometimes it can create visions, but imperfect ones: they have a dreamlike gauze, they disappear if you focus your eye on them, they have a translucent, ethereal sheen to them... Ghosts. \n\nThe subjective experience of seeing a ghosts is then mirrored in his philosophy because the subjective experience must have an objective counterpart in the Will. A ghost apparition then, requires two rare phenomena to occur together: two persons with strong connections to the world as Will who meet in the strange in-between zone of subjective and objective reality. How all of this works exactly, Schopenhauer isn't sure. But he is hopeful scientists of the future will figure it out...",

Ruthless, ambitious, and living for the here and now, Cesare is mentioned both in The Antichrist as well as Beyond Good and Evil, with rare Nietzschean praise.\n\nHe dreams of seeing someone like Cesare Borgia in the papal seat, and in Nietzsche's alternative daydream version of history, that would've spelled the end of Christianity as we know it.

It is what is says: a cross in the mountains. \n\nBut it sparked a huge debate culture war in Germany. The painting became the battleground for the so-called Ramdohrstreit, the Ramdohr Battle.\n\nThe painting was an altarpiece, yet it depicted a landscape. A huge faux pas: landscape painting was considered one of the lowest genres of painting. Totally unfitting for an altarpiece, which should show a historical scene (the crucifixion of Jesus) or an allegory for God (such as the Lamb of God).\n\nThe painting became a dividing line in a battle for the meaning of art. Neoclassicism versus Romanticism.\n\nShould art conform to timeless, objective ideals, or can art also be transformative if it has a strong subjective effect?",

    "description": "Support us on Patreon, get access to exclusive videos:\n▶ https://www.patreon.com/WeltgeistYT\n\nOUR ANALYSES: \n▶ Beyond Good and Evil: https://youtu.be/WIHXZUltfqk\n▶ The Antichrist: https://youtu.be/qej1Z8Qzq_c\n▶ Genealogy of Morals: https://youtu.be/6PUx4cOfFcI\n▶ Twilight of the Idols: https://youtu.be/YpVr_NEvWYA\n▶ The Will to Power: https://youtu.be/He6ZC7ZFBt8\n▶ Daybreak: https://youtu.be/cOL2z7nuXdA\n▶ The Joyful Science: https://youtu.be/U0fTBOJ-C_I\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis quoted Friedrich Nietzsche in his first encyclical, Lumen Fidei, a text he completed from a draft by Pope Benedict XVI. This encyclical, part of a trilogy exploring the theological virtues of charity, hope, and faith, cites a letter Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, where he contrasts the comfort and peace offered by faith with the bold, uncertain pursuit of truth through philosophy and exploration. By including this quote, the encyclical positions Nietzsche as a representative of modern rationalism, embodying the contemporary challenge to Christianity’s relevance in an era that prioritizes science, reason, and individual inquiry over traditional religious frameworks.\n\nThe inclusion of Nietzsche underscores a profound tension between two opposing worldviews. The Catholic Church, as articulated in Lumen Fidei, pursues a universal mission to promote the “common good,” seeking to provide moral and spiritual guidance for all. Nietzsche, however, is an elitist thinker who writes for a select few, emphasizing the individual—particularly the Übermensch, or \"overman\"—who forges new values and transcends conventional morality. In works like Beyond Good and Evil and The Antichrist, Nietzsche explicitly rejects the idea of a shared “common good,” arguing that what is common lacks value and that true greatness lies in the exceptional individual’s ability to create meaning and bend the world to their will. This stark contrast highlights not just a philosophical disagreement but a fundamental difference in purpose: the Church’s inclusive, collective vision versus Nietzsche’s focus on solitary, transformative genius.\n\nLumen Fidei further explores this divide by addressing the nature of truth. The Church advocates for an objective truth rooted in Christian teachings, which it believes can guide humanity universally. Nietzsche, by contrast, questions the very concept of objective truth, viewing it as suspect when applied universally. For him, truth is subjective, tied to the individual’s deepest convictions and creative power, as exemplified by the Übermensch. This perspective is reflected in his admiration for figures like Pontius Pilate, whose skeptical question, “What is truth?” in The Antichrist captures Nietzsche’s disdain for universal claims to truth and his celebration of individual authenticity.\n\nDespite his atheism and critique of Christianity, Nietzsche acknowledges the societal role of religion in shaping values and culture, as discussed in texts like On the Genealogy of Morality and Beyond Good and Evil. His famous declaration, “God is dead,” reflects not a personal triumph but a cultural observation about the decline of religious authority in the modern world. Lumen Fidei uses Nietzsche’s ideas to frame the challenges facing Christianity in a rational, post-Enlightenment era, where appeals to biblical authority or traditional teachings no longer hold the unchallenged sway they once did. The encyclical grapples with how Christian faith can still serve the common good in a world increasingly skeptical of absolute truths.\n\nUltimately, the dialogue between Pope Francis and Nietzsche in Lumen Fidei reveals a deeper question about human existence: “How should we live?” For the Catholic Church, this is a universal question, answered through shared faith and objective truth. For Nietzsche, it is an individual pursuit, answered through personal authenticity and the rejection of collective norms. This contrast not only illuminates the philosophical stakes of their encounter but also underscores the enduring relevance of Nietzsche’s challenge to modern Christianity.",

Support us on Patreon, get access to exclusive videos:\n▶ https://www.patreon.com/WeltgeistYT\n\nOUR ANALYSES: \n▶ Beyond Good and Evil: https://youtu.be/WIHXZUltfqk\n▶ The Antichrist: https://youtu.be/qej1Z8Qzq_c\n▶ Genealogy of Morals: https://youtu.be/6PUx4cOfFcI\n▶ Twilight of the Idols: https://youtu.be/YpVr_NEvWYA\n▶ The Will to Power: https://youtu.be/He6ZC7ZFBt8\n▶ Daybreak: https://youtu.be/cOL2z7nuXdA\n▶ The Joyful Science: https://youtu.be/U0fTBOJ-C_I\n\nThis video delivers a hilarious and over-the-top analysis of Eric Carle’s children’s book \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar,\" framing it as a profound Nietzschean masterpiece. We playfully argue that this simple tale of a caterpillar munching through foods before becoming a butterfly is steeped in philosophical symbolism, particularly echoing Friedrich Nietzsche’s themes of \"self-overcoming,\" \"growth,\" and the \"will to power.\"\n\nIn this video, we propose that the caterpillar’s journey reflects Nietzsche’s philosophy, setting it against Schopenhauer’s \"Will to Life\" and Darwin’s survival-focused evolution. While Schopenhauer and Darwin emphasize mere existence, Nietzsche’s \"Will to Power\" insists life strives to thrive and expand—perfectly captured, we claim, by the caterpillar’s relentless eating and stunning metamorphosis. We highlight the caterpillar’s escalating appetite—from one apple to a lavish feast—as proof of its urge to transcend itself, ultimately transforming into a butterfly, which we liken to Nietzsche’s Übermensch (superhuman).\n\nWe also connect the book to German literary roots in this video, suggesting Carle’s time in Germany immersed us in Nietzsche’s ideas. We draw parallels with the Decadent movement, comparing the caterpillar’s food list to the sensory indulgence of Joris-Karl Huysmans’ \"A rebours.\" Yet, we argue the caterpillar surpasses decadence through transformation, aligning with Nietzsche’s hopeful vision beyond nihilism. Symbols like the egg (potential and rebirth) and the sun (a new dawn) are spotlighted as Nietzschean motifs, reinforcing the caterpillar’s philosophical arc.\n\nThe video wraps up with a cheeky nudge to re-read the book through this Nietzschean lens, only to reveal it’s an April Fool’s prank. Still, amidst the humor, we pack in an educational rundown of Nietzsche’s ideas—contrasting them with Schopenhauer and Darwin—while celebrating the caterpillar’s tale as a metaphor for growth and self-overcoming. Watchers are left with both a laugh and a lesson from this cleverly crafted video.",

He argues that life passes quickly, often unnoticed until old age, when we realize its brevity. Schopenhauer suggests that awareness of time’s flow can help us appreciate the moment and navigate life’s challenges with wisdom.\n\nChildhood (Mercury): Represented by Mercury, childhood is a blissful, rapid-moving phase under the influence of the clever and eloquent Hermes. Free from the \"Will to Life\" (Schopenhauer’s concept of an innate drive), children live in pure cognition, unburdened by desire, assuming good parenting shields them from suffering.\n\nPuberty/Youth (Venus): Venus, the goddess of love, governs this stage starting around age 20. The sexual drive awakens, dominating and distracting individuals from higher pursuits like philosophy. This \"devil\" fosters a \"moderate madness,\" driving social behavior and conflict as individual differences emerge.\n\nAdulthood (Mars, Planetoids): At 30, Mars rules with strength and defiance. Intellectual capacity peaks, though sexual distraction persists. By 40, the four planetoids (Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Juno) symbolize a stabilizing phase—accumulating wealth, knowledge, and domestic order.\n\nMiddle Age (Jupiter): At 50, Jupiter, king of the gods, reigns. This is the peak of genius, where experience and authority balance declining raw intellect, free from youthful distractions. It’s a time of independence and mastery.\n\nOld Age (Saturn, Uranus): At 60, Saturn, the god of time, brings awareness of mortality, slowing life with a heavy, lead-like quality. By Uranus (death), we transition from earthly to heavenly spheres. Schopenhauer sees death not as an end but a return of the Will, hinting at a cycle tied to life’s beginning.\n\rSchopenhauer concludes with a poetic lament about Neptune’s naming (preferring Eros to link love and death) and muses on death as a \"reservoir of life,\" echoing ancient myths. His essay, written in old age, blends pragmatic advice—like prioritizing health—with philosophical depth, offering a guide to life’s inevitable highs and lows.\nThis work, rich in metaphor and wisdom, serves as both a map and mirror for navigating existence, urging us to face life’s transient beauty and struggles with awareness and resilience.",

He critiques how different worldviews interpret suffering — from Christianity's promise of an afterlife for salvation to the pessimistic views of philosophers who see life as fundamentally negative.\n\nThe Strong vs. The Weak:\n* For Nietzsche, the strong see suffering as a challenge to be overcome, a test of their will. They affirm life, embracing both joy and pain as part of existence. Conversely, the weak succumb to suffering, often by complaining or seeking solace in narratives that justify or blame external factors for their plight.\n\nResentment and Complaining:\n* Nietzsche introduces the concept of \"resentment\" (or ressentiment), where the weak, unable to change their circumstances, resort to complaining as a form of imaginary revenge. This act of complaining provides a temporary sense of power, alleviating but not solving the underlying issues. He specifically critiques Christians and anarchists, seeing their ideals of equality as masks for this resentment.\n\nPsychological Analysis:\n* He argues that the weak invent value systems (like religious doctrines or social equality ideals) to cope with their powerlessness. These systems often preach equality not out of genuine belief in justice but as a way to level the playing field by pulling down the strong. This is a form of psychological self-deception, where the weak pretend to desire equality while secretly wishing to possess the power they criticize.\n\nLife Affirmation vs. Complaint:\n* Nietzsche contrasts complaining with his ideal of life-affirmation. He introduces the thought experiment of eternal recurrence from \"The Joyful Science,\" where one must imagine living every moment of life, including its suffering, over and over. Affirming life in this context means loving every aspect, even the suffering, which requires immense psychological strength — an attribute of his concept of the Übermensch (Overman).\n\nConclusion:\n* Nietzsche's philosophy suggests that complaining does not solve problems but rather reveals one's inability or unwillingness to face life's challenges head-on. Instead, he advocates for an active overcoming of obstacles, embracing life's hardships with a \"Yes\" to existence in all its forms, which he sees as the path to true power and self-mastery. This perspective is intended to push individuals towards a higher form of living, where one does not merely endure life but celebrates it.\n\nIn essence, Nietzsche's critique of complaining is not just about stopping the act but about transforming one's approach to life, from one of passive acceptance or resentment to active engagement and affirmation.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant.",

(His bulging crab-like eyes, for example, allow him to take a broader view of the world than those with normal, forward-facing eyes can... he says to his friend Crito.) \n\nWhat's so provocative about Nietzsche's statement is not the statement itself but rather that he uses it as an argument against Socrates. Isn't that the classic example of an ad hominem attack? You're ugly therefore you're wrong? \n\nBut Nietzsche goes deeper into it and uses the ugliness of Socrates as a springboard to critique ancient Greek culture - how Socrates and the Socrates Revolution was a symptom of decadence, of the ancient pre-Socratic Greeks losing their noble tastes, allowing themselves to be seduced by reason, allowing Socrates to convince them that from now on, they needed good reasons, solid arguments, for their way of life. The happy instinct of the powerful, that needs no justification beyond itself, now stood in need of a justification: good reasons were required for your beliefs.\n\nAnd the Greeks had Socrates to thank for that.\n\nFor Nietzsche, this is not a sign of philosophical enlightenment, but a sign of decay, of decadence, of a loss of strength; of weakness.\n\nMoreover, with Socrates, the way was paved for Plato, and his world-changing distinction between appearance and reality. The Greeks used to judge books by their covers, and Plato changed that. Now, there is this rotten, fallen, imperfect material world juxtaposed with a perfect World of Forms. For the pre-Socratic Greeks, this idea was not as forceful as it is today: appearance WAS reality. \n\nAnd only ugly Socrates, who could not compete with the strong, healthy, noble Greeks on physical terms, had to invent a kind of mental challenge: the tyranny of reason, and the prelude to the World of Forms where reason would reign supreme over all the rest.

Publication was delayed because not long after writing the work, Nietzsche started writing his so-called \"insanity letters\" (Wahnbriefe) to friends, which caused them concern for his mental well-being. He signs these letters as either The Crucified One or Dionysus, and claims (among other things) he has created the world and that the Pope should be shot.\n\nHis friends are concerned and send him to the doctor while they take control over the manuscript of The Antichrist. The book would not see publications for over half a decade.\n\nOstensibly, because they thought this book was written while Nietzsche was already mentally unwell and that therefore, it shouldn't be considered a serious work of philosophy of his. But actually, the book itself is very straightforward, sets out arguments in a neat, orderly manner -- totally unlike his later insanity letters. No, the book was more than likely withheld because of its radical anti-Christian contents.\n\nThe final page of the book, a declaration of a \"Law against Christianity\" was initially omitted from the work because it was thought to be a separate note that wasn't necessarily intended to be included. Later scholarship has proven that this enigmatic final page should indeed be part of the Antichrist, but even today many editions lack this concluding section of the work.\n\nIt was suppressed for its radical tone and anti-Christian sentiment. Why? Nietzsche is, characteristically for this period, hyperbolic and radical. He lists seven propositions, policy proposals, that together make up his \"Law against Christianity.\"\n\nIn summary, they are:\n\n1) Priests should be locked up\n2) Church services are an attack on public morality\n3) The birthplace of Christianity should be razed to the ground\n4) Chastity is anti-nature\n5) Associating with priests should be a crime\n6) Words like “God”, “savior” and “redeemer” should be used as insults, fit for criminals\n7) All the rest follows from this.\n\nThis video takes a deeper dive into each proposition Nietzsche wrote down here, and examines them in the light of his earlier philosophy. Was this final page the work of a madman, writing on the edge of insanity, or does it follow logically from his earlier work?\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant.",

And if you stare long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\"\n\nThis is one of most famous yet mysterious quotes by Friedrich Nietzsche. What does it mean? In this video, we try to offer an exposition of this aphorism, according to Nietzsche's own dictum that an aphorism is not understood at first reading, but requires an \"art of exposition.\"\n\nNietzsche claims that he is the only psychologist so far who has dared to venture into the depths of the human soul. Western society being so strongly influenced by Platonism and Christianity that we cannot look beyond our naive belief in opposites: good versus evil, truth vs lie, egoism versus altruism.\n\nHe harkens back to a pre-Platonic view of looking at the world, in the manner of the Homeric Greeks, before Plato and his \"Egyptianism\" sought to capture Being in neat concepts (ideas) instead preferring a Heraclitean way of looking at things: reality and nature being in an eternal flux of Becoming.\n\nSuch a worldview would go Beyond Good and Evil and beyond the naive belief in antinomies, and would pave the way for a new psychology of the depths, a psychology that reckons honestly with the dark side within the human soul rather than explaining it away as the result of ignorance or an imperfect representation of some Platonic Ideal, a corrupt copy of a copy of \"the Good.\"\n\nNo, says Nietzsche, the monster at bottom of many a human soul must be confronted honestly, and reckoned with as part of human nature. Only then will we be able to make way for the coming of the Superman.\n\nAs Zarathustra says, mankind needs to become more evil.",

For his transgression and theft of the fire, he was chained to a rock for all eternity as a vulture gnaws at his liver daily. Yet Prometheus undergoes his punishment with stoicism, and knows that ultimately, despite his suffering and pain, he had given his life a purpose beyond himself: alleviating the suffering of others by granting mankind knowledge. Byron's message is that we should all find something that makes us want to bear the vulture and the chain.\n\nFinally, Nietzsche saw in the Prometheus myth the origin story of Western civilization, contrasted with the Biblical origin story of Adam and Eve. Prometheus brings knowledge to mankind through fire, just as Adam and Eve brought knowledge through the fruit. But this knowledge, in both stories, comes at a cost. For Adam and Eve, it meant banishment from paradise and original sin for mankind. For Prometheus, it meant the vulture, and the knowledge of the suffering of the world for mankind.\n\nThus Prometheus continues to speak to the imagination of many different artists and eras who each find in his story another lesson we inherit, but ultimately the overarching lesson is this: the price for our knowledge as human beings, is that we become aware of the suffering of the world. And it's up to us to learn how to deal with that.",

    "description": "Support us on Patreon, get access to exclusive videos:\n▶ https://www.patreon.com/WeltgeistYT\n\nOUR ANALYSES: \n▶ Beyond Good and Evil: https://youtu.be/WIHXZUltfqk\n▶ The Antichrist: https://youtu.be/qej1Z8Qzq_c\n▶ Genealogy of Morals: https://youtu.be/6PUx4cOfFcI\n▶ Twilight of the Idols: https://youtu.be/YpVr_NEvWYA\n▶ The Will to Power: https://youtu.be/He6ZC7ZFBt8\n▶ Daybreak: https://youtu.be/cOL2z7nuXdA\n▶ The Joyful Science: https://youtu.be/U0fTBOJ-C_I\n\nPascal's Wager is usually presented online as an argument for God's existence - and it's just as quickly debunked.\n\nBut these debunkings often happen because people aren't informed about the context surrounding the wager. Blaise Pascal himself never intended the wager to be a proof of anything. He believed God could not be understood rationally and therefore that an argument that hinges upon reason (such as the wager) can never lead to true faith.\n\nSo when people say \"if you only believe in God for a heavenly reward, that's not real faith\" they are correct. But Pascal never claimed that it would anyway.\n\nThe other common counter argument is that there are thousands of possible religions. So the odds of the wager don't work out in your favor. Pascal forgot that other religions exist! Except he didn't - a considerable part of the Pensées (the book in which the wager appears) is dedicated to Pascal discussing why he thinks Christianity is the one true faith. You can disagree with his reasons for thinking so, but to claim that the wager itself doesn't work because of it, purposefully ignores the wider context of the book and presents Pascal as a naive shallow thinker who somehow overlooked the existence of other religions in a book about faith.\n\nUltimately, the wager is a pensée, a thought. A thought experiment meant to get you started on your religious journey. At least that's what Pascal intended. He laments that people don't think about the fate of their immortal soul at all, they just numbly go through life. But what is at stake in the afterlife, by necessity pales everything and anything that could ever happen in your earthly, finite, life.\n\nPascal's message is: start thinking about it.

Calling religions illusions, he maintained that they arise out of a child's need for comfort as it grows up in an increasingly hostile world as it leaves the parental bubble.\n\nThe desire for the safety of the father ultimately leads to what we would call religions today, often with god(s) as a father figure on central stage.\n\nMoving on from the individual to the societal level, religions are illusions that help maintain civilization by encouraging adherents to repress their most violent, primal instincts. \n\nFreud believed however, that religions would come to be discarded as their function is fulfilled by other mechanisms, by the advent of science and the further development of reason.",

In short, Nietzsche finds this ideal behind every big aspect of human culture: art, philosophy, religion, and even science.\n\nThe ascetic ideal is that which promotes a movement away from the material world, that which denies life and strips humanity of its uniqueness. The ascetic ideal is the precursor to nihilism.\n\nIn the Genealogy, Nietzsche explores this concept as it rears its head in religion (Christianity), philosophy (Schopenhauer), art (Wagner), and science (Darwin, astronomy). \n\nChatGPT and advancements in large language models and artificial intelligence, seem to fit the pattern of modern science whose trajectory Nietzsche criticizes in the Genealogy.\n\nScience took away our special place in the universe (Copernicus), our divine origin (Darwin) and now it threatens to take away our language (ChatGPT).\n\nMusic:\n\"Zombie Hoodoo\"  and \"Ghost Dance\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",

But in order to fully comprehend Nietzsche unorthodox sociology and psychology of the criminal, we need to take deep dive through his entire philosophy, and visit The Genealogy of Morals as well as The Antichrist.\n\nDécadence and the morality of custom take center stage as Nietzsche sketches a sociology where society domesticates man. It suppresses our violent instincts so that society can run smoothly. Better to be cooperative, well-spoken, polite, than an aggressive, violent brute.\n\nBut the suppression of these animalistic drives in man comes at a cost: it fosters a disease which Nietzsche dubbed décadence, and all of society, through the long march of history from the paleolithic, through Christianity, to now, has become sick with it.\n\nOnly some individuals retain a bit of their primal strength. Not fully internalized, not fully externalized. That is the criminal: the strong man made sick.\n\nNietzsche puts traditional sociology on its head: rather than the criminal being the odd one out, being the exception, Nietzsche says society is the exception, society is the sick one, the criminal the healthy one. Only that he has become sick because his environment is sick.\n\nThe criminal who loses the fight against society, succumbs to it, and internalizes his aggression and develops a bad conscience. But some individuals are so strong that they aren't changed by society -- they change society.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant. Thanks!",

So half a century after Nietzsche's death. Still, it caused quite a stir, with heated debates going back & forth over whether or not this book is authentic.\n\nThis video explores the crazy story of the manuscript, and how it ended up from a mental asylum in New York City.\n\nThe book is a counterpoint to Ecce Homo, Nietzsche's other work of biography. But here, the style is much more toned down. Nietzsche comes across as weak, a man completely exhausted by life, no power left, except to find rare moments of lucidity and write this book. Featuring thoughts on mortality, the afterlife, and shocking biographical revelations.\n\nIt also dabbles in Nietzschean philosophy. He claims he was wrong about Tolstoy and Schopenhauer, and above all, Jesus Christ. The book hints at a possible conversion of Nietzsche.\n\nAs a mirror-image of Ecce Homo, the book has some philosophical points to make. Mainly on the nature of good and evil, and the Christian faith. There is some critique of Karl Marx here as well (which is suspect, as Marx never appears directly by name in other writings by Nietzsche.) Other passages betray a Freudian influence.\n\nA curious little work well worth reading for any Nietzsche enthusiast.\n\nWith music from Kevin MacLeod\nhttp://incompetech.com \n\nThis video was sponsored by NordPass.",

Convinced that metaphysics, and thus meaning, were impossible, he ended his life. “My sole and highest aim has vanished. Now I have none.”\n\nIn 1801, German writer and playwright Heinrich von Kleist first came into contact with the Kantian philosophy. His critique of reason and its limits made a lasting impression on him. The young Kleist had been obsessed with finding the answers to the great questions of life, and in the Age of Enlightenment, Reason seemed to conquer all.\n\nHowever, Immanuel Kant published his Critique of Pure Reason in 1791, and argued that we cannot make definite judgements about the world-in-itself. Our knowledge must be confined to the phenomenon, not the noumenon. For Kleist, this was an admission that humanity’s highest goal would forever be out of reach: the answer to the meaning of life.\n\nLife seemed meaningless to him now, truth impossible, hope useless. In his despair, he ended his life.",

Reading the book, it quickly becomes clear that the title refers to being anti-Christian rather than being anti-Jesus, because Nietzsche speaks in terms of admiration for Jesus. \n\nHe blames the early Christians (the Apostles, and Paul specifically) of distorting Christ's message for their own political and social gain, introducing elements of ressentiment and will to power that were simply absent from Jesus's life and teachings.\n\nThis video looks at a passage in the Antichrist in which Nietzsche claims that Jesus was not a hero nor a genius. It's a reaction to Ernest Renan, a historian of religion who played a central role in what theologians now call the \"quest for the historical Jesus.\" A period in history during which scholars looked at the Gospels through the historical, not the theological, lens. It was a movement that sought to demystify the Gospels and separate fact from legend. Studying the Gospels as you would any other historical text, by critically examining its sources and internal contradictions.\n\nRenan, in his best-selling and hugely influential biography of Jesus, ascribed heroic qualities to Jesus (while also denying his divinity and ability to perform miracles.) \n\nNietzsche accuses Renan of being a lackluster psychologist and furthermore that to call Jesus a hero is simply a mistake. \n\nHe then proceeds to give his own account of Jesus's psychological profile: claiming that the undistorted message of Jesus is one of asceticism, a new mode of being, free from resentment, a superabundance of love -- quite the opposite of what later Christians would make of his life when they sought to claim some sort of victory over their Roman oppressors and introduced ideas like Heaven or the claim that the Kingdom of God is some sort of other world which will come to pass in a future time in a spiritual place.",

Nietzsche considers it necessary for a philosopher (or free spirit) to conceal himself. Both from others, and himself. From others, because a true psychology would be shocking to society, laying bare the 'black and deep desires' of man. We must dilate the truths of our inner world, make it more palatable. Hence; a mask.\n\nWe also hide from ourselves. Moral biases and prejudices, ingrained since birth, cause internal resistance when we dig too deep down into our soul. We may not like what we find. The mind creates defense mechanisms. Nietzsche here touches upon a psychological phenomenon that would in modern times be called cognitive dissonance or self-deception.\n\nHe considered his philosophical work to be start of a psychology of the future in which \"free spirits\" (his dreamed-of new guard of philosophers) would boldly dare go beyond good and evil in their examination of the human psyche, setting sail over morality into new territory, heretofore unexplored.",

But soon their spikes hurt the other. So they separate again. But then the cold forces them back together, and of course they end up hurting each other again.\n\nSo the hedgehogs ultimately find an equilibrium: far enough to not be hurt by spikes, close enough to be somewhat warm. A compromise that leaves them unsatisfied, but it’s better than nothing.\n\nSchopenhauer argues that it’s better to be alone, to be your own source of warmth. While also realising that such is not possible for the vast majority of people: humans are social animals. So he advises us to ‘keep our distance’ (he even uses the English expression.) \n\nThe video goes a step further by thinking about a possible Nietzschean perspective: seeking intimacy and friendship, knowing full well that hurt might result. \nWe can view the hedgehog’s dilemma as something more than a simple metaphor for human relationships. It’s a litmus test on how a person views life: full of suffering yes, but does that mean we should run from it, or embrace it? In this way it lays bare the biggest difference between Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.",

This is relatively late in his intellectual career, yet the Russian writer still had a profound influence on him.\n\nHe called Dostoevsky “the only psychologist from whom I had anything to learn” and read a few of his novels in French translation. The very first novel he read was Notes from the Underground, although in a botched, low-quality French translation.\nStill, it’s highly likely that Nietzsche got the idea (maybe even the word) of ressentiment from Dostoevsky. This French term appears 4 times in the book that Nietzsche read, and while inklings of the idea were present in earlier works, it was not until the Genealogy of Morals (written in 1887, so the same year as his discovery of Dostoevsky) that the word would take centre stage in his philosophy.\n\nDostoevsky describes the inner psychology of the Underground Man, touching upon themes of isolation, cognitive dissonance, struggles with nihilism, and most importantly (for Nietzsche) resentment. He describes the man of “heightened consciousness” who does not immediately strike back upon being hit, but plots and thinks and analyses his revenge instead. Out of weakness, perhaps, or simply because he thinks too much about the question of justice.\n\nIn any case, this lingering has nasty psychological side effects. Dostoevsky describes this man as a mouse, who hides in his mouse-hole and feasts on his own eternal spite. Over time he might even start to enjoy this wallowing in self-pity.\n\nThis describes almost to a T, Nietzsche’s idea of ressentiment. The condition of the slave, who cannot win from his masters (the strong) in the real world and therefore takes recourse in an imaginary revenge. This slave morality would ultimately give birth to Christianity and other so-called Hinterwelt philosophies. \n\nBut what Nietzsche admired most was Dostoevsky’s psychological insight into what makes us human. The portrait of the Underground Man is dark and deep, the type of psychology that Nietzsche first envisions in Beyond Good and Evil, the new “crown of the sciences”, a psychology that dares to leave morality behind and venture beyond good and evil.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant.",

It immediately split public opinion in half: hated by the academic world, embraced by the artistic world. \n\nHeavily drawing on the influence of Arthur Schopenhauer, it features the twin concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian as creative drives in the human spirit. Apollonian art representing individuality, restraint, delineation; plastic arts, as opposed to the Dionysian; exuberant, formless, ecstasy, emotion; musical arts.\n\nBoth of these creative forces reach an equilibrium in Greek tragedy. This work deals with how Greek tragedy came to be (borne from the Greek chorus), how tragedy died (featuring also one of Nietzsche’s earliest critiques of Socrates) and how tragedy can be reborn (through the Gesamtkunstwerk of Richard Wagner.)\n\nAlthough this work put Nietzsche on the map, he would later disavow much of its ideas while saving others. In particular, he would become disillusioned with Wagner’s art and turn against his former idol Schopenhauer. The metaphysics underpinning the entire work would also be discarded.\n\nHe revisioned his ideas on the nature of (Greek) pessimism and the role of art in a culture. Republished fourteen years after the original with a new foreword which includes a self-criticism, the work attained a unique place in Nietzsche’s larger body of work and philosophy.\n\nStill, the Birth of Tragedy stands as an influential work, if not in philosophy, definitely in art history and aesthetics.",

He praises Julius Caesar as his best tragedy, and calls Brutus “virtuous.” \n\nYet historically, Brutus was the prototypical traitor, even starring alongside Judas in Dante’s depiction of Hell, being eternally chewed up by one of Lucifer’s mouths. \n\nAnd even though Shakespeare has Mark Antony call Brutus “the noblest Roman of them all” at the end of the play, he does so for different reasons than Nietzsche finds.\n\nFor Nietzsche, Brutus did what he did to protect the freedom and independence of his soul. He killed Caesar not for the good of Rome, at least not on a psychological level. His real reason was that Caesar presented an obstacle to his independence. \n\nAnd, according to Nietzsche, no price is too high to pay for independence of soul. Not even the life of a friend can stand in the way. That’s what makes Brutus great. \n\nFurthermore, Nietzsche praises Shakespeare for portraying Brutus in a positive light, for not casting a “shadow of suspicion” on the kind of virtue that Brutus represents. A virtue of a different character than Caesar, who could also count on Nietzsche’s admiration. \n\nNietzsche’s philosophy is all about growth and self-overcoming, and Nietzsche has always championed the individual. Both Caesar and Brutus represent this struggle in different ways. Caesar for making his mark on world history through sheer power of will; Brutus for fiercely pursuing the directives of his soul, even to the detriment of his friend.\n\nThe true message of the play is not the death of Caesar, the nature of politics, monarchy versus republicanism, tyranny versus freedom, but about Brutus’ dilemma in choosing between his own ideals or the life of his benefactor. He chose the former, going against morality, and beyond good and evil.",

Generally, it’s agreed that Schopenhauer hates Hegel for personal reasons, but also for philosophical reasons.\n\nThe two men had a bit of an altercation when Schopenhauer had to pass an exam in order to teach at the University of Berlin.

Contrast this with Hegel, who was a philosophical superstar and world-famous almost immediately.\n\nBut philosophically, there are disagreements too. Hegel’s philosophy hinges too much upon history. For Schopenhauer, history was the polar opposite of philosophy: it focuses on the particular instead of on the general. For Schopenhauer, all of history is simply a manifestation through time of one underlying Will, with the Will itself being unchanging. Philosophy is the study of this Will. History is the study of the appearance, or manifestation. In this framework, Hegel makes an unforgivable category-error: he thinks he’s doing philosophy, but he’s actually a historian.\nHe also disagreed with Hegel’s general outlook. That history is the progressive realization of a fundamentally good ideal; history being the march of the Geist as it unfolds itself and comes to know itself, ultimately resulting in total human freedom. Schopenhauer disagreed that the world is going in a particular direction (being only a manifestation of something unchanging) but also he disagreed with the implied optimism of this philosophy of history. We’re not marching towards some ideal, we’re just here to suffer, forever and ever. Existence has no goal beyond this, let alone some rational Geist permeating everything.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant.",

At this stage in his life, he was a firm believer in the philosophy of Schopenhauer. \n\nHe argues that Hamlet is the prototypical Dionysian man: he has seen the truth; the world is a place of endless suffering. This realization, explained by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche with their metaphysics of the Will, paralyses him. \n\nIt explains why throughout the play, Hamlet is so hesitant to kill Claudius. This hesitation has been the subject of major debate. Freud blamed it on the Oedipus complex. René Girard thought Hamlet was paralysed because of his realization that violence begets violence, and avenging his father’s death would be harmful, not just. Existentialists argued that Hamlet is too spoilt for choice, being radically free in the world, and therefore opts to not choose at all, being overhwelmed.\n\nNietzsche argues that Hamlet’s paralysis is the default state of the Dionysian man, the man who looks beyond the veil of illusion that Apollo (the World as Representation) enchants us with. The Dionysian man sees the world for the place of suffering that is; irredeemable, endless suffering. No action can make things right. So why kill Claudius? Why do anything at all? Why even live?\n\nWhile Nietzsche only mentions Hamlet in passing, in this video we looks at the famous “to be or not to be” speech in the context of this interpretation.",

God as the source of truth, beauty and justice. What is good? Good is whatever is sanctioned by God. What is evil? Evil is whatever is prohibited by God.\n\nThe moral order had God as its foundation. Critically, the concept of God is transcendent. He exists not as a part of the world, but rather God exists outside of the world if you will, above it, beyond it. \n\nThat is what allows God’s morality to be objective: it’s sacred, it doesn’t find its origin our world with all its imperfections and contingencies. \n\nSo what is really at stake with the death of God, is not the disappearance of God himself, but rather the death of objective morality as such.\n\nScientific atheism had been preparing itself in the decades leading up to Nietzsche’s proclamation. Little by little, God had become superfluous: the world could be explained through the scientific method.\n\nEven worse, the place of man in the universe had been under constant attack. No longer were we created in God’s image, chosen by God to fulfil his divine plan. Copernicus robbed us of our central place in the universe, and Darwin gave us a worldly explanation for the origin of man: descent from an ape-like ancestor.\n\nBut what these scientific discoveries reinforced, is the idea that only this world is the real world. Confidence in the scientific method and its great explanatory power eroded the necessity for a beyond world. After all: we seem to be doing pretty well without it.\n\nYet, our existence in the material world is characterised by change and contingency. Everything is in constant flux, cultures change, wars are fought, empires are lost and won. Continental drift. Entropy. The expanding universe. \n\nWhere can we find something everlasting, something eternally true, a solid foundation on which to build our table of values? Where can meaning be found?\n\nNietzsche dedicates a few words to Schopenhauer’s reception in German philosophy, and he’s not positive about it. He mentions by name three philosophers:\n\nJulius Bahnsen\nEduard von Hartmann\nPhilipp Mainländer\n\nThese three were followers of Schopenhauer’s philosophy who critically engaged with it and let him influence their own philosophy. In this sense they are post-Schopenhauerian philosophers. But neither of these three, says Nietzsche, truly engaged with the most important question that Schopenhauer asked. They are not real pessimists. \n\nLet’s fast-forward to today. It’s been over 200 years since Schopenhauer first unleashed his philosophy upon the world, and it’s been over a 100 years since Nietzsche died. \n\nWhere are we now in regards to the fundamental question: what is the significance of existence? \n\nWell, we haven’t conclusively answered the question yet. And we probably never will. But the question has become more urgent than ever.\n\nIn a way, this question spawned the entirety of existentialist philosophy, which dominated the latter half of the 20th century. \n\nKierkegaard, the philosopher who is commonly credited with being the first truly existentialist philosopher, tried to escape Hegel’s all-encompassing system of the development of history. Looking at Hegel’s huge construction, his grand historical narrative of one concept evolving out of the other, the great march of the Geist through history, Kierkegaard asked himself: what about me? What about the individual? How do I fit in this grand Hegelian system? \n\nAnd while Kierkegaard stood firmly in the Christian tradition, and tried to reconcile these questions with the Christian framework, subsequent existentialist philosophers took its development one step further and tried to answer the question without the help of God. \n\nThen we arrive at names like Camus, Sartre, Heidegger, de Beauvoir, Jaspers.\n\nThe question still occupies us today, and it has even become a sort of cliché. We don’t really speak of the “significance of existence” anymore, but we’ve all heard the modern formulation: what is the meaning of life?",

Didn’t have anything more profound to say?\n\nWe can imagine the disappointment in the words of his friend Crito. After Socrates mentions the sacrifice, Crito asks him: if there is anything else. As if to say, “is that it? those are your final words?” But Socrates remained silent.\n\n\nAnd indeed, most ancient commentators don’t assign all too much value to these final words. They are mostly dismissed as the ramblings of a man who has just drunk lethal poison, babbling on about roosters in a moment of hemlock-induced delirium.",

Not only that, we must ask ourselves one of the most fundamental questions of all:\n\nWhat is the value of life?\n\nNietzsche’s fundamental disagreement with Schopenhauer lies in the answer to this question. More than just a theoretical question, the question ultimately determines our attitude towards life. Your answer to this question determines whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist. Whether you affirm life, or deny life.\n\nIf you know just a little bit about Nietzsche, you know where he stands on this question, and where Schopenhauer stands on this question. But what is more insightful, is figuring out exactly why these two great philosophers answered this fundamental question differently, and why Nietzsche changed his mind on it.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant.

We’ve covered his views on death and what happens after it, and the metaphysics surrounding it, in another Patreon-exclusive video on the channel. \n\nBut the quote at the beginning does illustrate one of Schopenhauer’s pet peeves, namely his dislike of rationalism and what we may call “crude materialism”, the belief that there exists nothing beyond the material and that metaphysics is useless or not quote unquote “real.” \n\nThroughout his writings Schopenhauer harps on the physicists who look down upon metaphysics and dismiss it as philosophical fables that have no bearing on the real world. These physicists argue that physics is all one needs to explain the world, and consequently that metaphysics is useless at best or harmful at worst.\n\nIn the Parerga and Paralipomena, a collection essays that serve as a supplement to his main philosophy but which can be read on their own, Schopenhauer penned down some remarks on the starting point of philosophy.\n\nHe argues that there are two possible starting points for any philosophical investigation. Either you take an objective starting point, or a subjective one.\nWhat does he mean by this?\n\nA subjective starting point is any philosophy that begins with the mind, or perception, or consciousness. The philosophy of Descartes is the clearest example, epitomised by the phrase “I think, therefore I am.” But Schopenhauer names Locke and Berkeley as examples, as well as Immanuel Kant, who, in his estimation, reached the peak in this subjective way of thinking.\n\nKant, like Locke and Berkeley but different in some key aspects, thought that the world is essentially mental, or at any rate, that there is an essential mental quality to the world. That’s why his philosophy is idealism. It’s transcendental because it differs in some important ways from the idealism of Locke and Berkeley, but these details need not concern us here. \n\nWhat matters is that Kant, Locke and Berkeley all assumed the world to be mental. If not entirely, then at least in essential part. This is why they chose, according to Schopenhauer, a subjective starting point for their philosophy.\n\nA philosophy of this kind will tend to focus on how the mind works and how it comes to knowledge of the world through its mechanisms.\n\nAn objective standpoint then, logically, is the opposite. This starting point takes the world, or nature, or matter, or the universe as its beginning. \n\nA philosophy of this kind will end up with a focus on the relations between objects, the laws of nature, the forces at work, the interactions between materials, et cetera. \n\nA philosophy which regards the material world as the only thing that is absolutely given will inevitably become just a form of physics, and indeed, up until recently people used the term “natural philosophy” to refer to disciplines which we would today call biology, chemistry, physics, and so on.",

Specifically, of course, the transvaluation of Christian values.\n\nAs the title of the book The Antichrist makes clear, Nietzsche sought a complete reversal of Christian morality. In order to establish such a new moral order, he wanted to overturn, or transvaluate, all existing valuations.\n\nIn other words, if Nietzsche is against Christianity, then what is he for? Well, logically, he is for whatever runs counter to Christianity.\n\nWhich historical periods can we turn to for inspiration for such an anti-Christian world order? Well obviously the period before Christianity, specifically pre-Socratic Greece. But also the Renaissance. The period in history that positioned itself opposite of the long, Christian Middle Ages, and drew heavy inspiration from pre-Christian antiquity.\n\nIn Nietzsche’s estimation, the Renaissance was an attack on Christianity, and a successful one at that.\n\nIn the Renaissance, Nietzsche found a complete reversal of Christian values.",

He lived in the 5th century BC at a time when Sparta and Athens went to war. He wrote down an account of this war in the work entitled History of the Peloponnesian War. \n\nNot only is this work considered to be one of the first scholarly works of history, it also cemented Thucydides as the father of scientific history. \n\nThe History is marked by an objective, detached, some may say cold, style. Thucydides wanted to differentiate himself from Herodotus, the other great historian of Antiquity, whom he accused of making up stories or embellishing his history. Thucydides wanted to be as objective as possible in his assessment and carefully selected sources and eyewitness accounts with a critical mindset. \n\nThese elements might give an early hint as to why Nietzsche admired Thucydides. His praise for the Athenian historian is a consistent feature in his work, from Daybreak to Twilight of the Idols, written 7 years apart. Scholars have noted that throughout Nietzsche’s works, amid all the praise, not a single critical note is raised against him. \n\nIn this video we’ll take a deeper look at this praise. We’ll go over Nietzsche’s assessment of Thucydides as it appears in Daybreak and Twilight of the Idols and analyse the relationship between the two through two famous passages in the History of the Peloponnesian War: the so-called Melian Dialogue and the funeral oration of Pericles.",

Nietzsche continually and repeatedly asks the same question: what is the meaning of ascetic ideals? He will find these ideals expressed in four domains: religion, philosophy, art, and science.\n\nNow, this final third of the Genealogy is ingeniously constructed so as to not reveal the answer to the question, what is the meaning of ascetic ideals?, until the very last sentence of the entire book. All the way throughout, Nietzsche is building up tension, tackling idols and representatives in religion, philosophy, art and science to slowly make his case and expose the different instantiations of these mysterious ascetic ideals until in the final paragraph of the book, he ties everything together and reveals the answer to us. \n\nThe most obvious instances of these ascetic ideals are found in religion. Indeed, one could argue, and Nietzsche basically does argue, that the entire point of religion is to foster an ascetic ideal in man. \n\nBut what is an ascetic ideal? Religion gives us the most straightforward answer. An ascetic ideal, generally, is that ideal which promotes a movement away from the material world, away from the here and now. Religions, in Nietzsche’s view at least, tend to show a general distrust of the material. In the case of Christianity, the material world comes second to the immaterial world, Heaven or the Kingdom of God. In the case of Hinduism and Buddhism, the material world is exposed as illusory or the cause of all suffering. This general distrust of the material is then expressed in specific commandments, almost all of which are geared towards a denial of the material. \n\nThis is the ascetic ideal as it presents itself in religion. In philosophy Nietzsche finds traces of the ascetic ideal starting with the Socratic revolution all the way up to Schopenhauer, so present in the entire Western philosophical tradition. In art, he finds the ascetic ideal most pronounced in the late operas of Richard Wagner, chiefly in his last work, Parsifal. \n\nBut what about science?\n\nWell, spoilers ahead, Nietzsche will attack science, or rather modern science and accuse it of being another instantiation of this ascetic ideal. But in order to understand this attack, we need to dig a level deeper.\n\nThe ascetic ideal is a principle by which movement away from the material world is encouraged. We saw the examples of fasting, abstinence, prayer, poverty and self-flagellation in religions. \n\nBut this movement is not just a withdrawal from the material world, it’s also a turn away from our material body, which is after all part of the material world. With the exception of poverty, which is directed outwards, most of these ascetic practices are actually directed inwards, focusing on the inner life and the physical body. \n\nThe ascetic practices of these religions are not only about the material world, but in a very literal sense they are about withdrawing from yourself by attacking the material vessel with which you exist in the world, that is to say, your body. \n\nBut the thing is, unless you believe in the soul or the spirit, your body is more or less synonymous with yourself.\n\nWhat is the meaning of ascetic ideals?\n\nFor Nietzsche, the ascetic ideals are not simply about hatred or contempt for the material world, but also about contempt for the self.\n\nBecause the cruel fact of the matter is, that the ascetic actually derives pleasure from his suffering. These ascetic feats that require so much willpower, even though they lead to a general state of weakness, are a source of pleasure, or to put in more Nietzschean terms, a source of power. Nietzsche’s grand thesis is that there is pleasure in contempt, pleasure in weakness, pleasure in being hungry, denying yourself food and drink, even pleasure in hurting yourself. This is the paradox that lies at the heart of the ascetic, who outwardly claims to chase neither power nor pleasure, in fact, he claims to chase the exact opposite. He has to derive pleasure from his hard lifestyle, because as an ascetic, it’s the only pleasure he is afforded. His will has nowhere else to go, he has no other way to vent his human desire for power. \n\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant. Thank you for supporting the channel!",

As a sort of sequel to Daybreak, it features many of the ideas for which Nietzsche would later become famous.\n\nBut when we look at the chronology, we see that the work was also released before his most well-known works such as Beyond Good and Evil, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Genealogy of Morals, and Twilight of the Idols and the Antichrist.\n\nAlthough that’s not the entirely true, because the Joyful Science has an interesting publishing history. The first edition of the work was released in 1882, while a second edition, which added a fifth book and a prelude and appendix with poems, came out in 1887. So in between publishing the first and the second edition, Nietzsche wrote and released his two most famous works: Beyond Good and Evil and Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\nAnd the additions to the second edition will sound very familiar to anyone who has read The Genealogy of Morals.\n\nSo in a way, the book we know as the Joyful Science functions as a sort of transition between the intermediate and the late Nietzsche. Many ideas that would come to dominate his thought in his later work, will find their first expression here. The two most notable ideas are the Death of God and the Eternal Recurrence.\n\nIn this series, we will discuss those ideas along with other central themes of the works. By the way, we have covered many of Nietzsche’s works right here on the channel. We have a full analysis of Beyond Good and Evil, On The Genealogy of Morals, Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, Daybreak, and Ecce Homo. Check the links in the description if you’re interested.

And why do people seem to derive some kind of pleasure from the act of complaining? Why does the simple act of blaming society, the world, or even yourself, for some kind of perceived injustice, seem to blow off steam?\nThese are questions that occupied Nietzsche, who sought to formulate a psychological framework to answer them. \n\nFirst we’re going to take a look at a paragraph from Twilight of the Idols which gives us an incomplete, but well-written answer. If the title of this video strikes you as provocative or sensational, rest assured that the contents of Twilight of the Idols are much worse. The quote at the start of the video is a good indication of this.\n\nNietzsche investigates the psychological type of the “complainer”, through the lens of two archetypes: the anarchist and the Christian. \n\nWhen dealing with Twilight of the Idols, it’s important to keep in mind that this work is simply very radical in nature, that Nietzsche generally doesn’t bother to be precise. He’s looking to impart some philosophical concepts of his in little linguistic bombs. An entire chapter is entitled “Maxims and Arrows”, sometimes translated as “maxims and missiles.” This is one of many indications that show us Nietzsche is trying to hit us with short bursts of insight which leave little room for nuance. The many allusions to “hammers” in this work are another example.\n\nThat’s why we shouldn’t let ourselves be bothered by the precise formulations in this work but rather try to unravel the underlying thought behind the words. We can avail ourselves of other works, and we will look at The Genealogy of Morals for further clarification, to flesh out the arguments in a more nuanced way.\n\nwe can explore the psychology of two types of complainers: the Christian and the anarchist. These are archetypical examples who serve as a stand-in for all types of other complainers. Nietzsche is fond of using this technique to criticise a behaviour, an idea, or even an entire philosophy and view of life: construct an archetype which has the essential qualities of the thing he wants to criticize, and then perform a psychological analysis of that type.\n\nSo what are these essential qualities? Well, first of all, surely, someone who complains must complain about something. \n\nThe main difference between the anarchist slash socialist and the Christian, is the object of scorn.\n\nThe anarchist blames others, or society, for his bad lot in life. The Christian hates himself.\n\nWhat function does complaining serve then? Like other forms of ressentiment, another such Nietzschean concept, the act of complaining temporarily gives people a rush of power. For a brief moment, you can allow yourself to feel superior. The anarchist temporarily exalts himself above society, and the Christian, by acknowledging his suffering, feels himself closer to God. In effect, it’s a tiny dose of revenge, a quick hit of a feeling of fleeting superiority. It’s all about will to power.\n\nThis video is sponsored by AtlasVPN.",

It’s decidedly more radical in tone than his earlier works. For a more nuanced take on Immanuel Kant, we need to go visit Nietzsche’s earlier writings.\n\nLet’s take a look at Nietzsche most sustained critique of him, the one we find in Beyond Good and Evil. It concerns one of Kant’s central ideas in metaphysics, his table of categories.\n\nThe table of categories is therefore a part of Kant’s answer to the questions: how does the mind work? How does it make sense of the world? How does it generate experience? It’s in large part his answer to the famous question: how are synthetic judgments a priori possible? \n\nNietzsche’s critique boils down to this: he accuses Kant of not saying much at all. \n\nNietzsche paints with a very broad brush here, as he is wont to do. But his argument is really that behind all the technical terms and expensive words, Kant is moving around in a circle and in fact not accomplishing much at all. He is going nowhere.\n\nHow does the mind work, asks Kant. And what is his answer? By a faculty of the mind. The mind works by virtue of a principle by which the mind works. It’s a non-answer.\n\nThe first part of Nietzsche’s critique centres around the circle in which he claimed Kant moved. Saying that Kant didn’t really answer the question at all, but merely repeated it. Like the doctor in Molière’s play. \n\nThe second part of his critique is not unique to Kant but rather a general point Nietzsche makes about all philosophy in Beyond Good and Evil, namely that each philosophy is merely a reflection of the personality of the philosopher who came up with it.\n\nKant asks the question: how are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\nAnd Nietzsche replies with another question: why should they be possible?\n\nKant had a very clear goal with his philosophy - he had already decided his destination. He wanted to build a bridge between the rationalism of Descartes and the empiricism of Hume, and in the process of doing so, save the possibility of scientific knowledge, a priori synthetic judgments.\n\n\nKant therefore stands accused of putting the cart before the horse. Rather than being a disinterested, cold, objective thinker, who will follow whatever path his philosophy takes him, Nietzsche accuses him of having already set a destination and then rationalising his way towards a path to that destination.\n\nKant wanted to save the possibility of synthetic judgments a priori, and therefore he found a way to do so.\n\nThis is the wrong way to go about things, as we are supposed to believe, and indeed we delude ourselves into believing, that philosophy is an autonomous activity that will lead wherever it leads. If we have a predetermined conclusion we want to arrive at, that is suspicious. Philosophy is supposed to be the discipline that will tell us, through investigation and deep thought, which conclusions are correct. If we presuppose a certain conclusion, we are skipping the entire philosophical process.\n\nNietzsche accuses basically every philosopher of doing this, including Kant. Most notably in Beyond Good and Evil he also attacks Descartes for doing the same thing. \n\nSo far we have only discussed Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology. But Nietzsche’s most vitriolic critiques are reserved for Kant’s system of morals.\n\nThe foundation of his critique is the same: philosophers come up with systems that are not the result of a dispassionate objective search for truth, but rather every philosophical system is a way for the philosopher to justify his personality, emotions or prejudiced beliefs. For Nietzsche, this is true in the realm of metaphysics, like we just discussed, as well as in the domain of ethics.\n\nKant’s ethical system became famous because of the so-called categorical imperative. This is a principle based on duty for which Kant developed three formulations.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant. Thank you for supporting the channel!",

Even though Nietzsche heavily criticises the priestly class, he has some kind of respect for them as they are at least in some measure successful in their pursuit of power, even if he detests the means by which they do so. The same is true of the saint, another type of human that features prominently in Nietzsche’s works and in a very ambivalent, almost paradoxical way, as if Nietzsche can’t figure out whether to hate or respect the saint, or do both at the same time. \n\nGoing back to the question of prayer, Nietzsche commends the priestly class for being able to devise a mechanism by which they exert power over the common folk: they literally shut them up by means of prayer. \n\nStill, there is more to unpack because the priest himself certainly feels the need for prayer, at least sometimes. \n\nIt’s not a black and white question of the cynical, secretly irreligious priest oppressing the naive believers with a ritual designed to keep them silent. \n\nNietzsche grants that even the priest, after a long day perhaps, might find some use for prayer, for “mechanical piety” as he calls it. \n\nPrayer actually serves a double function: on the one hand, as we’ve discussed, it’s a means to keep the people quiet. But the people themselves get something out of it too: to them, it’s a means of simulating a religious experience. \n\nThis is where Nietzsche the elitist rears his head again: the common folk, to him, are incapable of experiencing genuine religion, or an “elevation of the soul” as he calls it. Therefore, prayer is devised as a sort of mental aid, training wheels to the religious experience. But it is a kind of religious experience, and in that capacity, it’s better than nothing. It’s just that others, presumably, those with more intelligence, don’t need prayer to experience awe and an elevation of the soul.",

    "description": "SUPPORT US ON PATREON:\n▶ https://www.patreon.com/WeltgeistYT\n\nWATCH: Schopenhauer: How to Be Happy (all parts):\n▶ https://youtu.be/4Qv6OLWzMZo\n\nSCHOPENHAUER'S WORKS:\nParerga and Paralipomena vol. 1: https://amzn.to/3pK6xCj\nParerga and Paralipomena vol. 2: https://amzn.to/3jJa2p0\nThe World as Will and Representation vol. 1: https://amzn.to/3FPGkIj\nThe World as Will and Representation vol. 2: https://amzn.to/3FT0nFC\n\nIn volume I of his main work, The World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer makes the argument that poetry is more important than history as far as our knowledge of mankind is concerned.\n\nBut in volume II, he released a complementary essay in which he discusses his thoughts on the role and purpose of history in more detail, beyond the negativity expressed in the first volume. This second essay is altogether more nuanced and it repeats the main points of the first discussion.\n\nIn this video we’ll go over the essay and look at history through the lens of Arthur Schopenhauer’s philosophy. We do a lot of videos on Schopenhauer right here on the channel, including deep dives into his main work, so if his philosophy interests you, we recommend you subscribe to the channel and click the bell button.\nWith that said, the essay consists of two major parts.\n\nPart 1: Tearing history down, and;\nPart 2: Building history up.\n\nIn the first part, Schopenhauer will tell us what history is not. \n\nHistory is not science.\nHistory is not philosophy.\nHistory is not poetry.\n\nSchopenhauer argues that by moving from the particular to the general, science places itself above the world so to speak. Science, strictly speaking, deals in concepts. We speak of the ant species, not of each and every single ant. \n\nThe other sciences do the same. They divide the world amongst themselves, and place themselves above it. Chemistry tells us about the interaction of molecules as a general principle. The mind has no horsepower to contemplate every single chemical interaction ever — we conduct enough particular experiments in order to derive some kind of general knowledge about how chemicals interact. \n\nScience, properly, deals in concepts. Science is therefore general. Strictly speaking, it deals not with the world in a direct, experiential way, but it deals with the concepts and ideas we have extrapolated from the world. In this way, Schopenhauer says that science places itself “above” the world. \n\nThis allows us to expand our knowledge of the world, and it would be impossible otherwise. The generalisations we make, are the preconditions for true knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the higher up this ladder of generality we go, the further we remove ourselves from the real world, the more important the knowledge becomes.\n\nBecause of this, Schopenhauer ranks philosophy as a discipline as the most important field of knowledge. More important than science. \n\nIn the context of Schopenhauer’s philosophy, it’s easy to see why that is. Let’s go back to the ant. The biologist can observe a multitude of ants and notice how ants do everything in their power to continue their own existence and to procreate. A biologist who studies birds might come to the same conclusion.\n\nBut that’s as far as biology can go. We start with the particular behaviour of individual ants and we conclude that in general, ants seem to try to maintain their own existence and also to beget offspring. Likewise, we start with the particular behaviour of individual birds and we conclude the same thing.\n\nThere seems to be some kind of biological principle that says that all living creatures try to stay alive at all costs and that they try to procreate. \n\nBut why do they do this? We have reached the limits of biology as a discipline. In the limits of biology, we cannot generalise further.\n\nSchopenhauer believes that history must always remain stuck at the level of the particular - essentially dealing with facts rather than conceptions. \n\nAny proposed general concept in history, Schopenhauer argues, arises only because of our incomplete knowledge of the particulars at play, rather than there being objective conceptions such as in science.",

His main work, The World as Will and Representation, deals with politics sparingly. The work is focused on metaphysics, ethics and aesthetics — things which are, in Schopenhauer’s view the true objects of philosophy.\n\nHe liked to paraphrase Henry David Thoreau, who advises us not to read not the Times, but the Eternities.\n\nDifferent systems of government come and go, but metaphysics and ethics, these are eternal. \n\nSchopenhauer saw countless revolutions and wars in his lifetime, most notably in his native Germany as well as in neighbouring France, and he always maintained his principle that politics is not the business of the philosopher.\n\nNevertheless, when we look at his writings in some more detail, we can work out a picture of what Schopenhauer thought good government should be.\n\nIn short, Schopenhauer was a monarchist who believed in limited government. Let’s take a look at his reasons why.",

A brief passage in Ecce Homo is dedicated to “the scholar”… The type of person who spends his entire day reading books. Nietzsche would’ve been all too familiar with this type of person from his days as a scholar himself, when he was a professor philology at the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nNietzsche’s problem with reading too many books is related to overstimulation. By constantly reading books, you become dependent on their stimulus to formulate your own thoughts. A yes or no or a critique of those thoughts. In other words, you become a reactive being as opposed to a proactive being. \n\nOf course, we also know for certain that Nietzsche had around 1100 books in his private library at the end of his life. And those represent less than half of all the books he’s read in his life.\n\nSo, make no mistake: Nietzsche did read a lot. But he warns against reading too much, and becoming dependent upon books and the ideas of others to formulate your own opinions. In other words, he warned against becoming reactive in your thinking rather than proactive. The first is the hallmark of a critic, someone who takes another person’s system and criticises it. But the proactive thinker comes up with his own system and ideas, he generates original thoughts.\n\nNietzsche doesn’t attribute his inspiration to reading books. Quite the opposite: he states multiple times that his best ideas came to him while being out on a walk, while being physically active in the real world.\n\nFor example, he famously came up with his concept of the Eternal Recurrence while looking at a rock during one of his hikes in the Swiss Alps.",

Link in the description. \n\nOne common thread in these two videos centers around a word that comes back quite often in Nietzsche’s writings: weakness. \n\nNietzsche accused Plato of weakness because he is the prototypical philosopher who seeks refuge in a so-called Hinterwelt, a world of metaphysics that is ontologically removed from the material, physical world. Plato’s theory of forms is a great example of this Hinterwelt idea, and in Nietzsche’s view it is also the original one. Christianity’s Heaven, Kant’s thing-in-itself, and Schopenhauer’s Will, are, in Nietzsche’s view, not separate instances of different Hinterwelts, but rather evolutions of a general idea that started with Plato.\n\nAll of this to say, that for Nietzsche, dialectics, which is to say, having a discussion or an argument, is a sign of weakness.\n\nOn these two videos, the same type of comment pops up again and again. The main idea is always the same, so allow me to rephrase the general gist of them. These comments to read as follows: \n\n“Nietzsche says arguing is for weak people but he spent his entire life writing books, which is just another way of making arguments. He himself is guilty of what he accuses others of doing. Doesn’t this make him weak as well?”\n\nThere are two charges here. The first is an accusation of hypocrisy. The second, is a charge of weakness.\n\nLet’s look at the hypocrisy problem first.\n\nThere is definitely some truth to this: Nietzsche, especially in his later work, where the distinction between strong and weak becomes more important to his philosophy, thinks that arguing is a sign of decadence or weakness. The powerful don’t need to convince, they simply command. \n\nBut isn’t Nietzsche doing just that: trying to convince us of his philosophy?\n\nLet’s take a closer look.\n\nShould a philosopher practice what he preaches? Not all philosophers have the same answer to this question.",

We learn that he mischaracterized the source from which this movement sprung: both Arthur Schopenhauer and Richard Wagner, seen as exemplars of Romanticism, were misinterpreted by Nietzsche. What was his mistake exactly? It has something to do with Dionysian art, suffering, and the character of philosophical pessimism.\n\nNietzsche assumed Richard Wagner's music and Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy were the products of an overflowing vitality, or a surplus of life. However, in the Joyful Science, he changes his mind. It was a mistake to think Wagner and Schopenhauer are a product of exuberance, rather, Wagner and Schopenhauer are a product of a lack of vitality. \n\nMost notably in his work The Case of Wagner we find a long polemic that seeks to critique Wagner’s music, and with it, Schopenhauer’s philosophy. If there’s enough interest, we’ll do a separate video on Nietzsche versus Wagner. Comment below if you’re interested.\n\nThis video is not about criticism. In this follow-up video, we want to look at what kind of art this late Nietzsche considers good. If bad art procedes from a lack of vitality, what kind of art procedes from a surplus of vitality?\n\nIn the paragraph of the Joyful Science in question, Nietzsche drops four names:\n\n“[Art may] proceed from gratitude and love:—art of this origin will always be an art of apotheosis, perhaps dithyrambic, as with Rubens, mocking divinely, as with Hafiz, or clear and kind-hearted as with Goethe, and spreading a Homeric brightness and glory over everything.”\n\n\n\n\n--- Music in the video (CC)\nCanon in D Major by Kevin MacLeod is is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0-licence. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100301\n\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

And unlike other ideas present in this work, which Nietzsche would later change or completely disavow, his damnation of the Socratic spirit in this work would later be expounded upon in works such as Twilight of the Idols.\n\nAs Twilight of the Idols is one of Nietzsche’s later works, and written in an attacking, vicious, perhaps radical style, we would do well to look at The Birth of Tragedy first and look at Nietzsche’s problem with Socrates in more detail. It will give us additional context for when we finally tackle his treatment of Socrates in that later work. \n\nIn The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche presents Socrates as a disruptive force in Athenian society. The arrival of Socrates signals a new era of Hellenism.\n\nSocrates, of course, is famous for the Socratic method in which he presents himself as a curious questioner of the Athenians. To do so, Socrates uses his trademark Socratic irony, in which he feigns ignorance in order to elicit a certain response from his conversation partner. He then attacks that response and challenges him on his presuppositions. In the typical Socratic dialogue, his opponent will then be exposed: he has certain strongly held beliefs, but he soon discovers that he has no good reasons for having them.\n\nThis emphasis on having good reasons will be important. \n\nThe root of Nietzsche’s problem is this: he finds no fault in the presocratic Greeks. On the contrary, the presocratic culture was for him an ideal, a highpoint. For him, this was a world of greatness, a golden age which has become lost to us — in part because Socrates was successful in overthrowing the morals and aesthetics of the time. Socrates represents the victory of reason over instinct, and for Nietzsche, this signalled the decline of the culture, not the progress.\n\nBy the way, we can tie all this in to a discussion in Beyond Good and Evil where Nietzsche exposes the so-called Will to Truth of the philosopher as nothing more than a disguised form of Will to Power.\n\nThe philosopher, not having power in the conventional sense, needs to find his power elsewhere. In the case of the philosopher, in his words and theories and influence. \n\nSocrates, being an outcast in Athenian society, has to resort to dialectics to affirm himself. He has no other means of doing so.",

Ultimately, there is nothing that can replace reading Nietzsche’s works for yourself, and this is what I would encourage you to do. We cover Nietzsche in great depth here on the channel but these videos are not a replacement for thorough reading and study if you’re serious about understanding Nietzsche’s philosophy.\n\nBut among the great names of philosophy, Nietzsche occupies a strange place. His work is difficult, but not in the way that Hegel, Kant or Heidegger are difficult. For the most part, Nietzsche writes in short sentences, using simple words. \n\nYet this is precisely the trouble. Nietzsche never bothers to be really precise with his terms, and he almost never gives a definition. He trusts that the reader will figure it out for himself.

In Ecco Homo, he compares Schopenhauer’s philosophy to a decomposing corpse.\n\nIn Twilight of the Idols, the book that preceded Ecco Homo, Nietzsche offers a similarly poisonous but altogether more insightful critique of Schopenhauer, engaging with the content of Schopenhauer’s philosophy instead of its overall character.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end there. Nietzsche, who probably knew Schopenhauer as well as anyone can know someone through only their writings, puts on his psychologist’s hat and attempts a psychoanalysis of the man Arthur Schopenhauer. \n\nIt’s only a tiny paragraph.

Does it have a societal value, an ethical value, or even a religious value? And what’s up with abstract art? \n\nIn today’s video we’ll take a look at Nietzsche’s view on the l’art pour l’art movement. An artistic movement that was in vogue and increasingly popular when Nietzsche wrote Twilight of the Idols, one of his later works. \n\nAlready in 1888, well before we see the true lift-off of abstract art in the form of Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain, or Picasso’s Demoiselles D’Avignon, or Jackson Pollock, Nietzsche took a stand against so-called “l’art pour l’art” – art of art’s sake. \n\nThe phrase originated somewhere in the 19th century in France and by the time Nietzsche wrote Twilight of the Idols, had quite a bit of traction. The central idea was that art should exist autonomously, that it should stand on its own two legs. In other words, that art would serve no function beyond itself. Art should be an end, not a means. In other words, art should not be about sending a moral message, or about the glorification of your country, or whatever other meaning you might assign to art.\n\nIf you’re watching this video in the 21st century, this probably sounds a little strange to you. \n\nAffiliate disclosure: At no cost to you, if you make a purchase through one of the above links, I get a small commission.

It followed a period of sustained productivity in the year 1888, during which he wrote four works: The Case of Wagner, Twilight of the Idols, the Antichrist, and Ecce Homo. \n\nIn Ecce Homo, not only does Nietzsche focus on the outer world, for example by discussing diet or climate, he also focuses on the inner world. Ecce Homo is full of references to the human body, and most interestingly, the nose. For Nietzsche, the nose is the most underrated of the senses – having received very little interest in philosophy. Yet the sense of smell is perhaps one of the most powerful ones, able to instantly take us back to a memory when we smell a certain aroma. \n\nBut the nose is also an excellent warning system. It warns us against rotten food, for example. It elicits a reaction of disgust more powerful than mere visuals. Rotten meat looks disgusting for sure, but have you ever smelled it? \n\nNietzsche uses the metaphor of smell in two ways.\n\nFirst, like we said, to bring back attention to our body and to the material world, as part of his ongoing struggle against the Hinterwelt.\n\nBut secondly, he uses smell to illustrate his concept of degeneration. \n\nDegeneration, or décadence, is one of the most ubiquitous, but also difficult concepts in Nietzsche’s philosophy. It can’t be explained in this short video, but we went deeper into it in our video series on Twilight of the Idols. \n\nFor the purposes of this video, we must remember that degeneration functions as a sort of catch-all term for Nietzsche’s diagnosis of Western culture. \n\nStrictly speaking it refers to a state of decline. Specifically Nietzsche targets Christian dominance in the West and the philosophies associated with it. There is Platonism, as a sort of precursor to Christianity, there is Kantianism, which, in Nietzsche’s interpretation, is simply Christianity but in philosophical terms instead of religious ones, and there is Schopenhauer, the philosopher who unwittingly exposed the nihilism upon which Christianity is built. This descent into nihilism is what the core of décadence.  \n\nLet’s try to see how far we can take this metaphor. If Christianity and Schopenhauer smell rotten, if they are decaying, décadent, degenerated, then what would be the opposite? What would smell clean, good, fresh?\n\nWell, it would be Thus Spoke Zarathustra of course. \n\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission.

But that doesn’t mean he just blurted it out without reason. \n\nNietzsche has a very specific bone to pick with Plato. \n\nPlato’s theory of forms, broadly speaking, holds that the physical, material world is only an ephemeral, imperfect reflection of a truer, timeless world of forms or ideas. \n\nThese ideas are the essence of things. For example, there are many cups in the world. But they all share the same essence: they all participate in the idea of “cupness.” The ideal cup exists somewhere as a Platonic idea or form. Without this idea, we couldn’t call a cup, well, a cup. \n\nIn Platonism, the material world is imperfect compared to the world of ideas. A geometrical example can make things clearer: imagine a circle. It’s impossible to draw a mathematically perfect circle in the real world. The perfect circle exists only as an idea, as a concept. But that doesn’t mean we can’t draw circles at all. The theory of forms tries to explain why we recognize this imperfect circular shape as a circle. It’s because the drawing participates in the idea of the circle. It shares its essence. \n\nSo there is the imperfect material world and there is the perfect world of forms. Should we focus our philosophical efforts on the imperfect world or on the perfect world? The answer is obvious. \nAnd you can see how these ideas can transform over time into Christianity. The Platonic world of forms becomes the Kingdom of God or Heaven – it’s the same underlying idea that the material world is imperfect but there exists a spiritual world of perfection someplace else, on a metaphysical level. \n\nThis is the idea of the Hinterwelt – and it takes many forms. It’s the world of ideas in Plato, heaven in Christianity, the thing-in-itself in Kant, and the Will in Schopenhauer. These proposed metaphysics are different in detail but not in essence. For Nietzsche, they are all different instantiations of the Hinterwelt, a beyond-world that is somehow more perfect or everlasting than the material world. \n\nThis notion of the Hinterwelt began with Plato and survived up until Nietzsche’s day, and depending on who you ask, it still persists today. \n\nBut Nietzsche’s problem with Plato doesn’t stop at a simple disagreement on metaphysics. For Nietzsche, there is a psychological component to the Hinterwelt.\n\nThe Hinterwelt, in Nietzsche’s psychological analysis, is exposed as a refuge for the weak. They construct this imaginary artificial world to hide from the real, material world in which they’re not faring too well. \n\nWe explore this deeper in our hour-long analysis of Nietzsche’s work On The Genealogy of Morals. Again, link in description. \n\nIn that work, Nietzsche argues that in the struggle for power, the strong win from the weak. The weak, in turn, need to find a psychological mechanism to cope with this position of inferiority.\n\nOne such coping mechanism, is the construction of an imaginary world which allows them to escape the real world. The emergence of these kind of Hinterwelt philosophies, is for Nietzsche the chief symptom of décadence, the sign of an unhealthy culture.\n\nWe cannot fully explain the ramifications or meaning of these loaded terms in a short video such as this. If you’re interested, you can check out our videos on the Genealogy of Morals and Twilight of the Idols.",

In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he calls this “light-footedness.” Nietzsche wants us to confront the here and now with an almost childlike optimism, as a sign of strength and an affirmation of life.\n\nWhy is this controversial? Nietzsche’s renewed appreciation for life is one of the main ingredients of his attack against the philosophical tradition. He attacks all of Western philosophy since Socrates, all the way through Christianity, up until the era of Kant and Schopenhauer. \n\nIn Nietzsche’s estimation, these philosophical movements are sick. Their disease? They say life is not good.\n\nNietzsche uses the Latin term, consensus sapientium, to capture this widespread agreement among the wise that life, generally, is full of suffering and consequently, that it is no good. \n\nSocrates, in his famous last words before his death, calls life a disease when he asks his friend to make a sacrifice to Asclepius, the god of medicine to which Greeks made sacrifices as thanks for being cured from an illness.\n\nChristianity presents the rotten state of the world and the sufferings of life as a consequence of the Fall of Man, subsequently it tacitly agrees that life is not good. \n\nAnd of course, Schopenhauer is the philosopher of pessimism, arguing that life is synonymous with suffering.\n\nTogether, these three represent not just their themselves, they are stand-ins for the Western philosophical tradition in its entirety. Nietzsche is not just attacking these three, but everything they stand for as well. Together, they represent the consensus sapientium, the agreement of the wise.\n\nAnd they all agree on one thing: that life is no good.\nJust because the wise of all ages agree on something, doesn’t make them right. Consider how provocative this is: what Nietzsche is saying, in effect, is that all those who came before him, all the smartest and greatest minds in philosophical history, are wrong.",

This video series will analyze this critique. \n\nSchopenhauer distinguishes between two kinds of honor. \n\nThe first kind we might call universal honor – which exists in nearly every culture. The other kind Schopenhauer calls knightly honor. Most of his critique will center upon this latter sort of honor, which arose in the European Middle Ages and is therefore not universal, rather it is very specific to a certain culture and a certain time period. \n\n\nWe have an innate realization that as humans, we need others to accomplish our true potential. In other words, we need society in order to function. Without society, Schopenhauer says, man is like Robinson Crusoe on a desert island – not capable of accomplishing much. \n\nBut to enjoy the benefits of living in society, we must prove ourselves worthy of being a part of it. We must contribute. \n\nThe best way to contribute to society is to fulfill the needs of the other members to the best of our ability. Humans do this by becoming doctors, carpenters, scientists, bricklayers, and so on. Each person plays his part, and in turn, he gets to enjoy the value created by other people who are also playing their part. \n\nBut because we are granted honor by other people, there exists a danger where we take the honor ideal too far, and focus too much on other people’s approval of ourselves, to the detriment of our actions. In short, we focus on gaining approval instead of giving value. \n\nThis danger is present in every honor culture, but it reached an apex in the Medieval European context. With so-called knightly honor, Europe embraced a system of honor that spiralled out of control, and became autonomous, being completely divorced from the social context in which it arose, where it started to lead its own life. \n\nSchopenhauer tries to figure out what went wrong, and starts with a brief history of Medieval honor culture. Why was it precisely in Europe, and nowhere else, that knightly honor took the place of civic honor? \n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission.

It followed a period of sustained productivity in the year 1888, during which he wrote four works: The Case of Wagner, Twilight of the Idols, the Antichrist, and Ecce Homo. \n\nIn Ecce Homo, not only does Nietzsche focus on the outer world, for example by discussing diet or climate, he also focuses on the inner world. Ecce Homo is full of references to the human body, and most interestingly, the nose. For Nietzsche, the nose is the most underrated of the senses – having received very little interest in philosophy. Yet the sense of smell is perhaps one of the most powerful ones, able to instantly take us back to a memory when we smell a certain aroma. \n\nBut the nose is also an excellent warning system. It warns us against rotten food, for example. It elicits a reaction of disgust more powerful than mere visuals. Rotten meat looks disgusting for sure, but have you ever smelled it? \n\nNietzsche uses the metaphor of smell in two ways.\n\nFirst, like we said, to bring back attention to our body and to the material world, as part of his ongoing struggle against the Hinterwelt.\n\nBut secondly, he uses smell to illustrate his concept of degeneration. \n\nDegeneration, or décadence, is one of the most ubiquitous, but also difficult concepts in Nietzsche’s philosophy. It can’t be explained in this short video, but we went deeper into it in our video series on Twilight of the Idols. \n\nFor the purposes of this video, we must remember that degeneration functions as a sort of catch-all term for Nietzsche’s diagnosis of Western culture. \n\nStrictly speaking it refers to a state of decline. Specifically Nietzsche targets Christian dominance in the West and the philosophies associated with it. There is Platonism, as a sort of precursor to Christianity, there is Kantianism, which, in Nietzsche’s interpretation, is simply Christianity but in philosophical terms instead of religious ones, and there is Schopenhauer, the philosopher who unwittingly exposed the nihilism upon which Christianity is built. This descent into nihilism is what the core of décadence.  \n\nLet’s try to see how far we can take this metaphor. If Christianity and Schopenhauer smell rotten, if they are decaying, décadent, degenerated, then what would be the opposite? What would smell clean, good, fresh?\n\nWell, it would be Thus Spoke Zarathustra of course. \n\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission.

It followed a period of sustained productivity in the year 1888, during which he wrote four works: The Case of Wagner, Twilight of the Idols, the Antichrist, and Ecce Homo. \n\nIn Ecce Homo, Nietzsche makes it clear that his personality cannot be separated from his philosophy. \n\nNietzsche will seek to transparently and obviously embrace his personality when doing philosophy. In doing so, he breaks with the old philosophers, according to Nietzsche, have always tried to hide their personality from their work so as to maintain the illusion of objectivity and disinterested truth. \n\nThe focus on biography as an underpinning of philosophy, also serves another purpose. It provides Nietzsche with ammunition to attack the idea of the Hinterwelt. The Hinterwelt is a general term for the kind of philosophy or religion Nietzsche attacks throughout his writings. German for “behind-world”, it refers to the idea common in philosophy and religion that this world, the world of the here and now, the material world, is not of supreme importance. \n\nThe Hinterwelt takes many forms. It could be Heaven or the Kingdom of God, as in Christianity. Or it could be the thing-in-itself in the philosophy of Kant, or the Will in the philosophy of Schopenhauer. It could even be the veil of Maya, the idea in Hinduism that the material world is an illusion.  The Platonic World of Ideas or Forms, is another example.\n\nNietzsche takes issue with this kind of philosophy, and sought to make an end to the Hinterwelt. His philosophy is an invitation for us to live in this world without hope for salvation in the next, and to courageously endure and overcome the struggles of the material world. That is what the Will to Power is all about. \n\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission. Thank you for supporting the channel.",

But Schopenhauer is much more than his main system. Careful study of his works allows us to reconstruct a philosophy of religion. We have covered this in detail on the channel. Link in the description. \n\nIn this video we’re going to explore three stages of encountering religion. These are successive steps which can be distilled from Schopenhauer’s works as kind of a ladder, which, ideally, everyone must climb, but in reality, only the philosopher will really climb. We must never forget, Schopenhauer is an elitist. And where this subject is concerned, he is relentless. \n\nWe’ll tackle the three stages through the lens of one specific example, the story of Adam and Eve. Depending on the stage, the story changes meaning.\n\nPeople at the first stage accept religion without questioning it. They are provided with metaphysical and ethical explanations for the world around them which approximate real metaphysics and ethics. It’s a good enough explanation that gets them through life, and for all intents and purposes, it’s all they need. As Schopenhauer would say, not everyone can be a philosopher. He uses the example of the wooden leg: it replaces a real leg, it does a good enough job of it, but it’s not a real leg. Even so, the wooden leg is of amazing value to someone who lacks a real leg.\n\nIn the second stage, people start questioning religious dogma. They ask themselves, is it all really true? And they must come to the conclusion that it’s not. Religious dogma is too full of absurdities and contradictions to stand on its own legs. Following this realization, they reject religion entirely. \n\nBut in the third stage, you realize that the job of religion is to communicate these real metaphysical ideas in a way that is understandable to the average person. To that end, the truth must disguise itself a little. This disguise is what we call religion. And the absurdities and contradictions are there for those who are smart enough to figure it all out. They are  breadcrumbs for curious minds. The absurdities, the contradictions, in a word, the mysteries, are a way for religions to quietly admit their own allegorical nature. The clever ones will pick up on this, while it flies over the heads of the masses. \n\nReligion fulfills the metaphysical and ethical needs of those who lack the capacity to become philosophers. It’s unfair to demand of religion that it be true in a literal sense, because it was never meant to be true in a literal sense. It was always meant as a pia fraus, a noble lie. \n\nThis, for Schopenhauer, represents the mature way of looking at religion. The child believes in religion at face value. The adolescent rebels against it, while the adult comes to appreciate its utility and recognizes why it’s needed.\n\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission.

And because of this reluctance, lots of women remain without husbands, and thus without sustenance and livelihood. This, in turn, forces them into “dishonorable professions” or resigns them to a quiet life of spinsterhood. \n\nHe argues that, for women on the whole, a polygamous society is preferable. It’s also more natural for the men. \n\n“…there is no reason why a man whose wife suffers from chronic illness, or remains barren, or has gradually become too old for him, should not take a second.”\n\nAnd, above all, he argues that people live in polygamy anyway. Men and women both cheat, and it happens rarely that people only have one partner over the course of their entire lifetimes. Then why pretend to exalt the monogamy as the best system there is? There is no reason. \n\nIn unpublished notebooks, Schopenhauer worked out an alternative to monogamy called tetragamy, with the Greek prefix “tetra” meaning four. The system was not completely worked out, which explains why Schopenhauer never published this idea, but a rough sketch remains. \n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, when you make a purchase through the links provided above, we make a small commission.

    "description": "Download the essay: https://weltgeist.tv/courage\n\nWith this video I want to bring to attention a tiny little section coming at the end of the penultimate chapter of Schopenhauer’s Counsels & Maxims, his advice for practical living. \n\nSchopenhauer’s claim to fame is his philosophical pessimism – the characterization of the world as the battlefield of the will, existing only for the eternal, blind, irrational striving of the Will to Life. Every creature, in fact, even every object, exists in a state of perpetual struggle against the other. And what’s worse, all of this suffering does not have any redeeming quality about it. There is no happy ending in Schopenhauer’s philosophy. \n\nBut these musings on the nature of the world and the creatures in it, are philosophical problems. After penning down his entire system in the magnum opus called The World as Will and Representation, and after spending decades perfecting and expanding it, Schopenhauer took to writing for a completely different objective. In these later writings, he is not so much concerned with deep, philosophical questions, but with day to day psychological observations on human society and how one should conduct oneself within it. \n\nIn a remarkable section on courage, Schopenhauer combines his pessimistic view of the world as an eternal battlefield, with remarkable uplifting prose on the virtue of courage and the necessity of facing the challenges of life with determination and willingness to fight.",

Schopenhauer’s general rule is to never tell anyone more than what they can figure out for themselves. \n\nIn doing this you also train yourself in the art of thinking before you speak. As you might imagine, this skill comes with high praise by Schopenhauer.\n\nOften we are overly critical of ourselves, and because we pay so much attention to ourselves and to our flaws, we assume these flaws must be glaring to other people as well.\n\nWe then make the mistake of bringing up our insecurities in conversation when the other person would never even think of noticing your flaws.\n\nBy training yourself to keep quiet you can avoid situations like these. Don’t make things harder on yourself than they need to be. \n\nAnother benefit of keeping your mouth shut is you will avoid revealing dangerous details. Schopenhauer warns against the tendency of people in social situations to take a tiny little fact and extrapolate from it an entire story. In other words, don’t reveal too much information.\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission. Thank you for supporting the channel.",

    "description": "Schopenhauer's works:\nParerga and Paralipomena vol. 1: https://amzn.to/3pK6xCj\nParerga and Paralipomena vol. 2: https://amzn.to/3jJa2p0\nThe World as Will and Representation vol. 1: https://amzn.to/3FPGkIj\nThe World as Will and Representation vol. 2: https://amzn.to/3FT0nFC\n\nThe will to life objectifies itself in the multitude of the phenomenal world. All that is, everything we experience, is the Will become flesh, so to speak. \n\nThis is as true for the lifeless rock as it is for ourselves. As we move up the ladder, from rocks to plants to animals, we can see the Will more clearly at work, more distinctively objectified. In the higher organisms, such as animals, the Will finds more clever ways to assert its own objectification. \n\nIn general, the more clever an animal is, the more sophisticated its Will-expressions, in other words, its struggle for survival, will be. \n\nWe can see this mechanism at work when ravens or chimpanzees solve puzzles for food.\n\nWe like to watch animals. It’s just one of those things humans seem to enjoy. Have you ever wondered why that is?\n\nArthur Schopenhauer’s works are full of psychological observations which he goes on to explain through the lens of his philosophy. He considered it one of his philosophy’s greatest strengths: while his system was constructed through pure reason and subjective experience, it also accounted for a great deal of natural phenomena, ranging from the observation that plants seem to fight each other for sunlight, to explanations for seemingly obvious little facts of life.\n\nFor example, that humans like to observe animals. \n\nBecause of the all-encompassing nature of Schopenhauer’s philosophy, having a good understanding of The World as Will and Representation will add an extra layer of meaning to Schopenhauer’s explanations. However, even without this knowledge there is much to be gained from reading this little essay. \n\nWith more complex degrees of objectification, comes an increased intelligence. With humans, the Will finds its most complex objectification yet, and correspondingly, humans are the most intelligent beings in the world. It’s important to note that the intellect is a byproduct of, and subservient to, the Will. But that is a subject for another video.\n\nThe high intelligence afforded to humans by the Will, comes at a great cost. First, it makes us aware of the suffering of the world. And second, it allows us to lie, mislead, and cheat. In other words, it allows us to hide our true feelings.\n\nIn animals we can witness the Will without the veil of reason hanging over it, obscuring it. We take delight in a more pure form of existence, a naïve existence, unburdened with the knowledge of the sufferings of the world with which we humans are so intimately acquainted.\n\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission.

    "description": "When we read Schopenhauer’s advice for conducting oneself through society, or how to position oneself for material gain, or how to maximize happiness – one objection that often comes up is something like the following:\n\n“Schopenhauer was a bitter, lonely old man who died alone and who alienated everyone around him… Is he really the kind of guy you want to take advice from?”\n\nThere is certainly some merit to this reaction. By all accounts, contemporaries describe Schopenhauer as a pain to be around, a killjoy who was overly confident in his own intellectual ability and tactlessly corrected everyone around him to the point of being downright insulting. \n\nHowever, some biographical facts, which are often forgotten, paint a slightly more nuanced picture of the philosopher, when it comes to taking life advice from him.\n\nYes, it is true he lived off his father’s inheritance and never had to work a day in his life. But he also doubled his money through smart investments, while his mother and sister squandered their inheritance.\n\nYes, he was arrogant and overly confident in his own intellectual abilities. But he was correct to point out to his mother that her books and her name would soon be forgotten, while his work would stand the test of time and secure his place in the history of philosophy. Remember, he had this conversation with his mother while he was  a no-name philosophy student who just finished his dissertation, while his mother was one the best-selling German authors of the time.\n\nAnd yes, today he is known as a grumpy old man. That’s the age at which he became famous. But what is often overlooked, is how Schopenhauer started writing his philosophical magnum opus, The World As Will and Representation, when he was only 26 years old, and he finished this huge undertaking only four years later at the age of 30.",

But beyond the writings of his main work, which teaches denial of life and the material world, we find essays filled with advice from a practical point of view, aimed at the average reader and not the scholar or philosopher. \n\nIn these essays, Schopenhauer gives advice on how to lead the good life, often borrowing heavily from the ancient Greeks and Romans, especially the Stoics. \n\nAnd sometimes, his advice sounds very modern indeed. One section of the Parerga & Paralipomena deals with how foolish it is to ponder too much about either the future and the past. It’s about how we must live in the present, the only time we truly have. \n\nBut the tone is not entirely positive. Schopenhauer teaches us that attaining peace of mind, which is a necessary condition for truly living in the present, is a difficult task.\n\nThere are two obstacles to be overwon.\n\nFirst, fear.\n\nSome people are so preoccupied with worry about the future or what could go wrong, that they can never truly enjoy the present moment. Schopenhauer recommends an exercise that is also found among the Stoics: \n\nWe must analyze our fears and realize that either we do not know when some kind of evil will befall us, or we must realize it’s not likely to happen at all.\n\n\nWhen we have conquered our fears, next up is the problem of desire. Desire is fundamental to our being, especially in Schopenhauer’s teachings. It’s the Will to Life at work directly through us. As such, it’s hard to keep desire at bay. But if you’re constantly preoccupied with what you want, you’re unlikely to enjoy the present moment. \n\nThis short section of Schopenhauer’s occupies a strange place in his philosophy. For the record, these essays are written for the general reader. And they discuss life with one major assumption being made, namely that life is worth living in the first place. As we saw repeatedly in other videos, Schopenhauer actually advocates for asceticism, the life of a monk. Fasting, prayer or meditation, abstinence, and so on. In his main work.\n\nYet he recognizes not every one is capable of making this sacrifice. Schopenhauer himself certainly wasn’t able of doing so.\n\nAffiliate disclaimer: At no cost to you, by purchasing products linked above, I make a small commission.

We like to think we can make plans and stick to them, but the truth is that the direction of our lives is not shaped by rational decisions, nor do we make important choices by way of intellectual arguments.\n\nSchopenhauer identifies two great powers which shape the course of our lives beyond our own volition. They are Luck and Instinct. \n\nEver the master of metaphor and simile, Schopenhauer likens luck to the wind at sea, with our lives being the voyage of a ship.\n\nAll we can do is set a destination for ourselves, and try to steer our boat in the right direction. But we are dependent upon the wind – it can blow us in the right direction and get us to our destination faster. But it can also work against us, and undo years of work and toil in the blink of an eye. \n\nAbove all, when we set sail for a far off destination, we embrace uncertainty.\n\nHowever, luck is not the only force that shapes our life beyond our control. We might like to think that we humans are rational creatures, basing our decisions on careful analysis and deep contemplation. But Schopenhauer was one of the first prominent philosophers to argue this isn’t true.\n\nIn the framework set out by Schopenhauer, what we call “instinct” is simply the Will, the most fundamental part of our being, at work. For Schopenhauer, the Will precedes the Intellect, with the Intellect having the subservient role.\n\nToday, we would use the word “rationalization” to denote this phenomenon where we make decisions based on emotion and gut feeling, yet convince ourselves after the fact we have made the decision based on deep rational analysis. \n\nThis brings forth the question of just how trustworthy our gut feeling is. Can we always trust it? Or should we defer to the intellect from time to time?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. Every person needs to figure out for himself in what proportion the subconscious gut feeling can be trusted in favor of the conscious rational decision making process. The wisdom needed to make this call, only comes with experience and age.",

    "description": "Autobiography of Madame de Guyon: https://amzn.to/2X9CGYn\nMysticism reader: https://amzn.to/3FLbLmY\n\nThe philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer ends on a negative note. His main work, The World as Will and Representation, exposes the world as Representation, the material world of day to day, as being ultimately empty. \n\nIt’s possible to arrive at this insight purely through intellectual speculation, which is what Schopenhauer claimed to have done with his philosophy. Moreover, if you truly understand Schopenhauer’s philosophy on a deep level, you too can arrive at this insight of the ultimate nothingness of the world by purely thinking about it. At least in theory. \n\nMuch more likely is the second path. Now we are leaving the realm of metaphysics and entering the realm of ethics. \n\nSchopenhauer advocates an ethics of compassion, but for the truly ethical person, simply being compassionate isn’t enough. \n\nThis so-called denial of the Will is another way towards the realization that this material world, is essentially nothing. \n\nThe question of course, is: where do we go from here? If philosophy ends in nothingness, what else is there?",

    "description": "More on Schopenhauer and smalltalk and relating to people: https://youtu.be/_oR78_QVF8s\nNietzsche and the Last Man, Zarathustra's warning: https://youtu.be/RtLKBT42YsM\n\nSchopenhauer’s writings outside of his great philosophical magnum opus, The World as Will and Representation, are full of psychological observations. \n\nOne such observation, concerns people who are easily offended. \n\nThe sensitivity of these people arises from the fact that they are thoroughly subjective, as most people are. The word “subjective” has a specific meaning here.\n\nIt means that these people regard everything through the lens of their own person and experience, and are unable to take an objective, that is to say, disinterested, viewpoint. Therefore, everything that appears before their mind’s eye, everything they experience, is colored by their own personality.\n\nBecause the common man lacks the intelligence to assume the objective viewpoint, he is stuck viewing things subjectively. In other words, he cannot help but put his personality behind everything. In short: everything is personal. \n\nAnd when everything is personal, everything can offend. \n\nAnother side-effect of having this exceedingly subjective view, is a certain kind of narcissism in conversation. Everything is always about them, and whenever you bring something up, they need to relate whatever you just said to themselves.\n\nBecause people always find a reason to make everything about them, and are drawn to whatever affects them personally, the cynical Schopenhauer remarks that it’s really easy to win them over by flattery. \n\nBecause their opinions are not formed by objective standards but subjective ones, their opinion is easily influenced. \n\nIf you want to defend yourself against this manipulation, the solution is to occupy your mind with things other than yourself. In other words, to inject some objectivity into your life. The most straightforward way to do this is by studying philosophy or even reading literature or doing math. In general, the way to escape the subjective viewpoint is to train your mind to engage with big, abstract ideas. The further those ideas are removed from day-to-day reality, the better.",

    "title": "Napoleon's Role in History (Hegel vs Schopenhauer)",
    "description": "One of the more interesting curiosities of history, is that two great German philosophers, Schopenhauer and Hegel, both caught a glimpse of Napoleon Bonaparte. \n\nHow each of them thought about Napoleon, his role in history and his significance for mankind, provides a nice exploration of their respective philosophies. \n\nHegel’s encounter with the Emperor is perhaps the most famous one. \n\nOn the day before the Battle of Jena in October 1806, Napoleon entered the German city to inspect it for reconnaissance purposes. While touring the streets of Jena, mounted on a horse, he was spotted by Hegel. He later wrote to a friend:\n\n“I saw the Emperor—this world-soul [Weltseele]—riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.” Letter to Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer\n\nNapoleon, for Hegel, was a world-historic figure who played a crucial, but necessary, part in moving history toward its goal. Napoleon was the vehicle by which the French Revolution was completing itself outside of France, as part of a larger project wherein the Geist, or Spirit, gradually comes to know itself through time. \n\nAside from the fact that Schopenhauer doesn’t believe in a progression of history like Hegel does, the suffering caused by such conquerors as Napoleon or Alexander the Great, is simply too large for there ever to be a net positive for mankind. \n\nFor Hegel, Napoleon as a world-historic figure is fulfilling a destiny, he is the vessel with which history and the Geist unfold itself. For Schopenhauer, Napoleon is just one more bloodthirsty conqueror in a long line of bloodthirsty conquerors, without a special purpose and without the possibility for redemption.\n\nWhat is unique in the character of Napoleon, is his extraordinary intelligence, courage, and above all will to subject the world to his power. This combination of traits makes Napoleon unique, but not special. \n\nIn Napoleon we find a rare individual who can completely indulge in the destruction craved by the will to life. The will, of which Napoleon is but one objectification, seeks to continually assert itself at the cost of other instantiations of the will. In other words, through Napoleon the will has found a perfect vehicle to perpetuate itself. But all of this suffering only takes place in the world of representation – on the fundamental level, in the world as will, the person who inflicts suffering is the same as the person who undergoes the suffering. \n\nWhat is important to remember as far as Napoleon is concerned, is that for Schopenhauer, Napoleon is a unique individual but not a special individual. He is unique in so far as he was a gifted military commander, born in the right place at the right time, with the right set of talents to succeed in such an environment. He is not special, however. He is not special because fundamentally, Napoleon is just as egoistic and ambitious as the rest of mankind.",

In writings other than his main work, written near the end of his life, he takes it upon himself to give his readers practical advice for day to day life.\n\nA lot of his advice deals with the question of how to move through society. And invariably, Schopenhauer’s elitism will shine through. Without shame, Schopenhauer writes about the dumb masses versus the intelligent genius, and how such a genius should conduct himself in polite society. \n\nWhen a person of great intellect is forced to mingle in polite company, the best thing to do, according to Schopenhauer, is to play dumb. \n\nThe reason why it pays so well to play dumb, is because intelligence in other people rouses a great feeling of resentment and envy. \n\nIntelligence is the object of so much envy because we do not feel like we deserve our intelligence. To have it, means you are in possession of an unfair advantage which you did not earn yourself. \n\nThe same psychology is at play when we are jealous of someone who inherited a large sum of money. It doesn’t matter if he’s a legitimately good businessman or investor and took great care to increase his inheritance instead of wasting it. If this person would flaunt his wealth and rub it in your face how much money he has, we would not like him for it to say the least.\n\nHe quotes approvingly from Balthasar Gracian’s Oracle of Worldly Wisdom, one of his favorite texts.",

    "title": "SCHOPENHAUER: The Art of Being Polite (And Why Some People Don't Deserve It)",
    "description": "As part of his investigations into human nature, Schopenhauer has a few words to say about politeness.\n\nIn a more serious philosophical work, On the Basis of Morality, Schopenhauer describes politeness as a phenomenon that arose in order to mask the inherent egoism of human beings. \n\nSchopenhauer’s cynical view of politeness holds that, by agreeing to be polite to each other, we agree to overlook the faults and defects in the personality or the intelligence of the other. This makes the faults less obtrusive from both sides, and results in a win-win arrangement where dealing with people in general just becomes more tolerable. \n\nWe should be careful not to confuse politeness with genuine love for our neighbour. Politeness, when compared to true love or kindness, is a technicality. Just like justice in the court of law is different from justice coming from an integrity of the heart.\n\nPoliteness, being a technicality, can therefore be used to our advantage just as we would use a machine to our advantage. \n\nWhat is interesting to note is that, for Schopenhauer, being polite is not really a goal in itself. It’s more of a clever play in order to get what you want more easily. \n\nBecause, and Schopenhauer never tires of laboring the point, most people don’t actually deserve your politeness.\n\nWhy is that? Isn’t it good to always be polite no matter what? \n\nWell, not exactly. Remember that in Schopenhauer’s conception, politeness arises because two people reach a mutual but silent agreement. The agreement is that each ignores the flaws of the other in order to move the social interaction along. \n\nIn Schopenhauer’s estimation, most people are so flawed that it actually becomes disingenuous to treat them politely, and to ignore these obvious character flaws just to get along.",

    "title": "SCHOPENHAUER: How to Spot a Fake Friend (What Is a Real Friend?)",
    "description": "Is real friendship even possible? This is the question Schopenhauer tries to answer.\n\nThe basis of true friendship, for Schopenhauer, is an objective compassion with the weal and woe of your friend. The word “objective” here denotes disinterest – a good friend is completely selfless, and identifies himself completely with his friend, so much so that not even a trace of a selfish motive for the friendship is left. \n\nSuffice to say, that for Schopenhauer, this is an ideal that is almost never reached in the real world. He even wonders if it’s possible at all. \n\nSchopenhauer’s cynical view of friendship is exemplified by a passage in which he does admit that true friendship might be possible after all, only to add the disclaimer that surely, some kind of secret personal motive must be at play as well. Still, we might as well regard this kind of friendship as “genuine.” Even though it’s not perfect, it’s the best we can hope for, because at bottom, at least there is some real feeling of compassion in there.\n\n\nSo, the question arises: how do you know if a friend is real or fake? There are two ways to know. \n\nYou know a friend is real if circumstances force him to make some kind of great sacrifice for you. If misfortune befalls you, who of your friends will be there for you? And which of them will disappear from your life? Will your friends support you in difficult times, or will they not bother? \n\nWe also dive deeper into human nature and Schadenfreude, be sure to watch the video....",

    "description": "In Nietzsche’s epic work Thus Spoke Zarathustra, we find the concept of the Last Man. \n\nZarahustra has descended from the high mountains, he is longing to speak his wisdom to the common man below. However, his message, the coming of the Superman, of the Übermensch, falls on deaf ears. \n\nThe crowd laughs at him and mocks him. \n\nEvidently, the crowd is not ready to hear of the Übermensch. Zarathustra’s message of advancement, of a lofty goal for mankind, of the next stage for humankind, the “meaning of the earth” – it all falls flat. The crowd, the common man, is not interested. They cannot be roused to excitement. \n\nSo, Zarathustra tries something else. Instead of talking about lofty aspirations and high ideals, he tries to go in the opposite direction: he speaks to the crowd in terms of what awaits them if they don’t heed his message.\n\nIf the people won’t be motivated by visions of heaven, maybe they will be motivated by visions of hell.\n\nThat hell, is the Last Man. \n\nIntroduced as the opposite of the Übermensch or Superman, the Last Man is Nietzsche’s vision for mankind should it not heed his call for greatness. The Last Man is contemptible. Empty. Unthinking. Unfeeling, even. \n\nThe Last Man is Nietzsche’s nightmare vision for humanity. Zarathustra hopes that this pessimistic vision of mankind will scare the crowd into listening to him.\n\nLike a Biblical prophet who preaches the end of the world in order to increase the urgency of his message, as if to say “this is your final chance to listen to me. Or else…\n\nAnd so Zarathustra paints the dreadful picture of that lamentable creature, the Last Man.",

A recurring stock character in fiction, the absent-minded professor is the prototypical genius, great at what he does, but horrible at being a normal human being. The website TVTropes has a great write-up on the character, plus a huge database of examples of absent-minded professors in fiction.\n\nThales of Miletus, considered by many to be the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, is said to have been so engrossed in philosophical thought while looking up at the stars, that he didn’t notice the well in front of him, and he promptly fell down into it. \n\nSchopenhauer also noticed this tendency of great geniuses to be absent-minded or otherwise ill-equipped to deal with the social reality of day to day life. \n\nThe phenomenon arises because the genius takes a bird’s eye view of humanity. The genius rises above the petty concerns of man. He is preoccupied with the world in its totality, not in its parts. All of existence poses a riddle to him. What time does such a person have to concern himself with gossip, conversations about the weather, or social etiquette?\n\nThe commoner, by contrast, has a much simpler point of view. The common man cannot transcend his own viewpoint and see the world from a higher vantage point. The commoner is stuck with his own individuality, and only looks at the world from his own selfish perspective.",

Schopenhauer’s highest ethical ideal in this work, is the life of the ascetic: someone who withdraws from the world and turns his back on ordinary life. If you are interested in the philosophy behind all of this, you can check out our big video dedicated to this major work.\n\nHowever, Schopenhauer always maintained that this saintly hermit life is a path only a few individuals can take. The vast majority of people simply don’t have it in them to live their life in this way. \n\nSchopenhauer’s aim with the Wisdom of Life, is to write for the common man, not for the holy saint. In order to do so, he must cast aside the conclusion of his main work, and proceed with pragmatism and realism. We are not concerned with philosophy or the search for truth, we are writing a practical manual on the happy life.\n\nWhile Schopenhauer admits that there are two other sources of happiness, namely in possessions and in reputation or fame, he argues that only in this category can you find lasting happiness. \n\nYou might be surprised to hear that Schopenhauer, the famous pessimist, is such a proponent of a cheerful character. It’s even more important than intellect or physical health…\n\nOf course, you could say that a cheerful disposition is the result of happiness, not the cause of it. Not necessarily so for Schopenhauer. While we should always welcome a merry feeling when it arrives, “for [it] never comes inopportunely,” its arrival is ultimately largely out of our control. We should enjoy it when it’s here but learn to be content without it. \n\nWe can make our lives better, however, if we work on the conditions that make it easier for cheer and joy to arrive on our doorstep. \n\nSchopenhauer gives us a quick list of recommendations, such as the need for daily exercise in the open air, cold baths, the avoidance of stress and negative emotions. \n\nPain and boredom.\n\nThe human experience is characterized by a constant struggle of avoiding both pain and boredom, but this is a fool’s errand, because, \n\n“in the degree in which we are fortunate enough to get away from the one, we approach the other. Life presents, in fact, a more or less violent oscillation between the two.”\n\nIt’s obvious how we can win the battle against the first enemy, pain. This is an objective condition. Good health, and also enough money and property to live comfortably. Chances are, if you are watching this YouTube video, your problem, in Schopenhauer’s terms, is not pain, but boredom.\n\nBoredom is a subjective state of mind. Therefore, the cure for boredom is found within yourself. The cure for boredom is the development of the intellect – study!\n\nHowever, there’s an obvious point to be made here: in order to develop your talents, or enjoy art, or read philosophy, you need free time. And in order to have free time, you need money.\n\nMoney, for Schopenhauer, is simply the means with which you buy time. Money, by itself, is never the goal. But Schopenhauer isn’t a dreamer either. He won’t tell you that you can be happy as a starving artist, living on the street, so long as you’re chasing your passion.\n\nIf you’re lucky, you are born into a wealthy family. If you’re like most of us, you’re not so lucky, and you need to work to earn money.\n\nBut having to work for money is not the biggest obstacle to a happy life. The real problem, is greed.\n\n“Riches, one may say, are like sea-water; the more you drink the thirstier you become…”\n\nIn your quest for money and wealth, there is constant pressure on you to limit your desires. Money has a tendency to take hold of someone. People want more money than they need – it becomes an addiction. \n\nBefore you know it, the money you earn is not simply your ticket to freedom. You want a big house, a fancy car, a huge pool. Champagne and oysters. The trick is to keep your desires low and your money high. If you allow yourself to get trapped into keeping up with the Joneses, your money becomes useless because you spend everything you make.\n\nThe goal of money is to be free, not become a slave to your possessions or luxurious lifestyle.\n\nAgain we find Schopenhauer in agreement with the Stoics, and the Greeks in general.",

    "title": "SCHOPENHAUER: The Importance of Getting Up Early (Don't Waste Your Morning)",
    "description": "“Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.”\n\nWaking up early in the morning is not just something busy CEOs or high-profile athletes do. Back in 1851, Schopenhauer already wrote on the importance of waking up early and not wasting your mornings. \n\n“Do not shorten the morning by getting up late, or waste it in unworthy occupations or in talk; look upon it as the quintessence of life, as to a certain extent sacred.”\n\nThis advice is hidden within a short essay on imagination. Schopenhauer warns against daydreaming, but even more against daydreaming at night, or in the evening. \n\nWhen we’re awake at night, thinking about our life, imagining how things could have gone differently, pondering over our regrets or missed chances, we are harming ourselves. Not necessarily because thinking about our past choices is wrong, but because when we do these things at night, we tend to be too hard on ourselves.\n\nIf you have work to do; if you need to study, or want to create art, or spend some time thinking, then do so in the morning. If you want to reflect on your own life, where you are and where you want to go; do so in the morning, when the mind is fresh and the gloominess of the night has passed. \n\nWhen we put this little tidbit of advice together with other recommendations Schopenhauer makes throughout his writings, we can piece together a Schopenhauer-approved morning routine. \n\nIt’s not that different from morning routines you can read about in today’s self-help books. The main elements are all there:\n\n1) Get up early\n2) Take a cold shower (or cold bath, in Schopenhauer’s case)\n3) Have coffee but no breakfast\n3) Get exercise (Schopenhauer walked for two hours per day)\n4) Do the most important work in the morning; Schopenhauer did his writing in the mornings, and did his daily reading in the afternoon, after lunch. Evenings were spent at the theatre or the opera.",

This is inevitable. We must get along with other people to get what we want. We must be cooperative and generally be pleasant to be around. Above all, we must be able to relate to the common man.\n\nFor the intelligent person, and especially the man of genius, this is a big burden to carry. For the genius, it’s hard to relate to the common man. He will inevitably feel alone.\n\nTherefore, it’s for the best if he learns to enjoy solitude. \n\nBut why is society so dull in the first place? Schopenhauer’s answer is elitist: because most people are dull. And it’s exactly because most people are dull, that they are driven to interaction with others. It’s as if the average person is not a full person by himself, and needs others to complete him.\n\nThe intelligent mind can occupy itself and does not need distractions or empty activity. But for the average person, this kind of activity, literally just passing the time, becomes necessary.\n\nHowever, Schopenhauer also concedes that the need for solitude is directly related to age. The younger you are, the more need you have for socializing. This is also because your mind is not yet fully developed: the younger we are, the more we are like others. \n\nThe essay closes with a word of warning. Seclusion, being alone, has its drawbacks. For example, Schopenhauer notes that we become more irritable by being alone. We are more easily annoyed by minor things because we aren’t accustomed to the turmoils of regular life.\n\nA small rock, thrown into a still lake, causes a notable disturbance. The same rock thrown into a stormy sea, not nearly as much. But this is a small price to pay for peace of mind, which we attain by removing ourselves from the stormy seas of society.",

But at the same time, he realizes how enjoying flattery and hating insult, is a core part of our nature.\n\nTherefore, if it’s happiness we’re after, we should try our best to temper this flaw in our nature. \n\nHow do we do this? By becoming more certain of our own abilities and qualities. In other words, by becoming more confident. When you’re sure of yourself, other people can’t throw you off balance; either by praise or by insult.\n\nSelf-confidence is the key to building a solid foundation of happiness.\n\n“Otherwise, a man is the slave of what other people are pleased to think…”\n\nThis is a life-long effort we’re talking about. Perhaps it’s even impossible to completely eliminate the need for being liked – but the journey is still worthwhile. We must fight against this part of our human nature.\n\nIt's also in this chapter we can read about Schopenhauer’s analysis of honor culture. We might do a separate video on this if there’s enough interest, but for the purposes of this series, this would take us too far from the question at hand, which is, how to be happy? Honor culture as Schopenhauer critiques it in this chapter, doesn’t really exist anymore. In the century and a half since this work was written, the knightly ideal of protecting your honor, and challenging someone to a duel, has been lost. Still, if you want to see us tackle this subject, please leave a comment telling us. With enough interest, we’ll do a video on it. \n\nThe next section, then, deals with fame. Schopenhauer distinguishes two ways to become famous: through actions or through works. You might guess he prefers the second method. While actions are soon forgotten, unless they are immortalized by history, works stay alive. \n\nFame is not something to be chased at all costs. Rather, fame should come on its own by the production of great works of art, or by the doing of great deeds. Works which deserve to become famous must be ahead of their time. In other words, they will most likely not be received well in their own time. Fame is a slow process that adds up over time. \n\nBut Schopenhauer is the first to admit that all humans, in some capacity, desire fame. \n\nAnd fame itself will not make you happy. We are back to developing your talents and intellect, because not the fame itself will bring you happiness, but those capacities that allowed you to become famous in the first place.",

In this first part we will briefly introduce the work and go over some necessary context. In following parts, we will do a deep dive analysis. \n\nAs always, we begin with the title. The original German, Der Antichrist, actually has two meanings in English. It can literally mean “the Antichrist”, referring to the character in the Bible that is predicted to come to Earth in the end times.\n\nBut it can also simply mean “Anti-christian”. \n\nNietzsche is obviously being provocative by engaging in this double entendre, which is also why most English translations decide on “The Antichrist” as the title. Although, it must be noted, Nietzsche never uses the term “Antichrist” in the book to refer to the biblical character. He only ever uses the term to mean “Anti-Christian.” \n\nThe title of this work is also less mysterious than, let’s say, Daybreak, Twilight of the Idols, and of course, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It’s obvious what Nietzsche will attempt in this work: a sustained critique of the Christian worldview and morality. \n\nThe Antichrist was actually the first instalment in a planned four-volume work, which Nietzsche could never complete due to his mental collapse. The work was to be entitled:\n\nThe Will to Power: A Transvaluation of All Values\n\nAnd the four volumes making up the work would be:\n\n1. The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.\n2. The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic Movement\n3. The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality, the Most Fatal Form of Ignorance\n4. Dionysus: the Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence.\n\nAs it stands, however, only the first volume, the Antichrist, was released as intended by Nietzsche. There have been attempts to reconstruct Nietzsche’s original vision of this great work but this is controversial. This reconstruction is known as The Will to Power and was heavily edited by Nietzsche’s sister. Because of this, and because Nietzsche never intended these notes for publication in the first place, this reconstruction is not generally considered to be canonical.\n\nBut back to the Antichrist. This work was written in 1888, which makes this book, together with the autobiography Ecce Homo, Nietzsche’s final publication before his descent into madness. Just like with Twilight of the Idols, this means that the book is of a very radical nature. The late Nietzsche pulls no punches in his philosophical writings. He wants to hit hard and provoke his audience. We will see exactly how as this series continues. \n\nMuch of what we will cover in this series, will sound familiar to long-time viewers of the channel. We will talk about décadence, the Will to Power, master and slave morality, and other Nietzschean concepts that were covered in other videos.\n\nIn the next part, we will go over the notion of pity and why Nietzsche thought that pity was one of the most harmful elements of Christianity. \n\nIn earlier works, Nietzsche already spoke out against pity, or compassion. For example, in a paragraph of The Joyful Science, Nietzsche laments how pity leads us away from our own path and our individuality: pity as a distraction.\n\nNietzsche’s demonization of pity or compassion is an obvious attack on Schopenhauer’s philosophy, which held that compassion is the root of all morality. In fact, he is probably directly alluding to Schopenhauer in the above passage. And it is true, that for Schopenhauer, supreme goodness consists in complete compassion for other people and animals, so much so, that the perfectly good person should forget his own individuality altogether!\n\nThis is absolutely appalling to Nietzsche. In this formulation of pity, Nietzsche sees a denial of life, a resignation, a saying of No. A degeneration of man’s primal instinct: the will to power. \n\nPity, driven to its ethical conclusion, will make you a part of the herd by stamping out your individuality. Pity is the primary virtue of slave morality.\n\nBut this is not the whole story. There is another problem with pity. \n\nThe reaction to pity, Nietzsche argues, is always disproportional to the cause. This makes pity extra insidious. Pity is the ultimate emotion of corruption, of degeneracy, because when we are being compassionate, we take the side of the weak and grant them a kind of power which they do not deserve. \n\nBut what is Nietzsche’s endgoal in writing this scathing critique of the Christian faith? Nietzsche wanted a transvaluation of all values – a new system of ethics, of philosophy, a new system of life, completely opposed to the decadent values that he saw were dominating the culture; decadent values that found their source and justification in Christianity.",

    "description": "In this work, Schopenhauer lays out his eudaimonology, or theory on how to lead a happy existence.  This theory will be subject of this video series. \n\nThis first part will serve as an introduction to the work as a whole, while subsequent parts will each tackle a particular section or chapter of the work. If you want to be notified when these subsequent parts are released, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the Bell-button.\n\nThe first thing to be said about this work is how contradictory it is to Schopenhauer’s main philosophy. \n\nThe grand conclusion of The World as Will and Representation is that life is generally not worth living – the world is a hell, and life is full of suffering. Schopenhauer’s highest ethical ideal in this work, is the life of the ascetic: someone who withdraws from the world and turns his back on ordinary life. If you are interested in the philosophy behind all of this, you can check out our big video dedicated to this major work.\n\nHowever, Schopenhauer always maintained that this saintly hermit life is a path only a few individuals can take. The vast majority of people simply don’t have it in them to live their life in this way. \n\nSchopenhauer’s aim with the Wisdom of Life, is to write for the common man, not for the holy saint. In order to do so, he must cast aside the conclusion of his main work, and proceed with pragmatism and realism. We are not concerned with philosophy or the search for truth, we are writing a practical manual on the happy life.",

Previous parts tackled his critique of pity and compassion – decadent emotions of weakness that found their sanction in Christianity. We have discussed Nietzsche’s attack on the so-called theological instinct: the drive to reason away empirical reality and the material world in favor of some kind of Hinterwelt or Beyond: whether it be Schopenhauer’s Will, Kant’s thing-in-itself or Christianity’s Heaven or Kingdom of God.\n\nAnd finally, we saw how, according to Nietzsche, even the message of Jesus Christ himself was distorted by his pupils after he was crucified. \n\nBut what is Nietzsche’s endgoal in writing this scathing critique of the Christian faith? Nietzsche wanted a transvaluation of all values – a new system of ethics, of philosophy, a new system of life, completely opposed to the decadent values that he saw were dominating the culture; decadent values that found their source and justification in Christianity.\n\nNietzsche finds in the Renaissance the revival of pre-Christian Greco-Roman culture, an age of nobler values, above all, a celebration of life. \n\n\nEven the papacy underwent this drastic transvaluation of values during the Renaissance.\n\nThe corrupt Renaissance Popes, who used the riches of the Vatican to live lavish lifestyles full of bacchanalia and banquets, which are generally considered a low-point in Church history, find in Nietzsche’s estimation a celebration of life where previously Christianity had promoted something else.\n\nMartin Luther, the Protestant reformer, launched an attack on what he viewed as corruption and excesses of the Catholic Church. But of course, for Nietzsche, these excesses and this corruption was a good thing. In Nietzsche’s historical analysis, Luther was responsible for the failure of the spirit of the Renaissance to remove Christianity from Europe. \n\nLuther’s Protestant Reformation was a restoration of the old Christian order. \n\n\nLuther’s actions ultimately rendered the Renaissance futile, meaningless. A revolution was preparing itself in Europe, but it was stopped short by the advent of Protestantism. \n\nStill, the message is clear. Nietzsche invites us to look at the Renaissance for inspiration of what he envisions as his project for the future: the Transvaluation of values. In the Renaissance Nietzsche saw a renewed lust for life, an appreciation of beauty, an affirmation of existence, displays of strength and of a healthy culture – in short, in the Renaissance he saw everything that Christianity is not.",

    "description": "WATCH:\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/_V1NFlaO3TE\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/QPvtIG_dgTw\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/pBsXdkKMYCI\n\nThe figure of Jesus Christ is a complicated, complex character in Nietzsche’s writings. On the one hand, Nietzsche is obviously opposed to all values Christianity stands for. On the other hand, Nietzsche speaks high praise of Jesus Christ the person.\n\nTo completely understand this dichotomy, it’s necessary to make a distinction between Jesus Christ, his life and death, and Jesus Christ as he was later interpreted by his pupils, the Apostles, and subsequentely, the Church and its history. \n\nLike many in the 19th century, Nietzsche was very interested in Jesus Christ beyond his depiction in the Gospels, the four books in the Bible that serve as a sort of biography. The Gospels were written decades after the death of Jesus, and they are not historical documents, but religious ones. What this means is that they are not necessarily an accurate depiction of what Jesus was like. The Evangelists, those who wrote the Gospels, had an agenda. And it’s this agenda that Nietzsche finds problematic, and it’s this agenda that has ruined the figure of Jesus Christ, and which, ironically, gave birth to Christianity. \n\nWhen Jesus was crucificied, his Apostles could not believe it. The death of Jesus was an unexpected event: here was the Savior of humanity, tortured and put to death in the most humiliating way possible. Were they misled? What happened? This death of Jesus caused them great anguish. In all likelihood, some of them even felt cheated.\n\nNietzsche tries to understand the psychology of such an apostle.\n\nThe death of Jesus is now seen as a sacrifice, now there is need of a resurrection, or a state of life after death… None of which was really mentioned by Jesus himself. \n\nNietzsche often repeats the sentence “The Kingdom of God is within you.” (Luke 17:21) which is said by Jesus according to the Gospel of Luke. What Jesus meant is that the Kingdom of God is not a place, or not something that will come in the future. The Kingdom of God is within you, it’s a state of mind. \n\nThe Kingdom of God is within you… It’s already here. There is no need for “guilt, “sin”, “resurrection” or no need to be saved, even.\n\nBut where does this distortion come from? It’s rooted in ressentiment. \n\nNietzsche argues that the Apostles, and consequentely, all of Church history, fundamentally misunderstood Jesus. They couldn’t deal with his death, and to make this loss bearable, and justify it to themselves, they invented notions like the afterlife. Now, death does not have the last word… It was a way for the apostles to get back at those who killed their Teacher.",

    "description": "WATCH:\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/_V1NFlaO3TE\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/QPvtIG_dgTw\n\nWhat is Nietzsche’s problem with theologians, and what does he mean exactly when he talks of the theological instinct? \n\nChiefly, Nietzsche points out “idealists” as exemplars of those with theological instinct. The theological instinct is the tendency of philosophers and priests to look at reality with suspicion. \n\nWhen Nietzsche speaks of the theological instinct in the Antichrist, he is referring to this mistake – postulating God as the first cause, as the ultimate reality. Nothing could be further from the truth, according to Nietzsche – the theologian flips metaphysics on its head. He puts first, the thing that should come last, or rather, the thing that should not come at all.\n\nThe idealist philosopher is also guilty of making this mistake. Arthur Schopenhauer and Immanuel Kant, for example, have both reasoned that not this world, but some other world, the Will in Schopenhauer and the thing-in-itself in Kant, is the ens realissimum, or the most real thing. \n\nBut it is not just a metaphysical question. By flipping reality on its head, so to speak, the theologian also flips morality on its head.\n\nThe theological instinct against which Nietzsche declares war, is of course best exemplified not in the philosophy of Kant or Schopenhauer, but in Christianity itself. Thus Nietzsche characterizes Christianity as being completely imaginary: making up imaginary causes which lead to imaginary effects.\n\nWe can see how this theological instinct is, for Nietzsche, the root of everything that is bad with the world. The theological instinct leads to bad metaphysics, which leads to bad ethics, which leads to a distrust of nature, which leads to a distrust of life… Which leads to décadence, weakness, and ressentiment.\n\nAnd the theological instinct finds expression in Kant and Schopenhauer, and with them in the entire tradition of Western philosophy, but most of all, it finds its expression in the religion of Christianity. And against this instinct, against this religion, Nietzsche will wage and attempt to set the record straight.",

TIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 Introduction\n03:29 Decadence & Socrates\n12:31 Morality Against Nature\n18:04 The Weak Against the Strong\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche’s Twilight of the Idols is a short work. It was written in just over a week in 1888, one year before Nietzsche’s mental collapse. \n\nIn the collected works of Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols stands as a sort of summary of Nietzsche’s entire philosophy up until that point.\n\nThe writing style is radical. The contents are radical. There is very little nuance, and the reader gets the impression that Nietzsche is out to shock his audience. Some interpreters have even speculated that in Twilight of the Idols, we can already see the signs of Nietzsche’s coming mental breakdown. \n\nIn this series, we’ll go over the most important ideas present in the book. Because the entire book was written as a sort of summary of the late Nietzsche’s philosophy, this series will also serve as a good introduction to Nietzsche’s thought in general. Still, for a more in-depth overview, we recommend our series on Beyond Good and Evil and the Genealogy of Morals.\n\nTwilight of the Idols is a play on words. Nietzsche is parodying the title of the final opera in the famous Ring-cycle by Richard Wagner: Twilight of the Gods. The pun is more obvious in German: Götterdämmerung versus Götzendämmerung. \n\nThe fourth and final part of Wagner’s Ring cycle ends with the destruction of the gods: Valhalla goes up in flames, the eponymous ring is returned to the Rhinemaidens, the banks of the Rhine river overflow and extinguish the fire. The gods are dead, but the world is born anew. Humans, from now on, are no longer playthings of the gods, but free beings ready to create their own destiny. \n\nSimilarly, Nietzsche envisions a future in which humans are free from the “philosophical gods” of the past – ideas that have come to be regarded as dogmatically true from which mankind must liberate itself.\n\nBut Nietzsche named his book Twilight of the Idols, not Twilight of the Gods. An idol, in a religious context, is a man-made object that is venerated for the deity that it represents. In Christianity, Judaism and Islam, idolatry – the worship of man-made objects – is strictly forbidden. In other words, an idol could be said to be false god. \n\nBy choosing this title, Nietzsche is saying he will set out to destroy certain false gods – mistakes philosophers before him have made.\n\nOne of the most elusive yet most frequently used words in Twilight of the Idols, is the word “décadence.” Interestingly, Nietzsche prefers to use the French term even though he sometimes uses German words like Verfall, Niedergang, or Entartung. In English, we can keep the French term, or use words like Degeneration or even Corruption. \n\nNietzsche uses the term to denote the process by which individuals, or even entire societies or time periods become worse, or, degenerate. Much of Twilight of the Idols is devoted to the description of how this process and works and what that means. \n\nHowever, in true Nietzschean fashion, we never find a real definition or sustained analysis of what degeneration is exactly. It’s up to us, the readers, to piece things together and make a coherent picture out of disparate parts and fragments.\n\nNietzsche will argue that a morality is defined by how it teaches us to deal with these passions. Nietzsche notes that nearly every morality thus far formulated, advocates the quelling of passion.\n\nIt’s not hard to come up with examples. The idea that impulsive emotion is bad, that unbridled lust or greed are problematic, that violent anger is rarely justified – these are all ideas that have become so commonplace they are barely questioned. Every single system of morality, from Stoicism to Buddhism to Kantian ethics – preaches either the control or even the annihilation of emotions.\n\n\nThis is the prototypical example of a morality that seeks to annihilate passion and emotion.\n\nThe great antinomy in this work, is that of the weak versus the strong. If Twilight of the Idols sounds radical to our modern ears, it’s because of this theme of strong versus weak. \n\n\nTwilight of the Idols is full of criticism. Criticism of the modern age, criticism of Christianity, criticism of German culture, even attacks on individual writers such as Thomas Carlyle and Ernest Renan.\n\n\nIt all starts with the world. Specifically, the material world as it is given to us. Nietzsche challenges us to engage with the world as it presents itself to us. No easy task, considering the rich tradition and history of being sceptical of the world. Christians, of course, disregard the material world in favor of Heaven or the Kingdom of God. And Western philosophy too, broadly speaking, has not much good to say about the world either…",

Experience comes before learning – this is how humans make sense of the world around them. When ideas are generated in this way, there is an obvious link between an observation and the subsequent idea. \n\nTraditional education flips this dynamic on its head. In traditional, or, articifical education as Schopenhauer calls it, the idea precedes the experience. \n\nWhat happens when you learn the ideas, before you have the necessary experience, is you will apply those ideas wrongly as soon as you step out of the classroom into the real world. \n\nThe teacher is busy cramming the head of the student full of ideas, instead of teaching the student how to think in the first place. Children will then grow up with a worldview that is based on hearsay and opinion, and they are rarely equipped to handle the real world. \n\nChildren are submerged in a ready-made apparatus of opinion and prejudice, and if the real world conflicts with this web of ideas – which is bound to happen as the child grows up, then he will not change his opinion but rather lash out at the world instead. Although lacking the proper term, Schopenhauer is describing here what we would call cognitive dissonance today. \n\nEducation should seek to put observation before ideas and thus mimick the natural way in which humans learn things. \n\nHowever, Schopenhauer also notes that during youth, our faculties of judgment are not yet fully developed. This is why he proposes that in the first years of a child’s education, there will be no subject matter that falls into what we would call “the humanities” today. So no philosophy, no religion, no matters of opinion.\n\nUntil age 16, a child should be taught only those subjects in which objective errors are possible, for example, mathematics or languages. Schopenhauer also mentions history here, but only the kind of history that is concerned with memorization, such as remembering dates. \n\nThe added benefit of this approach, says Schopenhauer, is that our memory is the strongest during our youth. And those things we memorize when we are young, we often remember for life. \n\nTherefore it’s of great importance that these youthful years are used to let children soak up as much quality information as possible. Schopenhauer proposes that a group of experts from every branch of knowledge comes together every 10 years, to decide on a canon of essential knowledge.\n\nSchopenhauer argues that maturity must come with experience. Today, we might say this is the difference between knowledge and wisdom. For Schopenhauer, engaging with the real world is of extreme importance.",

    "title": "Schopenhauer's Philosophy of Religion: Christianity vs Buddhism and Hinduism (all parts)",
    "description": "You may not realize it, but hidden in his collection of essays, Arthur Schopenhauer has worked out a more or less systematic philosophy of religion. This is the first part in a series of videos that will cover Schopenhauer’s unique outlook on religion. If you want to be notified when the other parts come out, please consider subscribing and clicking the bell button.\n\nSchopenhauer’s main gripe with religion is with the distinction they make between meaning in sensu proprio versus in sensu allegorico. \n\n“Sensu proprio” is the Latin term he uses which basically means “in a literal sense.” Sensu allegorico, of course, means “in an allegorical sense.” \n\nWhat happens with religion, is they present some kind of dogma, which might be true in an allegorical sense, but they have to pretend to mean it in a literal sense. Religion cannot pretend its main tenets are merely allegorical because doing so would mean to undermine their own credibility.\n\nIn the second part, we will zoom in on Schopenhauer’s criticism and evaluation of Christianity and the theological problem of reconciling the Old with the New Testament. \n\nThe main religious text in Christianity, the Bible, is composed of the Old and the New Testament. The problem is that Schopenhauer sees an optimistic worldview in the Old and a pessimistic worldview in the New Testament.\n\nIt is pretty well-known that Schopenhauer greatly admired both Buddhism and Hinduism. It’s said he read the Upanishads every night before bed, and at the end of his life he even taught himself Sanskrit. Let’s take a closer look at his thought on these Eastern religions. \n\nRecall how in the previous parts we saw how Schopenhauer calls religions pessimistic or optimistic depending on how they interpret the nature of the material world. According to this classification, Judaism was optimistic while Christianity was pessimistic. \n\nBuddhism and Hinduism of course, are both pessimistic with regards to the material world. \n\nThe Buddhistic acknowledgement that life is suffering, that earthly happiness cannot be found, the strict ascetic lifestyle of Buddhists and Brahmans, these factors are, in Schopenhauer’s lexicon, signs of a pessimistic religion: a religion that regards with contempt the material world and seeks to turn away from it through fasting, meditation, and abstinence. \n\nThe question is, where does this pessimism come from? Ultimately, the pessimistic outlook must stem from an epistemic scepticism regarding the material world. What this means is that there must be a conviction that the material world is not the world of supreme importance, that something exists beyond mere matter, that the material world is an illusion. \n\nWe see how Buddhism and Brahmanism (or Hinduism) are in fundamental agreement (even if there are some particular differences) with Schopenhauer’s metaphysical as well as moral teachings. While New Testament Christianity is certainly in agreement with Schopenhauer’s moral teachings, it is lacking on the metaphysical front. Buddhism and Hinduism, on the other hand, score well on both fronts. For this reason, Schopenhauer ranks the Eastern religions as the most perfect expressions of truth to be found in religion.",

    "description": "Twilight of the Idols PART 1: https://youtu.be/5r2IflhebzE\nTwilight of the Idols PART 2: https://youtu.be/nFbgzoegVNA\nTwilight of the Idols PART 3: https://youtu.be/k43MRQwxzBI\n\nTwilight of the Idols is a notoriously difficult book because of its structure. It seems as if Nietzsche hops from one subject to the next, without a clear or logical method to his madness. In this video we will try to discover the common thread that runs throughout much of the work, so that you may hopefully read Twilight of the Idols with a fresh understanding. \n\nThe great antinomy in this work, is that of the weak versus the strong. If Twilight of the Idols sounds radical to our modern ears, it’s because of this theme of strong versus weak. \n\nBut what does Nietzsche mean when he uses those words?\n\nTwilight of the Idols is full of criticism. Criticism of the modern age, criticism of Christianity, criticism of German culture, even attacks on individual writers such as Thomas Carlyle and Ernest Renan.\n\nThroughout these attacks we can piece together a coherent picture of what weakness entails exactly, and then, of course, we can figure out what “strength” means. \n\nIt all starts with the world. Specifically, the material world as it is given to us. Nietzsche challenges us to engage with the world as it presents itself to us. No easy task, considering the rich tradition and history of being sceptical of the world. Christians, of course, disregard the material world in favor of Heaven or the Kingdom of God. And Western philosophy too, broadly speaking, has not much good to say about the world either…",

    "description": "Twilight of the Idols PART 1: https://youtu.be/5r2IflhebzE\nTwilight of the Idols PART 2: https://youtu.be/nFbgzoegVNA\n\nIn the previous part of this series on Nietzsche’s Twilight of the Idols, we looked at the concept of degeneracy or decadence and what that means on a metaphysical level. In this part, we will explore decadence through a moral lens – we will look at a tiny little chapter in Twilight of the Idols entitled “Morality as Anti-Nature.” \n\nThere are more parts coming out. If you want to be notified when these are released, please consider subscribing to the channel and clicking the Bell button.\n\nNietzsche will argue that a morality is defined by how it teaches us to deal with these passions. Nietzsche notes that nearly every morality thus far formulated, advocates the quelling of passion.\n\n“…owing to the stupidity inherent in passion, men waged war against passion itself: men pledged themselves to annihilate it,—all ancient moral-mongers were unanimous on this point, \"il faut tuer les passions.\"”\n\nIt’s not hard to come up with examples. The idea that impulsive emotion is bad, that unbridled lust or greed are problematic, that violent anger is rarely justified – these are all ideas that have become so commonplace they are barely questioned. Every single system of morality, from Stoicism to Buddhism to Kantian ethics – preaches either the control or even the annihilation of emotions.\n\nAnd of course, Nietzsche singles out one system for attack: Christianity. In particular, he cites the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus says, with regards to sexuality: “if thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.” \n\nThis is the prototypical example of a morality that seeks to annihilate passion and emotion.",

    "description": "Twilight of the Idols PART 1: https://youtu.be/5r2IflhebzE\n\nOne of the most elusive yet most frequently used words in Twilight of the Idols, is the word “décadence.” Interestingly, Nietzsche prefers to use the French term even though he sometimes uses German words like Verfall, Niedergang, or Entartung. In English, we can keep the French term, or use words like Degeneration or even Corruption. \n\nIn this video, we will take a deeper dive into this concept, specifically as it appears in Twilight of the Idols. This is part 2 in a planned series on this late work by Nietzsche. If you want to be notified when subsequent parts come out, please consider subscribing to the channel. \n\nBroadly speaking, the term décadence denotes a process by which some entity becomes worse over time. If you stop working out and lifting weights, you will lose muscle mass, and we can say your muscles start degenerating. \n\nNietzsche uses the term to denote the process by which individuals, or even entire societies or time periods become worse, or, degenerate. Much of Twilight of the Idols is devoted to the description of how this process and works and what that means. \n\nHowever, in true Nietzschean fashion, we never find a real definition or sustained analysis of what degeneration is exactly. It’s up to us, the readers, to piece things together and make a coherent picture out of disparate parts and fragments.",

    "title": "NIETZSCHE: Eternal Recurrence Is Real (in the Will to Power Notes)",
    "description": "Eternalised's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb79IM0UcJM\n\nIf we read the book the Will to Power, which is really a compilation of notes, released after Nietzsche’s death, and compiled by his sister, a different picture of the Eternal Recurrence comes to light. We see an attempt by Nietzsche to offer a kind of materialist framework in which the Eternal Recurrence is not merely a thought-experiment, but an actual state of affairs. \n\nThe problem is, that this compilation of notes is not generally viewed as a canonical work by Nietzsche. That is to say, scholars disagree on whether or not the ideas in this work truly represent Nietzsche’s own views. There is considerable debate as to the influence of his sister in the compilation of these notes. Did she make changes? Did she make things up? Did she add a word or sentence here and there? For the purposes of this video, we will not concern ourselves with these questions, but as we go on, it’s important to keep this in mind. \n\nThe entire final chapter of The Will to Power is devoted to the Eternal Recurrence. 14 notes in total deal with the subject. They present a radically different picture of the Eternal Recurrence than we saw in Nietzsche’s earlier writings. \n\nWe see how the concept of the Eternal Recurrence has become more than a thought experiment, as it was first formulated in The Joyful Science and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. \n\nIf we take this conception of the universe as a fact, it follows that the universe was not created, but that it has always existed. It implies time is not linear, but cyclical. \n\nThe cyclical nature of time is found in other systems of thought, notably in Eastern religion, but also in Norse mythology and Greek philosophy – notably with the Pythagoreans. In fact, the conception of time as linear has only really been found in one religion: the Judeo-Christian one which has since come to dominate Western thought.\n\nBecause of this, Nietzsche finds with his new conception of the Eternal Recurrence another breaking point with Christian values. By asserting the cyclical nature of time as an actual reality instead of a thought experiment, he can deliver another blow to the Christian worldview, which fits into his greater project of bringing about a transvaluation of values.\n\nThe point is that Nietzsche has found a physical basis, not just a theoretical or moral basis, to assign a positive value to the material world. \n\nIf everything repeats itself and comes back again for all eternity, then this present moment, this material world of ours, becomes of great importance. Every moment is eternal. Every single experience of your life is now part of the absolute, part of a perpetual cycle. \n\nOur life is not just “a lightning flash between two eternities”, as Schopenhauer puts it, but an everlasting light. \n\nThis is the most radical formulation of a life-affirming philosophy. By promoting the Eternal Recurrence from a theoretical thought-experiment to an actual, physical reality, Nietzsche seeks to affirm life in a very true and real sense. The Eternal Recurrence becomes a more serious matter. It’s the difference between living your life as if something was true, versus living your life knowing something is true.",

    "title": "NIETZSCHE Explained: Twilight of the Idols - Introduction (pt. 1)",
    "description": "Friedrich Nietzsche’s Twilight of the Idols is a short work. It was written in just over a week in 1888, one year before Nietzsche’s mental collapse. \n\nIn the collected works of Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols stands as a sort of summary of Nietzsche’s entire philosophy up until that point.\n\nThe writing style is radical. The contents are radical. There is very little nuance, and the reader gets the impression that Nietzsche is out to shock his audience. Some interpreters have even speculated that in Twilight of the Idols, we can already see the signs of Nietzsche’s coming mental breakdown. \n\nIn this series, we’ll go over the most important ideas present in the book. Because the entire book was written as a sort of summary of the late Nietzsche’s philosophy, this series will also serve as a good introduction to Nietzsche’s thought in general. Still, for a more in-depth overview, we recommend our series on Beyond Good and Evil and the Genealogy of Morals.\n\nTwilight of the Idols is a play on words. Nietzsche is parodying the title of the final opera in the famous Ring-cycle by Richard Wagner: Twilight of the Gods. The pun is more obvious in German: Götterdämmerung versus Götzendämmerung. \n\nThe fourth and final part of Wagner’s Ring cycle ends with the destruction of the gods: Valhalla goes up in flames, the eponymous ring is returned to the Rhinemaidens, the banks of the Rhine river overflow and extinguish the fire. The gods are dead, but the world is born anew. Humans, from now on, are no longer playthings of the gods, but free beings ready to create their own destiny. \n\nSimilarly, Nietzsche envisions a future in which humans are free from the “philosophical gods” of the past – ideas that have come to be regarded as dogmatically true from which mankind must liberate itself.\n\nBut Nietzsche named his book Twilight of the Idols, not Twilight of the Gods. An idol, in a religious context, is a man-made object that is venerated for the deity that it represents. In Christianity, Judaism and Islam, idolatry – the worship of man-made objects – is strictly forbidden. In other words, an idol could be said to be false god. \n\nBy choosing this title, Nietzsche is saying he will set out to destroy certain false gods – mistakes philosophers before him have made.",

    "description": "“There are three Images of Man fashioned by our modern time, which for a long while yet will urge mortal men to transfigure their own lives…” – Nietzsche, Schopenhauer as Educator.\n\nOne of Nietzsche’s earliest writings are his so-called Untimely Meditations, a collection of essays that lack his later aphoristic and polemic style of writing. One of these essays, entiteld “Schopenhauer as Educator” is of considerable interest. \n\nWe will go over the essay in its entirety in another video. Please subscribe if you want to be notified when it comes out. The purpose of this video is to highlight an interesting typology Nietzsche proposes about halfway through. \n\nNietzsche distinguishes three types of men in the modern world. You could say they are archetypes of sorts: men who set an example that is worthy of being followed. Or are they stages individual men must go through? Nietzsche is not particularly clear on this point. Still, let’s take a closer look. \n\nThe Man of Rousseau is the first type. This type “has the greatest fire, and is most calculated to impress the people” – the Man of Rousseau is a revolutionary. Yet it also a deeply troubled soul, who feels estranged from the modern world. \n\nGoethe’s Man is not angry nor dangerous. Goethe’s Man represents a renewed appreciation of Culture and history. Goethe’s Man is not a revolutionary. \n\nWhere the man of Rousseau seeks to change the world through revolutionary action, Goethe’s man appreciates the world as it is, including its history. Yet he remains troubled. You could say he appreciates art and culture only to distract himself from his own troubles. His life is culturally-minded, full of pleasure, yet it’s an existence going from desire to desire, fundamentally empty. He lacks passion and brute force. \n\nThe Man of Rousseau is passionate but lacks refinement and sophistication. Goethe’s Man is refined, cultured, and sophisticated. But lacks passion. Goethe’s Man needs to become angry.\n\nThe Schopenhauerian Man tells the truth, even if others around him don’t like it. The Schopenhauerian Man speaks to the universal, which greatly irritates common men who are only concerned with the particular. \n\nNietzsche praises the ideal of the Schopenhauerian Man, which is the same creature as the ascetic in Schopenhauer’s philosophy: the sage, the monk, the saint. \n\nThe Schopenhauerian Man is a true philosopher in that he is not concerned with wordly affairs. The Man of Rousseau seeks to change the world. Goethe’s Man tries to appreciate the world in order to forget his own suffering, and the Schopenhauerian Man embraces suffering, and turns away from the world.",

    "description": "Antinatalism is the philosophical belief that assigns a negative value to birth. Antinatalists believe that having children is morally wrong and that one shouldn’t do it. There are a variety of possible ethical arguments to make, but the general tone of the antinatalist position is that existence itself has a negative value. In other words, that it’s better to not exist at all. If non-existence is preferable to existence, then it follows that it’s morally wrong to create new life and doom another being to a life of suffering. \n\nThis video is not about antinatalism in general. Rather, we’re taking a look at Schopenhauer’s position on this question. There seems to be a great misconception regarding Schopenhauer’s views on procreation. \n\nThere is this idea that Schopenhauer was not a complete antinatalist. One philosophy magazine, for example, called Schopenhauer a “proto-antinatalist.” While it’s definitely true that Schopenhauer directly influenced those philosophers who are most famously associated with antinatalism today, like Emil Cioran, in this video we want to argue that there is nothing half-baked about Schopenhauer’s antinatalism. In other words, we want to argue that Schopenhauer was a full-fledged antinatalist, even if the term did not exist at the time.\n\nThe two arguments presented in this video take us to the origin of suffering an Schopenhauer's ethical recommendations. \n\nWe take some ideas from Arthur Schopenhauer's main work, The World as Will and Rpepresentation, and read between the lines a bit to find out Schopenhauer's reasons for his anti-natalist views.",

    "description": "BUY THE BOOK: https://amzn.to/2Pqa092\nWATCH Schopenhauer Explained: https://youtu.be/f-djIdl8WO4\n\nBernardo Kastrup is a Dutch philosopher who counts among the few contemporary philosophers who subscribe to a kind of metaphysical idealism, the notion that reality is essentially mental. He has a PhD in philosophy as well as a PhD in computer engineering.\n\nIn his book, Schopenhauer’s Metaphysics Decoded, he attempts to make a case for Schopenhauer’s metaphysical system. As he explains in the introduction, Schopenhauer’s legacy and influence has mostly been felt in the fields of ethics and aesthetics, and not so much in the field of metaphysics. He calls this “tragic”, and I tend to agree. \n\nThis book, then, is meant as an appreciation as well as an elucidation of Schopenhauer’s metaphysics. At 141 pages it’s a quick read. And it may be too quick of a read for people who aren’t familiar with Schopenhauer at all, and think this book serves as a good introduction. On the other hand, this book is very readable once you have a basic understanding of Schopenhauer’s system. It’s not like you need to plough through the 1000+ pages of the World as Will and Representation first. (Although of course, it would help.) \n\nIf you are a long-time viewer of the channel, and you have watched our series on The World as Will and Representation, you’re good to go.

    "description": "WATCH part 1: https://youtu.be/l_eMcosHDAc\n\nNietzsche assumed Richard Wagner's music and Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy were the products of an overflowing vitality, or a surplus of life. However, in the Joyful Science, he changes his mind. It was a mistake to think Wagner and Schopenhauer are a product of exuberance, rather, Wagner and Schopenhauer are a product of a lack of vitality. \n\nMost notably in his work The Case of Wagner we find a long polemic that seeks to critique Wagner’s music, and with it, Schopenhauer’s philosophy. If there’s enough interest, we’ll do a separate video on Nietzsche versus Wagner. Comment below if you’re interested.\n\nThis video is not about criticism. In this follow-up video, we want to look at what kind of art this late Nietzsche considers good. If bad art procedes from a lack of vitality, what kind of art procedes from a surplus of vitality?\n\nIn the paragraph of the Joyful Science in question, Nietzsche drops four names:\n\n“[Art may] proceed from gratitude and love:—art of this origin will always be an art of apotheosis, perhaps dithyrambic, as with Rubens, mocking divinely, as with Hafiz, or clear and kind-hearted as with Goethe, and spreading a Homeric brightness and glory over everything.”\n\n\n\n\n--- Music in the video (CC)\nCanon in D Major by Kevin MacLeod is is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0-licence. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100301\n\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

    "description": "WATCH:\nPt. 1: https://youtu.be/f9EVlUJyrQg\nPt. 2: https://youtu.be/XAXj06hZe5I\n\nIt is pretty well-known that Schopenhauer greatly admired both Buddhism and Hinduism. It’s said he read the Upanishads every night before bed, and at the end of his life he even taught himself Sanskrit. Let’s take a closer look at his thought on these Eastern religions. \n\nRecall how in the previous parts we saw how Schopenhauer calls religions pessimistic or optimistic depending on how they interpret the nature of the material world. According to this classification, Judaism was optimistic while Christianity was pessimistic. \n\nBuddhism and Hinduism of course, are both pessimistic with regards to the material world. \n\nThe Buddhistic acknowledgement that life is suffering, that earthly happiness cannot be found, the strict ascetic lifestyle of Buddhists and Brahmans, these factors are, in Schopenhauer’s lexicon, signs of a pessimistic religion: a religion that regards with contempt the material world and seeks to turn away from it through fasting, meditation, and abstinence. \n\nThe question is, where does this pessimism come from? Ultimately, the pessimistic outlook must stem from an epistemic scepticism regarding the material world. What this means is that there must be a conviction that the material world is not the world of supreme importance, that something exists beyond mere matter, that the material world is an illusion. \n\nWe see how Buddhism and Brahmanism (or Hinduism) are in fundamental agreement (even if there are some particular differences) with Schopenhauer’s metaphysical as well as moral teachings. While New Testament Christianity is certainly in agreement with Schopenhauer’s moral teachings, it is lacking on the metaphysical front. Buddhism and Hinduism, on the other hand, score well on both fronts. For this reason, Schopenhauer ranks the Eastern religions as the most perfect expressions of truth to be found in religion.",

The problem is that Schopenhauer sees an optimistic worldview in the Old and a pessimistic worldview in the New Testament.",

    "description": "You may not realize it, but hidden in his collection of essays, Arthur Schopenhauer has worked out a more or less systematic philosophy of religion. This is the first part in a series of videos that will cover Schopenhauer’s unique outlook on religion. If you want to be notified when the other parts come out, please consider subscribing and clicking the bell button.\n\nSchopenhauer’s main gripe with religion is with the distinction they make between meaning in sensu proprio versus in sensu allegorico. \n\n“Sensu proprio” is the Latin term he uses which basically means “in a literal sense.” Sensu allegorico, of course, means “in an allegorical sense.” \n\nWhat happens with religion, is they present some kind of dogma, which might be true in an allegorical sense, but they have to pretend to mean it in a literal sense. Religion cannot pretend its main tenets are merely allegorical because doing so would mean to undermine their own credibility.",

    "description": "Chapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n7:54 First Essay\n18:27 Second Essay\n32:03 Third Essay\n\n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals is considered by many to be Nietzsche's masterpiece. It certainly is one of the more accessible works, as it (largely) lacks the poetry and allegory of Thus Spoke Zarathustra and is not as aphoristic as Beyond Good and Evil. On the Genealogy of Morals consists of three essays which will be tackled each in their own, separate video. The introductory part of the video aims to provide a solid understanding by first asking the question: \"What exactly is Nietzsche's genealogical method?\" and situating the relevance of the Genealogy in the bigger Nietzschean corpus (namely: the transvaluation of all values and setting humanity up for a philosophy and morality of the future.)\n\nThe second part tackles the first essay of Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals. Much of it will sound familiar to those who have read Beyond Good and Evil or Daybreak. Nietzsche makes a historical-genealogical (even linguistic) case for the good/bad and good/evil dichotomy. \n\nIn the third part, we see Nietzsche dive deep into prehistory towards the creation of a morality of custom which leads to man's instinct for cruelty being repressed, and finally, turn inwards.\nThe bad conscience, in this analysis of Nietzsche, is not \"the voice of God\" as Kant and Christianity claim. Rather, the bad conscience is the paradoxical self-torture and self-pleasure that results from a drive for cruelty which cannot be directed externally and therefore must wreck havoc internally.\nThis is a notoriously difficult essay and it has been somewhat overlooked as a result. With this video, we hope to do it justice.\n\nIn the fourth and final part, we arrive at the grand conclusion. Nietzsche explores the question: \"What do ascetic ideals mean?\" Throughout history and throughout different types of men: the artist (Wagner), the philosopher (Schopenhauer), the aesthete (Kant) but most importantly, the priest (Christianity) and the scholar (scientists like Darwin and Copernicus). Nietzsche will argue that a Will to Nothingness underpins the ascetic ideal: it gives meaning to our suffering. Because, as Nietzsche said it at the start: Man would sooner will nothingness, than not will at all. \n\nThank you so much for watching.

    "description": "Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaDxR7zOymI\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_3lkq_tAk\nPart 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwoLPrywnqs\n\nWelcome to the final instalment in our series on Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals. In this video, we arrive at the grand conclusion. Nietzsche explores the question: \"What do ascetic ideals mean?\" Throughout history and throughout different types of men: the artist (Wagner), the philosopher (Schopenhauer), the aesthete (Kant) but most importantly, the priest (Christianity) and the scholar (scientists like Darwin and Copernicus). Nietzsche will argue that a Will to Nothingness underpins the ascetic ideal: it gives meaning to our suffering. Because, as Nietzsche said it at the start: Man would sooner will nothingness, than not will at all. \n\nThank you so much for watching.

Rather, the bad conscience is the paradoxical self-torture and self-pleasure that results from a drive for cruelty which cannot be directed externally and therefore must wreck havoc internally.\nThis is a notoriously difficult essay and it has been somewhat overlooked as a result. With this video, we hope to do it justice.\n\nThe fourth, and final part, is coming soon. Please subscribe if you want to be notified when it's up.",

It certainly is one of the more accessible works, as it (largely) lacks the poetry and allegory of Thus Spoke Zarathustra and is not as aphoristic as Beyond Good and Evil. On the Genealogy of Morals consists of three essays which will be tackled each in their own, separate video. This introductory video aims to provide a solid understanding by first asking the question: \"What exactly is Nietzsche's genealogical method?\" and situating the relevance of the Genealogy in the bigger Nietzschean corpus (namely: the transvaluation of all values and setting humanity up for a philosophy and morality of the future.)\n\nThis is a planned four-part series.

    "description": "WATCH: Nietzsche Explained: Beyond Good and Evil (all parts):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIHXZUltfqk\n\nStoicism is becoming increasingly popular as a philosophy of life in the 21st century. Yet, another popular philosopher, Nietzsche, seems to take a big stand against Stoicism most notably in a famous passage in Beyond Good and Evil. The Stoic is accused of hypocrisy, of arguing in circles, and of denying life itself.\n\nYet this is not the whole picture. Aside from the famous passage in Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche is more nuanced in other works, most notably The Gay Science (The Joyous Science) and his little-known work Daybreak.\n\nIn this video we take a look at Nietzsche's writings on Stoicism. We take a deeper look at a disturbing passage in Epictetus's Enchiridion, and we try to clear the fog a little bit: did Nietzsche hate the Stoics, or not? It will be seen that Nietzsche's view is more nuanced although he does have big problems with the Stoic philosophy.\n\nWould Nietzsche prefer Caesar over Marcus Aurelius? Probably. Did he HATE Marcus Aurelius? Probably not.",

This video attempts to set the stage for a deeper understanding of this seminal work of German philosophy.\nIn this first part, we explore the significance of the title, Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future, and we introduce the concept of the \"philosophical prejudice\" which is the main theme of the work. Nietzsche believed \"other philosophers\" (all those who came before him; notably Descartes, Kant, Plato, Schopenhauer and the Stoics) suffered, unbeknownst to them, from hidden presuppositions. Nietzsche, the philosopher with the hammer, seeks to destroy these presuppositions and lead the charge in the creation of a new philosophy of the future. \nIn this first part we mainly discuss Nietzsche's treatment of Descartes famous \"cogito ergo sum\", \"I think, therefore I am\" argument.\n\nThe Will to Power is one of the most famous concepts in Nietzsche's philosophy. In the second part we will explore the concept as it appears in the work, Beyond Good and Evil.  \n\nNietzsche's problem with the old philosophers of the past, such as Kant, Descartes, Spinoza, and Schopenhauer, continue. He accuses these philosophers not of having a will to Truth, but of having a will to Power. He then asks us the question: can this will to power explain the state of affairs in the world? Do we even need Christianity, or some complex “otherworldy” philosophy, like those of Schopenhauer, Spinoza, or Kant? What if the world is Will to Power — and nothing besides? What does that look like? This part explores Nietzsche’s tentative answer.\n\nIn the third part on Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, we explore the concept of slave morality. Particularly as it pertains to Christianity and Schopenhauer's philosophy. A lot of what is said in this video, is elaborated on in Nietzsche's subsequent work, On the Genealogy of Morals. If this video does well, we will release a full video on this seminal philosophical work.\n\nNietzsche's main critique on Christianity is that the Christian is weak; anti-life; unnatural. Why? Because the Christian (as does Schopenhauer) regards this world as not that important: it's a preparation for the afterlife. Christians think this because they are a powerless class, as opposed to the ancient Romans who were their historical enemies. The slave revolt in morals is a famous Nietzschean concept and appears together with \"ressentiment\" in Beyond Good and Evil.",

    "description": "Arthur Schopenhauer is one of the most influential German philosophers. His philosophy of the Will has influenced thinkers and scientists such as Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, and even Albert Einstein. In many ways, Schopenhauer will also anticipate existentialism. In this documentary on the philosophy of Schopenhauer, we take a deep dive into Schopenhauer's magnum opus: The World as Will and Representation. We look at Schopenhauer's metaphysical system, his indebtedness to Immanuel Kant, and his philosophy of the Will. \n\nThis video also explores Schopenhauer's ethics and focuses on two recommendations: compassion and asceticism. We also introduce the concept of \"agape\", or divine love. Schopenhauer's intense focus on the individual, could be seen in some ways as a precursor to the existentialism movement later in philosophy. \n\nThirdly: Schopenhauer has sometimes been called \"the artists' philosopher\" because of his lasting influence on art. Art, for Schopenhauer, is a way for us to forget our suffering, even for only a short time. And music was the most perfect means to do so. Lots of artists took Schopenhauer's aesthetic theory to heart and felt emboldened in the pursuit of their craft as a result. We also touch upon his rediscovery of the Platonic Ideas.",

We also touch upon his rediscovery of the Platonic Ideas.\n\nWatch: SCHOPENHAUER Explained: Metaphysics of the Will: \nhttps://youtu.be/i87hX_uznEQ\nWatch: SCHOPENHAUER Explained: Ethics of Compassion (pt. 2)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAeKylqj-Xg",

    "description": "In the second instalment in our series on German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, we discuss his ethics. In the first video we saw how Schopenhauer thinks of the world, but the question now arises: what do we DO with that knowledge? This video explores Schopenhauer's ethics and focuses on two recommendations: compassion and asceticism. We also introduce the concept of \"agape\", or divine love. Schopenhauer's intense focus on the individual, could be seen in some ways as a precursor to the existentialism movement later in philosophy. The next part in this series will deal with the most famous aspect of Schopenhauer's philosophy: his aesthetics.

    "description": "Arthur Schopenhauer is one of the most influential German philosophers. His philosophy of the Will has influenced thinkers and scientists such as Sigmund Freud, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, and even Albert Einstein. In many ways, Schopenhauer will also anticipate existentialism. In this video, the first in a series on the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, we take a deep dive into the first part of Schopenhauer's magnum opus: The World as Will and Representation. We look at Schopenhauer's metaphysical system, his indebtedness to Immanuel Kant, and his philosophy of the Will. \n\nIn subsequent videos we'll discuss Schopenhauer's ethics and aesthetics.
