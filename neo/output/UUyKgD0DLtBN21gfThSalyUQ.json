    "title": "The Hidden Heresy Behind  \"Justice.\"",
    "description": "Black Liberation Theology is another piece of the social justice puzzle that is disturbing and fascinating. When sermons focus more on resistance than repentance, something’s off. People may not recognize Black Liberation Theology by name, but the worldview seeps in through sermons, social media, “woke” activism, and justice movements within the church. I had an incident happen in the summer of 2025 that caused me to see the race issue in 4K, and I don't think I'll ever be the same after it. I mean that in a good way. Because it's caused me to understand a few things. First, the race and social justice warriors aren't going anywhere. We must stand firm and prepare ourselves. Second, too many Christians think they're doing the right and biblical thing by promoting Critical Race Theory and staying in Black Liberation churches. They’ve started fighting the wrong battle. Focusing on systems instead of sin, activism instead of repentance.\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "title": "The Conspiracy Mind Virus That Explains Everything",
    "description": "Have you ever seen an ideology that is so out there, so evil, dangerous, and just absolutely wild, and think… there's NO way that people are going to believe this, because it's just so insane and untethered from reality? \n\nNo, I’m not talking about the Woke Left. \nI’m talking about the Woke Right. Or as some have appropriately put it: The Woke “Reich.”\n\nIn my longest interview yet, I brought on my friend Will Spencer, a former New Ager who was also pulled into this world of woke-right propaganda. \n\nTo understand the woke right, you have to understand that their worldview begins with: “the Jews are to blame for everything, and the Post World War 2 consensus is nothing more than a massive cover-up designed to protect them.” From there, every modern problem becomes a conspiracy: media, banks, academia, culture, medicine, even Pearl Harbor and 9/11. And yes… even themurder of Charlie Kirk. \nSome people will watch this and immediately decide I’m the enemy. But this needs to be exposed. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00- Why this video will be different than my rest.\n06:07- How I stumbled upon this: hypocrisy, aggression towards Allie Beth Stuckey, Seth Dillon standing up to “No enemies to the right” and Tucker Carlson’s interview. \n07:48- Unfortunately, I have to introduce you to Nick Fuentes here. (Warning: some inappropriate clips are shown here, but people need to see who this boy-man is who is being platformed and praised.)\n15:24- Defining terms. What exactly IS the Woke Right?\n20:49- a crucial key to understanding this worldview: Blame the Jews. \n22:33- A risk I’m taking. (I don’t care.)\n25:40- Beginning of interview: Will’s background and why he has some authority to talk about this. \n38:16- How Will ended up writing his viral Neo-Nazi article.\n42:47- Why the New Age world can open people up to conspiracy;how there’s a Neo-Nazi type movement already within the New Age world. \n45:38- HoIocaust denialism is very old, how it flourished in the backrooms of the internet (like 4chan and the manosphere), and how Will got caught up in this world. What was happening in private in those chat rooms now has a captive audience. \n1:01:36- Will further defines the “Woke Right.” \n1:06:09- How did people see the Woke Right coming? How did the rise of the progressive Woke Left give rise to the Woke Right? \n1:12:34- What does the “Post World War 2 consensus” have to do with this? \n1:21:40- How does the Woke Right explain this “grand conspiracy” that “the Jews” are at fault for virtually all the societal issues we have? \n1:27:04- a CORE feature of the Woke Right: Conspiracy. \n1:33:51- What’s “Hollywood” about the HoIocaust? Will explains why we need to look beyond just the morality of the HoIocaust and look at the ideology. \n1:40:50- Covering some common slogans in the Woke Right. (Woke Left had Black Lives Matter, Love is Love, No Justice, No Peace, etc.)\n1:44:54- “Christian Nationalism” slogan.\n1:49:36-“America First” slogan.\n01:51:36- “Christ is King” slogan \n1:55:21- How the Woke Right views Jesus: as an authoritarian political leader. \n2:01:47- The “just asking questions” slogan. How do “vibes and feelings” play a part in this?\n2:07:30-  “No enemies to the right.”\n2:11:01- The Woke Right feature of “Vibes” and “Intuition.”\n2:13:41- Christian Nationalism. Why are some reformed Christians spearheading a lot of the Woke Right poison? What does “red pilled” mean? \n2:24:23- How the Woke Right takes legitimate concerns and twists them into something ugly, conspiracy-soaked, and spiritually toxic.\n2:30:15- Having fair and legitimate conversations and disagreements about Israel without being accused of being anti-semetic or on the Woke Right\n2:34:40- How Candace Owens’ hatred for the Jews made them responsible for themurder of Charlie Kirk.\n2:36:53- China is a MUCH bigger issue than Israel.\n2:42:35- How the hyper-focus on the Jews has given cover to the progressive left’s lunacy.\n2:44:48- Kanye West.\n2:48:02- Nick Fuentes.\n2:49:16- Tucker Carlson\n3:00:57- Candace Owens\n3:02:22- Andrew Tate\n3:06:06- The influencers.\n3:07:29- Keeping people loyal through blackmail\n3:11:10- Joel Webbon\n3:16:00- The Woke Right and Islam partner over shared hatred for the Jews:“The enemy of my enemy is my friend.”\n3:17:50- Will’s plea to people caught up in the Woke Right mind virus.\n\n●Will's Viral Article: https://christoverall.com/article/longform/the-dangerous-secret-your-young-men-are-keeping-neo-nazi-thought-has-entered-the-church/\n●Substack post with additional resources:\nhttps://www.willspencer.blog/p/defeating-holocaust-denialism\n●Seth Dillon’s article: https://www.thefp.com/p/the-foolishness-of-no-enemies-to-the-right?utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=organic-social&utm_source=twitter\n●How the Woke Left Created the Woke Right: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXcd_3JhYFM\n●Share the Arrows backlash: https://youtu.be/sC9ZqJuGaZU?si=BRXH0dbY8NREpq8B\n●My favorite interview Will has done on the Woke Right: https://youtu.be/O6YyMqa0fDU?si=KRBTrfEZlSbhhF3V",

    "description": "Christians in Nigeria are being hunted, kidnapped, and killed and somehow it barely makes a blip in Western media. Every two hours a Christian is murdered, but you’d never know it from the outrage-industrial complex over here.\n\nI talked with Kevin Briggins and Laura Zifer to talk about what’s really happening on the ground, why Islamist groups are targeting believers, why the Nigerian government can’t (or won’t) stop it, and why the West acts like speaking honestly about Islamic ideology is some kind of social crime. Kevin and Laura bring incredible clarity to this tough topic. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:29- Who are Kevin and Laura and why are they qualified to talk about this topic?\n03:40- What is going on in Nigeria?\n10:15- Now that we've gone over what is going on, let's talk about WHY it's going on and why it’s NOT reported on. \n31:43- There seem to be Muslims who are perfectly peaceful. Would they call out and denounce the terrorists who are doing these atrocious things?\n34:00- very important things to know about the Quran and the Hadith\n38:29- how Mohammed would be victorious through terror, and the Islamic strategies that are the “long con” to their victory of Jihad and Sharia Law.\n42:14- What about Muslims who were like Nabeel Qureshi who were genuinely ignorant to a lot of of Islamic teachings? Laura shares an interesting story here. \n46:56- Mohammad’s child marriages… one to a nine year old and how the Muslim Brotherhood changed the law in Egypt in 2011 to make child brides legal. All of this explains why they’re taking places over like Nigeria. \n48:48- This is why it’s startling that so many Muslims are in American politics, and how not talking about Islamic terrorism, I'm calling everybody Islamophobic, has given Islamic terrorists a foothold in America. \n53:05- How Islamic terrorists are getting paid to murder Christians. \n58:04- One word to describe the major difference between Islam and Christianity\n1:08:58- What can we do about Islamic terrorism and their murdering Christians around the world?\n01:17:51- The shocking difference of Afghanistan in the 1970s compared to today.

The interview focused on meaning and purpose. It was actually about five hours of content, but the video itself ended up being 3 1/2 hours. I have asked Greg to share his reflections on the interview, what he observed, and the points he wanted to make but didn't get the opportunity to. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n03:10- The interview was over 5 hours long. What didn't make the cut?\n9:00- The difference between “atheist” and “agnostic.”\n11:19- What are Greg's thoughts on Alex bringing up “pansychicism” and why consciousness is such a stumbling block for him? What does this have to do with Gnosticism?\n23:00- the topic of suffering got brought up. Here’s the WILD meaning and consequences of Karma according to Dr. K and Greg’s analysis. \n32:37- Unpacking Dr.K’s claims of spiritual sensitivity and his fixation on Greg being an “enlightened” person. \n39:04- A double standard where Alex held Greg’s feet to the fire with suffering in the Christian worldview, but not Dr. K. Getting into evil and suffering. \n48:05- Greg shares more of his thoughts about evil and suffering in Genesis 3 that Alex kept bringing up. He shares what he’s been thinking of since then. \n54:35- The Christian worldview \n59:15- What more Greg would have said in his closing remarks. \n1:04:16- What would Greg say to Steven Bartlett if he could after having this conversation?\n\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "My friend Dr. Frank Turek has been through a lot the last two months. So we talk about a lot in today's video. \n\nWe talk about his recent UC Berkeley (Or... the \"Bezerkely\") event that turned chaotic because of some violent activists, including Antifa, and why this kind of thing keeps happening. We get into how certain parts of progressivism seem to treat hostility as a feature, not an accident. We also discuss something called the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is why so many people online sound confident but have no idea what they’re talking about. From free speech to critical thinking, we talk about why testing claims, demanding evidence, and rejecting sensationalized conspiracy theories are more important than ever. Especially when those falsehoods have led to real threats toward Frank and others.

    "title": "The Lie of Polygamy: Exposed Biblically, Logically & Ethically|with @InspiringPhilosophy",
    "description": "Why is polygamy sorta trending, and why are people saying it's biblical? What in the nope is going on?\n\nPolygamy shows up in the Old Testament, in Islam, in Mormonism, but I've been seeing this promoted by some Christians today, and I'm surprised to see it growing. From TLC's Sister Wives to influencers like Rich Tidwell and Rob Kowalski to Muslim polygamist circles, this whole trend concerns me. Some of their arguments are that polygamy is really God’s design for marriage. I started paying closer attention to this when a friend sent me an Instagram profile of a man who claims to be a Christian and has two wives. From there, I discovered numerous others making the same claims.\n\nTo unpack this, I invited my friend Michael Jones onto my channel. He’s addressed polygamy several times on his own platform, and together we break down the top biblical arguments polygamists use, expose the logical flaws, and look at the devastating psychological impact it has on women, children, and families. If you’ve ever wondered why God regulated but never celebrated polygamy, this conversation will hopefully give you some answers.\n\n● Check out Michael's YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/@InspiringPhilosophy?si=JNzUYxk8H5WYhy5C\n● Michael's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/inspiringphilosophy_?igsh=MWluYWt2Y2N6ODh6OQ==\n\nTimestamps: \n01:50 – Polygamy is in the Bible. What is it?\n05:22 – Some popular polygamists are claiming that Christians have been lied to about polygamy in the Bible. Is this true? And looking at a surprising verse that seems to outlaw polygamy.\n12:44 – If polygamy is such a big sin, why does it seem to be practiced and endorsed in the Old Testament?\n14:19 – Some pushback: God never strictly forbade polygamy.\n17:23 – Why polygamy is so harmful according to studies.\n22:51 – “First Wife Syndrome”\n26:23 – The psychological stress among polygamist wives.\n29:25 – An observation from watching TLC’s “Sister Wives”\n31:11 – What do the studies show about the men’s struggles?\n33:20 – Comparing polygamists like Joseph Smith, who stated “religious reasons” to practice polygamy, to modern polygamists, and giving pushback on the argument that men don’t actually love their wives.\n37:23 – Giving some arguments from the perspective of polygamists on why they think polygamy is biblical, and how Martin Luther is used as a resource to support polygamy.\n43:25 – Some important commentary on this Martin Luther resource\n44:57 – Revisiting the hypothetical question of the consequences of polygamy being outlawed in the Old Testament.\n47:57 – Why does polygamy seem to be prevalent throughout the Old Testament, but almost nonexistent in the New Testament?\n50:12 – Playing a video from a prominent polygamist and getting Michael's thoughts on it.\n59:55 – Why arguments for polygamy sound like spiritual abuse.\n1:02:08 – The societal and civil consequences for polygamy.\n1:10:24 – The poor KIDS.\n\n📚RESOURCES RELATED TO THIS VIDEO📚:\n●https://www.amazon.com/shop/melissadougherty\n●Article on plural marriage: https://richtidwell.com/on-plural-marriage/\n●Mike Winger’s video on polygamy: https://youtu.be/sIlyDjxYtKQ?si=dN4zHTKtqzFioTMu\n●Michael's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UC5qDet6sa6rODi7t6wfpg8g \n● Our Video on Polygamy: https://www.youtube.com/live/JWTcQi9dKa8?si=I66gN88TgHp8YFZz\n\n📲FOLLOW📲:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwiX: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\n\n💡SEMINARY💡:\nLooking for a solid theological education?

    "description": "I don’t care if this makes me lose followers. We must learn to think critically. Honor Charlie Kirk’s memory by thinking the way he did: not blindly believing, getting swept up in conspiracy, but following the truth through verified evidence, not what one person claims is true. Paranoia is not discernment. Confidence is not competence. Charisma is not credibility. When someone needs to be the hero, the victim, and the authority all at once, then I have a hard time believing that truth is their goal. Seems like they're after power and control. \n\nAlso, I made this before Candace came for Allie Beth Stuckey. Can we all please take a moment to pray for her? She’s been hit with an onslaught of unnecessary and awful hate over the last month. She doesn’t deserve it. Allie has consistently been a phenomenal example of thoughtful critique, biblical love, and steady patience. With everything that’s been thrown her way, Allie’s grace and composure have been a masterclass in integrity. That’s the kind of example I wish more women would follow.\nI fully expect a wave of backlash from Candace’s followers. I think that’s exactly why so many people stay silent. But I just don’t care. Remember: the ones trying to bring people back to reality aren’t being divisive. It’s the ones disconnected from reality who are. This is a core reason why I have such strong issues with unfounded and sensationalized conspiracy theories.\n\nI will GLADLY take this video down and publicly repent if Candace Owens can prove, with verifiable evidence:\n\n1. *How* TPUSA executives or associates were directly involved in Charlie Kirk’s murder with specific, detailed, and corroborated facts verified by law enforcement, journalists, or court proceedings *beyond* Candace Owens' personal claims.\n2. That her claim that Tyler Robinson did not commit the murder is backed by credible, independently verified evidence... not speculation, assumptions, or anonymous claims, and *beyond* Candace Owens' personal claims.\n3. That her alleged “inside sources” or “federal leaks” actually exist, and that they’ve provided verifiable, legally obtained, and independently confirmed information. Simply asserting “I have sources” or “I know people on both sides” without documentation, names, or corroboration does not count as proof *beyond* Candace Owens' personal claims.\n4. That multiple reputable, independent investigators or journalists, outside of Candace Owens herself and her own media network, have verified her claims through credible, documented evidence.\n5. That none of her public statements or implications have recklessly misled her audience, defamed innocent people, or emotionally exploited a murder case for engagement or personal branding.\n\nUntil then, everything stated in this video remains satirical opinion and commentary on publicly available information and public statements.\nI genuinely hope I'm wrong. \n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "title": "When Activists Tried to Silence Her, They Exposed Themselves",
    "description": "I saw a video the other day of progressive activists obnoxiously and aggressively silencing a 16-year-old girl because she refused to play basketball against a boy.  \n\nIt really caught my attention, and my heart just went out to this girl. The reason I want to highlight this is that these activists tried to silence this girl in the most antagonistic way, but I think their nonsense actually backfired, because it caught my attention. And now I have a good excuse to make a video about their aggressive progressive nopey nonsense ideology. \n\nWhat happened to her exposes the deeper ideology behind modern progressivism, gender activism, and cancel culture. My hope is to help you see how critical theory, toxic empathy, and the culture of victimhood have traded truth for feelings and why that should matter to Christians who care about free speech, fairness, and biblical truth.\n\nBut there's also a strong caution I want to give to Christians. There's a strange phenomenon I'm seeing as a response to the aggressive progressive nonsense, where I'm seeing people who are fighting progressives by using the same tactics. It's like a \"mirrored\" version of the woke left, except on the other side. This is shocking and disturbing. We *must* stay vigilant. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n04:24- The Video.\n09:27- The Activists' Worldview\n24:41- Why They Feel Justified.\n31:07- The \"Free Speech\" Issue.\n35:42- The Progressive Christianity Connection.\n38:43- The Islamic Connection.\n41:28- The Christian Worldview.\n44:45- What Now?\n48:43- A Warning. \n51:43- Bottom Line.\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

So of course, he went out and talked with experts in a variety of different areas, covering everything from angels, demons, to NDEs (near-death experiences), spiritual encounters, and more. I was especially interested in getting his thoughts on NDEs, There's a lot of documentation for many supernatural encounters, and the question I want to ask is: How does this work in a biblical framework? \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00- Intro and a Biblical viewpoint on the supernatural\n06:18- Let’s start with NDE’s (near-death experiences…)\n09:39- What about NDEs that seem like they are not consistent with the Bible? How are they different from deathbed visions?\n19:00- a story about famous atheist, Charles Templeton, and deathbed visions. \n29:30- About hellish NDEs\n33:56- What does the Bible say about angels, and what has people's experience been like with angels?\n39:18- Do we have guardian angels?\n42:18- People who have “angels” as spirit guides- segue into demons. \n49:28- Can a Christian be demon possessed?\n51:53- Satan is not God’s equal.

    "description": "Gnosticism is one of the oldest heresies in church history, and it never really went away. Gnosticism is part of what gives New Thought its roots. Whether it's Word of Faith, LGBTQ ideology, or TikTok theology, it's still in our faces. In this interview, I asked my friend and scholar, Dr. Doug Groothius, to explain what gnosticism is, how Scripture warned against it, and how it shows up in today’s culture, spirituality, and even Christianity itself. I've been wanting to cover this topic for a while, and it won't be the last video I make on this topic. \n\nTimestamps:\n02:59- What is Gnosticism?\n10:33- What are some gnostic practices that we don’t realize are Gnostic?\n17:17- Where did gnosticism even come from?\n19:42- Where is gnosticism warned about in Scripture?\n21:37- What are things in society that are gnostic, but redefined in culture?\n28:46- What does it look like to actually achieve the gnostic view of awakening?\n34:18- Are there connections between gnostic practices and what we see in some churches like Bethel?\n38:00- What are the connections between gnosticism and what we’re seeing in the LGBTQ+ community?\n41:48- Gnostics say that the body is evil, but what does scripture say about our bodies and a physical resurrection? Why is this SO significant?\n48:33- There are many popular gnostic books and ideas in pop culture. What are they and where did they come from? \n50:22- What is the connection between gnosticism and Carl Jung?\n54:20- Is there any good historical or philosophical reason for why we should accept gnostic writings as true?\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

It’s intended to prevent Jehovah's Witnesses from communicating with anyone who questions the organization, which is equivalent to questioning God Himself. \nI think it's really helpful to highlight this kind of stuff because my hope and goal is that Jehovah's Witnesses see through the Watchtower deception, but also so that others watching can learn about manipulation and control in spiritual settings.

    "description": "What we believe about identity didn’t just appear out of nowhere. It has a history, and it’s shaping the way our kids, our churches, and our culture see truth. And this goes beyond just the transgender movement. What's inside you is spiritual and divine. This is your identity, your true authentic self. And if this self says that you are an animal or a fantasy creature? Then \"God\" must be obeyed. This is a topic that continues to fascinate me because the more I understand where this ideology came from, the more I understand spiritual warfare and truth. I sat down with Carl Trueman (Strange New World) and Pastor Todd Pruitt to talk about where this came from, why feelings have replaced reality, and how the Bible gives us a better answer.\n\nWe filmed this before Charlie Kirk's assassination, and then the following discovery that the k*ller was involved in the furry community.

    "description": "I wasn't planning on making a video on my thoughts on the murder of Charlie Kirk. But one thing has been bothering me. I don’t think most people have the slightest idea what they mean when they accuse someone of being a fascist. There's only one man I could think of in the midst of all of this who I thought would be able to speak into this with clarity and wisdom. And that is my professor from Southern Evangelical Seminary, Dr. Bernard Mauser. What actually *is* fascism? What are some of the ironies with this accusation? What part does free speech play? There’s so much more to know about this, but I’m hoping this will give a broader perspective on the *real* hate that killed an innocent man, a brother in Christ, and a father. There is so much more to this conversation, but I did my best to give you some good information. Sorry for the choppy intro. I had to collect myself a few times.\n\nI won’t be monetizing this video. It feels icky to do so.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n16:51- Beginning of Video. What is fascism and why do people use it interchangeably with authoritarianism or Nazis? \n30:42- How is fascism more like communism, and what is the difference between the two? \n36:09- Dr. Mauser shares the Nazis' policies. \n37:27- The irony of accusing people who hold the opposite of fascist policies of being fascist. \n42:44- The biggest enemy to fascism: reason, free speech, and critical thinking. \n49:15- Talking more about antifa. \n51:34- Talking about utilitarianism.\n54:35- Dr. Mauser’s thoughts on us being oppressors who must be stopped, and why is viol ence, a feature of progressivism? Comparing the reaction to Charlie’s deat h to progressive’s reactions. \n59:25- Switching gears to free speech. What does free speech look like under fascism?\n1:02:16- What does free speech look like under our Constitution? \n1:08:30- Why is hate speech still free speech?\n1:09:59- What about what happened with Jimmy Kimmel?\n1:32:16- Why it’s true that if you control speech, then you control thoughts. \n\nMy Seminary Professors:\n●Dr. Mauser's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UCdYXyhX92JYfPpxU-gAiDjQ \n●Dr. Winstead YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UCmGJlcwNscGsfLWXfAz7BnQ \n●Dr. Bridges YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UC6O-hN1LXYchZSREBaIWNJA \n●Dr. Brian Huffling: https://youtube.com/@classicaltheology?si=P7lkOruNgAIcEUYN\n\nResources Related to this Video:\n\n●Debunking the ridiculous conspiracy about Frank Turek: https://youtu.be/9qRKcviiQuE?si=VzO7C-66Id9tzkex\n●Frank’s video discussing Charlie’s last moments and witnessing his murder.

    "description": "I had a video plan to release today, but that was before the events of Wednesday. I think that this would be a more appropriate one to release, considering the events of this last week. I've been asked by more than one person how we should handle the topic of forgiveness with all of the stuff that's been happening. And I think that this conversation might surprise you. And help you. \n\nI think many would be surprised to discover that biblical forgiveness isn't what they think it is. I remember having a very specific \"oh woooowwwww...\" moment when I understood that there was a big difference between biblical forgiveness and what my friend Teasi Cannon calls \"therapeutic forgiveness.\" She was wrong about this for years. So was I. I can’t think of anyone better to talk about forgiveness than Teasi. She’s walked through more hardship than most of us can imagine, not because of her own choices, but because of the sins and failures of others. She’s had more people to forgive than anyone should. But what does forgiveness look like, exactly? Is forgive and forget biblical? What is therapeutic forgiveness, and why is it problematic? In the first half of this video, Teasi shares her story (trigger warning). In the second half, we talk about biblical forgiveness, and Teasi shares what she got wrong for all these years. \n\n● beEmboldened: Freedom From Spiritual Abuse: https://www.beemboldened.com/\n● Teasi's Website: https://www.teasicannon.com/\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "You’ve probably heard stuff like “Christ is in everyone” or “Jesus just came to show us how to tap into our higher self.” It sounds super spiritual and maybe even somewhat Christian, because they throw in a few Bible scriptures to back it up. But it’s actually something completely different. It’s part of a growing belief called Christ Consciousness, and it’s everywhere right now. I used to believe this and thought it was what Jesus and the Bible taught. (I hope you get secondhand ick for me as you read that.) \n\nPeople are using the Christian word “Christ\" but twisting it into something Jesus never taught, while at the same time saying that Jesus taught this very thing. Both cannot be true. So what's going on? In this video, I aim to provide a clear understanding of what Christ Consciousness truly is,  its origins, how it’s leading many people away from the genuine gospel, and what we can do about it. \n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "I'm surprised so many of us quietly struggle with anxiety and fear. Every time I go online, I want to go right back off. Everything feels loud, divided, and uncertain right now, but I always wonder, hasn't it always been this way? Christians aren’t immune to anxiety. In this conversation, I talk with Jeremiah Johnston about the kind of peace the world can’t offer: God’s shalom. It's a pretty cool biblical word. After having his own massive panic attack, God used that to help him really lean into what Scripture taught about this. There's so much rich theology and biblical application here. \n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "Sooo here’s what happened in order:\n1. I saw this year's lineup for the Kenneth Copeland Southwest Believers Convention. (SWBC.) \n2. I was shocked at the leaders who were still aligning with Copeland (Bill Johnson, Creflo Dollar, Benny Hinn, etc), and I shared the lineup on social media. \n3. After I shared this, someone pointed out that Creflo Dollar uses a translation called the “Mirror Translation.” \n4. ...the \"what\" translation? I then looked up said translation.\nI.\nWas.\nSHOOKETH.\n\nTurns out Creflo Dollar is just the tip of the iceberg. Many Word of Faith and Bethel leaders endorse and use this translation. This video is what I found. Here’s a quote from François du Toit, the creator of the Mirror that expresses the heart behind his paraphrase:\n\n“The mission of Jesus was not to begin the Christian religion but to reveal and redeem the image and likeness of God in human form. He did not come as an example for us but of us. Much of popular Christian doctrine reduce the life and teaching of Jesus to yet another ‘display-window’ message, while the very intent of God was to uncover the blueprint life of our design in Christ as in a mirror, where he is introduced to us not as Christ in history, or Christ in outer space, nor even as Christ in a future event, but as Christ in you!”\n\nWow, a translation that teaches a different Gospel and says that you’re divine? Sounds like a bunch of theological nopey nonsense to me. And too many leaders are teaching this nonsense to others.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00- How did I stumble upon the Mirror Translation?\n03:29- Who is François du Toit?\n11:08- What is the Mirror Bible?\n25:57- Watch out for Sectarian Translations\n29:31- What kind of education does François have? (This is where things took a turn in my research.)\n39:05- Word of Faith and Bethel Leaders Using the Mirror Translation\n49:14- A surprising public call out and denouncement of the Mirror\n56:16- My final thoughts\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "Even if you've never heard of him, Robert H Schuller’s influence has a long shadow that reaches into some of the most influential and popular pulpits today. Schuller’s theology blended biblical language with self-help psychology and New Thought metaphysics, all while being a part of the RCA (The Reformed Church in America.) Not many Christians know that he was also basically the Godfather of the Seeker Sensitive movement. In this deep dive, I’m unpacking who he was, what he taught, and why it matters. I will also be giving an analysis of the seeker-sensitive movement. \n\nI sat on the research for this video for a while. This is the longest deep dive I've done so far, and some might find it controversial. A lot of work goes into these deep dives, and I enjoy the research. But I always want to make sure that I am doing my best to give the information with fairness and integrity, but also with boldness and firmness. I believe I've done that. \n\nTimestamps: \n\n05:23- Part 1: Who is Robert Schuller? This will be a short biography and introduction about who Robert Schuller even is, what his accomplishments were, and what he taught. \n23:19- Part 2: Schuller’s “Secret” Theology of Possibility Thinking and his Self-Esteem Gospel, laying the foundation for his motives in church growth.\n1:51:36- Part 3: The Seeker Sensitive Movement. I will go over the brief history of the secret, sensitive movement, the major players in it, the influence that Schuller had, and how we see this manifested today. \n02:17:32- Part 4: The Influence. An overlook of the prominent pastors and leaders who Schuller has directly mentored and influenced, and why this is problematic. But also why it’s sort of not.\n02:51:34- Part 5: The Pros and Cons of the Seeker Movement. Here I'm going give what I would consider to be firm but fair insights on the Seeker Sensitive movement and the purpose of the Church. \n03:27:34: My Conclusion and final analysis. \n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "A while ago, I filmed a conversation with Abdullah, a very kind Muslim. There were some things I did okay, but I think there was a lot I could've done better. So I invited my buddy David Wood on to analyze the conversation. There was a part of his analysis that I found very interesting, and it had to do with the complicated history of the Jewish/Muslim dispute as well as how their own Quran isn't read or understood.

    "description": "This is one of the most important interviews I’ve done so far. It feels like every other week, there’s news about another pastor, worship leader, or Christian influencer caught in some kind of moral failure. Case in point? We had this interview scheduled long before the news about the former lead singer of Newsboys, Michael Tait, broke. \n\nWhat’s going on? In this interview, I speak with Emeal EZ Zwayne from Living Waters about why this keeps happening, how celebrity culture and a lack of real accountability contribute to it, and what kind of damage it does to people’s faith when someone they looked up to falls. We also talk about whether fallen leaders should ever return to public ministry, what true restoration looks like, and how everyday believers can protect themselves from the same kind of temptations. Hopefully, this conversation helps bring clarity, compassion, and change. \n\nEmeal's Info:\n💡Get Fight Like a Man: https://amzn.to/4e8Otcw\n💡Ministry: https://livingwaters.com/\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

In this video, I’m breaking down what affirmations really are and where they actually come from. I'm talking about New Thought teachers like Ernest Holmes, Florence Scovel Shinn, and Emma Curtis Hopkins... you know... names you’ve (probably) never heard of, but their ideas are alive and well on TikTok, in MLMs, on your cousin’s vision board, on your aunt’s “manifest it!” coffee mug, and even in some pulpits. These and other thinkers helped shape a belief system where your words are tools to manifest reality, an idea that’s quietly woven its way into churches, sermons, and your social media feed.

    "description": "A while ago, I put out a post asking Christians for their arguments FOR the enneagram. I was grateful that so many were comfortable sharing their perspective, even though many would disagree. I asked my friend Alexa Cramer, who is with Mama Bear Apologetics, to come on and help address these arguments. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n03:08: What is the Enneagram, the “True Self” vs. the “False Self,” why Richard Rohr is associated with the Enneagram, and the Origins.\n15:50: Argument #1- There’s some hypocrisy here. Why do Christians condemn the Enneagram for its alleged occult roots but not chiropractic care, despite its founder’s spiritualist beliefs?\n18:37: Argument #2-  Intent matters. The Enneagram isn’t inherently wrong because of its origins, despite similar concerns being overlooked in wedding traditions.\n20:52: We can redeem it.\n22:37: It’s a personality test just like Myers Briggs.\n26:13: The Enneagram is a Gospel tool. I’m a believer because of the Enneagram.\n33:19: The Enneagram is a tool that highlights our need for God's grace and helps us align with the gospel, rather than encouraging sin. \n35:38: The Ennegram is a communal tool that can be adapted as we please. \n37:33: A random question I had for Alexa.\n42:45: Richard Rohr is a heretic, sure, but the Enneagram is supported by reputable scientific studies. \n46:35: It’s basically a psychology tool. It helps you understand who you are. If Christians go to therapists, then they are engaged in psychology. The Enneagram is no different on this level.\n48:25: It’s no different than knowing your love language. \n50:07: The Enneagram helped save my marriage. \n52:31: Of all the personality tests, the Enneagram has helped me the most. It focuses on the internal. \n01:06:24: Another question I have for Alexa\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Order Happy Lies: \n● Barnes and Noble: https://tinyurl.com/h3yb2vmz\n● Audible: https://tinyurl.com/4b8j88vp\n● Christianbook: https://tinyurl.com/msvjxt2e\n● Amazon: https://amzn.to/46XmuZO\n\n👀WATCH👀:\n●Alexa's Channel.

In this video, I’ll share what I agree with, what I disagree with, and how it all aligns (or doesn’t) with a biblical worldview. But as I’m learning, it’s never quite that simple. Much like my deep dive into Napoleon Hill, I ended up stumbling into some unexpected controversy with this book, even though that wasn’t my intention. Yet, here we are. I hope to give a fair assessment of this controversy. \n\nThis isn’t a deep dive into Mel Robbins herself, just an honest Christian review of her latest book. I always aim to be as fair and thorough as necessary, which sometimes means the videos end up being a bit longer. It takes many hours of reading, note-taking, and preparation to put something like this together, but my goal is to give you the most accurate and thoughtful insight I can.

I sit down with Dr. Robert Bowman Jr., whose book on the Word of Faith movement helped shape my own research for my chapter on the New Thought teachings infused in the Word of Faith movement. We discuss the tangled origins, its early teachers, and the controversial connection between E.W. Kenyon and Kenneth Hagin. I ask him about the influence of New Thought, particularly in areas like positive confession, prosperity, divine healing, and the belief in human divinity, and whether my conclusions hold up. \n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

She saw Christianity as outdated, something for people who just hadn’t “evolved” spiritually yet.

    "description": "Aaron Abke. If you don't know the name (or how to pronounce it), I assure you that you've heard the concepts: manifestation, I AM affirmations, Christ consciousness, nonduality, the false and true self, reincarnation, channeled teachings, and much more. He has a growing platform and speaks with great confidence about the Bible, Christianity, and Jesus, but in a way that historic Christianity would label as blasphemous.\n\nHe came onto my radar a few months ago when some of you sent me some of his material, some of which made it into this video. You could tell something was off, but wanted clarity as to why. This video is my attempt to bring clarity to that confusion. In this video, I’ll break down some of Aaron’s core beliefs, highlight their influences, and compare them to biblical Christianity. I’ll also include clips from his content and his recent debate with Wesley Huff to provide a clearer picture of what he teaches. This is not a personal attack, just what I consider to be an honest examination of his theology through a biblical lens. I want to help Christians, but I'm also making this video in hopes that those who have gotten caught up in these teachings can see a different perspective. Jesus warns about deception. Wouldn't it be nice to know what that deception looks like? Bad theology hurts people and makes them victims of false teaching. And this is bad theology. \n\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought: thing?

There were a few featured clips people sent me, but there was so much more to this interview that I think is worth unpacking.\n\nThis was an interesting conversation to watch. I’ve done my best to provide insight into Pete’s theological and spiritual views, helping you understand what he believes and why—so that you can better understand what you believe and why. This isn’t just a reaction video.

    "description": "Few books have the potential to put Christians in a theological chokehold, quite like Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. This book is more than just a best-seller. It's the entrepreneur's gospel, the self-help holy grail, the self-improvement manifesto, and, believe it or not, the sacred scripture of a 1930s secret cult. It has influenced millions of people and celebrities all around the world, giving credit to this book and its concepts for changing their lives. There are a lot of very good and true things to say about challenging ourselves to become more motivated and successful. There’s no doubt that Think and Grow Rich contains valuable insights about motivation and success—concepts that have genuinely helped many, including Christians. But is that all there is to this man and this book? Is there more lurking behind these motivational messages? I believe the answer is an emphatic yes. By the end of this video, I hope to convince you of the deeper, more complex reality behind the man and the message. \n\nIt took me months to put this video together. To prepare, I re-read Think and Grow Rich, watched the film adaptation (yes, that’s a thing), and followed the Napoleon Hill Institute on Instagram, engaging with their content regularly. I dove into Hill’s other works, consumed documentaries and videos about him, and I was also an avid follower of the New Thought beliefs held by Napoleon Hill, so I see him and this book with different eyes. \n\nI think it's either crazy or awesome (or both) that you all like staring at a screen, listening to my face talk for over two hours. It takes a LOT of work, sometimes months, to put these videos together. So thanks for being crazy awesome. \n\nTimestamps:\n0:00- Intro\n05:02- Part 1: Who is Napoleon Hill?\n47:21- Part 2: Think and Grow Rich\n1:26:14- Part 3: What is Napoleon Hill's Spirituality?\n1:58:57- Part 4: But...

Plus, we touch on some shocking revelations about the goals of certain LGBTQ activists, the controversial Kinsey reports, and the impact of queer theory. \n\nGet Natasha's book When Culture Hates You here: https://amzn.to/4jAjdW9\n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Order Happy Lies: \n● Barnes and Noble: https://tinyurl.com/h3yb2vmz\n● Audible: https://tinyurl.com/4b8j88vp\n● Christianbook: https://tinyurl.com/msvjxt2e\n● Amazon: https://amzn.to/46XmuZO\n\n👀WATCH👀:\n● Natasha's interview with Frank: https://youtu.be/t4Yqa97zMmc?si=n6-BbQooDXWyEXCK\n●Is Christian Nationalism a Real Problem?: https://youtu.be/OblfMVGvzjM?si=8Y87Jf1-hGEk7jiY\n\n📚RESOURCES📚:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/melissadougherty\n\n📲FOLLOW📲:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwiX: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\n\n💡SEMINARY💡:\nLooking for a solid theological education?

This is about more than just drag queens reading stories. They are not reading a story to kids to teach them about why reading is important or trying to improve their reading literacy. It's about grooming your kids to accept an ideology. If the world considers me  \"close-minded\" or a \"bigot\" for being against the sexualization of children, then let me be against the world.\n\nFor me, this fight is personal. I’m joined by Kirk Cameron to discuss his work with Brave Books and his efforts to stand against the chaos. This is about how a set of values can fundamentally change the direction of our country, and the fight isn't over. In fact, after the election, I can see a swift and heavy retaliation from gender activists.

In the past, this is why I adored apologetics so much. Two people would passionately debate a topic, then set their differences aside with a high five, go to dinner together, and even share pictures of their kids. That kind of camaraderie feels rare today. Many people might fear being \"canceled\" by their \"tribe\" or criticized for associating with someone who holds opposing views. Perhaps this shift is because so many spiritual topics have become emotionally charged and unnecessarily divisive. We all sense this tension. And we all feel it.

    "description": "Did you know that \"manifest\" is Cambridge Dictionary's word of the year for 2024? It's one of the most looked-up words in the world. \n\nManifestation has gained immense popularity in recent decades, largely due to the influence of the stealthy New Thought movement and its promotion of teachings like the Law of Attraction. I recently came across an article that talks about this rapidly growing trend. While some might dismiss this occult-inspired New Thought belief as harmless or irrelevant to Christians, think again. These ideas often hide in plain sight, subtly weaving their way into everyday thinking and practices. Including the Christian Church. \n\n💡Want to know more about Manifestation and this New Thought thing?

This ideology is responsible for how we have gotten to the point in society where language is rebranded and “sex” and “gender” are separate. Now, there are supposedly unlimited genders. If this isn’t disturbing enough, the logical conclusion of this ideology (which really functions like a religion) is that *age* should be flexible, too. Kids should have the freedom to choose what age they identify as… as sexual beings. This ideology says this is good, liberating, and empowering. \n\nThis is completely shocking.

    "description": "In this video, I’m taking a deep dive into the episode behind a well-known clip of Oprah that’s been widely shared in Christian circles. It’s sparked a lot of discussion about her beliefs and where they stand in relation to Christianity. But I believe there’s more to this clip than what’s on the surface.\n\nI go over the majority of the episode, show what you didn’t see, analyze Oprah and the panel’s beliefs, and explore the spiritual questions raised, giving a lot of commentary on what I would consider to be unrecognized New Thought beliefs. This is not just about Oprah or another \"Oprah EXPOSED\" video. This is about something bigger—a set of beliefs that isn't going anywhere and I promise you at some point in your Christian walk, you'll be confronted with these arguments and beliefs this panel puts forth. I want you to be equipped.\n\nOn top of this, I also give some (maybe) unpopular opinions about the interaction between Oprah and an outspoken audience member. I thought this would be a shorter video, but… that just didn’t happen. Even for how long this turned out, I still could have spent another hour (or more) analyzing this episode and the clip in question.\n\nIt's been a 👉ride👈 trying to get this video up. I thought it would be one of those videos that was forced to remain unpublished forever. I do not know if this will eventually get taken down. I'm hoping it doesn't, but the content is worth the headache. \n\n💡Want to know more about this \"New Thought\" thing?

    "description": "In this interview, I sit down with Jeremiah Johnston, renowned theologian and historian, to dive deep into the mysteries of the Shroud of Turin. Is it truly the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, or is it just a centuries-old artifact? There's been new evidence to come forth recently. But I'm not sure I'm convinced. Maybe you're not, either.

    "description": "One of the most puzzling questions in the New Testament for me has always been the mysterious ending of the Gospel of Mark. Specifically, Mark 16: 9-20. It says some good stuff... but then says some very un-Markish stuff. What's going on? Did the original ending actually end abruptly? Was it lost or added over time, or something else? And what are we to do with a text that says Christians should handle poisonous snakes and drink poison?

    "description": "I’m sorta putting my hand in the fire with these topics. But my love for God and people compels me to speak. \n\nI love God. I love my country. I love (correct) prophecy. And I love truth. Many people can use current events to bolster their spiritual image. Sometimes you don't need the power of prophecy to foresee what's going to happen. If you make a prophecy about the election (or anything else with similar outcomes), it's a 50-50 chance that you are going to be right, and then take credit for it, solidifying the belief that you are indeed a prophet and people need to believe you. This is still prophecy darts, and it is rather silly to make a prediction like this, in my opinion. The only consequence, if you are right, doesn't really have anything to do with glorifying God but instead brings attention to the \"prophet.\"\n\nEven though I made this video before the events of July 13th, my point still stands: I'm not trying to \"debunk\" prophecy. A lot of times, prophecy is used to bring attention to God and spread the Gospel. My issue is whenever people misuse prophecy to bring attention to themselves and gain power. The question to ask: Who is this really glorifying?\n\n01:20- Plea #1- Don't shame people for testing you. \n03:02- Plea #2- Be specific.\n04:53- Plea #3- Take responsibility when you're wrong.\n07:27- Plea #4- Think how this affects others.\n09:01- Plea #5- Check your bias. (*see pinned comment.)\n09:50- Plea #6- Know this brings division.\n12:07- Plea #7- Know my intentions. \n\n👉My Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n💡Order Happy Lies: \n● Barnes and Noble: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/happy-lies-melissa-dougherty/1145097424\n● Audible: https://tinyurl.com/4b8j88vp\n● Christianbook: https://tinyurl.com/msvjxt2e\n● Amazon: https://amzn.to/46XmuZO\n\n📚RESOURCES📚:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/melissadougherty\n\n📲FOLLOW📲:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwiX: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\n\n💡SEMINARY💡:\nLooking for a solid theological education?

    "title": "The Controversial World of MLM's... And What Nobody is Talking About.",
    "description": "In this video, we delve into the world of MLMs (Multi-Level Marketing Companies) and explore their allure and controversy. And let me tell you... MLMs can be one of the strangest and most intriguing phenomena in the business world. I never intended this video to be as long as it did. But the more research I did, the more I decided that I needed to cover.  It took me many, many hours and almost 2 months to do this research. \n\nI have yet to see MLMs addressed from a Christian perspective. The *real* fuel for why I did this deep dive has to do with my background in New Thought and what I started noticing hidden within MLMs that needs to be talked about. (And it's not New Age.) I'm calling this the \"dirty secret of MLMs.\" \n\nMy goal is to approach this with fairness but also firmness. I think there’s generally a lot of (understandable) anger and bitterness with some of the anti-MLM crowd, and I wanted to approach this from a different angle. I made this video with no resentments but with a genuine interest in the topic, your stories, and a love for people and truth. I actually had a really wholesome experience doing this research. \n\nMy view on MLMs might evolve as time goes on. But this is where I currently stand with MLMs. Thank you all for your help with this.\n\nAnd thank you to my friend Phoenix Hayes for helping edit, especially the parts where I had to do a voiceover 🫶\n\nFormer MLM Leaders Share Why They Left it All: https://youtu.be/NUTAIkf5Fi4\n\nWant to know more about New Thought?

I think it has a lot to do with objective morality. \n\nThe debate can seem very forward at times, but debates like this give me hope that we all can still come together and freely talk about tough topics without being silenced. Notice the logical conclusions of both worldviews and how Frank simply asking David to explain his position was enough to show how incoherent it is. \n\nThis is a good example of the logical conclusion we fall into if there is no God: power rules morality and *truth*.

Or to either? \n01:10- Question 2: Do you think it is ok as a Christian to use they/them pronouns for a friend? Do you think if Christians do comply with using preferred pronouns that it would be enabling them?\n03:50- Question 3: Are Christians the only people who please God? Are they the only ones who are going to be saved? What about the people who existed before Judaism who didn't know Jesus? What is the criteria for salvation? \n14:10- Question 4: Should all churches provide some form of equipping in the word to those who want it? Or is this the job of small groups? While our church does not teach false doctrines, since we are not equipped in how to study the word for ourselves, many members of the church are following false Gospels. Inside our groups most of what we find is life issues and self-help books from the perspective of questionable teachers. What is the role of the church an the congregants?\n24:10- Question 5: I feel like I may being led to start re-evangelizing  people who used to go to church.  I am wondering if you can point me in the right direction for helping those who were hurt by the Church, or are mad at God.\n\n👀WATCH👀:\n● Stand to Reason YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@STRvideos\n● Other Q&A Vids: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLvfK83TeHUuLbvoVi1OiYvUg5puj2tQE\n● Culture and the Transgender Debate: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLvfK83TeHUuS6XxdgdMKaiSF3GFjNu8K\n● What is the Gospel: https://youtu.be/gi5md6jqi-M\n\n📚BOOK RESOURCES📚:\n● https://www.amazon.com/shop/melissadougherty\n● Bring Em Back Alive: https://amzn.to/46wUQCe\n\n🤗DONATE🤗:\nIf you are led, consider donating:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77\n\n📲FOLLOW📲:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\n💡SEMINARY💡:\nLooking for a solid theological education?

I tried to answer stuff.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:14- When sharing the gospel with people or telling them about God, how do you balance the love of God with His righteous judgment in such a way that people understand His judgment as loving?\n03:49- Where did the tradition of meeting in a building and listening to a pastor speak every week become the thing to do \"be a good Christian?\"  Where in the Bible is that the model of Christianity? Did that come later where some King or ruler implemented that for their own benefit, or is it actually what Jesus wanted Christianity to look like?\n06:27- My question is, do you see Catholics as “works based” as LDS and JW clearly and freely admit they are?\n09:32- As we are in a fallen world that is full of sinners, WHY does God keep sending innocent souls to experience life here as a born sinner?\n11:48- For someone like me who remembers before I was born, very vivid particular memories, which I now understand were apparently the Akashic records and reviewing the book of life, how does one have this memory/ experiences and meld into Christianity life?

We discussed Bible stories that seem hard to believe. How do we approach such a sensitive topic without in any way discrediting the authority of scripture? \n08:26- Why did God allow the ancient peoples’ children and David’s infant son to die for the sins of their ancestors despite that Scripture says that, in Deut. 24:16-“ Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.” \n13:21- What should our takeaway be from the book of Job? That book has always bothered me, and even though I've been in church my entire life, I've never heard a good explanation of it.\n28:41- I am struggling with the idea of doing \"good\" apart from God. I really do understand why people think that they don't need church or God to be \"good\" when there are others out there doing good works apart from the church and God. How do I reconcile this? How do I talk about this to my unbelieving friends? \n\n\n👀WATCH👀:\n● Wisdom on How to talk to people you don't agree with: https://youtu.be/1VfZDep6Z50\n● The Attributes of God: https://youtu.be/mAKanZvgn4k\n● What the Bible Says about love vs. the World's Love: https://youtu.be/dq1zWfuVn9Q\n● Thoughts about Hell: https://youtu.be/DkdgnwBdlYM\n\n📚RESOURCES📚:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/melissadougherty\n\n🤗DONATE🤗:\nIf you are led, consider donating:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77\n\n📲FOLLOW📲:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/",

    "description": "Deepak Chopra, a very well-known New Age teacher of mysticism debates Christian apologist Greg Koukl on Lee Strobel's show \"Faith under Fire.\" This interaction was mentioned in the forward to Greg's book, \"Tactics.\"\n\nThough this aired in 2005, I think it's still one of the best examples of how to effectively deliver facts while calling out inconsistencies in your opponent's position. Notice how Dr. Chopra begins stating information with certainty, only to default to \"uncertainty\" at the end, a very popular (and wildly inconsistent) position many New Agers hold. Many progressive Christians have a similar view, interestingly. \n\nWhat's startling is that Deepak Chopra has written several books about \"Jesus\" and he's not able to take Greg's challenges and corrections head-on. I think this is an excellent resource for students, too, to show logical fallacies. I added subtitles and a little \"flair\" to this video version. \n\nGet Greg's book, Tactics: https://amzn.to/3RJ9PSw\nFollow more from Greg at @STRvideos \n\n👀WATCH👀:\n●The full debate can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5EqcKsmThE&t=1s\n●Stand To Reason YouTube Channel:  @STRvideos  \n\n📚RESOURCES📚:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/melissadougherty\n\n🤗DONATE🤗:\nIf you are led, consider donating:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77\n\n📲FOLLOW📲:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nLee Strobel: http://leestrobel.com/\nGreg Koukl: http://www.str.org/",

    "description": "This is the story of Becket Cook. He was a gay man in Hollywood who had quite a successful career. He gave up everything to follow Jesus. It all started with a fateful event in a coffee shop... In this video, we discuss how this happened and how he overcame common objections to what the Bible says about homosexuality. We also discuss Christians going to gay weddings, Progressive Christianity's unbiblical (and unhelpful) stance on this topic, do's and don'ts when someone comes out, and much more. Our goal is to talk about these topics in a loving but firm way in a culture that is hostile to a Biblical perspective on sexuality. \n\nTimestamps:\n01:56- Becket's story as a gay atheist who found Christ.\n03:35- The turning point and the beginning of change.\n43:18- Theological questions: What made Christianity appealing? Why not other religions?\n45:29- The Bible is clear about homosexual behavior.\n48:01- Thoughts about Matthew Vines and Progressive Christianity.\n57:10- Being single... forever?!\n01:01:22- Difference between being homosexual and homosexual behavior. \n01:04:28- Dos and Don'ts when friends or family comes out to you. \n01:09:05- Would you go to a gay wedding?\n01:10:45- Becket's advice to those who struggle with same sex attraction.

Apathy makes people prefer the false peace of conformity to the tensions of liberty. Whatever and whoever has the power can pressure you into believing their version of truth.... even if they're flat-out lies. Anyone who opposes this is viewed as backward and ignorant. We live in a world where there is more and more intense social pressure to accept that there is no such thing as objective truth. There's only power.

We both see that racism is a serious issue. But CRT is *not* the answer. You can't become a gaslighting racist to get rid of racism. This isn't about politics.

    "description": "The belief in Universalism has become more popular in recent years. In almost every era of the Christian church, professing Christians have found the idea of universalism attractive. It has been condemned in the history of the church, almost from the beginning. And it comes up every generation to be debated. \nA helpful analogy: Say we're sick and have cancer. We want to get better. So we look into medicine to help us. We might have people who want to help us and give us suggestions on how to get better. It might be that someone is telling you not to go to the doctor at all! Go holistic. Someone else says you need a vacation. Less stress cures cancer! Someone else might say you must get chemo and go to the doctor. Another might say you must get meds off the black market to live. Another will say that you must meditate and use crystals. Another says NO, you must use oils and practice a very clean diet. Another says, just pray with nothing else. And yet another says you must take illegal drugs to live and get better. The question is: which one will cure my cancer? Which one will actually help?\nImagine for a second that someone walks into the room and says, \"you know what? They ALL cure your cancer. Doesn't matter which one you do or take. Just pick any one of those solutions and you'll be okay.\"\nWhat you'll probably end up doing is the easiest one! But the worst person in the room is the dude telling you that every one of these will work. They have almost guaranteed that you won't pick a hard path to a cure. \"Don't worry... you'll be fine in the end no matter what you do!\" Taken to a spiritual level, Universalism is a bad cure.

Gender-affirming activists will force you to now believe that what was up is now down, a circle is now a square, 2+2 now equals potato, and your girl is now a boy.

    "description": "Many people have started to notice that there's a unique sect within Christianity that is deeply involved with signs, wonders, healing and miracles. Though these beliefs are certainly a part of the Christian life, this is different. There seem to be extreme views forming that are becoming more prominent... and problematic. People commanding the Holy Spirit to do their will, positive confessions, glory realms, physical manifestations of heaven, speaking faith has creative power, that we can do the same things that God can do, that God should ALWAYS heal, and much more. This stems from what's called the Word of Faith Movement, and it would surprise people to know the roots of this movement. In this interview that my friend Steven Bancarz and I did with our good friends at Cultish, we discussed the ties of the metaphysical cults with the formation of this movement.

    "description": "What do we do when \"just have faith\" isn't enough? What makes Christianity different from other religions? Does your affiliation with Christianity feel more like an accident than an informed decision? I sat down with J.Warner Wallace to talk about one of my favorite books he's written (... okay probably my most favorite...) about what it means to have what he calls a \"forensic faith\". We attempt to make a case for why we even need to make a case for Christianity, an apologetic for apologetics. One reason why I really fell in love with apologetics so long ago was that it satisfied a deep need for a more rich, robust, and *full* faith that didn't just rely on my subjective experience or what I felt was true. Literally, anyone of any belief system can have that. But Christianity? Was there evidence for this? Could I fall back on what was objectively true when feelings ultimately failed? Should I shelve my doubts entirely and ignore them or can I face them head-on and ask questions and honestly wrestle with Scripture to draw a deeper and more powerful reason for why I believe what I do? Answer: Yes. \n\nWhere to purchase Forensic Faith: https://www.amazon.com/Forensic-Faith-Detective-Reasonable-Evidential/dp/1434709884/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3RKX406U7AK0&keywords=forensic+faith&qid=1650659644&sprefix=forensic+faith%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-1\n\nJim's Website:\nhttps://coldcasechristianity.com/\n\nJim's YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ColdCaseChristianitywithJWarnerWallace\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

    "description": "When I was in the New Age, I identified as Christian, but my theology was basically garbage. I had no idea of what the *essential beliefs* of the Christian faith were. This is a very basic thing. But I had hangups. One of the major issues I had was why they were so many Christian denominations. One of the most appealing things to me in the new age was the idea that we were all One. It didn't matter what you believed because there were many paths to salvation and to God. My reasoning for why there were different denominations was simply because they had different styles or preferences on how they worshipped or believed in God. I had NO understanding of the salvific essentials of Christianity. In this video, I’m going to go over this today, what uniquely defines the Christian faith. \n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \n\nSupport the channel!

    "description": "Does a verse in Revelation 18 teach that pharmaceutical drugs are going to be the main catalyst of deception to lead all mankind astray? I got an email from a concerned friend asking me about the word “pharmakeia” in scripture, particularly in Revelation 18:23. It says: “For your merchants were the greatest in the world, and you deceived the nations with your sorceries.” \n\nThis word for sorceries is “pharmakeia”. It’s talking about drugs, poisons, and sorcery, and how it’s connected to magical arts, idolatry, and witchcraft.  Bad theology hurts people, and sometimes kills people. So, is this bad theology? Is this interpreted incorrectly?\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

    "title": "\"Reap What You Sow\" - What the Bible Really Says",
    "description": "Galatians 6: 7-8 says  \"Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.\"\n\nSounds straightforward, but \"sowing a seed\" has a very different meaning in many Word of Faith churches and from their teachers. In the New Age, I remember learning about the supposed spiritual laws of the universe, and one of those laws was the \"Law of Sowing,\" which is strikingly similar (if not directly the same, with some verbiage exceptions) to what many prosperity teachers preach about \"sowing\" into your life. The idea was whatever you \"sowed\" in the physical and spiritual realm would manifest itself to you. If you sowed a seed of money, you reaped money. If you sowed a seed of happiness, you'd reap happiness, and so on and so forth. It was a way to manifest prosperity. (And this was before I knew there were people in the CHURCH teaching these things!) This Scripture is just one of many misused to support this bad theology. \n\nWhat does this scripture actually mean?\nMike Winger helps break down scriptures sometimes misused by the New Age and Prosperity Preachers and corrects a common misunderstanding about biblical prosperity and the context of these verses.\n\nAlso, in my screen recording in the beginning of the video, I couldn't help myself but share out loud what I thought of Duplantis' teaching. I forgot that screen recording on my Mac also picks up on outside sounds. My comment was too appropriate to edit out.

    "description": "I had THE most fun doing this painting. Everything about it, from beginning to end was a total blessing. \n\nFor those that aren't aware, I do a painting around this time of year to celebrate the resurrection, the very event that transformed the world and defines our Christian faith. Every year on Passion week my family watches Pilgrims Progress and American Gospel. In particular, the song choice for this painting and crown of thorns is a nod to American Gospel 2: Christ Crucified, where the atonement is passionately defended. I've had the idea for this painting since watching it for the first time. \n\n\"In Christ alone who took on flesh\nFullness of God in helpless babe\nThis gift of love and righteousness\nScorned by the ones He came to save\nTill on that cross as Jesus died\nThe wrath of God was satisfied\nFor every sin on Him was laid\nHere in the death of Christ I live.\"\n\nAnd there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.- Acts 4:12\n\nFun facts:\n1.) The crown of thorns in the beginning was a last-minute thing when I planned the painting. I was just going to paint the whole Canvas black but then I decided that it might be fun to do a negative space image and just paint over it. \n2.) Painting with my hands was unplanned as well. It's a good day when there's paint on my hands! Plus it is easier to maneuver the paint that way.\n3.) This is my first time ever using glow in the dark paint and it's really fun!\n4.) The song is by Shane and Shane and is very purposely chosen to connect the idea of the painting. There are two versions of the song and I edited them both together. \n5.) The splatter of the stars was my favorite part. \n6.) The mess on my hands can be symbolic of the message of the painting with the song: We're dirty. He cleanses us. \n7.) The last image of the video says it all.\n\nI hope this blesses you as much as it was a blessing to make!\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

She was raised, yet hidden, within mainstream culture and public school education, where no one knew—or the few with a sense of something, stayed silent.

One reviewer describes the book in this way: \"This testament to female empowerment and self-love, with an endearing coming-out story at the center, will delight readers.\" \n\nSo yeeeaahhh... self-help. The scary patriarchy. Radical feminism. White supremacy. Oppressed by religion. Not to mention the Progressive/New Age spirituality scattered throughout the book.

    "description": "What in the crazy is happening in the world? The pressure Christians are under to buckle and give in to this ever-growing secular culture is unlike what we've seen in most of our lifetimes. How can we navigate through the cultural mess when there are so many loud voices in our faces pressuring us to compromise our values and God, and if we don't, then we're seen as bigoted, hateful, and close-minded? (Not to mention it's ten times harder to know we've even been seduced when most Christians don't read or study their Bibles.) We're ridiculed for standing for truth that corresponds to reality. Christians are accused of having the worst possible motives when we simply believe that there's a reason to live for truth, justice, and love from a Biblical perspective. How can we remain faithful in a culture that is becoming more and more aggressively hostile to the Christian faith? Here is one lifeline: This book.\n\nThere are a few books on my shelf that are marked up and tabbed. I refer to these books often. This is one of them. This is one of the best books I've read about this topic, and possibly Natasha's best book she's written yet. (Which is saying something!)

    "title": "The Time a Christian Visited a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall",
    "description": "In my early days of ministry, waaaaay before the Tubes of You, I used to frequent many events that surrounded the Jehovah's Witness religion. One thing I'd do is visit their Kingdom Hall. This is different from the time I went to visit a psychic. My theology wasn't a metaphysical mess this time. This was a very educational and fruitful time for me, and to the best of my memory, I want to share what my first visit was like. I wanted to respect the privacy of the women I attended the Kingdom Hall with, so I didn't mention them by name or give details about their lives. There's no way they'd ever have gone to church with me, because to them our churches are worldly, of the devil. Me going to them led to many very Gospel-centered conversations and thoughtful challenges to their beliefs that I was able to put forth that I otherwise wouldn't have had an opportunity to do. \n\n*I want to be clear and say that I'm not saying that every Christian needs to go visit a Kingdom Hall, especially someone that is new in the faith or isn't equipped to enter into that kind of situation. I was ready, willing, equipped, and knew exactly what I was walking into and did it for good reasons and it ended up being a very fruitful thing for me with sharing the Gospel effectively with JW’s. This was the very roots of my ministry. I like to revisit this time in my life often to remind myself that there are people that are in the bondage of strict legalistic religion and know nothing of the love of God. They are stuck with rigid religious rules that they'll never be able to follow, and it’s a reminder to me of the power of the Gospel and that Jesus can indeed free them from their bondage. \n\n0:00- Intro and Thoughts on Why I Did This\n03:51- Beginning of Video\n\nJehovah's Witness Series:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlAmaBToyrI&list=PLLvfK83TeHUtcq0d1eKttTiOxl6LY5wlh\n\nMy Story:\nhttps://youtu.be/QSVnprFKoVw\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Meldougherty77\nMy Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

Evolution answers the question of how we got here. So how do we know that a God even exists? \n08:52- I don’t understand how morality proves that a God exists. Even an animal can show ‘kindness’ to another and it doesn’t need to prove that a god exists, so how is this even a good argument?\n12:35- Can’t multiple universes explain the fine-tuning argument?\n15:33- All religions claim to be true. What makes you think your religion is the true religion and everyone else is wrong and damned to hell? Isn’t that completely judgmental of you to say?\n20:29- How could a loving God send people to hell, especially for all eternity? Why not just allow everyone into heaven, or have a temporary punishment for the people that really have done evil?\n25:58- How do we know that the Bible is reliable? Do we have any actual evidence for the Old Testament claims like the army being wiped out in the Exodus, and how do we know they recorded the truth and didn’t make it up?\n32:11- With the terrible amount of evil in the world, It seems that a good God would do *something* to intervene. How can God sit and watch and do nothing?\n39:44- The Bible doesn’t teach homosexuality is a sin so why do Christians condemn it?\n44:07- Why is it that only religious people say abortion is wrong?

I asked how many of you believed that all humans are born already children of God and how many of you believed we are *not* born children of God, but become His children. The vast majority voted what I would agree with: that humans are NOT all children of God. I want to make this video for the 12-15% and explain WHY this is what the Bible teaches, why it makes sense, and why it’s actually a very beautiful theological truth. \n\nGod Loves Mormons YouTube channel:\nhttps://youtube.com/c/GodLovesMormons\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty \n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

    "title": "God is Love or Love is God?: How Progressive Christians and New Agers Have it Wrong",
    "description": "1 John 4:16-18 says: \"So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.\"\n\nThis scripture (and many others) I saw misused to promote a type of unbalanced spiritual love that was seen as a sort of 'power'. Love was a frequency, a vibration, that was obtained by how you felt and what you thought. The enemy to love was fear and judgment. There were many times that I was told things like, \"God is love! There's no fear in love. Look! It's even in the Bible!\" and this scripture among many others was shown to me to make it seem that this is what Jesus taught and what these new thought/new age teachers taught was indeed correct. \n\nBut are they?\n\nMike Winger helps break down another scripture sometimes misused by the New Age and Progressive Christians and corrects a common misunderstanding about biblical love. \n\nThe link to the longer video is found here: \nhttps://youtu.be/C8K8h0OL9sQ\n\nHere's my Video about Godly Love:\nhttps://youtu.be/dq1zWfuVn9Q\n\nMike's YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EkimRegniw\n\nMike's Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/MikeWingerii\n\nMike's Website:\nhttp://biblethinker.org/\n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nFind me on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity\n\nFind me on Instagram:\n@melissaldougherty\n\nSupport the channel!

Through a very interesting series of events, I came across a video that they did about how they left the Hyper-Charismatic movement. (This is purposely called *hyper* charismatic because it's an extreme belief about how God works in the supernatural.) Intrigued, I watched it and reached out to them afterward. I asked them to come on my channel and share more about their experience and they kindly agreed. God works miracles, heals, and speaks to us.... but not like this.

    "description": "Believe me... there are more than just five. \n\nEmma is just trying to post an article to her blog. The title of the article is “Why I Believe God Exists” and gives evidence for her position. She just hopes that people will read it and give quality feedback and intelligent arguments, is that too much to ask? But when she’s about to post it, the essences of online logical fallacies show up. Get the popcorn ready!\n\nThis is a million.5x45+300 divided by a purple potato times infinity percent- Alisa Childer's idea. This entire concept and idea was hers and is based on her article \"The 5 Most Illogical People You Will Meet on the Internet.\" Super shoutout to her for letting me run with this article and idea. Your FACE is amazing!\n\nMeet Red Herring- The logical fallacy that LOVES to change the subject to take the focus off of the actual point. Called a 'Red Herring' as a visual for a strong-smelling fish used to throw hounds off the scent, when someone is guilty of this fallacy, they are changing the subject, using irrelevant information to distract you, sending you down a rabbit trail you never intended. (Points to you if you can guess what Red's earrings are made out of!)\n\nMeet Character Assassinator/Ad Hominem- The logical fallacy that we see all too often that attacks the person and their shortcomings instead of discussing the actual argument. They love to name-call and accuse rather than actually face the real argument.\n\nMeet Self-Defeater- If they only knew how they sounded... This is someone who defeats their own position... BY their own position! The kicker? They don't even realize it. This fallacy fails to meet its own standard and cannot live up to its own criteria. (Shout-out to my 7-year old for letting me destroy her headband with a cheap arrow and to our pet chickens for lending some feathers. You a real one.)\n\nMeet Strawman- This fallacy just loves to misrepresent others' arguments because they're easier to attack than the real one. They end up arguing against a false or distorted version of the argument rather than the argument itself.\n\nMeet Gish Galloper- This fallacy is truly a magician of words, flamethrowing objections, questions, and arguments to overwhelm you, making it impossible to actually combat each argument in a reasonable amount of time. Giddy up. They have a false superiority of their position as a result. (Gish and Red are basically besties.)\n\nAlisa Childers article: \nhttps://www.alisachilders.com/blog/the-5-most-illogical-people-you-will-meet-on-the-internet\n\nAlisa's Socials:\nWebsite: alisachilders.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/alisachilders\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty\n\nMy Other Satire Videos:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLvfK83TeHUsvPRzWL3DgOCbvwAt0zU39\n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

    "description": "For the last few years for Resurrection Sunday (Easter), I've done a painting. I only started really incorporating these pieces on my channel in some way. I have had this idea and concept for a painting for a *long* time. I finally was able to make it all come together this year. No other time of year do I hold closer to my heart as a Christian than when we celebrate the Resurrection. \n\nGuys... God became a man.\n\nGOD became a MAN. He became His own creation to pay the just penalty for sin that we could never pay. He took our place, the righteous for the unrighteous. *This* is the atonement. I mean... wow. \"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\"- 2 Corinthians 5:21.\n\nI filmed this with three different cameras, over six hours of footage. The editing itself was a total rollercoaster, wild and unpredictable. To me, the video is just as much art as the painting itself. I hope you all enjoy it. I worked very hard on it. \n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: \n@melissaldougherty \nTwitter:\n@meldougherty77\n\nIf you are led, please consider contributing:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

For those of you who are senior Christians, then just a heads up, this video isn’t really aimed at you, but who knows, there might be something you didn’t know! After a recent conversation with a new Christian, I realized that sometimes we forget that there are quite a few Christians that may not know these things, and we forget at one point there was a time that *we* didn't know these things either! So just consider this your fun Christian version of Snapple facts here on the Tubes of You. \n\n*To elaborate on one fact: Stephen Langton is credited with dividing the Bible into chapters in 1227.

    "description": "For a while now I’ve been wanting to cover this topic about God’s attributes, and in my study of putting together this video, I discovered that this is also a *great* way to show the validity, perfection, and necessity of God being a Trinity, particularly in God’s love. I think a lot of unbelievers-and even believers- think they know who God is and how He functions. But so many things are completely misunderstood about God because they misunderstand who He is in His glory and completeness, mainly, they misunderstand the Attributes of the Christian God. Who is He? What makes Him so unique and set apart? All throughout Scripture He sets Himself apart from all other false gods and anything people could possibly imagine in creation. I think if the attributes of God were understood better then people would have a much better understanding of how God interacts with the world and why He does it in the manner in which He does and why it's so believable that God doesn't *need* anything from humanity... because He's completeness perfected!\n\nVideo about God's Love:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq1zWfuVn9Q&t=19s\n\nVideo with Wesley Huff:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSSJVVG5S4&t=1s\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty\n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

    "title": "\"You are gods...\" What Did Jesus Mean?",
    "description": "In my opinion, one of the most misunderstood passages in the gospels is in John 10:33-36 when Jesus is talking to the Pharisees. It says, “We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.” Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods”’? If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside— what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?\"\n\nWhat did Jesus mean when he said the phrase, \"you are gods\"? Many people claim this is a verse saying that humans were meant to be gods, but this is against everything Jesus and Scripture stood for. Pastor Mike helps bring clarity. \n\nWe both understand there are different understandings of this passage. I'd recommend checking out Dr. Michael Heiser's research about this as well. \n\nThere are a lot of scriptures that are used to support WoF (Word of Faith) new age/new thought teachings.

    "description": "Salvation and water baptism are a lot like marriage. It’s not the wedding ring that makes you married, right? It’s the inner commitment and the vows that you take. Accepting Jesus as Lord and committing your life to Him, is like the wedding vows, the commitment that comes from within.\nThe water baptism is like putting on the wedding ring. You want people to know that you’re married. It’s a public testimony to where your loyalties lie.\nI believe both the inner and outward commitment is important, based on what the Bible tells about both.\n\nI'm aware there is an element of intelligent discussion among many of my respected brothers and sisters in Christ about this topic, especially depending on their denomination. I'm not going to hash all this out here in this video but just wanted to make a short thoughtful video about the beauty of baptism. I'm sure we, as the Bride of Christ, can handle these thoughtful disagreements in the comments section.

    "description": "I'm very excited to share this video. I loved making it. In this video, I’m going to give you some core differences between the type of love we see expressed in society, the culture, and the world compared to the love that is taught in the Bible… and yes, there’s a big difference. When I was in the New Age, I had a complete distortion of what I understood ‘love’ to be, but at the time I truly perceived ‘love’ to be a deeper spiritual law. It was emotional, but it was more than that. I thought of it as a universal power, used to wield peace and harmony sheerly based on the power of my thoughts and feelings and how I treated others. In my mind, it was through the power of ‘love’ that we’d bring a sort of awakening through humanity. So when I started learning about what the Bible *actually* taught about love as defined by God, it took a very long time of intentional study to ‘unlearn’ what I was taught. \n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty\n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nSupport the channel!

But what does this verse *actually* mean?\n\nA constant question I get asked is what scriptures really mean when they're misused in such ways by so many.

What about reincarnation, NDE's, hell, and if the soul even exists? \n\nLots of people ask questions about these topics and wonder if they're compatible with Christianity.\n\n(Spoiler alert... they're not.)\n\nWe have a conversation about these topics from a Biblical Christian worldview.\nThese are topics that Lee Strobel covers in his new book, \"A Case for Heaven.\" I felt honored and humbled to be able to interview Lee about the book. I know this is a subject that many people, not just Christians, wonder about. You can expect the same journalistic approach that Lee takes in his numerous other books.

I claimed to be Christian and went to church often. I never read my Bible and was completely dependent on experience and feelings to guide me. I didn’t think visiting a psychic reading was wrong at all. There are a LOT of people who claim to be Christians who believe this same thing. Is this wrong?

    "description": "The link to the longer video is found here: \nhttps://youtu.be/C8K8h0OL9sQ\n\nThis was my favorite segment of this two-hour video. \n\nMatthew 7:7-8 says, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\" This was the ultimate scripture used when I was in the New Age for the Law of Attraction, a New Age belief that taught that 'like attracts like'. You can manifest your reality by following this supposed law of the universe that is responding to your thoughts feelings and words. Matthew 7 was called the 'Ask-Believe-Receive' formula. If you ask and you believe, then you *will* receive it. In many churches, it's used the same way. If you have enough faith and believe without doubting, then God will give you what you desire. So... if that's the case, why have so many not received what they were believing for? What about the healing, help or breakthrough you've been begging God for? Mike does a great job explaining this.  \n\nA constant question I get asked is what scriptures really mean when they're misused in such ways by so many. I asked Mike to come on my channel a while ago and break down 10 of the most misused scriptures from the Word of Faith camp and the New Age. I gave him the scripture and explained how it's interpreted by someone in the New Age and Word of Faith. The then breaks down the passage and explains what it actually means. \n\nThere are a lot of scriptures that are used to support WoF (Word of Faith) new age/new thought teachings.

    "title": "When Lies Become \"Truth\" and the Monsters it Makes Us.",
    "description": "Heads up... Dense conversation ahead.\nYou've been warned. \n\nWhat do you do when suddenly everything in your culture gets turned around? We're finding more and more people embracing blatant lies thinking it's the high moral ground. As language becomes less expressive, minds are more easily controlled. Wrong is right. Right is wrong. Up is down. Down is up. Babies in the womb aren't actually babies. Men have periods. Men are women. Women are men. At the same time... there are no men or women. Gender is fluid. The color of your skin determines your worth and character. Never in my lifetime did I think this would be considered 'progress'. It ironically hurts more people than it helps, especially those who truly struggle with their sexual identity and those begging to be heard about true injustices. The world hurts the world to help the world. Slavery is freedom. War is peace. Love is hate. This reminds me of Orwell's \"Newspeak.\" This is confusing.\n\nAnd I think it's supposed to be.\n\nWhy?\n\nPower.\n\nApathy makes people prefer the false peace of conformity to the tensions of liberty. Whatever and whoever has the power can pressure you into believing their version of truth.... even if they're flat-out lies. Anyone who opposes this is viewed as backward and ignorant. We live in a world where there is more and more intense social pressure to accept that there is no such thing as objective truth. There's only power. Whoever holds the power decides what is true and false. The value of truth claims depends on who's making them. More and more people are knowingly believing lies out of fear of opposing them. \n\nPersonally, in a few short years, this has been in my face. It's been difficult and confusing to sort out what's happening and trying to understand it in a meaningful and accurate way. It felt messy. It's like you're trying to clean your kitchen, and can handle the regular mess of everyday life. Then suddenly, your kitchen expands ten times bigger and the mess is no longer one you're capable of handling by yourself. It's time for reinforcements who have had MUCH more experience dealing with MUCH bigger messes. \n\nSo I handed Greg Koukl his metaphorical mop and broom. I asked Greg on to give me his thoughts on this. As I mention at the beginning of the video, I listen to his podcast, Stand to Reason, regularly.  He did one in May that really resonated with me. We discuss things like:\nHow do we discern truth in this divided world? Are we really entering into soft totalitarianism? What does that even mean? Are we inflating this? With such militant and intense pressure to conform, what can we do about it? And much more. \n\nI walked away from this conversation with a lot of the understanding, perspective, and insight that I've been craving about these topics. \n\nSo yeah. This was an interesting interview.\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00- Intro\n04:54- How Are we Entering into Soft Totalitarianism?

Always ready to call out every little thing everyone does, all in the name of Jesus. They're waiting... like virtual vultures, ready to make you their theological punching bag. If you're a new Christian? Watch out. Almost everything is a theological battle and mountains are made out of molehills. (No thanks to that pesky magnifying glass.) \"No grace\" is their motto, and they're some of the most toxic and angriest Christians on the internet. \n\nThey do more damage then they realize.\n\n-Yes, that's a real pitchfork. They really ARE in short supply. \n-The magnifying glass is my favorite thing ever.\n-The reference to 2001 is me making fun of myself. I went through a 'McJudgerson' phase.\n-The wig was from my Mom. She had breast cancer last year. (Yes, she beat it!) When she lost her hair she got a wig. She never wore it. \nI can see why.\n-My apologies to anyone who’s coincidentally named Judy. Please don’t cancel me.\n\nSpecial thank you to my friend Derrik Behler for the voiceover.

    "description": "I talk a lot about what goes on in some churches when it comes to spiritual experiences with God. Some are on one side of the pendulum and are very insistent that supernatural encounters should be normal and constant, while others are perfectly spiritually content without them. Not to mention many are willing to enter into New Age practices just to have MORE encounters with God. How does this happen? How is there such a divide? I have a theory. And it has to do with idolatry. Specifically, idolatry of the supernatural and a lust for experience.\n\nJust in case...

    "description": "Is it true that for every counterfeit spiritual experience or practice out there, that there's an authentic one? These are teachings such as clairaudience (speaking to angels), channeling spirits, spirit guides, spell casting, trances, astrology, auras, psychic powers, or just ‘fill in the blank’ with any New Age teaching. In many churches and in Physics of Heaven, it's taught that there’s an authentic version of these new age teachings that actually belongs to the Church. I want to give my respectful but firm disagreement about this idea\n\nAnd guys, to be clear -yes- this book is a book currently sold at Bethel's book store and endorsed by Bethel's leaders. Beni and Bill Johnson contribute chapters in the book and Kris Vallotton gives the introduction. This book is the epitome of what concerns me about what is happening at Bethel and what they're teaching. When I'm having a conversation with someone at church and their theology is a direct result of what they read in this book? That means it's influencing Christians.

    "description": "This is a short clip from a longer video discussing one of the many issues I go over in the MegaChurch model. The longer version of this video can be found here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0QvXOtJ58Q&t=2828s\n\nThere are churches that are huge that are growing in membership every year... Yet we see a decline of people who follow the actual Biblical standard of what defines a follower of Jesus. How can this be? Aren't there hundreds of thousands of people going to huge churches every week? When we see how the MegaChurch functions, typically we see the appeal to emotions and felt needs over actually knowing the gospel and the Bible. Under this model, there are lots of numbers and numerical growth... but we hardly ever see true repentance or spiritual growth. It's not that it doesn't happen in megachurches... it does! God can- and does- use any means to draw people to Him. Praise God for that. But when someone can go to a seeker-sensitive church for years and still not know the core doctrines of Christianity or what the Gospel really is, it might be time to bring this to the table and discuss it. \n\nOther Resources:\n\nWhat Is the Gospel?: https://youtu.be/gi5md6jqi-M\n\nDefinitely worth watching American Gospel: http://www.americangospelfilm.com/\n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \n\nIf you are led, please consider donating:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

    "title": "What is the Gospel?",
    "description": "I can hardly believe that my channel is going to be at 100,000 subs.\n\nI just want you guys to know that this whole channel really isn't about me at all but doing what God has gifted me to do and that's to proclaim Him and the Gospel. It's not easy, but I kind of look at this ministry like it's something that I'm stewarding and it needs to be all for God's glory and in His will. So I am in essence a servant, to serve not just Jesus but also to the Church, His people. And something that I've really been wanting to do lately is something that might seem a little weird to some people. Maybe it's because they assume that people would know this, but I actually want to make a video about the Gospel. It was Paul Washer in the American Gospel documentary that was saying that he can't just assume that the audience he’s talking to actually knows the Gospel so that's what he chooses to preach on most of the time. And I also got done reading Michael Wilder's book, \"Passport to Heaven\", and it was deeply saturated with love for the Gospel and the search for truth and it really resonated with me. So I thought it would be appropriate for where my channel is at right now to make a video on this. Everything I do is surrounded by the Gospel, the identity of Jesus, and fighting for truth. I want everything I do in ministry to revolve around this: loving God and loving people. Praise God for letting me use my God-given gifts, whether it's art, satire, relaying theology or apologetics for Him. I'm a mixed bag. Growing up, I always thought I didn't fit in, but now I embrace the weird things about me. I am repeatedly in awe at how God uses us. Praise the Lord! \n\nDefinitely worth watching American Gospel (and the second one!): http://www.americangospelfilm.com/\n\nLink to Micah Wilder's book, Passport to Heaven:\nhttps://www.adamsroadministry.com/passport-to-heaven-book\n\nMy Website:\nhttps://www.melissadougherty.co/\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \n\nIf you are led, please consider donating:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

Others have said it and were very genuine in their words and belief. So... what's up with it? Is it wrong?  Is this okay to repeat then?

    "title": "A Candid Conversation with Dallas Jenkins, Director of The Chosen",
    "description": "This interview is a little different. \n\nIn this video, I interview Dallas Jenkins. Dallas is the director of The Chosen, a very popular Christian tv series that continues to grow with incredible momentum. With momentum and popularity comes controversy, and The Chosen has been no exception. In this video, Dallas and I discuss some of that controversy. We discuss his convictions, beliefs, and talk about some tough stuff too, in particular the controversy he's gotten for his association with the LDS. And yes, we spoke many times about this through email before the interview so he wasn't blindsided. This was a very mutual conversation. Much of the controversy comes from him sharing publicly that he believes that LDS and Christians believe in the 'same Jesus,' which is a salvific issue. If anyone has talked with a senior LDS or your friendly local Missionaries that knows what the LDS Church teaches and the doctrine then you'll know why this is so problematic.\n\nFor as long as this interview was, we did still discuss some of this 'tough stuff' off air as well. I'm positive there will be controversy from LDS and Christians over this, one side saying I 'misrepresent' LDS beliefs (check out the receipts below please, and if you disagree with what the LDS Church teaches... um... that's not a bad thing lol) and the other side upset that I'm simply even interviewing Dallas, or that I didn't harshly rebuke him or something. Just know that this video easily could have gone three times as long and I hope it lays a good foundation for this situation. \n\nDo I agree with some of Dallas's conclusions? No.\nDo I lovingly challenge him on this? Yes.\nDoes he welcome and want these challenges? Yes. \nDo I agree with other conclusions? Yes.\nDo I lovingly agree with him on these things? Yes.\n\nThis conversation hopefully will help everyone know where Dallas stands with these issues that we talked about. Please pray for Dallas and for everyone on the set of The Chosen. \n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Thoughts Before the Interview\n6:09 Post Intro\n9:08 What are Dallas's Beliefs and Background:\n31:17 Controversy Over LDS Affiliations- Do We Love the Same Jesus?  \n43:17 My Pushback\n48:32 Sometimes Ya Can't Win: \n50:21 Does The Chosen Have LDS Influence?\n52:37 How Much Do You Know About LDS Beliefs?

As Christians, is there any reason we should or shouldn't have these? Many new agers attribute power and healing to certain gems and crystals. Does this mean they should be avoided at all costs?\n\nAnother Helpful Video:\nCrystals- A Christian Perspective:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPJJq2JzbAM\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \n\nIf you are led, please consider contributing:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

    "description": "This video has been a long time coming. \nI sat down with my good friend Britt who's a licensed mental health professional to talk to her about SOZO, a deliverance ministry that's out of Bethel Church in Redding California. From their website, it says: \"SOZO is a prophetic ministry for all-embracing healing and for deliverance from bondage. SOZO helps uncover the roots that are keeping you from living a life of freedom and fullness. In personal encounters with Jesus and through the resurrection power of the Holy Spirit, these roots are identified, removed and replaced by new life. In this way, when you receive a SOZO you can become whole and walk better in the destiny to which God has called you.\"\n\nYou can read from their own website more about it: https://bethelsozo.ch/what-is-sozo/\n\nIn my research of looking into this deliverance ministry, one aspect of it that I wanted to look into was the mental side... How damaging is it? What can go wrong here? She read Bethel's SOZO book with me and had *many* concerns from her perspective as not only a Christian but as someone who's in the mental health field. It's not my area of expertise, and when we sat and talked about what she thought, she made it sound much smarter than I ever could. I decided to ask her to sit and talk with me about SOZO. I plan on making a follow-up video discussing the theological implications of SOZO. Please pray for Bethel.\n\nHelpful and Related Content:\n\nShort Video on my Research of SOZO:\nhttps://youtu.be/JzVfxHZ4Vsw\n\nMy Video on the Pendulum Problem:\nhttps://youtu.be/9esRYYJNLNw\n\nTop 5 New Age Teachings in the Church:\nhttps://youtu.be/FCDbO8Lc5NU\n\nSharing Truth in Love:\nhttps://youtu.be/f7yCxWvttJs\n\nBethel and the New Age:\nhttps://youtu.be/nPAe5l_gifI\n\nA Discussion on Christian Counseling:\nhttps://youtu.be/All93j0dRls\n\nAn Honest Critique of Bill Johnson's Book:\nhttps://youtu.be/-KNCSbn7xMs\n\nInterview with Mike Winger about Scriptures that are Misquoted to Support Word of Faith/NAR teachings:\nhttps://youtu.be/C8K8h0OL9sQ\n\nIssues With Word of Faith:\nhttps://youtu.be/KlfsC3AN3sU\n\nNew motion Graphics are selflessly done by:\nTimothy Medina\nIllustration, Graphic Design, Filmmaking, & Motion Graphics\ndribbble.com/timbmedina\ninstagram.com/timdesignco\nvimeo.com/timbmedina\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\n\nInstagram: \n@melissadougherty77 \n\nTwitter:\n@meldougherty77\n\nIf you are led, please consider donating:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

I realize not *all* Women's Bible studies are like this, Praise God.\n\nBut when you're in one like this boy do you sure know it. \n\nBudget for this filming: approximately $8.\nAnd it shows.\n\nAnother satire: Sarah the Super Christian Meets Yolanda the New Ager: https://youtu.be/hpDOI8bfJmo\n\nWho Is Jesus?

    "description": "Sometimes we (sadly) poke the bear to be mean. Sometimes we poke it to provoke. Other times the bear did a no-no and needs to be held accountable.  \n\nSo in this video, I'm daring to address the madness of all the false predictions about the 2020 election. I try to pick and choose my battles, and when I choose to ‘battle’, it needs to be in with the right intention. Paul reflects this in scripture that we need to be at peace with people as much as we can, except when it comes to the gospel and identity of Jesus. That’s worth fighting for. I’m not here to do what’s popular, I want to do what’s right. All this was done in the name of Jesus, and that’s really the heart of me speaking about this. This shames Jesus’ name. That’s worth speaking up about. That being said, I think this definitely needs to be firmly addressed.\n\nVideo Resources:\n\nAllen Parr Made a video about this topic as well, and it's by far one of the best ones I've seen so far:\nhttps://youtu.be/usSlOUWaCdM\n\nFor those with extreme beliefs and need some perspective on balance: https://youtu.be/9esRYYJNLNw\n\nReasons I'm Grateful for 2020...

    "description": "Want to know why Universalism, the Law of Attraction, Mysticism, Religious Pluralism, and Oneness isn't Biblical? Well, here you have it. In a previous video linked below, I went over Five New Age teachings that I have seen enter into the church. Though there were a lot, I only went over the top five I saw the most. I won't be going over each one in detail like I did in the last video, but I will be going over how each one of these beliefs is completely against what the Bible says and what Jesus taught.

    "title": "Freedom in Christ",
    "description": "Time for another painting video :-) \n\nI have been painting this particular piece for many years now, but this is the first time filming it for YouTube. This was a piece that I did on a total whim one day because I was inspired after hearing testimonies of those who had left religious cults. The story of freedom made me think of someone who was free from the chains of false religion, false gospel and a false Jesus and was now in true freedom in Christ. I LOVE painting with reds and greys. There's something very powerful about a limited palette to portray a message, and red has always been a very loud and leading color. \"Freedom\" is the name of this painting, and it was made to portray our freedom in Christ, and the release from spiritual bondage. \n\nSometimes we need to relax and remember who Jesus is and who we are in Christ. \n\nBehind the Painting: This took about three hours to do, and is done in oils. The only colors I used were black, white and two different kinds of red. The canvas size is 24x36.\n\nMy Tribute Painting to Ravi Zacharias: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Togab6lpk\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \n\nIf you are led, and want to support my ministry work please consider contributing:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

In this video, I present what I call the 'Impossible Gospel' of the New Age. Because it does, indeed, require constant works in order to obtain the salvation it offers. \n\nThere are not many belief systems in the world. There are not thousands of religions. There are not even hundreds. There are not even a dozen. What if I told you that there were only…. Two? Yes… that's it. Two. They're DO and DONE. *This* is what makes Jesus SO unique.

    "description": "Matthew 7:1- \"Do not judge or you too will be judged…\" well there ya have it, folks. It has it right here in scripture to not judge. \r\rWhy can't we all just be one big living coexist sticker? Doesn't Jesus here say not to judge? \r\rOne of the BIGGEST things I hear after leaving the new age, and even when I was in it was how judgmental Christians were. Aren't we supposed to not judge? Isn't judging wrong? So let's break this down today. What did Jesus mean in Matthew 7 when he said, 'Do not judge?' When you actually read the Bible and get an idea of the context of not only what Jesus was saying, but the attributes of God Himself, you get some fantastic perspective on what Jesus means here and the overall Biblical perspective on how judgment works for humanity. In this video, I'm going to share four points to show that there is a biblical place for proper and improper judgment.\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \n\nIf you are led, please consider contributing:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77",

I am enough.\r\rThese are only some of the affirmations I made when I practiced the Law of Attraction as a new ager. What's wrong with these statements? Are self-affirmations like this really new age? Why? Is it wrong to say or think positive things about myself now? Am I supposed to walk around thinking what a terrible person I am because saying positive things about myself is 'new age'?\r\rThese are some of the common questions I asked myself when I left the new age, and many have asked me similar questions. Honestly, many ex new agers struggle with this. \n\nIn this video, I'm going to share Three main ideas that will help illustrate this and give biblical support to show you what I mean.\n\n**FYI- I did have some audio/visual issues while filming this video. Towards the middle of the video, you'll notice a slight lag. I always strive to put out the best quality image and audio I can for you guys.

    "description": "**This is a re-upload from April 2019.**\n\nThis was filmed at my old church by some of our wonderful production crew for Palm Sunday. \n\nThe song that I laid over this is called the Great I AM by new Life Worship. Being an ex New Thoughter, this song has a very different meaning for me. I used to think I AM meant that *I* was God, that I could harness an inner power of divinity by affirming I AM like Jesus did. I now stand in awe at the majesty of who Jesus is, a humbling reminder that He and He alone is -uniquely- the I AM, and I'm a sinner saved by His sacrifice and grace. This is HIS gift that He gave to me. Jesus is the Artist!\n\nWe did this in one nonstop shot with three camera angles. It took me four months of practice *every day* to get this right. This was done with black acrylic paint with my hands and a single Filbert size 16 brush on a 48x60 canvas. I still have a LOT to learn. This whole process was humbling and incredible to be a part of. \n\nI know I'll be accused of making a graven image just for painting this. I'd encourage people to look at those passages in the Old Testament and read what exactly a graven image is, then observe if that's indeed what's going on here. Here are some good articles about that:\n\nWhat is a Graven Image? https://www.gotquestions.org/graven-image.html\n\nIs it Wrong to Have pictures of Jesus? \nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/pictures-of-Jesus.html\n\nMy Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/\nInstagram: @melissaldougherty",

In this video, I break down why and how the Jw's are under spiritual and mental lockdown, and why it's so important to connect with them understanding this perspective. I refer to Steven Hassan's work on this. He's an ex-cult member, now a cult expert.

    "description": "Come along on a journey with me... a journey through one of Kenneth Copeland's \"sermons.\" I laughed. I cried. I cringed. I jest, but I've been wanting to talk about Kenneth Copeland for a while, and I decided this video was a good starting point to fairly critique his teachings. \n\nA lot of people don't actually believe that Kenneth Copeland teaches the things he does. Some think it was something he said once in the 80s that he can't possibly still teach. This is my attempt to give some thoughts on why his teachings are more theatrical than biblical, and why he should be avoided. Let's be sure to pray for him. \n\nI purposely didn't edit out a lot of the talk and the long pauses in between his sentences, simply for context and making the point of showing his speaking style. \n\nThis was my first time doing a sort of screen share video and did have audio issues that hopefully don't come through too much. \n\n*Just a disclaimer- remember guys, it's easier to be a bully when it comes to putting someone down. It takes love and dignity to not stoop to such a level when we're disagreeing with someone like Kenneth Copeland... who- let's face it- can be an easy target. Let's display a godly maturity in this area 🙏\n\nFollow and message on Social Media:\nInstagram: @melissadougherty77 \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity/",

    "description": "*I had a lot of audio issues in this video. I was recording in a new space that was rather empty so there was an echo. It created a sort of 'muffling' effect at times and I didn’t notice it until editing. I tried to fix it the best I could. My apologies for the lower quality of the audio\r\r.\n\nGood ol’ Joel... with his million-dollar smile and witty accent. What’s not to like? In this video, I give a fair assessment of his teachings. I start out the video by addressing my intent in examining Joel’s teachings, that I’m not out to ‘get’ him, and if I’m ‘judging’ him fairly.

    "description": "*Correction- at around the 26 mark, it's *Esther* without the works, nor Ruth. Oops.* \n\nAre we saved by faith alone, or faith plus works? This should be a very simple answer, but unfortunately, many works based religions have placed a yoke of works on people by using verses like James 2:26, and others, to tell them works are necessary for salvation. In this video, I look at the teachings, philosophy, and fallacies of works based religions vs grace alone, and go through James 2:14-16 and explain it. James wrote his letter for a reason.

Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 30since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.\"\nRom. 4:3, \"For what does the Scripture say? \"And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\"\nRom. 4:5, \"But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness,\"\nRom. 4:11, \"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also,\"\nRom. 4:16, \"Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.\"\nRom. 5:1, \"therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\"\nRom. 5:9, \"Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.\"\nRom. 9:30, \"What shall we say then?  That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith.\"\nRom. 9:33, \"just as it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, And he who believes in Him will not be disappointed.”\nRom. 10:4, \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\"\nRom. 10:9-10, \"that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved;  10for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.\"\nRom. 11:6, \"But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.\"\nGal. 2:16, \"nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.\"\nGal. 2:21, “I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.”\nGal.3:5-6, \"Does He then, who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? 6Even so Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\"\nGal. 3:8, \"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, \"All the nations shall be blessed in you.\"\nGal. 3:14, \"in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\"\nGal. 3:22, \"But the Scripture has shut up all men under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.\"\nGal. 3:24, \"Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be justified by faith.\"\nPhil. 3:9, \"and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.\"\n1 Tim. 1:16, \"And yet for this reason I found mercy, in order that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience, as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.\"\n\nIf you are led, and want to support my ministry work please consider contributing:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77\n\n#James2 #FaithWithoutWorks #Jesus",

    "title": "Are There Scriptures That Support New Age and Word of Faith? Talking with Pastor Mike Winger",
    "description": "I got the great opportunity to talk with my friend and one of my favorite apologists on YouTube, Mike Winger, about how we can properly understand these scriptures taken out of context to support many teachings that we see in the Hyper-Charismatic, Word of Faith, and New Age movements. \n\nThis is a follow up video from my Law of Attraction video that I did a few months ago. I addressed many things in the video, but a constant question I got asked as a result were what scriptures in particular were distorted to fit this type of teaching? We come to find that it's not just the Law of Attraction, or even new age/new thought in general, but also what we find in many of our churches today. There are a lot of scriptures that are used to support new age/new thought teachings. These are just a few, and the ones that I see mostly misused in churches and from new age/new thought teachers. \n\nIf you haven't checked out Mike's YouTube channel, it has fantastic content on it that will definitely be a blessing to you as he has covered many relevant topics in Christianity.\n\nI want to thank Mike for taking the time to do this video. I don't think we intended it to be as long as it ended up to be, but it will definitely be worth the time to watch. I learned a lot from this conversation, things that I needed to hear and learn too.\n\nMike's YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EkimRegniw\n\nMike's Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/MikeWingerii\n\nMike's Website:\nhttp://biblethinker.org/\n\nMy Original Law of Attraction video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eQYJf0gcDQ&t=65s\n\nMy Physics of Heaven Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG2GueeiBmE&t=1015s\n\nMy video on 'Judgmental Christians':\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsmmKFe2l7s&t=1s\n\nScriptures referenced in this video:\nJohn 10:10, Acts 20:35, Matthew 7:1-2, Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Matthew 21:22, Proverbs 23:7, John 10:34-35, Romans 4:17, 1 John 4:16-17, Galatians 6:7-8, Proverbs 18:21, John 14:12-14, Philippians 4:13, Jeremiah 29:11, Romans 12:2.\n\nFind me on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NewAgeToChristianity\n\nFind me on Instagram:\n@melissaldougherty\n\nIf you are led, and want to support my ministry work please consider contributing:\nhttps://paypal.me/MelissaDougherty77\n\n#mikewinger #newage #prosperitygospel",

This is supposed to be black and white, and no color or race is implied. I understand Jesus was a Jewish middle easterner. I also know I'll be accused of making a graven image just for painting this. I'd encourage people to look at those passages in the old testament and read what *exactly a graven image is*, then observe if that's indeed what's going on here. Here's some good articles about that:\n\nWhat is a Graven Image? https://www.gotquestions.org/graven-image.html\n\nIs it Wrong to Have pictures if Jesus? \nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/pictures-of-Jesus.html\n\nGob Bless you!",
