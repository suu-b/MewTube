    "title": "Creatures of the Word: How God’s Speech Creates, Redeems, and Sustains His People | Michael Horton",
    "description": "Michael Horton explores the profound reality that creation itself—and the Church—are spoken into being by God’s powerful Word. He interacts with scenes from C.S. Lewis’ The Magician’s Nephew and challenges tendencies to privilege seeing over hearing. Horton highlights the biblical emphasis on hearing and receiving God’s speech, distinguishing between law and gospel, and examining the Church as the creatura verbi: a community formed not by individual initiative but by the Holy Spirit working through the preached Word of Christ. This presentation is from Theo Global in South Asia.\n\nDr. Michael S. Horton is Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Sola Media (formerly White Horse Inc), home to Core Christianity, White Horse Inn, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global (formerly Global Theological Initiative). He is the J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Westminster Seminary California.\n\n00:00 \"Song of Creation\"\n05:28 Spirit, Word, and Eternal Father\n08:46 \"Empowered by the Word\"\n12:45 \"Living by God's Word\"\n14:05 \"Church Created by God's Word\"\n19:24 \"God's Word as Creative Act\"\n22:21 \"Preached Word as God's Voice\"\n24:36 \"God's Word: Heard and Living\"\n30:02 \"Confidence in God's Speech\"\n32:11 \"Healing Self-Curved Humanity\"\n\nPROPHET, PRIEST, AND KING - https://solamedia.org/theologytogether/ \nGet your copy of the first release of Theology Together, a five-volume theology series created in partnership with Zondervan featuring leading theologians from across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.  \n\nTHEO GLOBAL \nTheo Global annual symposiums gather brothers and sisters who teach theology in more than 70 seminaries and Bible colleges around the world.

By examining biblical foundations, New Testament interpretations, and comparative perspectives on veiling and gender, Grace Al Zoughbi invites the church to affirm and re-envision the shared human dignity and value of women, particularly women in the Middle East.

And the wicked are condemned not because God delights in their death, but because in his holy will he has allowed them to suffer the just judgment they deserve. We can't pretend to pry into God's hidden wisdom; we can only look to Jesus and his perfect work, finding our personal assurance of God's fatherly goodness in him.\n\n📖 Isaiah 42:1; Proverbs 16:4; John 6:37–39, 15:16; Acts 13:48; Romans 8:29–30, 33–34, 9:22–23; Ephesians 1:4–5; 2 Timothy 1:9; 1 Peter 2:8; Revelation 13:8 #short",

    "description": "Dr. Sherif Fahim (Egypt) considers the relation of theological anthropology to soteriology in presenting and assessing the anthropology of the Apocalyptic Paul school of thought. \n\nHe examines the influential apocalyptic perspective in 20th-century New Testament scholarship, contrasting the existential emphasis of Rudolf Bultmann with the cosmic, liberation-focused theology of Ernst Käsemann and others. The video traces how apocalyptic readings view Paul’s anthropology, sin, and salvation, highlighting liberation from cosmic powers rather than individual guilt, and evaluates leading figures such as Christian Becker, Beverly Gaventa, and Douglas Campbell. \n\nFahim critically assesses the strengths and limitations of the apocalyptic school, especially its diminished focus on the forensic and penal dimensions of Christ’s atonement, and argues for an integrated understanding that upholds both cosmic liberation and the foundational, substitutionary work of Christ. This presentation is from Theo Global Middle East.\n\nPROPHET, PRIEST, AND KING - https://solamedia.org/theologytogether/ \nGet your copy of the first release of Theology Together, a five-volume theology series created in partnership with Zondervan featuring leading theologians from across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.  \n\nDr. SHERIF A.

    "description": "If you're a Christian deeply invested in theology and apologetics, you’ve probably encountered atheism—whether in personal conversations, online debates, or modern culture at large. But too often, Christians assume atheism is all about reason and evidence. And we assume zealous atheism is as popular as it once was. The reality is far more complex—and far more human.\n\nIn this video, theologian Brannon Ellis walks through five essential truths every Christian should understand when engaging with atheism or atheists today.\n\nFrom the rise and fall of the “New Atheism” movement to the deeper heart issues that drive unbelief (both theoretical and practical), we’ll explore why atheism isn’t just a rational position. It’s a belief system built on borrowed capital, a heart condition that only the gospel can heal.\n\nPARTNER WITH US - https://solamedia.org/partner/?sc=AS2502VY\nWhen you become a partner today, you'll receive two remarkable books as our thanks: \nRediscovering the Holy Spirit by Dr. Michael Horton and Praying with Jesus by Pastor Adriel Sanchez.

    "description": "Dr. Wilson Jeremiah (Indonesia) introduces the theology of Herman Bavinck with a focus on the metaphysics of the image of God (imago Dei) and common grace, exploring how Bavinck’s Trinitarian framework enriches our understanding of humanity. \n\nJeremiah unpacks Bavinck’s conviction that the imago Dei is best understood not only in Christological but also in pneumatological and Trinitarian terms—both individually and collectively, and from an eschatological perspective. He highlights how this approach allows for a fuller appreciation of the body, integrates traditional categories of the image (structural, functional, relational), and clarifies the role of the Holy Spirit in preserving God’s image—even in fallen humanity.\n \nJeremiah concludes by considering how Bavinck’s theology of participation connects the doctrines of the image, common grace, and deification, offering promising insights for Reformed and global theological discussion.

    "description": "What's the truth about atheism? As Christians, we believe that there are actually two kinds of atheists: \"theoretical\" atheists, who appeal to reason and evidence to justify their unbelief, and \"practical\" atheists, who simply live as if God isn't there or is irrelevant to our lives. Practical atheism is far more common—it's found among the spiritual but not religious and even among professing Christians. Being an atheist doesn't necessarily make you a worse person than someone else, but before the judgment seat of God, all stand guilty apart from the gift of right standing in Christ received only by trusting in him. Whether we struggle with theoretical or practical atheism, Jesus is the only one who can satisfy our souls.\n\n📖 Job 21:14–15; Psalm 10:4, 14:1, 53:1; Zephaniah 1:12; Luke 12:16–21; Acts 17:22–31; Romans 1:18–23; Titus 1:16 #short",

At this two-day Sola conference in Orlando, keynote speakers Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Gretchen Ronnevik, and Jim Davis led us in exploring how Jesus uniquely brings insight and healing to people like you and me. Mining the rich resources of the Reformation, our speakers pointed us to the grace and truth that only Christ can offer to broken people in a fractured world.

    "description": "Edmund Fong (Singapore) investigates the theological depths of what it means for humanity to be created in the image of God (imago Dei), arguing for a distinctively Christ-centered (christological) perspective that sees the image of God most fully revealed in Jesus Christ. Surveying historical interpretations from the early church through Reformation thought, Fong draws on figures like Irenaeus, Athanasius, Augustine, and John Calvin to show how understanding imago Dei as imago Christi clarifies the unique dignity and calling of humanity within creation. He explores and critiques major views—ultimately contending that only by looking to Christ can we grasp the fullness of what it means to be human.

In A Place for Weakness, Michael Horton shows how the cross and resurrection of Christ don’t just explain suffering—they overcome it.\n\nIn this message from Jim Davis at Sola’s Binding the Broken conference, Davis shares how the church—and even Christians hurt by the church—are joined to an unshakable assembly: the Kingdom of God. While we may be exiles, sojourning away from our true home, we are nevertheless being sanctified, strengthened, and grown. \n\nBINDING THE BROKEN \nWe're all sinners and sufferers in need of grace and truth. At this two-day Sola conference in Orlando, keynote speakers Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Gretchen Ronnevik, and Jim Davis led us in exploring how Jesus uniquely brings insight and healing to people like you and me. Mining the rich resources of the Reformation, our speakers pointed us to the grace and truth that only Christ can offer to broken people in a fractured world. In these messages, you'll be reminded that Jesus ministers to us so that, in turn, we'll be equipped by him to do the same for others.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8oIOkAqgPGfpSuOd3OBJ3mqXSNulVQOo\n\nFOLLOW US\nNewsletter: https://solamedia.org/subscribe/\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n   \nWHO WE ARE \nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

    "description": "A PLACE FOR WEAKNESS - https://solamedia.org/offers/aplaceforweakness/\nWeakness isn’t a flaw. It’s where hope begins. In A Place for Weakness, Michael Horton shows how the cross and resurrection of Christ don’t just explain suffering—they overcome it.\n\n\"God isn't going to throw away your body, but he's not going to just improve it. It's not a better you. It's a new creation.\" In this message from Michael Horton, at Sola’s Binding the Broken conference, he shares why we must die in order to be raised with Christ.\n\nBINDING THE BROKEN \nWe're all sinners and sufferers in need of grace and truth. At this two-day Sola conference in Orlando, keynote speakers Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Gretchen Ronnevik, and Jim Davis led us in exploring how Jesus uniquely brings insight and healing to people like you and me. Mining the rich resources of the Reformation, our speakers pointed us to the grace and truth that only Christ can offer to broken people in a fractured world. In these messages, you'll be reminded that Jesus ministers to us so that, in turn, we'll be equipped by him to do the same for others.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8oIOkAqgPGfpSuOd3OBJ3mqXSNulVQOo\n\nFOLLOW US\nNewsletter: https://solamedia.org/subscribe/\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n   \nWHO WE ARE \nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

Michael Horton, Bob Hiller, Walter Strickland, and Justin Holcomb respond and share what the Reformers meant by \"faith alone.” Using Scripture and the confessions, the hosts show why the assurance of salvation rests in the finished work of Christ, not our performance.\n\n0:00 The Free Grace movement\n7:08 Not justified by that faith which is alone\n19:47 What can we be assured of?

    "description": "What's the truth about joy? As Christians, we believe that joy is deep and lasting happiness, delight, and satisfaction in God and his good gifts, especially the gift of enjoying life with him and one another in Jesus Christ. This joy isn't based in our feelings or circumstances, but in the boundlessly happy life of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In Jesus, we will know joy at the end because it has always been in God since the beginning.\n\n📖  Psalm 16:11, 37:4; Nehemiah 8:10; John 15:11; Romans 5:1–2; 2 Corinthians 6:10; Philippians 4:4 #short",

    "description": "Obedience is pleasing to God. But my life and your life have more or less been exercises in disobedience: failing to keep God's law, falling short, missing the mark of loving him as he deserves and loving our neighbors as he commands.\nSo how is obedience not only good, but even good news? The answer is that it's not our obedience that's good news. It's Jesus' obedience. And it's the best possible news.\nIn this episode of The Christian Mind, we explore the precious Christian truth of Jesus' suffering and obedience in our place and for our sake--what the church since ancient times has often called the Great Exchange.\nJesus didn't pay our debts just to place us on never ending parole. He didn't come to rescue us from punishment only to leave us to wander ceaselessly through the wilderness. Jesus sets the captives free. He brings us home.\n\n0:00 The Passive Obedience of Christ\n5:34 Passive Obedience isn't enough\n7:57 The Active Obedience of Christ\n\nGET YOUR COPY OF \"LAW AND GOSPEL\" Understanding the difference between law and gospel opens the Scriptures to faithful understanding. But failing to distinguish them can do significant damage. In this booklet, White Horse Inn hosts Michael Horton and Bob Hiller explain the essential biblical distinction between law and gospel. https://store.solamedia.org/products/law-and-gospel\n\nFOLLOW US\nNewsletter: https://solamedia.org/subscribe/\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n\nGET THE LATEST OFFERS\nhttps://solamedia.org/offers/\n   \nWHO WE ARE \nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

    "description": "\"God may pity me, but he could never understand me.\" Don't we often feel that way, especially when confronted with the darkest parts of of the human heart--both in ourselves and others? In this moving and pastorally rich message based on Hebrews 4, Michael Horton urges us not to hide ourselves from God but to hide ourselves in God by approaching his throne of grace through our sympathetic high priest, Jesus Christ.\n\nA PLACE FOR WEAKNESS - https://solamedia.org/offers/aplaceforweakness/\nWeakness isn’t a flaw. It’s where hope begins. In A Place for Weakness, Michael Horton shows how the cross and resurrection of Christ don’t just explain suffering—they overcome it.\n\nBINDING THE BROKEN \nWe're all sinners and sufferers in need of grace and truth. At this two-day Sola conference in Orlando, keynote speakers Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Gretchen Ronnevik, and Jim Davis led us in exploring how Jesus uniquely brings insight and healing to people like you and me. Mining the rich resources of the Reformation, our speakers pointed us to the grace and truth that only Christ can offer to broken people in a fractured world.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8oIOkAqgPGfpSuOd3OBJ3mqXSNulVQOo\n\nFOLLOW US\nNewsletter: https://solamedia.org/subscribe/\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n   \nWHO WE ARE \nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

He created us in righteousness to reflect his image, but we rebelled in falsehood and unfaithfulness. Now that path of righteousness is forever closed to us. Our only hope lies in God's righteousness given to us in Jesus, so that God might truly be just and the justifier of those who believe. Now, we possess Christ's righteousness both so that we can be declared righteous (justified) and that we can walk in his faithfulness by grace (sanctified).\n\n📖 Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 145:17; Ecclesiastes 7:29; Luke 1:6; Romans 3:25–26, 5:18–19; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 3:8–9; 1 John 3:7 #short",

    "description": "Not everyone believed Jesus’s teaching and some even hated him. One of his own disciples, Judas, betrayed Jesus to the Jewish leaders who accused him of lying about being the Son of God and the King of the Jews. What the Jewish leaders didn’t know was that Jesus was telling the truth, and that dying was part of his plan to save the world. But what happens when the Son of God becomes the sacrifice for our sin? And what will his disciples do when their long-awaited king dies?\n\nSeason One of Tell Me A Story introduces kids to the theological concept of the promised Messiah who would accomplish what Adam could not—perfect obedience—and save us from sin and death.

Kings come and go, but none are obedient to the Lord. So, God brought a drought to dry up the land of Israel. One day, God sent a prophet named Elijah to challenge the rebellious king and his false prophets to a contest to prove their idols are powerless. \n\nSeason One of Tell Me A Story introduces kids to the theological concept of the promised Messiah who would accomplish what Adam could not—perfect obedience—and save us from sin and death. In “A Tale of Two Adams,” each Old Testament Bible story told will point forward to Christ, and each New Testament story will demonstrate how Jesus fulfills God’s promises to his people. \nLearn more: https://solamedia.org/tellmeastory/\n\nLISTEN TO THE SHOW\nApple: https://apple.co/4kl95kp\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/37haTmiplpnfQCMdkeDlhz\n\nGET THE LATEST OFFERS\nhttps://solamedia.org/offers/\n\nFOLLOW US\nNewsletter: https://solamedia.org/subscribe/\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n   \nWHO WE ARE \nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

    "title": "Exploring Divine Providence | Sherif A. Fahim | Theo Global",
    "description": "In giving humanity free will, did God take a risk? How does “concurrence” help us understand the relationship between God’s sovereignty and human responsibility? How does our understanding of this relate to our understanding of God’s omnipotence, omniscience, and goodness?  These questions are asked and answered throughout the world. \nIn this presentation, Dr. Sherif Fahim explores and articulates, from the Bible, how creation depends on God not just for its origin, but for continuation, and survival. \nHistory is not guided by purposeless or random forces or without intention. Rather, it is the wise, holy, all powerful, good and righteous God who leads history to an end that he intended from eternity. The biblical doctrine of God's providence provides us with a caring, wise, loving, powerful and all knowing God whose purposes can never be thwarted.\n\nDR. SHERIF A. FAHIM is Professor and New Testament Chair at Alexandria School of Theology and the General Director of El-Soora Ministries in Egypt. He earned his PhD in Biblical Studies from Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary, having written his dissertation on Paul’s teaching on sanctification in Romans 6.\n\nIN THIS VIDEO\n1:00 - God’s providence defined in contrast to Pantheism and Deism (Francis Turretin)\n6:20 - Human Reason and Divine Revelation \n11:45 - Two Dangers on Divine Providence: Claiming to know too much (rationalism) or too little (postmodernism). We attend to what God reveals in the Bible. \n14:45 - Why is there suffering if God is good? Does God risk?  \n17:45 - God’s Attributes: Omniscience\n25:40 - God’s Attributes: Omnipotence\n35:55 - God’s Attributes: Goodness - how could God allow for sin to exist?\n38:45 - How could moral evil be consistent with the providential order of an all-good, all-powerful God?\n43:20 - “Concurrence” - God carries out his good will through the free will of humans. \n46:45 - We should not dilute God’s providence, in order to uphold human responsibility\n48:00 - Chance is random, blind, weak and careless. God is purposeful, knowing, powerful, wise, and loving. \n \nTHEO GLOBAL JOURNAL\nGet your copy of the Theo Global Journal, including this presentation and other papers from the 2024 symposiums\nhttps://solamedia.org/tgjournal/\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSLETTER\nhttps://solamedia.org/subscribe\n\nFOLLOW US\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n\nTHEO GLOBAL\nTheo Global annual symposiums gather brothers and sisters who teach theology in more than 70 seminaries and Bible colleges around the world.

In this presentation, Justin Holcomb explores and explains how Christian theology can understand God through God’s accommodation through self-revelation. This presentation was originally given at Theo Global South Asia. \n\nRev. Dr. Justin Holcomb is a Senior Fellow with Theo Global, professor at the Reformed Theological Seminary, and Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Central Florida. He is the author or editor of more than 20 books on historical theology, abuse, and biblical studies.\n\n0:00 - How can an infinite God be revealed and known? \n3:28 - God Transcends Creation. Creator and creature distinction in Western and Eastern Orthodox theology\n4:00 - What we can and cannot know; God’s Essence and God’s Energies \n6:20 - Scripture: Not God’s essence, but the location and record of God’s speech\n7:00 - John Calvin - God’s essence is to be adored, but not inquired into\n7:35 - God’s revelation is God’s condescending “accommodation” to our limited capacities (Aquinas, Chrysostom, Origen, Augustine, Clement of Alexandria)\n9:30 - Finite creatures cannot perfectly know or comprehend the infinite God (Aquinas)\n11:28 - John Calvin on God’s “accommodating” in revelation\n15:30 - John Calvin - theology does not handle what God is, only what God is like in relation to the world\n19:40 - The giving of God’s name, Yahweh: Revelation vs. speculation.\n21:45 - Humans can have true knowledge of God through God’s self-revelation\n22:40 - Univocal, equivocal and analogical views\n25:20 - Archetypal and ectypal theology. Christian theology rests on God’s self-revelation\n28:12 - We can know God truly, through His speech/revelation, although not fully.\n\nTHEO GLOBAL JOURNAL\nGet your copy of the Theo Global Journal, including this presentation and other papers from the 2024 symposiums\nhttps://solamedia.org/tgjournal/\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSLETTER\nhttps://solamedia.org/subscribe\n\nFOLLOW US\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n\nTHEO GLOBAL\nTheo Global annual symposiums gather brothers and sisters who teach theology in more than 70 seminaries and Bible colleges around the world.

    "description": "\"Incomprehensible\" probably isn't the first word you think of when reflecting on the gospel. So why do theologians always talk this way about the God of the gospel?\n\nIn this video we explore the seeming paradox of a God who is both utterly beyond our comprehension and intimately known in Jesus Christ. We delve into the Christian doctrine of God's incomprehensibility, examining what it means for creatures to know and be known by our Creator. We discuss how our attempts to contain God betray our own rebellious nature, and how the good news of the gospel emerges in the midst of this bad news. \n\nDiscover how God's incomprehensibility actually points to his deep and personal knowledge of us, and how this knowledge offers surprising comfort and hope to those who know God personally in Jesus Christ. Join us as we unpack this profound concept and explore its implications for faith, discipleship, and assurance in the surprisingly good news of God's incomprehensibility.\n\n0:19 The curious relationship between the gospel's availability and God's incomprehensibility\n1:21 The classic definition of \"comprehend\" and the doctrine of God's incomprehensibility\n1:46 Creaturely limits aren't inherently bad, but it's not good to try to force God to fit within the limits of our own understanding\n2:10 The only way to fit a full balloon (God) into a little jar (our minds) is to take all the air out of it, making God seem manageable but also not very God-like\n3:05 An even better analogy for God's incomprehensibility than an air-filled balloon is air itself\n3:46 We dare not take too lightly the infinite mystery of the Lord God Almighty\n5:05 Being created and limited in our knowledge of God isn't our real problem; our real problem is what we as corrupt sinners do with the knowledge we have\n5:43 The surprising good news of God's incomprehensibility begins with the bad news of our inability\n6:02 Not only is God uncontainable—we're the ones who are contained. This is where the story of God's incomprehensibility starts to shift.\n6:40 If we know the incomprehensible God, it must be because he has chosen to make himself known\n7:08 As Christians we trust that God's goodness in revealing himself to us isn't just general, but specific and personal. It's saving grace.\n7:38 The surprising good news of the incomprehensible God \n8:31 John Calvin: \"If we are united to Christ by faith, we possess God\"\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSLETTER\nhttps://solamedia.org/subscribe/\n\nFOLLOW US\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n   \nWHO WE ARE \nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

Michael Horton responds to the conclusion of their conversation, where Huff asks Rogan, “What do you think of Jesus?” Rogan's answer is both important and instructive for Christians today, as it sheds light on how many secular people in the 21st century perceive Jesus.\n\n0:00 The hurdle Joe Rogan is dealing with\n2:02 Do we all have Jesus's connection to the divine within us?\n4:36 If Jesus rose from the dead, there are a lot of other things to believe\n6:03 Does Christianity work?\n8:28 Is Christianity true because it leads to a fulfilling life?\n9:30 The ultimate test of faith?\n11:43 Jordan Peterson and Moralism\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSLETTER\nhttps://solamedia.org/subscribe\n\nLISTEN TO THE SHOW iTunes: \nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/know-what-you-believe-with-michael-horton/id1776875542 \nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3iVTLF8opWifHQ8KtvXdr5?si=2f3cb2f11ef34b33\n\nFOLLOW US\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/solamediaorg/\nX/Twitter  https://x.com/solamediaorg \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/solamediaorg/\n \nWHO WE ARE\nSola is home to White Horse Inn, Core Christianity, Modern Reformation, and Theo Global.

Rod died after a brief illness on February 2, 2024. For those at White Horse Inn, “Dad Rod” was more than just a regular voice articulating a confessional Lutheran distinctive on the radio. He was a mentor, a father in the faith, and a trusted friend.\n\nListen in to hear how Mike, Kim, and Ken met Rod, how he had a desire to win people, not arguments, and how he never forgot to point us all away from ourselves to “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. \n\n#christian #theology #reformed #gospel #podcast #trending #preaching #teaching #inspirational #advice #theologypodcast #reformation #baptist #anglican #lutheran #fyp #viral #shorts #shortsfeed",

In the coming days, we'll share more from Carla including a special art piece she has created for you, our listeners. We thought this piece of her story would be a fitting way to introduce our series on Christianity and the Arts. \nThe doctrines of systematic theology are often caricatured (sometimes accurately) as cold and cerebral. We speak about beautiful things, but ironically, beauty seems to have little place in theology. But does Christian orthodoxy mean for us to ignore our senses in place of ivory-towered contemplation? In this series, Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Bob Hiller, and Walter Strickland each interview experts in architecture, art, and preaching to see if there is, indeed, a vital place for Christian art, or if it's better left on knick-knack shelves in department stores.\nhttps://whitehorseinn.org/",

Meanwhile, Zechariah’s prophetic song resounds: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people.” A Savior is born, and the angels sing out into the night, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!” Later, Anna and Simeon greet the baby Messiah at the temple, “[M]y eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples.” In this new White Horse Inn series, hosts Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Bob Hiller, and Walter Strickland unpack these biblical songs of Christmas, reflecting on the ways they instruct us in the true meaning and message of Christmas.\nhttps://loom.ly/LKkbelk",

This marked a new horizon for the church in America, but not necessarily for the better. In 1923, J. Gresham Machen’s seminal work, Christianity and Liberalism, was published, contrasting the modernist theological liberalism of his day with biblical Christianity. Arguing that liberalism couldn’t actually be called Christianity, he showed how the two differed in crucial areas. In this new White Horse Inn series, hosts Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Bob Hiller, and Walter Strickland revisit Machen’s work 100 years later, reflecting on its historic importance and relevance today as liberalism continues to creep into the church.

    "description": "*NEW SERIES OUT NOW* The 16th century Protestant Reformation was built upon a series of foundational beliefs—what we refer to now as the five solas. The Reformers saw these solas as the heart of the biblical gospel and the basis through which the “one holy, catholic, and apostolic church” could return to the message by which and for which it was created. Does the church today need this same call back to its gospel roots? In this new White Horse Inn series, hosts Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Bob Hiller, and Walter Strickland explore this question as they unpack the meaning of the five solas—sola Scriptura, solus Christus, sola gratia, sola fide, and soli deo gloria.

How do we live in light of what God has already accomplished in and for us, while also anticipating the final consummation of his redemptive work? In this new White Horse Inn series, hosts Michael Horton, Justin Holcomb, Bob Hiller, and Walter Strickland break down the tension between the “already” and the “not yet”, exploring eschatology, the new creation, and what it means to live with hope.\nListen wherever you get your podcasts, or on our website!\nhttps://loom.ly/6jVqQnc\n\n #worship #christian #theology #reformed #gospel #podcast #trending #preaching #teaching #inspirational #advice #theologypodcast #reformation #baptist #anglican #lutheran #shorts #fyp #viral #newseries #modernculture #scripture #breakdown #series #life #story #crisis #return #podcast #website",

    "description": "Many churches preach that your biggest problem is that you’re not living your best life now. Rather than calling people to repentance, they call them to “try harder, do better” so that they can be fulfilled, healthy, and happy. Reformed theology provides a doctrine to help counter this wrong diagnosis of our true problem: total depravity. But sometimes, this doctrine sounds much more like “utter depravity,” leaving nothing good or redeemable about humanity.

    "description": "“Fear God” and “Do not be afraid” are two phrases that are often repeated in Scripture. Sadly, today we are living through an epidemic of fear. We’re afraid of everyone and everything it seems…. except God. \n\nIn his new book, Recovering Our Sanity – How the Fear of God Conquers the Fears That Divide Us, Dr. Michael Horton explores what the Scriptures say about fear, and how the fear of God, rightly applied, helps us overcome the barriers that prevent us from finding rest in His word. \n\nFor a gift of $50 or more, you can request a copy of this book. Your support now will help us continue our work and reach more people with a message of joy, hope, and confidence found in the gospel. Get your copy here: https://whitehorseinn.org/fearofgod/",

In an attempt to attract larger numbers and compete in the marketplace of competing options, many churches throughout America have made their services more relevant, upbeat, and even entertaining.\n\nBut is this a wise course to take? Shouldn’t the church stand up for the timelessness of truth, rather than the timeliness of the trendy?\n\nIn our new collection, \"Christianity and Popular Culture: Understanding Our Time,\" we discuss this and more, as we consider the effects that American pop culture has had on the church.
