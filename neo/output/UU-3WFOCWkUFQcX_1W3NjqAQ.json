We decided to explore what it would mean if the Polygamy deniers were right… and frankly, if they are right… we have some major problems.\n\nPolygamy denialist’ “Faith Package”\n1. Accept the belief JS did not practice plural message.\n2. Reject, as deceptions, the testimonies of the Church’s highest leaders (ERS, ZH, BS, BY, JT, WW, and LS) after 1844 regarding their eyewitness accounts of JS’s introduction of the practice of plural marriage. Accept that the Church’s highest leaders for 50+ years were deceivers.\n3. Reject D&C 132 and its teachings, including those describing how JS had authority to create eternal families.\n4. Reject the temple endowment because nothing concerning it was recorded during Joseph Smith's lifetime. Instead, it represents the 1877 recollection of Joseph Smith’s 1843 teachings, recorded by Wilford Woodruff, who also recalled how Joseph practiced plural marriage in 1843.\n5. Reject President Russell M. Nelson’s teachings and the recent post on the Church’s website that affirm: “Joseph Smith introduced the practice, not Brigham Young.”\n\n\nOur Links\nWebsite: http://thoughtfulfaith.org\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thoughtful.faith\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thoughtful.faith\nPodcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478749\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this video are entirely the opinion of the creator and do not necessarily reflect any officially endorsed positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or channel sponsors.",

This is a conversation that often happens between Latter-day Saints and other Christians.

Right? Well a few months ago my friend Hayden Carroll and I were digging into this topic and found some of the newest research. And to be honest… it blew our minds. This is a game changer. The bottom line is that the critics are simply wrong and demonstrably have been making some really bad assumptions about the documents and papyri for at least the last 50 years.

Abortion decisions are not made lightly and involve complex moral considerations.\n* The church's position on abortion includes a call for personal revelation and prayer.\n* IVF presents ethical dilemmas that require careful consideration and personal judgment.\n* Moral weight must be assessed when discussing the value of human life.\n* Political advocacy for pro-life issues requires a nuanced understanding of the law.\n* The pro-life movement is often misunderstood and requires clear communication of its goals.\n* Cultural narratives heavily influence modern beliefs about rights and personal choices.\n* Latter-day Saints should not shy away from discussing controversial topics like abortion.\n* Engagement in political discourse is essential for advancing pro-life values.\n* There is a growing interest in returning to foundational beliefs about God and morality.\n\nKeywords abortion, pro-life, pro-choice, Latter-day Saints, human life, moral implications, theology, exceptions, trauma, sacredness, abortion, IVF, pro-life, moral dilemmas, church teachings, political advocacy, rights, cultural influences, ethical discussions, reproductive technology\n\n\nOur Links\nWebsite: http://thoughtfulfaith.org\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thoughtful.faith\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thoughtful.faith\nPodcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478749\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this video are entirely the opinion of the creator and do not necessarily reflect any officially endorsed positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or channel sponsors.",

The discussion highlights the nuances of religious belief and the challenges of addressing historical narratives. The conversation delves into the historical context of Sidney Rigdon's speech, the misinterpretations surrounding it, and the broader implications of ex-Mormon narratives. The speakers discuss the argument from consequences in relation to religious beliefs, the discrepancies in Joseph Smith's First Vision accounts, and the hubris of those who believe they can improve upon established religious frameworks. They also touch on the humorous notion of Mormons having their own planet, highlighting the absurdity of certain beliefs. In this conversation, Jacob Hansen, Emerson Green, and Jared Higdon delve into the complexities of Mormonism, addressing critiques, misunderstandings, and the nuances of beliefs such as tithing. They explore the community contributions of Latter-day Saints and reflect on the broader implications of religion in human life, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of faith and its role in society.\n\n\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Introduction to Riverside and Podcasting Tools\n03:02 Personal Backgrounds: Ex-Mormon and Never-Mormon Perspectives\n05:50 Exploring the Ex-Mormon Community and Its Dynamics\n08:49 Reactions to Jacob's Interview with Alex O'Connor\n12:03 Dissecting the 27 Factually Incorrect Statements\n15:03 Contextualizing Historical Claims in Mormonism\n17:50 The Role of Historical Apologetics in Religious Discussions\n21:10 Analyzing the Extermination Order and Its Implications\n38:11 The Context of Sidney Rigdon's Speech\n41:29 Misinterpretations and Historical Context\n45:18 The Argument from Consequences\n56:59 The First Vision Accounts\n01:09:43 The Hubris of Improvement\n01:26:53 Mormons and Their Own Planet\n01:27:21 Cynical Perspectives on Mormonism\n01:29:56 Critiques and Misunderstandings of Mormon Beliefs\n01:34:02 The Complexity of Tithing in Mormonism\n01:44:03 Community Contributions and Misconceptions\n01:58:47 Final Thoughts and Reflections on Religion\n\nKeywords\n\nMormonism, ex-Mormon, podcasting, Riverside, historical apologetics, Jacob Hansen, Emerson Green, Jared Higdon, religious discussions, community dynamics, Sidney Rigdon, historical context, ex-Mormon, argument from consequences, First Vision, Mormonism, religious beliefs, community, improvement, planet theology, Mormonism, tithing, community, critiques, beliefs, religion, Jacob Hansen, Emerson Green, Jared Higdon\n\nSound Bites\n\n\"I thought you did really well.\"\n\"I don't think you were systematically misleading Alex.\"\n\"It's always kind of sad to me.\"\n\"I thought the interview with Alex was pretty good.\"\n\"This is one of the 27.\"\n\"That's not a factually incorrect statement.\"\n\"It's just overly pedantic.\"\n\"They omit half the story.\"\n\"It's just so rich to be like, Jacob is lying.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"We will never be the aggressors.\"\n\"This is wholly justifiable.\"\n\"This is a total misreading of the speech.\"\n\"You can't be friends with the Native Americans.\"\n\"You sound like a child.\"\n\"They started it is such a perverse reaction.\"\n\"You sound unhinged.\"\n\"You have to actually believe it.\"\n\"It's a draft, it was not finished.\"\n\"It's not that big of a deal if Joseph mixes up details.\"\n\"Isn't that what anyone would do in like the situation?\"\n\"Latter-day Saints give way more than everybody else.\"\n\"The data is always better in Utah County.\"\n\"Ex-Mormonism makes liars of all of us.\"\n\"You will be religious no matter what.\"\n\n\n\nOur Links\nWebsite: http://thoughtfulfaith.org\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thoughtful.faith\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thoughtful.faith\nPodcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478749\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this video are entirely the opinion of the creator and do not necessarily reflect any officially endorsed positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or channel sponsors.",

    "description": "In this conversation, Jacob Hansen and Hayden Carroll delve into the complex issue of animal suffering within the context of Latter-day Saint theology. They explore the philosophical implications of suffering, the nature of God, and how these concepts relate to the problem of evil. The discussion highlights the differences between mainstream Christian views and Latter-day Saint perspectives, particularly regarding consent and the nature of creation. Ultimately, they seek to understand how animal suffering fits into a broader theological framework and what it means for the nature of God and His relationship with creation. In this conversation, Hayden Carroll and Jacob Hansen explore profound philosophical and theological concepts, including the nature of existence, the necessity of opposites, the act of creation, and the nature of God. They discuss the implications of these ideas on the understanding of the afterlife, consciousness, and the problem of evil, particularly from a Latter-day Saint perspective. The dialogue emphasizes the importance of distinctions in understanding reality and the divine. In this conversation, Hayden Carroll and Jacob Hansen delve into profound philosophical questions surrounding suffering, consciousness, and the existence of God. They explore the implications of suffering in relation to theistic beliefs, the nature of consciousness, and how these concepts intersect with Latter-day Saint teachings. The discussion culminates in a logical argument positing that suffering may actually support the existence of God, rather than undermine it.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Exploring the Problem of Animal Suffering\n12:01 The Nature of God and Human Suffering\n24:00 The Latter-day Saint Perspective on Suffering\n31:59 Animal Suffering in Latter-day Saint Theology\n35:20 The Realm of Possibility\n36:00 Conceptualizing the Afterlife\n37:03 Opposition and Experience\n38:05 The Necessity of Opposites\n38:55 Creation and Distinction\n41:01 The Nature of Reality\n43:08 Consciousness and Existence\n44:59 God and Creation\n46:07 The Nature of God\n50:05 The Problem of Evil\n51:49 The Latter-day Saint Perspective\n53:58 Defining God\n56:03 The Nature of Divinity\n01:06:05 The Problem of Suffering and God\n01:11:56 Consciousness: A Philosophical Inquiry\n01:20:03 The Nature of Consciousness and Its Implications\n01:27:04 Suffering and the Existence of God\n01:31:00 Closing Thoughts and Future Projects\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nThe problem of animal suffering raises significant theological questions.\nMainstream Christianity often struggles to justify animal suffering.\nLatter-day Saint theology offers a unique perspective on suffering.\nConsent plays a crucial role in understanding suffering in this life.\nGod's nature is constrained by eternal laws, not arbitrary limitations.\nAnimal suffering can be viewed through the lens of a consensual existence.\nCreation ex nihilo presents challenges for traditional views of God.\nThe concept of gratuitous suffering is central to the problem of evil.\nUnderstanding God's nature requires a departure from Greek philosophical frameworks.\nThe relationship between God and creation is complex and multifaceted. There is a realm where anything can happen.\nAnimals experience a journey similar to humans.\nOpposition is necessary for understanding existence.\nCreation involves the act of distinguishing.\nReality is understood through contrasts.\nGod's creation is about organizing and distinguishing.\nThe nature of God is a complex philosophical question.\nDivinity aligns with eternal laws for the highest good.\nThe problem of evil challenges traditional views of God.\nUnderstanding God requires clarity in definitions. Unjustified suffering challenges the existence of an all-good God.\n\n\nKeywords\n\nanimal suffering, problem of evil, Latter-day Saint theology, God, suffering, Christian God, unjust suffering, creation ex nihilo, consent, eternal law, afterlife, creation, opposites, consciousness, God, existence, reality, Latter-day Saint, philosophy, theology, suffering, consciousness, existence of God, atheism, theism, philosophical inquiry, animal suffering, LDS beliefs, agency, spiritual growth\n\n\nOur Links\nWebsite: http://thoughtfulfaith.org\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thoughtful.faith\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thoughtful.faith\nPodcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478749\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this video are entirely the opinion of the creator and do not necessarily reflect any officially endorsed positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or channel sponsors.",

    "title": "Exploring Atheism: Where Does Atheism Lead You? (Featuring Troy Leavitt)",
    "description": "So I recently had a conversation with my friend Troy Leavitt. Troy has been an online friend of mine for several years as we have interacted in various forums. Troy grew up a member of the church, served a mission and but left in the Mid 90s after losing his belief in the truth claims of the church. Troy got involved in the scientific skepticism movement and later became a student of the new atheists like Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett.\n\nTroy also is a well known video game developer and became a fairly significant public figure in the online gaming world during the gamer gate controversy as he pushed back on the social justice activism in the gaming world until his retirement amid activists pressure in 2021. Troy is one of my favorite people to engage with online. I consider him one of my good atheist friends and In this discussion we explore what happens when people lose their faith and questions about where Atheism logically leads and we begin exploring a notion known as the substitution hypothesis. \n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\nThe substitution hypothesis suggests a need for new beliefs after abandoning religion.\n\nPeople often replace religious frameworks with secular ideologies.\n\nDeconstruction of faith can lead to existential crises if not followed by reconstruction.\n\nPsychological needs must be addressed when leaving religion.\n\nNew moral frameworks often emerge in the absence of traditional religion.\n\nBuddhism offers a secular worldview that addresses suffering.\n\nHuman rights are often rooted in historical religious contexts.\n\nPower dynamics influence societal structures and individual rights.\n\nA pragmatic approach to society focuses on what works for human flourishing.\n\nUnderstanding human nature is essential for establishing universal ethics.\n \nThe concept of sanity is often defined by societal norms.\n\nTransgender issues highlight the conflict between personal preference and societal acceptance.\n\nHuman rights are often a reflection of shared moral sentiments.\n\nPower dynamics play a crucial role in shaping societal norms and laws.\n\nThe idea of privilege can be contextual and varies across different groups.\n\nStoicism offers a framework for finding meaning in a secular worldview.\n\nUtilitarianism focuses on maximizing happiness for the greatest number.\n\nHuman nature encompasses both biological instincts and social constructs.\n\nMoral sentiments are influenced by both biology and social context.\nConversations about morality and truth are essential for societal progress.\n\n\n\nKeywords\n\nsubstitution hypothesis, secularism, religion, atheism, morality, human rights, Buddhism, existentialism, psychological needs, deconstruction, transgender, social constructs, human rights, morality, privilege, atheism, stoicism, utilitarianism, human nature, power dynamics\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 Exploring the Substitution Hypothesis\n02:52 The Role of New Beliefs\n05:59 Deconstruction vs. Reconstruction of Faith\n10:13 The Blue Church and Moral Frameworks\n14:54 Anthropological Approach to Religion\n17:01 Atheism and Morality\n22:08 Buddhism as a Secular Framework\n35:12 Tribalism and Moral Sentiments\n40:25 Exploring Purpose and Tribalism in Religion\n43:02 Religion as a Social Technology\n44:48 Postmodern Perspectives on Human Rights\n46:17 The Nature of Human Rights and Power Dynamics\n49:11 Classical Liberalism and Individual Pursuits\n51:41 The Role of Government in Preserving Rights\n53:43 Comparative Societal Structures and Human Flourishing\n56:06 Human Nature and Universal Ethics\n01:00:00 Objective Morality and Shared Humanity\n01:04:11 The Complexity of Morality and Social Constructs\n01:08:47 Progress and the Evolution of Societal Norms\n01:12:59 Power Structures and Minority Rights\n01:18:54 Examining Racial Disparities and Privilege\n01:21:07 Exploring Stoicism and Secular Worldviews\n01:22:52 The Search for Meaning in Atheism\n01:27:50 Utilitarianism and the Value of Religion\n01:29:18 The Nature of Truth and Moral Sentiments\n01:35:06 Human Nature and the Pursuit of Well-Being\n01:49:51 Concluding Thoughts on Morality and Existence\n\n\nOur Links\nWebsite: http://thoughtfulfaith.org\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thoughtful.faith\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thoughtful.faith\nPodcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478749\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this video are entirely the opinion of the creator and do not necessarily reflect any officially endorsed positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or channel sponsors.",

    "description": "Could the Book of Mormon fit onto the Gold Plates? Recently a friend of mine named Jacob Mayberry reached out to me about a video by Trent Horn AGAIN going after the Book of Mormon plates saying there is no way the Book of Mormon could have fit onto the plates. Jacob is a PHD student currently with a solid understanding of the research on this question, So I figured I would just let Jacob share his thoughts. \n\nAlso In order to be transparent and make an apples to apples comparison it's important to make this point of clarification: Grover's 300 to 600 plate estimate is referring to the total number of plates whereas Trent was only only referring to the unsealed portion of the plates in his video. Various witness accounts say the unsealed portion made up anywhere from one-third to one-half of the stack. Therefore if we use Grover's 300 plate estimate, the unsealed portion would have been anywhere from 100 to 150 plates. If we take Grover's 600 plate estimate, it would have been anywhere from 200 to 300 plates. The bottom line here is that Trent's 40 plate estimate is ridiculously low\n\n\n\nOur Links\nWebsite: http://thoughtfulfaith.org\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thoughtful.faith\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thoughtful.faith\nPodcast: https://www.buzzsprout.com/1478749\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this video are entirely the opinion of the creator and do not necessarily reflect any officially endorsed positions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or channel sponsors.",

    "description": "In this conversation, Jacob Hansen and Hayden explore the concept of religious authority, contrasting it with secular authority and discussing various worldviews including atheism, spiritualism, and monotheism. They delve into the implications of these beliefs on moral codes and the nature of authority, ultimately questioning how divine authority is established and recognized in a world filled with diverse beliefs. In this conversation, Hayden and Jacob Hansen explore the complexities of spiritual and ecclesiastical authority within the context of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They discuss the roles of prophets, the distinction between ecclesiastical and epistemological authority, and the challenges of judging prophetic statements. The conversation also delves into the nature of religious authority, the implications of personal agency, and the issues faced by Protestantism regarding authority and interpretation of scripture. In this conversation, Hayden and Jacob explore the concept of authority within religious contexts, particularly focusing on the role of living authority figures versus textual authority. They discuss the implications of having a final authority in interpreting religious texts and policies, the historical context of authority in early Christianity, and the challenges faced by various religious groups in establishing their authority.

From the very beginning, Columbus notes how generously the natives shared whatever they had, and he did not want his crew to take advantage of them. He demanded that there be an exchange, for example, beads and bells for needed food supplies. It was unequal to be sure, but trade nonetheless. He continually recounts having to restrain his crew from looting villages when the residents fled at their approach.

He arrived in the new world about the time Columbus finished his last voyage. Las Casas was initially just like the other Spaniards and took slaves, but upon seeing the horrors of what the Spanish were doing, he dedicated his life to working for their rights and good treatment. Las Casas had access to all the first hand witnesses and documents of Columbus when he wrote his history of Columbus's time period. While Las Casas does take issue with some of what Columbus did, this Native rights activist, who had all the primary sources available to him, still had a favorable view of Columbus. \n\n“...truly, I would not dare blame the admiral’s intention, for I knew him well and all I know his intentions were good.” History of the Indies by Las Casas, Book One, Chapter 93, p. 53.”\n\n Las Casas described Columbus as: “… imposing, good natured, kind, daring, courageous, and a pious man… God had endowed him with good judgment, a sound memory and eagerness to learn… as a God fearing man… he must have avoided exaggeration.” p. 15. “I think Christopher Columbus was the most outstanding sailor in the world, versed like no other in the art of navigation, for which divine Providence chose him to accomplish the most outstanding feat ever accomplished in the world until now.” p. 17. “Christopher Columbus, to whom all Christendom is so greatly indebted.” p. 18. “... he was a well-mannered, handsome man and a church-going Christian…” p. 19. “ .. well spoken, wise and prudent.” p. 29. “The excellence of Columbus’s project and its inestimable value...” p 30. “Many is the time I have wished that God would again inspire me and that I had Cicero’s gift of eloquence to extol the indescribable service to God and to the whole world which Christopher Columbus rendered at the cost of such pain and dangers, such skill and expertise, when he so courageously discovered the New World.” pp. 34-35. “My limited understanding and poor eloquence prompt me to think that the fruit of Columbus’s labor speaks better for itself than I do… God gave this man the keys to the awesome seas, he and no other unlocked the darkness, to him and to no other is owed for ever and ever all that exists beyond those doors.” p. 35. “It is fitting to stress that God most sublimely favored all of Spain over other Christian nation, when he chose Christopher Columbus to give to Spain such a golden opportunity in every sense of the word.” p. 36. “... that most worthy man Christopher Columbus was the cause, second to God but first in the eyes of men, being the discoverer and only worthy first admiral of the vast territory known as the New World…” p. 37.",

    "description": "What can the churches statement itself tell us about who approved the statement to vice and what triggered this condemnation from the church. \n\nStatement from the church to Vice:\n\n “President Ballard and Tim Ballard (no relation) established a friendship a number of years ago. That friendship was built on a shared interest in looking after God’s children wherever they are and without regard to their circumstance. However, that relationship is in the past. For many months, President Ballard has had no contact with the founder of Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). The nature of that relationship was always in support of vulnerable children being abused, trafficked, and otherwise neglected. Once it became clear Tim Ballard had betrayed their friendship, through the unauthorized use of President Ballard’s name for Tim Ballard’s personal advantage and activity regarded as morally unacceptable, President Ballard withdrew his association.  President Ballard never authorized his name, or the name of the Church, to be used for Tim’s personal or financial interests. In addition, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints never endorsed, supported or represented OUR, Tim Ballard or any projects associated with them. President Ballard loves children, all over the world. It has been his mission and life’s work to look after them, care for them, and point them to their Savior.”\n\n\nOriginal Vice Article: https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjypz/mormon-church-denounces-tim-ballards-morally-unacceptable-activities#TimBallard #LDS #Mormon #Vice #OUR",

    "description": "Do you really love something if you are unwilling to sacrifice for it? \n\n\"A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation\"- Joseph Smith\n\nJordon Peterson Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b4g0oehX6k (You Are Not Committed To Something Unless You Are Willing To Sacrifice For It)\n\n\n2 Nephi 2:16\n\nWherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.\n\n \n\nMosiah 3:19\n\nFor the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord..\n\n \n\nAlma 34:34-35\n\n..For that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world. 35 For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.\n\nAlma 41:13-15\n\n13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful. 14 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again. 15 For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.\n\nRead:\n\n2 Nephi 2:11-12\n\n11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so.. righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility. 12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.\n\n \n\n2 Nephi 2:27-29\n\n27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself. 28 And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit; 29 And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.\n\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:8\n\n8 Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice—yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command—they are accepted of me.",

    "title": "The People Who Knew For Sure If Joseph Smith Was A Liar: Deathbed Confessions!",
    "description": "If Joseph Smith ways lying there must have been many other people who would have known he was lying. What did these people day on their deathbeds? \n\n\"Jacob, I want you to remember what I say to you. I am a dying man, and what would it profit me to tell you a lie? I know, that this Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God. My eyes saw, my ears heard, and my understanding was touched, and I know that whereof I testified is true. It was no dream, no vain imagination of the mind—it was real\".- Oliver Cowdery shortly after he returned to the church, just prior to his death. \n\n\"It having been represented by one John Murphy, that I, in a conversation with him last summer, denied my testimony as one of the three witnesses to the BOOK OF MORMON. To the end, therefore, that he may understand me now, if he did not then; and that the world may know the truth, I wish now, standing as it were, in the very sunset of life, and in the fear of God, once and for all to make this public statement: That I have never at any time denied that testimony or any part thereof. Those who know me best, well know that I have always adhered to that testimony. And that no man may be misled or doubt my present views in regard to the same, I do again affirm the truth of all of my statements, as then made and published. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear; it was no delusion!\"’- David Whitmer, who never returned to the church near the end of his life. \n\n\"The Book of Mormon is no fake. I know what I know. I have seen what I have seen and I have heard what I have heard. I have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written. An angel appeared to me and others and testified to the truthfulness of the record, and had I been willing to have perjured myself and sworn falsely to the testimony I now bear I could have been a rich man, but I could not have testified other than I have done and am now doing for these things are true.\" Martin Harris on his deathbed. \n\nI don't blame anyone for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself....I felt much like Paul (who had also seen Christ in a vision)….some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; …. So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me,reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.- Joseph Smith. \n\n#mormon #josephsmith #Threewitnesses #OliverCowdery #MartinHarris #DavidWhitemer #bookofmormon",

    "description": "Neo Darwinism states that DNA (and thus life) arose via Random Mutations + Natural Selection. \n\nHere is the problem with that idea based on the latest research.  \n\nFact 1: Non functional information (aka random information) does not produce a living thing.\n\nFact 2: Natural selection selects the most fit organisms, not the best individual mutations. Therefore mutations of all types can and are passed on from one generation to the next.\n\nFact 3: The mean fitness of a population will fall if the ratio of mutations that are passed from one generation to the next are mostly harmful/deleterious.\n\nFact 4: The vast majority of mutations are harmful/deleterious.\n\nLogical conclusion: Given these facts in a population, on average each generation will inherit a slightly less functional genome than the previous generation. Therefore is it is perfectly reasonable to have serious doubts about the theory until this is resolved. \n\n\n-------\n\nRelevant Research. \n(Please note. The research below does not arrive at the same conclusion but it DOES support the facts and/or does recognize the same basic problem.) \n\nBernardes shows : \"In the time evolution of finite populations, the accumulation of harmful mutations in further generations might lead to a temporal decay in the mean fitness of the whole population that, after sufficient time, would reduce population size and so lead to extinction.\" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0378437196000593\n\nKondrashov's textbook on how genomic information breaks down over time.  https://www.amazon.com/Crumbling-Genome-Impact-Deleterious-Mutations/dp/1118952111\n\nKondrashov's research into why the genome breaks down due to harmful mutations not being selected away.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519385701671\n\nKondrashov's findings validated by Charlesworth. \nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/evo.12195\n\nKimura's neutral theory which shows that natural selection does not stop the majority of slightly harmful mutations from being passed on. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Model-of-effectively-neutral-mutations-in-which-is-Kimura/4dd288a00d352fd6e7781763a4e26f373f30fc3e?p2df\n\nBataillon: \"In all the studies, the mean fitness or mean of fitness related traits declined over time, suggesting that the net effect\nof spontaneous mutation is indeed deleterious .... Mean decline of the Fitness components of MA lines ranged from 0.1% to 1±2% per generation.\"  https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.492.4305&rep=rep1&type=pdf. \n\nLynch explains how in humans selection is unable to prevent mutational deterioration. https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/202/3/869/5930150\n\n\n------------\nOther Videos I have made on this subject\n\nNeutral Mutations Don't Solve The Problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rwvt8M66J8\n\nInformation and Genetics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1H7FJacA-M",

He was not satisfied with conversions or building up a congregation. Six months after the organization of the Church, the revelations directed him to organize “Zion.” The word implied a society... The unit of organization was not the parish or the synod but the community.He worked all his life to organize communities, and in the end he succeeded. The judgment of history has been that Joseph’s great achievement was the creation of the Mormon people…It was his calling, as Joseph himself put it, to “lay a foundation that will revolutionize the whole world.” - Richard Bushman (Rough Stone Rolling)",

    "description": "\"How do we keep the commandment to love our neighbors? We seek to persuade our members that those who follow lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender teachings and actions should be treated with the love our Savior commands us to show toward all our neighbors.\" - Elder Dallin H Oaks\n\n\"I wish to say that our opposition to attempts to legalize same-sex marriage should never be interpreted as justification for hatred, intolerance, or abuse of those who profess homosexual tendencies, either individually or as a group. As I said from this pulpit one year ago, our hearts reach out to those who refer to themselves as gays and lesbians. We love and honor them as sons and daughters of God. They are welcome in the Church. It is expected, however, that they follow the same God-given rules of conduct that apply to everyone else, whether single or married.\" - Gordon B Hinkley\n\n “In the Church, there are widowed, divorced, and single members; those with family members who have fallen away from the gospel; people with chronic illnesses or financial struggles; members who experience same-sex attraction; members working to overcome addictions or doubts; recent converts; new move-ins; empty-nesters; and the list goes on and on.... \" The Savior invites us to come unto Him -- no matter our circumstances. We come to church to renew our covenants, to increase our faith, to find peace, and to do as He did perfectly in His life -- minister to others who feel like they don't belong.“- Elder D Todd Christofferson\n\n “Young people struggling with any exceptional condition, including same-gender attraction, are particularly vulnerable and need loving understanding -- not bullying or ostracism. With the help of the Lord, we can repent and change and be more loving and helpful to children -- our own and those around us”- Elder Dallin H Oaks\n\n\"Caring for All We genuinely love and care for all our neighbors, whether or not they believe as we do. Jesus taught us in the parable of the Good Samaritan that those of different beliefs should sincerely reach out to help anyone in need, being peacemakers, pursuing good and noble causes. In February, a headline in the Arizona Republic stated, \" Bipartisan bill supported by Latter-day Saints would protect gay and transgender Arizonans. \" We, as Latter-day Saints, are \" pleased to be part of a coalition of faith, business, LGBTQ people and community leaders who have worked together in a spirit of trust and mutual respect. \" President Russell M. Nelson once thoughtfully asked, \" Can not boundary lines exist without becoming battle lines? \" - Elder Neil A Andersen",

    "description": "Is it always wrong to lie? To kill? To cheat? \n\n\"For the salvation and exaltation of the children of men … are principles you cannot annihilate. They are principles that no combination of men can destroy. They are principles that can never die. … They are beyond the reach of man to handle or to destroy...Organization, programs, procedures, policies, and principles—all are important. But they are not of equal importance. …If you do not know the principles—by principles I mean the principles of the gospel, the doctrines, what’s in the revelations﻿—if you do not know what the revelations say about justice or mercy, or what they reveal on reproof or forgiveness, how can you make inspired decisions in those difficult cases that require your judgment? There are principles of the gospel underlying every phase of Church administration. These are not explained in the handbooks. They are found in the scriptures. They are the substance of and the purpose for the revelations...Procedures, programs, the administrative policies, even some patterns of organization are subject to change. We are quite free, indeed, quite obliged to alter them from time to time. But the principles never change.”  - Wilford Woodruff\n\nFeel free to us this video during your Come Follow Me study.",

    "description": "Very few issues are as divisive today as the issue of race. Blair and I are pretty much on opposite ends of the issue as this video demonstrates. So I want to extend an open invitation to Blair to come on my program so we can compare and contrast our different perspectives. I welcome a variety of points of view. \n\nSadly \"platforming racists views\" can be seen as a racist action by some on his side of the Aisle, but I hope Blair still is willing to engage in conversation with those he disagrees with. Ultimately if we don't have conversation to resolve differences the alternatives are not pretty.",

    "description": "How do we deal with the notion of fallible prophets? How can we be sure what is and what is not True? \n\nRelevant Quotes\n\n\"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.\" \n\n\"One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.\" Duet 19:15\n\n\"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. There is another that beareth witness of me, and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth...But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.\" - Jesus,  John 5:31-37\n\n“When prophets write and speak on the principles of the gospel, they should have the guidance of the Spirit. If they do, then all that they say will be in harmony with the revealed word. If they are in harmony then we know that they have not spoken presumptuously. Should a man speak or write, and what he says is in conflict with the standards which are accepted, with the revelations the Lord has given, then we may reject what he has said, no matter who he is.” (Smith, Doctrines of Salvation, 1:187.)\n\n\"A few question their faith when they find a statement made by a Church leader decades ago that seems incongruent with our doctrine. There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.\" - Neil L Andersen\n\n\"Many members of the Church have had visions or other inspirations to inform them about how things operate or are organized in the spirit world, but these personal spiritual experiences are not to be understood or taught as the official doctrine of the Church... As to all of these, the wise cautions of Elders D. Todd Christofferson and Neil L. Andersen in earlier general conference messages are important to remember. Elder Christofferson taught: “It should be remembered that not every statement made by a Church leader, past or present, necessarily constitutes doctrine. It is commonly understood in the Church that a statement made by one leader on a single occasion often represents a personal, though well-considered, opinion, not meant to be official or binding for the whole Church.”In the following conference, Elder Andersen taught this principle: “The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk.” The family proclamation, signed by all 15 prophets, seers, and revelators, is a wonderful illustration of that principle.\"- Dallin H Oaks. \n\n\n\"Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.\"- 2 Nephi 29:8\n\n\nBut as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God...Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\"- Paul in his letter to the Corinthians.",

    "description": "Suicide Hotline: 1-800-273-8255\nA Point of Clarification: Please note that in this video I am not claiming Christs law of chastity does not cause anxiety, pain and challenge for those who deal with same sex attractions. They certainly do. This pain is real and I fully acknowledge this. So while this may be ONE factor in the equation it does not explain THE RISE in suicides we have been seeing. The teachings on homosexual behavior have remained virtually the same since the beginning. The question is what changed that caused the recent spike? Those who claim the church is behind the rise are simply mistaken. Furthermore, they often don't consider the isolation caused by activists who tell gays their family and faith don't love them and are actually evil people. If we want healing we need both sides to love one another and stop judging simply because we sin differently.
