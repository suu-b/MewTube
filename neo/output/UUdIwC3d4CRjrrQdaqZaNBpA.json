    "description": "Paper rots. Hard drives fail. The Cloud will eventually go offline.\n\nEverything you have ever created has an expiration date. But one incredible poet who became a self-taught bio-engineer has written a message that will outlast the Earth itself.\n\nThis is the story of The Xenotext, the most durable piece of literature in the universe.\n\nBut more importantly, this is a masterclass in what I call \"Radical Autodidacticism.\"\n\nIt's about having the ambition to charge into uncharted territory, learn what has to get learned, and push through obstacles.\n\nNo matter what.\n\nAnd in this video, I break down exactly how an award-winning poet taught himself genetic engineering to hack the genome of an unkillable bacterium.\n\nAnd you'll discover how you can use his \"impossible\" learning strategies to master any skill you want.\n\nIn this video, you will learn:\n\nA \"Skill Stack\" strategy that will allow you to combine two or more skills (like Poetry + Genetics) to become unique.\n\nThe mindset and practices of Radical Autodidacticism so you can teach yourself complex topics and skills.\n\nPolymathic persistence so you can stay focused on multi-year projects, even if the world thinks you're crazy.\n\n📚 WATCH NEXT: If you want to understand the mindset behind this kind of genius, watch this video next: This habit separates self-taught geniuses from everyone else:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8MaD-497hQ\n\nWant more help?\n\n🔥 Download the FREE Self-Education Blueprint to start mastering \"impossible\" subjects today:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/seb/\n\n🗣️  If you are ready to reject the 'quick hack' mindset, tell me in the comments: What is the 'impossible' skill you want to master in your lifetime? Let’s put it in writing below.\n\nMore details about this video:\n\nWe often look at historical figures like Da Vinci or Tesla as the ultimate polymaths.\n\nBut Christian Bök is proof that Radical Autodidacticism is alive and well today.\n\nBy encoding information into Deinococcus radiodurans (a bacterium that can survive the vacuum of space), Bök challenges everything we know about memory, legacy, and the limits of self-education.\n\nTake notes and dream big.\n\nA bright future of learning and accomplishment awaits!\n\n#Polymath #Autodidact #SelfEducation #Memory #ChristianBok #TheXenotext #LearningStrategies",

How to use simple album covers and figures (like the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland) as \"magnetic triggers\" for your Method of Loci practice a.k.a. use of the Memory Palace technique.\n\n2. The \"Puzzle Art\" conceptual method I'm developing and why complex, fractal-dense art like Bök’s The Lady in Gold Among the Almond Blossoms may potentially provide superior retention for difficult topics like philosophy or languages.\n\n3. Texture & Retention and the kinds of art you might want to avoid precisely because they are too textures.\n\n4. How to use the \"micro-stations\" within various types of art to trigger pattern recognition and make memories stick harder.\n\nIf you are running out of buildings for your Memory Palaces, or just want to make your mnemonic practice more creative, this is the technique you need to add to your mental toolkit.\n\n🚀 WATCH NEXT: Secrets of the Geometric Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAPwOf31N7o\n\nWant more training?\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit here:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt",

    "description": "🧠 Ever wondered why your brain occasionally throws a linguistic curveball, swapping names or mixing up words?\n\nYou're about to find out because today I'm unraveling the fascinating cognitive science behind those awkward verbal mistakes that happen to everyone... no matter how good you might be at language processing normally.\n\nIt's all inspired by a slip of my own where I said \"Roger Gilmore\" instead of \"David Gilmore.\"\n\nWhat seems like a mistake actually reveals incredible insights into how our brains process language, memory, and communication.\n\nKey Insights in This Video:\n\n1, The real reason behind unexpected name mix-ups.\n\n2. Why frequent speakers are MORE likely to experience verbal slips.\n\n3. Why pros use teleprompters to aid their careers as professional communicators.\n\n4. How memory actually works (spoiler: it's not what you think!).\n\n5. The neuroscience behind verbal mistakes, especially in situations where presentation skills face heavy cognitive load.\n\n6.

It really just comes down to your vision and desire.\n\nThat's why in this deep dive study of how to get mnemonics into use in your everyday life, I'll also help you demolish all of the key objections people face when it comes to setting up their systems and using them consistently.\n\nReady for another MMM \"masterclass\" on the fundamentals that make your memory great?\n\nLet's do this thing!\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "description": "When Ashley Strand told me about his live performances of The Book of Mark, I knew I had to interview him.\n\nIn this wide-ranging discussion, we talk about the \"real work\" that goes into memorizing a verbatim text of over 10,000 words.\n\nWhether it's Shakespeare or scripture, I can tell that Ashley really knows his stuff. And as a huge fan of live theatre, I wanted to spread the word about his performances.\n\nPlus, I've memorized texts totalling over 2000 words in Sanskrit. So I think you'll appreciate some of the granular details we get into based on our shared experiences.\n\nWe discuss, for example, the importance of textual analysis as an aid to memory.\n\nThen there are some fantastic strategies related to the Memory Palace technique that will help pull you through some of the stickier elements that arise when memorizing verbatim.\n\nThe way Ashley combines the method of loci with textual analysis is super-fascinating.\n\nTo learn more about Ashely Strand and book tickets to see him perform The Book of Mark live, visit his site:\n\nhttps://www.kingjameslive.org/\n\nThanks as always for your interest and support and talk soon!\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

Along these lines, I couldn't resist questioning Ben on my favorite pet topics.\n\nI'm taking about free will, how he approaches the Memory Palace technique and finding out what's coming in the new version of his epic guide, The Monographs.\n\nFind Ben Cardall on YouTube here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-_FoMtz95usjzrwQjydPA\n\nThe Monographs Version 2:\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/themonographsv2/the-monographs-version-2\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "title": "The Moon Memory Palace Technique of Alexander Dicsone",
    "description": "The New Art of Memory would not be complete without covering the Moon Memory Palace Technique, developed by the ingenious Alexander Dicsone. \n\nAlexander Dicsone was a renowned memory expert and scholar during the Renaissance. He devoted himself to writing two books about memory techniques. These are gathered in English translation with the original Latin in The Hermetic Art of Memory.\n\nAs Discone covers the standard mnemonic strategies, he also unraveled many of the mysteries of human consciousness. His groundbreaking technique involves using the Mansions of the Moon as a kind of Memory Palace.\n\nIn doing this, Discone was inspired by the method of loci, but also aspects of astrology.\n\nDicsone was also a student of Giordano Bruno, the brilliant philosopher, astronomer and master of memory. Many of Bruno's innovative ideas laid the foundation for the Moon Memory Palace Technique, influencing Dicsone's work and propelling it to new heights.\n\nIn this video, I'll guide you through the step-by-step process of creating your own Moon Memory Palace. \n\nEven better, I'll show you ways to maximize the space on the moon and even use \"infinite\" moons. Together, we'll explore the lunar corridors, each room and \"mansion\" serving as a repository for your precious memories.\n\nBut the journey doesn't stop there! I'll also share valuable insights on optimizing your Moon Memory Palace, enabling you to unlock the full potential of your mind. With practice, you'll find yourself effortlessly memorizing facts, speeches, languages, and so much more.\n\nJoin our community of memory enthusiasts today by clicking that subscribe button and thanks as always for your interest and support.\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

And that makes him the perfect science writer to explore what direction is and how we might optimize it.\n\nEven better, in Dark and Magical Places, Christopher Kemp explores how the brain produces your sense of direction.\n\nYou'll also learn why some of us might struggle to keep on track or lose our way in space.\n\nWe delve into some of the common mistakes people make and get into some of the \"metaphysics\" behind space itself.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned traveler or someone struggling to get around your hometown, you'll find this discussion useful.\n\nI highly recommend reading Dark and Magical places and hope you enjoy this interview with Christopher Kemp.\n\nFor more resources, a few years back, I created this tutorial on how to memorize any address:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2shzBN1tNo\n\nAnd...\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit;\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit;\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "title": "Short Term Vs Long Term Memory & How To Quickly Improve Both At The Same Time",
    "description": "Short-term memory and long-term memory are two different types of memory that play different roles in how we process and remember information. \n\nShort-term memory is responsible for holding onto small amounts of information for a brief period of time, while long-term memory is responsible for storing larger amounts of information for longer periods of time. \n\nIn this video, you'll discover the differences between short-term and long-term memory and give examples of how they work in our daily lives. We will also discuss some strategies for improving your memory and keeping your mind sharp.\n\nWhy should you care?\n\nWell, there are several benefits to improving short-term memory, including:\n\n* Increased ability to focus and concentrate on tasks, leading to better performance in school or at work.\n\n* Improved ability to retain and recall important information, such as names, phone numbers, or instructions.\n\n* Enhanced problem-solving skills and decision-making ability.\n\n* Reduced forgetfulness and improved memory for daily tasks and events.\n\nIt gets even better because the benefits of improving long-term memory include:\n\n* Improved ability to retain and recall information over the long term, such as memories from childhood or historical events.\n\n* Enhanced ability to learn new skills and concepts, leading to better performance in school or at work.\n\n* Increased ability to remember important details and events, such as dates, appointments, or directions.\n\n* Reduced risk of cognitive decline and age-related memory loss.\n\n🔥 For powerful training that leads to even more benefits, get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit;\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\nFor last week's video on visualization techniques, check out:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BMVeGVUIOk\n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

I’m just laying out all the great techniques I’m aware of from around the world and throughout time.\n\nYou’ll notice some crossover between these techniques, if not repetition. That’s because all memory techniques appear to be spatial in one form or another. \n\nFurther, as Giordano Bruno has said in many of his memory books, if anyone thinks long and hard enough about these techniques, they’ll reach the same conclusions.\n\nThese techniques might seem like they belong to or originate with a particular group. Certainly, everyone should take pride in their history. \n\nBut because there is so much crossover between these techniques, we should see the common humanity in them and not arrive at some kind of tribalism. \n\n--- Bookmarks ---\n\n0:55 \"Dusty old books...\"\n1:18 Don't get me wrong on this point\n2:25 Repetition Rocks!\n2:33 Bruno's Wisdom\n3:50 Repetition is difference\n3:59 What \"ancient\" means\n4:31 Aboriginal memory techniques\n5:53 How to use a Songline\n6:12 Songline example\n6:41 Abbreviations\n8:21 Pegword method\n8:54 Katapayadi\n10:15 Buddhist memory techniques\n11:39 Ars Notoria\n12:51 The Greek Memory Palace\n14:46 The Hidden Greek knowledge\n15:14 Parallelism and Enveloping\n17:59 The Hand Memory Palace\n19:50 The Mystic Ark\n20:42 Bruno's Statues\n22:09 Statues for learning multiple languages\n22:13 Using a toy as a Memory Palace\n23:29 Ninja memory techniques\n26:38 Robert Fludd's \"Real\" Theater Technique\n\n--- Additional Resources ---\n\nActive Recall\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um9S6TDVP0Y\n\nTyson Yunkaporta on Aboriginal and Indigenous memory techniques\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_--IAZz410\n\nArs Notoria\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIEWtw8B-j4\n\nMike McKinley\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5HEffOd27Q\n\n❤️ If you find my content helpful, join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n🔔 Subscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\n🚀 Resources I recommend:\n\n🏢 The Memory Palace Technique:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🎨 Mind Mapping for confidence to use these techniques:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BracGhyKS4I\n\n🔥 The Truth That Every Successful Learner Needs To Know\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSIaqhsqio\n\n🗣️ My TEDx Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\n✅ Recommended playlists:\n\nThe Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nHow to Become Fluent in a Language:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TOary2yQQ&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-tGGaDkT0w8oDDMoPj0Kt1\n\nHow to Study Effectively:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nr0HkOn9m4&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8OR3Qofo3XLX3iVeqPZdO2\n\nFocus Your Mind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zTkA8MW2k&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9wwdZj_YPSRY_VF12HRLSo\n\nMind Palace Training Secrets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3BQPH0MlM&list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nMemory Improvement Books:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-palace-books/\n\n🔥 Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit;\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt \n\n✅ Let's connect:\n\nTwitter - @anthonymetivier\n\nInsta - magneticmemorygram\n\nAnd of course, get subscribed to this channel and enable notifications so you don't miss any of our community live streams. 🙏\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "description": "Have you ever worried that your Memory Palace efforts will go to waste because you can't remember...\n\nWhat you remembered?\n\nNever fear.\n\nIt's fun and easy to use the Memory Palace technique and all the more so when you use it correctly. \n\nAs Richard Baker framed the question:\n\n\"I can use memory techniques to remember lists of information regarding different topics, to-do lists of different categories, or have more than one memory palace location that might have different sub-locations or serve a different purpose.  So I am no longer relying on passive brain processes to store this information.  But I am still relying on passive brain processes to remember what I have learned.  By indexing, I mean a way to build a reference of what you have in your memory so you won't forget that either.  If I have a useful list of concepts memorized in case I have to survive in the wilderness, but don't have some kind of index to remember that I have remembered that list in the first place, I might not remember that I have that list remembered.  Or I might have a good memory of all the stuff I stored in a given memory palace/location, but if I eventually have 20 memory palaces and forget the \"entry point\" to one of them, I might not be able to get back to that string of connections that leads me to remember all the stuff in that palace except by accident.\n\nRight now I'm just trying to have a master list of lists to remind me of the things I've built, but it feels convoluted and like it will get too long soon and I was wondering if there were other approaches that were more elegant.\"\n\nI think it's a great question and I hope my answer sets Richard's mind at ease AND yours. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that the best way to get results from the Memory Palace technique is to dive in and start using them.\n\nAnd I hope today's explanation helps you do that.\n\nFor more help, check out my FREE Memory Improvement Kit at:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "description": "Imagine memorizing 70 decks of playing cards to raise money for Alzheimer’s. \n\nNot just to fund research into curing the disease, but also to support front line workers who help care for the victims of this cruel disease. \n\nThat’s the goal memory athlete Braden Adams set for himself. \n\nThink about this for a second: That’s 70 times 52…\n\n3640 cards, all shuffled up.\n\nThat’s a lot of Memory Palace prep and Braden and I dig into that topic, including the “Shadow” technique used for encoding the cards - a powerful way of applying mnemonic tacts you’re not going to miss. \n\nBut it’s the meaning of the mission I want to focus on above all.\n\nAnd I feel that memorizing cards is a perfectly aligned symbol for the battle against conditions like Alzheimer’s.\n\nAfter all, the disease mixes up your thoughts and memories, but when you have the kind of memory skills Braden has developed for yourself, no matter how shuffled those cards get, you can still lay everything out in perfect order. \n\nTo support Braden, check out:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/bcalz\n\nTo join Braden's stream when he memorizes the cards and recalls them: \n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/bradenexplosion\n\nTo check out my previous conversation with Braden, see:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqazyPfDHYw\n\nThanks as always for your interest and support.

    "description": "If you want to improve your memory and concentration, you need Ron White's Black Belt Memory Course. \n\nI recently completed Ron White's Black Belt Memory Program myself. Check out the introduction to see what it looks like. \n\nNow, you might be confused. Why would someone who already knows a great deal about the techniques take another memory improvement program?\n\nThat's just the thing:\n\nAn expert knows the limits of their knowledge. They know that they don't know what they don't know. \n\nAnd to learn even more about what I don't know, I reached out to Ron and suggested this discussion. \n\nI learned even more than I was expecting! \n\nIn this exclusive interview with Ron White, we go deep into the origins of this course. \n\nAnd we dig deep into the granular details of what makes memory techniques tick. We talk about:\n\n* The Memory Palace technique (or Mind Palace, method of loci, etc)\n\n* 00-99 PAO and the Major System\n\n* Using these techniques to complete LARGE learning goals\n\n* The value of old memory improvement books\n\n* The important of active recall and review for establishing long term retention\n\n* ... and much, much more.\n\nDon't know Ron White of @Brainathlete?\n\nHe is a two-time Memory Champion and incredibly talented mnemonist and memory athlete. \n\nHe's an author, speaker and charitable individual who uses his memory techniques to demonstrate their power in multiple ways.\n\nHis Afghanistan Memory Wall project is one example of just how much anyone can achieve with these techniques while bringing great meaning to the world of mnemonics. \n\nLearn more about it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJK8BPLQFsQ \n\nAnd of course, subscribe to Ron's channel here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrn5bzpRYOKVJoRoYvn8mPQ\n\nI think this is an astonishing and beautiful way to help inspire and educate people about the power of memory. I hope you recognize that too and can find your own memory projects to create meaning around how you use the techniques.\n\nWhen arranging this interview, I promised Ron I would do everything in my power to make the discussion EPIC.\n\nI feel that it was, and I hope you'll agree. \n\nAs always, I look forward to your comments in the discussion area, and thanks for sharing this one around. \n\nTalk soon! \n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nP.S.

He also covers the court of public opinion from a legal perspective. \n\nFrankly, I've watched so many of his videos and those of the colleagues he recommends, it feels like part time law school sometimes. \n\nPlus, I dig the community he's creating, which you can check out here:\n\nhttps://vivabarneslaw.locals.com/\n\nCheck him out on Twitter too:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thevivafrei\n\nI think one of the best things you can do is to learn as much as you can about how you are governed.

    "description": "Are you curious about the memory techniques used in the ancient world? I'm talking about aboriginal memory techniques in Australia and all sorts of indigenous tools for learning and retaining information.\n\nIf so, you're in luck. In this video, I sat down with Tyson Yunkaporta, an author and educator who has shared these techniques with many groups of people.\n\nHe's a huge fan of both the Aboriginal memory techniques and the Memory Palace, so I think you're going to love how we discuss all the techniques we go over in this discussion.\n\nAs the author of Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save The World, Dr. Yunkaporta is an incredible teacher. I found this book compelling, useful and the main mnemonic device taught in the book is an obvious win for social change and healing global issues.\n\nBecause as Tyson expresses in this interview, the time for \"memory wars\" and all kinds of other wars is over. We simply don't have time for them anymore. And to help you in your culture be part of the solution, instead of the problem, you need to widen your context and bring that back into your community.\n\nHere are just some of the memory techniques you'll discover in this discussion:\n\nReal places and objects\nRelational\nHaptic connections\nRiddles and wordplay\nNight sky\nPlace and maps of place\nSymbols and images\nRhythm and rhyme\nRepetition\nSong\nRude language\nStories\nMessage sticks\n\nIn sum, if you were to put these mnemonics into play, you'd be using them as a \"way of life.\"\n\nFor more on the scientific study that inspired this \"yarn,\" please see my discussion with Dr. David Reser:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkDgT6_sNJQ\n\nI also recommend you supplement this video with Brilliant Miller's interview with Tyson:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCzlgBbv5OY\n\nLynne Kelly comes up in this interview, so if you'd like to catch up with me and her, please see:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jim_csNGV1Q\n\nThe \"Memory Wars\" recording with Dr. Reser and Dr. Yunkaporta:\n\nhttps://anchor.fm/tyson-yunkaporta/episodes/Memory-Wars-e12c0em\n\nWe talk about a number of mnemonic devices in this interview, so please be prepared to write them down. Songlines are part of a larger set that people used who had a ton of knowledge they needed in order to survive. \n\nMake sure you supplement your own survival by digging as deeply as you can into the wide range of techniques history around the world has to offer. And apply the information you acquire to helping the world become a better place. \n\nThanks for being part of the memory world at large and talk soon!\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n#memoryexpert",

    "description": "Do you want to incorporate the Memory Palace technique into your everyday life?\n\nWhether it's for general memory improvement or for studying, I've done it all. \n\nAnd in this video, I take you behind the scenes. \n\nYou might just call this video, \"A Day in the Life of Anthony Metivier.\"\n\nOf course, there's a lot more to things that I do than just the method of loci. \n\nI have to fit in writing, music practice, fitness, filming and all kinds of things. \n\nI imagine that you're much the same, so I hope you enjoy the tips that I share. \n\nIf I were to boil it all down to one thing, it's this:\n\nI LIVE inside a Memory Palace. \n\nAnd that makes all the difference in the world. \n\nI also don't take the easy way out, which so many do, which is why they struggle to improve their memory.\n\nBut if you're into the holistic memory training I talk about, please make sure to follow up with the additional resources I have to share. Memory is a martial art of the mind. And to experience its benefits, you have to treat it as such. \n\nPlus, you need to take the meditation and mindfulness angles seriously. \n\nSo many people can't work out how to use this technique because they simply don't have quiet minds.\n\nBut when you learn to quiet the mind, all memory techniques become incredibly fun and much easier. \n\nPlus, learning to organize your day is hugely important. There's really no way to improve everything across the board if you live a life of chaos. \n\nDisruptions must be reduced so that you can focus on what matters. That was one of the points of focus I took you through in the video on image streaming I created for you a while back. Did you check it out? \n\nIn all things, you can have an amazing memory. \n\nI'd love to help you out, so if you're new here, get subscribed, his that thumbs up and let me know your questions and progress updates in the comments. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\n=== Further Resources ===\n\nHow to Build a Memory Palace\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nMemory Palace for Mental Peace Long Form Demonstration & Discussion:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgNQ9bU-nEg\n\nTwo Easily Remembered Questions That Silence Negative Thoughts\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\nMemory-based Meditation\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwHtert6DjQ\n\nHyperphantasia\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAz3_pkqXqc\n\nImage Streaming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPrLt_sJgr0\n\nVisualization Techniques for Success\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA34yZxXUUw\n\n3 POWERFUL Mind Mapping Examples For BETTER Memory Palace Generation\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIhHKBRoy8E\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n#memorypalace #mindpalace",

    "title": "Better Than The Memory Palace? | Deep Dive Into A Scientific Study With Dr. David Reser",
    "description": "Dozens of people emailed me recently about some news articles stating that an Aboriginal memory technique is better than the Memory Palace. \n\nYou know what?\n\nIt might just be. \n\nBut our knowledge of how and why it might work requires nuanced understanding of what the study actually says - along with as many voices as we can get to help us explore it.\n\nThat's why I reached out to Dr. David Reser at Monash University. Here's his profile:\n\nhttps://research.monash.edu/en/persons/david-reser\n\nDr. Reser on Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dreser_neuro\n\nThe original study:\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251710\n\nFollow-up interview with Tyson Yunkaporta:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_--IAZz410\n\nFrom what I can understand, this study is incredibly interesting and bodes very well for future studies and your own application of the aboriginal memory technique. I can only hope more will emerge. \n\nIn fact, I'm hoping to follow with a second interview with Tyson Yunkaporta. Until then, here's an existing interview with him about his book Sand Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCzlgBbv5OY\n\nIn brief, this study showed that the Aboriginal technique performed better than the Method of Loci after a certain period of time. Tests after longer periods of time had fewer participants, so it feels like the study is less conclusive until further data from future tests arrive.\n\nThere are several other factors this conversation brought out that bring nuance to the role of the participants and what their preparedness suggests. I think the role of terminology also comes through and it is an interesting opportunity to think through how and why terms emerge as such.\n\nIn all things, the Memory Palace technique for studying and anything else was always just a term. And anything that adds to our knowledge of how to memorize anything better, faster and with great joy should be embraced. I can't wait to learn more about this methodology, see future studies and give some of the ideas a try.\n\nI hope this discussion helps you consider the role of science in discovery, the role of mind in learning and starts you on a deeper journey with all the memory traditions around the world. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n#memoryexpert",

    "title": "Hyperphantasia: A Guided Meditation For Seeing In Your Mind | Memory-Based Meditation",
    "description": "Can you experience hyperphantasia and start seeing in your mind? \n\nI believe so, and in this guided meditation, I want to help you boost your mind's eye.\n\nThe role of mental imagery is not well understood, but it is very well-experienced. The trick is to have some guidance in paying closer attention to your experience of consciousness. \n\nThat way, you can experience visualization in many different ways.\n\nWill this memory-based meditation help you if you have aphantasia, or just normal phantasia?\n\nI believe so and here's why:\n\nWhen I was a kid, they didn't use the term \"aphantasia.\" They didn't even have such a thing as an aphantasia test. Instead, I was told I had \"Imagination Deficit Disorder.\"\n\nThe consequences weren't so severe in my case because I'm a stubborn individual. I fought back and took the courses I wanted to take anyway. \n\nBut others have been held back and that's why I created this guided meditation. I want you to succeed, and much more quickly than I did. \n\nTo get the most out of this guided meditation experience, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. It doesn't really matter if you have your eyes open or closed. You can experiment with both. \n\n2. Do your best to link your breath with the questions I ask throughout the meditation experience. \n\n3. Try to notice objections and then let them go. It's normal for the \"monkey mind\" to object, so just notice it and let it go. Use your breath.\n\n4. Do your best to answer the questions I'm asking. You might not be used to thinking in this way, and that's fine. Give it your best and come back to it to deepen your experience. The more you work with this form of self-inquiry, the better and more nuanced results you'll get.\n\n5. Journal about your experience. This form of self-observation will help increase your metaskills and deepen your connection to the goal of hyperphantasia. \n\n6. Share your comments in the discussion. \n\n7. Check out the additional resources below.\n\nAs always, if you haven't completed the MMM FREE Memory Improvement Kit, please consider doing so. It's a great way to activate your mind's eye, especially when it comes to the eight Magnetic Mode: The Spatial Mode.\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions and I'll get back to you a.s.a.p.\n\nThanks as always for your interest and support of this channel.

    "title": "What is Memory-based Meditation? Intro to Types 1 & 2 for Better Memory",
    "description": "When I wrote The Victorious Mind, I focused on just one type of memory-based meditation. \n\nNow the time has finally come to teach the second type of memory-based meditation. \n\nLike Type 1, Type 2 is based heavily on the Memory Palace technique. But in this case, it draws even more heavily on research by Dr. Tim Dalgleish.\n\nIn his research, Dalgleish has shown how using the Method of Loci (a.k.a the Memory Palace technique) can help reduce depression and symptoms from other issues, such as PTSD.\n\nI covered this research in depth in a live stream. Feel free to watch the replay, which is called: \n\nCan the Memory Palace Technique Help Depression? [Memory Science Evidence]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs9UHz4pVuM\n\nNot only has this approach to using the Memory Palace helped me personally, but it is bound to work.\n\nAnd so I want to begin releasing a number of guided meditation videos on this channel.\n\nFirst, in this video, I need to explain more about the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 memory-based meditation. \n\nI wanted to go into depth because this will be a new direction for the channel and I hope regular and new viewers will support the initiative. I have every reason to believe that this is the biggest contribution the Magnetic Memory Method initiative can bring to humanity. \n\nIf the whole idea that memory training and meditation can go together is new to you, here's a video that breaks it down. It's called:\n\nMindfulness and Meditation for Better Memory\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPMoUYiPYLk\n\nThis video is chapter two of The Victorious Mind audiobook and presents the key research and the reasons why I think Type 1 memory-based meditation works so well. To this day, I continue to practice both.\n\nThere is much to explore when it comes to Type 2, so I hope you'll find this introduction video informative and useful. \n\nMy hope is that this approach gives you something more active and consequential to do. It should be an alternative to the \"Memory Recall\" videos that talk about binaural beats and the like.\n\nSuch as this kind:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjetznvcIjc\n\nThere's no research that shows any such things work. \n\n\nBut there's lots of research showing that techniques like I shared in this TEDx Talk work very well:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvtYjdriSpM\n\nBut what does work is showing up consistently to practice and I will be rolling out deeply engaging sessions that will relax you, help you increase your focus and boost your memory. \n\nI can't wait to hear your thoughts on the project, and I can't wait to help you through the same Free Memory Improvement Kit that has helped many others over the years. \n\nThat way you can enjoy both types of memory-based meditation with ease. \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\n\nThanks as always for your interest and support.\n\nTalk soon! \n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\n\"Memory Scientist\"\nCreator, Magnetic Memory Method\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n\n#memorybasedmeditation",

Maybe they’re reading a long and complex novel, studying for a big exam, or doing a task that involves being really careful.\n\nYes, those things might be involved, but not necessarily. So let’s start thinking about concentration by thinking about it as circles. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause the word “concentration” comes from “concentric.” That means having a common center. \n\nCommon with whom or with what?\n\nWell, that’s where things start to get really interesting and the meditations for focus and concentration you’re about to discover will help you find the center of concentration and accelerate your ability to enter into deeply focused states at will.\n\n\nThese concentration exercises are powerful, but please keep going with the following resources and additional concentration meditation exercises.\n\n\n--- Further Resources ---\n\n7 more concentration meditation exercises :\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/concentration-meditation\n\nVisualization Meditation training:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp3XNzfMA88\n\nMindfulness and Meditation for Better Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPMoUYiPYLk\n\nWhat is Memory-Based Meditation?\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwHtert6DjQ\n\nHarry Kahne's Multiple Mentality Course:\n\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/harry-kahne-multiple-mentality/\n\nHow to Memorize Sanskrit Chants Fast:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zGDLE98GxY\n\n\n4 Proven Ways Meditation Improves Memory Palace Training And Practice\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdtsQfrkBJg\n\nMeditation For Memory Improvement - Even With A Noisy Mind!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEq9p81kMGw\n\nMeditation to Improve Memory and Concentration Tips\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL4dllZY4u8\n\nFREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nHow to Use Guided Visualization to Diminish Stress and Anxiety\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/guided-visualization/\n\n10 Minute Guided Meditation for Focused Attention and Concentration\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBO8QEjANjs\n\n5 Minutes Meditation Can Improve Your Concentration\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpNmkpbxryM\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "description": "Giordano Bruno wrote several useful memory improvement books.\n\n\nBut they can be puzzling, especially since he talked about the Memory Palace technique in different ways. \n\nFor example, he released the \"Mind Palace\" from the so-called method of loci in a few different ways by using seals and other kinds of association. \n\n\nFor more on these matters, please check out all the videos in our Art of Memory playlist on this channel:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\n\nI used to struggle to understand a lot of what Bruno was talking about, but then I started to try using techniques he favored, such as ars combinatoria or the art of combination. \n\n\nIt is truly powerful and the more I read Bruno's Memory Palace books, the more my practice improves. \n\n\nI don't know exactly where you should start with Giordano Bruno's memory training material, but On the Shadows of the Ideas is possibly not ideal. \n\nI hope the suggestions and memory resources I give in this video give you some direction - and if you're already clear on Bruno, please help others by diving into the discussion. \n\n\nThat gives all of us more clarity and is exactly what I believe Bruno would have use aspire to. After all, memory training isn't about us as individuals (in his pantheism, there really are no individuals as such). We improve our memory to help others because that is the right thing to do.\n\nFor a full review of The Hermetic Art of Memory that deepens this admittedly philosophical point, please see:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArFTgRDIWo4\n\n\n\nIt is yet another excellent memory improvement book to add to your collection.\n\n\nFor the vision statement training, please see:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFz31HpVkj0\n\nThanks as ever for the view and please let me know what you'd like to see covered next on this channel.\n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony \"Always Reading Memory Books\" Metivier\n\n\nP.S....\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n\n#booktube",

    "description": "We all know and love Giordano Bruno for his incredible books on the Memory Palace technique.\n\nBut what many people don't realize about books like On the Shadows of the Ideas is that it has three big problems. \n\nAnd these problems have made it hard for many students of memory techniques to make the progress they could have if they knew about them.\n\nYou see, there is no such thing as the Giordano Bruno memory system. He's trying to teach you how to create your own mnemonic strategies.\n\nEven better, he's trying to teach what is called ars combinatoria, or the art of combination. More on that incredible mnemonic device for you right here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cYDmaBXvJg\n\nOnce you understand these things, you will use the Memory Palace, Roman Room, Journey Method, Mind Palace or whatever you want to call it a LOT better. \n\nThen, you will also understand Bruno better too and correct more of the errors introduced by Frances Yates in The Art of Memory.\n\n\nThis problem is covered in more-depth in part one of The Art of Memory Playlist:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I\n\nWhy is this topic so important? \n\nBecause on top of becoming a master of your memory, you also stand to connect deeper with your own consciousness.

    "description": "Few things irritate me more than the false information out there about speed reading. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the truth about how to read faster has little to do with what they usually teach in speed reading for beginners courses.\n\nBecause the truth is that if you really want to improve reading speeds without sacrificing comprehension and memory, you need better strategies.  \n\nFor example, in How to Memorize a Textbook, I have shared a very powerful technique you can learn and start using today:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIQRiqQFKQY\n\nBut counting your words per minute to establish a baseline?\n\nReducing subvocalization? \n\nBoth speed reading techniques are COMPLETE wastes of time. \n\nThe alternative is covered in this video and I can't wait to hear from you. \n\nBecause authentic speed reading is possible. But only if you have strategies that make sense and develop the true reading comprehension skills discussed in today's video.\n\n\nFor all 16 tips on how to read faster, please see:\n\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-read-faster/\n\nFor the memory improvement aspect of the game, check out this FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\n\nIt will help you rapidly learn more in ways that naturally improve how quickly you read.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "description": "Giordano Bruno devices over 30 different kinds of Memory Palace. Ars Combinatoria is just one, and it is very powerful.\n\nSometimes called The Combinator, this memory wheel is a mixture Memory Palace of his \"seals\" called The Field and The Tree. \n\nSeals are something we'll explain later in The New Art of Memory Playlist. If you're new here and need to catch up, you can start the series here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9njWtWwRrkZKaq8j7OjDL3\n\nTo read the original text yourself, here's the Amazon link for Thirty Seals and The Seal of Seals, prepared in translation by Scott Gosnell:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Thirty-Seals-Giordano-Bruno-Collected-ebook/dp/B01MRVORB7/\n\n\nLet me know in the comments if you give this \"Decision Memory Palace\" a try. Obviously, you will want to meet the \"requirements\" Giordano Bruno has in mind before the real results start kicking in, but I believe using these techniques can itself help get you there. \n\nWho was Giordano Bruno and what is a Memory Palace? \n\nAlthough you may have heard that he is a hermetic wizard and whatnot from Frances Yates, it is not clear that this was the case. I throw some nuance on the topic in this analysis of her book, The Art of Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3GGcO5Cx3I\n\nMy thesis is that Bruno was simply a very good master of the Memory Palace technique and quite likely someone who experienced what we sometimes call \"enlightenment.\"\n\nIf this is the case, the feelings he described as being achievable by anyone likely arrived because he trained his procedural memory through extensive memory practice and use of the method of loci.\n\nHe also used his memory to work on topics like math, physics and philosophy and seems to have started quite young. He lived from 1548 to 1600 when he was burned at the stake. \n\nThis is a sad outcome, but fortunately many of his memory improvement books survived. We are very blessed to have them and I look forward to diving deeper into more of them in future videos.\n\nTo learn more about the Memory Palace technique, please see:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-YrZhudPU\n\nDon't forget to grab my FREE Memory Improvement Kit while you're there:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA/join\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "description": "If you're confused about how to learn Chinese, this video is designed to help you out.\n\nNow, I've only passed Level III in Mandarin at the Confucius Institute. (It's based somewhat but not directly on HSK). Given the fact that I passed the final exam with a score of 99%, I think you'll get great value from my experiences.\n\n中文 is an exciting language, but people struggle with how to learn Mandarin for reasons that you can easily overcome. \n\nChinese grammar is one of the easiest parts of the Chinese language, and we'll talk about that. But when it comes to beginner Chinese, I've found that just memorizing the vocabulary was the easiest for me, provided I did it using what is called the levels-of-processing effect. This is also known as the Big Five of Language Learning.\n\nTools I've found most helpful along the way include the Outlier Linguistics courses and Pleco add-on. You can grab them all here:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/outlier-linguistics-resources\n\nConversations by Olly Richards:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/conversations\n\n(I've only gone through his Chinese program, but you might be interested in other languages he's created material for as well.)\n\nI also love using Screenflow during all my language learning sessions. Here's where to grab it:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/screenflow\n\nWhen it comes to Chinese learning, it's important to blend a number of language learning tactics, so please don't miss the full playlist I've created for you.

    "description": "The Victorious Mind: How to Master Memory, Meditation and Mental Well-Being by Anthony Metivier. \n\nThe Victorious Mind shows you: \n\n • The #1 thing that holds you back from accomplishing your memory improvement goals. \n\n• The 3 BIG misunderstandings that prevent you, as a lifelong learner, from fulfilling your purpose and dreams.\n\n• 3 things you must do to “get on purpose,” get lasting traction AND establish the mental peace that creates true focus for the rest of your life.\n\n• The EXACT steps I follow to build memory systems that have helped me learn everything needed to live a life of passion - and escape the horrible nightmare my mind used to imprison me in.\n\nReviews:\n\n\"As a life long student of the art memory, I've read my fair share of rehashed How to memory books; this is not one of them. As someone who has dealt with depression and anxiety since leaving the military, this book really hit home. Dr. Metivier takes you through a guided tour of his early life, the demons he faced, his process of overcoming them, and his journey in becoming the modern-day Giordano Bruno.\n \n I can not thank him enough for his part in my metamorphosis from a mentally beat up U.S. Vet to a top student in University.\"\n\n- Adolfo Artigas\n\n\"I bought this book in hopes for some memory techniques and a good read. Instead, I was surprised to behold a Swiss Army knife of meditation, breathing, and memory skills wrapped in the warm blanket of human experience and fascinating autobiography. \n\nThe writing is concise and to the point. Necessary for the teaching of time honored techniques and exercises, put here to a new focus. Memory and well being. Anthony reveals great vulnerability in telling his story through the sufferings and mishaps that plagued his past, but there is no , \"poor me\" syndrome in the tone of his writing. He writes sincerely, with an open heart, to help others avoid the detrimental mental states that limited his potential during his obvious suffering. \n\nHe encourages you, step by step, leading you in exercises to avoid/alleviate the pitfalls he encountered. Inspired by the traditions of Zen Buddhism, Mindfulness, and the works of Gary Weber and Alan Watts, Anthony Metivier brings you lifetimes of meditation practices without you having to sit under a tree for eternity or stare at a wall for millennia. \n\nWhere he really shines is in the memory exercises which are his expertise! Whether you have been using Memory Palaces for decades or are following along building your very first palace, he guides you thoughtfully into the powerful techniques which can transform your life. I found his candid tales through dangerous mental states inspiring and egoless. He did not make this book to huff and puff about highfalutin memory techniques. He draws you through his suffering and allows you to experience the grace of success within the handling of his own mental state with the exercises he bequeaths to you in this charming book. Come for the techniques, stay for the drama! You will not be disappointed.\"\n\n- Christian Fitzharris\n\nGet The Victorious Mind on Audible: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/vm-audible\n\nGet The Victorious Mind for Kindle, paperback or hardcover:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/vm\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nP.S.

Brain exercises can keep your brain from feeling flabby and help boost an already-fit brain significantly. \n\nNeurobics are also a great way to lift your mood, helping you cope with depression, deal with rejection, and even in overcoming anxiety. We’ll cover the three main categories of neurobics: physical, environmental, and auditory. I’ll show you what they are and how this special form of brain fitness can help your mental life thrive.\n\nPersonally, I find these exercises silly. But they have helped me cope with depression and anxiety. It's actually impossible not to feel the power of positivity every time you do them.\n\nFor more incredible brain exercises, please complete these 4:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaiF3DL-ens\n\nFor the ambidextrous memory trick I demonstrate in full, please see:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmD_RziRMdQ\n\nFor 5 more POWERFUL brain exercises: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaiF3DL-ens\n\nAnd for the FREE Memory Improvement Kit, visit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nP.S.

    "title": "The Art of Memory: Frances Yates, Giordano Bruno And The Mnemonic Tradition",
    "description": "The Art of Memory by Frances Yates is an incredible study of the memory techniques used by figures through history. \n\nFrom Giordano Bruno and Marsilio Ficino to John Dee, Ramon Llull, Martin Faulks and Nelson Dellis, The Art of Memory has been an incredible resource for thousands of people around the world. \n\nThe only problem is... Yates is considered by many scholars to have been incorrect about so many of her ideas. She seems to have deeply misunderstood Bruno when it comes to hermeticism and that suggests she might be misguided by how he and others used the Memory Palace technique. \n\nWhat was Frances Yates misguided on?\n\nNot only how the great memory masters used their Roman Rooms and the Journey Method, but they used these ancient mnemotechnics to achieve encyclopedic memory to establish a theory of everything. \n\nBruno's creativity was immense, and his ability to help others develop principles of self education and personal transformation is profound. But it matters a great deal that we understand the true implications of what Bruno was really saying, especially in an era when neuroscience tells us so much about the human brain. \n\nThe recent memory championship tradition is fantastic, but it has left so much of the rich philosophy inherent to the mnemonics behind. This playlist series intends to help restore the psychology and hermetic thinking behind memory \"magic\" to bring back the best of renaissance science as we use the internet as our common school of advanced study to helps us learn faster and remember more. \n\nFrances Yates was lucky to have found the Warburg Institute and we're lucky Aby Warburg created it.

    "description": "Want to know how to memorize a textbook? \n\nRemembering more from books is a fun and easy skill to develop. \n\nBut, as with all things, a lot depends on your mindset, your setup and the clarity of your goals.\n\nThat’s why, in this video, you’ll learn how to:\n\n • Correctly set your expectations of what the book will contain\n • Understand why you need to read the book (or if you actually need to!)\n • Quickly determine how much of the book you really need to read\n • Make a dedicated Memory Palace system to memorize the parts you really need\n • Learn how to take notes from a textbook onto index cards or flashcards, and \n • Determine how much time you’ll need to practice the information you’ve memorized\n\nYou'll learn how to memorize verbatim too.\n\nPlus, I'm giving you an example of how to memorize a formula, the kind you might come across in a math textbook. \n\nUltimately, what we're talking about when discussing textbook memorization is how to study books for maximum retention.\n\nAnd retention is not necessarily memorization. It's important to understand that difference. \n\nAnd the Memory Palace technique you'll discover in this video is designed to make sure that you know how to get the most out of your study time.\n\nIf you would like a simple and fun infographic to go with this post, it is downloadable and printable. I even have a pic of Magnetic Memory Method Familia Member Adolfo Artigas with his printout for you:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-memorize-a-textbook/\n\nPlease make sure you print it out and put it somewhere you can see it.

    "description": "Many memory competitors have asked me if the Magnetic Memory Method Masterclass will help them win a memory competition. \n\nNormally, I tell them... \"maybe, but I can't say for sure.\"\n\nAll that changed in 2019 when memory athlete James Gerwing won the Canadian Memory Championships. \n\nI've always known the MMM would help anyone use memory techniques better because I did pretty well myself when I competed. But I didn't win and can only say \"yes\" when someone else who uses this approach has.\n\nAnd, of course, James has done a lot more than just competing. Year's ago, he wrote to me:\n\n\"I have been banging things into the void of my memory for decades.\n\nYou have revived, and revived in me, the concept that where there is a will, there is a way.\n\nSince signing up for your Masterclass I have taken a Latin course at the University of Alberta and scored above 90% (that is not common territory for me)!\"\n\nAs you'll discover in this video, one thing he said, let to this follow-up a few years later:\n\n\"Anthony, Jim Gerwing, here. About 5 years ago, I began taking your online course and then went into some memory competitions. I am the 4 time, current, undefeated (and record holder) of the Alberta memory championships. Even better; I just won the 2019 Canadian Memory Championships (AND the first ever pan-provincial championship). Thanks for your input.\n\n\nSince signing up for your Masterclass I have taken a Latin course at the University of Alberta and scored above 90% (that is not common territory for me)!\"\n\n- James Gerwing, Educational administrator, Sherwood Park, Alberta (and now 2019 Canadian Memory Champion!\"\n\nIn this video interview, you'll learn how the Magnetic Memory Method helped James win and discover how you can use these techniques to learn and memorize anything you want. \n\nFor more free memory training from memory experts, check out this playlist: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R-uu0h2oo8-6Bs6ahxuXJ9Z\n\nWe go through all aspects of memory improvement, from the method of loci to the Major System and everything related to mnemonics. \n\nFor more on memory competitions, please check out the following videos:\n\nUSA Memory Championship: Inside The World Series Of Memorization | TIME\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zmLo_edeo\n\nMemory Athlete Braden Adams On The Benefits Of Memory Competition\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqazyPfDHYw\n\nAlexander vs. Nelson - USA Memory Championship 2014\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPjkVEb9SCs\n\nI LOST AGAIN, AGAIN! // 2019 USA Memory Championship RECAP\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8v9nGyjjtg\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n#memoryexpert",

    "description": "Are you a pharmacy or Latin language student looking for a Magnetic Memory Method Masterclass review? \n\nHere's one from Iustinian. \n\nHe provided this video testimonial after originally writing:\n\n\"Dear Anthony,\n\nI have tested MMM for  4 months. I am a Pharmacy student and as you know there is a great amount of info to cover here.\n\nI tried to hit the straight 10 ( straight A / I think is the top of the scale in american ed syst) and that is very hard to do that with a classical approach. It is kinda impossible, or it is possible but with imense sacrifices. It s just to much! On the long run it s catastrophic.\n\nBut with MMM things change dramatically.\n\nLet me fill you up with my current learning situation. I m 36 years old, I m a 2 nd year Pharmacy student. I ve also graduated Theology and Economics.\n\nSo from the first day that I started MMM I knew that this is the ultimate method, but I wanted to tested on the medium to long run and that is why I am a little late with my feedback. But I wanted to test the method to it s limits. Well the conclussion is that it has no limits. And that is because it is very organic. It is build after the human model and not from a artificial, mecanical model. \n\nPeople see, hear, smell, feel etc and that needs to be inegrated. \n\nNow it is true that the Loci method goes back to antiquity, but what you did is that you put an emphasis on that \"method\" term. \n\nThe discipline that the Major Method offers is priceless alongside the actual memory technique. \n\nThat comes from your personal experience and that is the gold behind the Title. \n\nSo I encourage any guy out there that has a goal on the learning area to save some money and to spend it on the key pass for the Magnetic Memory Method Masterclass.\"\n\nFor more reviews of the MMM Masterclass, please see:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/testimonials/\n\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

And the pegword mnemonic is just as much an example of spatial memory as anything else in the realm of memory training.

    "description": "Learning a foreign language? \n\nThere's no doubt about it. The process can present struggles. \n\nBut the good news is that memory techniques like the Memory Palace and even just the basics of mnemonic association can help you break through every obstacle. \n\nOn today’s Magnetic Memory Method video interview, I talk with the CTO, co-founder, and chief researcher of Outlier Linguistics, Ash Henson. \n\nA former electrical engineer for NASA, he discovered his love for languages in 1991, and left his high profile career to devote his life to language learning and teaching in 2004.\n\nSince then he has received his PhD candidacy in both teaching Chinese as a second language, and has completed studies in paleography and phonology, as well as in-depth studies in classic Chinese literature.\n\nAsh sheds light on what you really need to learn a language, the keys to master your target language (specifically whatever mastery means to you) in less time than you thought possible. Fluency is well within your grasp, and all it takes is a willingness to learn and openness to discover a different way of learning that’s highly possible, and probably a little foreign, but personal and proven to work.\n\nDive into this interview and you will discover: \n\n- The secret way rules can unlock thousands of words in your target language\n\n- How sharing a cultural heritage can help make language learning easier\n\n- When copying someone else is allowed, and even encouraged!\n\n- Why you should be skeptical of native speakers’ pronunciation advice, and when to just “take their word for it.”\n\n- How meaning and sound patterns help you to recall Chinese characters (this also applies to Japanese Kanji in many ways).\n\n-  The reason you should learn to speak in your target language first, followed by writing\n\n- Why making memory objects personal is the key to success with character memorization\n\n- Reasons to NOT have a “dedicated memory system”\n\n- The reason “specifics” are important, i.e., the purpose of kinesthetic, auditory, and visual senses, and emotions in memory objects\n\n- The purpose of specialized lists, such as animals, friends & family, and celebrities\n\n- The importance of existing competence in your language learning journey and how climbing Mt. Everest is quite similar to tackling your target language goals\n\nTo learn more about Ash's work, check out:\n\nhttps://www.outlier-linguistics.com/\n\nLearn to Read Chinese Characters:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkrUrzdqZyY\n\nThe Outlier Kanji Dictionary:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8vmVJP9AAY\n\nEnjoy this interview and let us know in the comments if you have any questions!\n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

    "title": "COPPA: How Would Giordano Bruno And Fred Rogers Teach Memory Techniques in 2020?",
    "description": "It's rare that I release videos about matters like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), or \"rule\" as the FTC calls it. \n\nBut it seems like these rules are overreaching... especially when it comes to the teaching of memory techniques. \n\nAfter all, in order to use association and Memory Palaces, we refer to all kinds of pop culture references that appeal to and have relevance for all age groups. \n\nPlus, we've seen these kinds of initiatives before... indeed, approximately 100 years ago. They didn't lead to the intended places... far from it. \n\nAnd the places things went led to events like Fred Rogers appearance before the Senate. \n\nAnd earlier than that... the burning of Giordano Bruno at the stake. \n\nYou might not think old Fred Rogers has a lot to do with mnemonics and ye olde Memory Palace technique, but he does. \n\nAnd he always will, as long as those of us who use these techniques use the Major System and arrive at \"mail\" for 35. What better way to make that word concrete than by using a character from Mr. Rogers' imagination? \n\nThis is how association works, and it doesn't matter what age you are and where you live - and all the ideals Fred Rogers fought so hard to ensure are directly involved in the Magnetic Memory Method initiative even though he and I never met. \n\nUnder these new rules, there's really no way to share Giordano Bruno's memory system as I had planned. It needs updating and pop cultural references will make more sense than constellations to a modern audience. \n\nIf you were me... what would you do? What do you think Bruno and Rogers would do if there were with us in 2020? \n\nWrite the Senate and Congress and let them know after you post in the discussion area below. \n\nLet me know your thoughts in the discussion and thanks as always for your engagement with these videos and for sharing this one around. \n\nOh, and 🛑 SIGN the SAVE Family-Friendly Content on YouTube Petition HERE ➡️: \n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/youtubers-and-viewers-unite-against-ftc-regulation\n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Anthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\n--- More good videos to help you learn about Coppa ---\n\nImportant Update for All Creators: Complying with COPPA (YouTube)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JzXiSkoFKw\n\nUpdates for 2020, COPPA and More!

Not only that, but I didn't think very highly of myself and had CRUSHINGLY low self-esteem. \n\nBut memory training helped me get my brain in order. It helped me focus and concentrate - even when times were tough and I still didn't feel well. \n\nI've been doing so much better ever since, and now it is my MISSION to help as many people as possible learn and use these same techniques. \n\nAre they challenging? \n\nYes, sometimes - but that's part of how they help elevate your mood as you literally CONQUER information. \n\nOf course, no one can use the techniques for you, so make sure you've got a strong enough vision.

    "title": "Iconic Memory Defined And Why Photographic Memory DOES NOT Exist",
    "description": "Iconic memory is a powerful type of sensory memory that helps you recall visual stimuli for brief moments.\n\nIn this video, we’ll explore the difference between iconic memory and photographic memory, debunking myths about picture-perfect recall.\n\nYou'll also learn how iconic memory compares to echoic memory and how it connects to your short-term and long-term memory. Finally, we'll dive into groundbreaking research by George Sperling and others to uncover the science behind visual persistence.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how to improve your memory, strengthen your attention, and build Memory Palaces, this video is for you! Don’t forget to visit magneticmemorymethod.com/iconic-memory for additional resources, and watch until the end to learn actionable memory improvement tips that can change your life.\n\nIconic memory also explains why images disappear from our minds in a flash. But it's not photographic memory, even if it affects short term and long term memory. In this video, we’ll explore why. \n\nIt’s also different than other kinds of memory and we’ll talk about an echoic memory example to explain why. Auditory memory can also comes in flashes, but iconic memory is much more related to flashbulb memory in many key ways.\n\nThe neat thing about this kind of memory is how it relates to at least 3 kinds of persistence in human memory related to visual, haptic and subjective cues. \n\nIf you’re interested in knowing more about visual memory, the visual system of the brain, working memory related to visual stimuli and more, please check out the full article with all the references on the Magnetic Memory Method website:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/iconic-memory/\n\nYour memory almost certainly has unlimited capacity to learn, and so I look forward to exploring more of its psychophysics over the course of time. \n\nIf you need ideas for what to work on next, check out these sensory memory exercises:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rUi7LNPHSA\n\nThanks for sharing this one around and talk soon! :-)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Martin Faulks is the author of A Mosaic Palace and is a memory expert who has performed a number of interesting demonstrations. \n\nA Mosaic Palace is also a great book. I highly recommend it in addition to this talk. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://www.lewismasonicdigital.com/ebooks/general/a-mosaic-palace/\n\nWho is Martin Faulks? \n\nIn addition to being a memory expert, he is an expert in the field of meditation. \n\nOn top of that, he’s a martial artist, yoga teacher, and author of over half a dozen books on subjects such as enlightened living and tai chi.\n\nHis newest book, A Mosaic Palace: Freemasonry and the Art of Memory explores the link between the ancient tradition of memory techniques and the secretive fraternal organization, the Freemasons.\n\nIn our conversation we explore memory as an internal transformative art that can change the very core of our being just in dedicated practice. \n\nHe argues that while in antiquity inner transformation through memory was a common association, but it has been lost in our modern age. The secret then to restoring this idea lies in your approach to committing to the techniques themselves.\n\nOur talking points in this video interview include:\n\n* Memory training and the potential for learning leading to inner transformation (and how what you put into your consciousness can change who you are)\n\n* How the Renaissance caused the art of memory to become a path of cultivation of virtue instead of simply utilitarian\n\n* How Memory Palaces are useful as a form of meditation\n\n* The impact of adaptive strategies on our personality and coping and life skills\n\n* The way your mind is always trying to help you\n\n* The method in which you learn something affects how easy it is for you to reference it\n\n* Why the church banned texts like the Ars Notoria as a “sorcery version of memory”\n\n* How the memory method of corporeal similitudes is the most powerful way to create associations for memory\n\n* The debate about whether Sherlock Holmes is a figure to look up to (otherwise known as a hero of an extra level of functioning) to when it comes to memory goals\n\n* Comparing and contrasting memory and sorcery, and memory palaces and magic circles\n\n* Why Giordano Bruno was a memory master and “terrible” teacher\n\n* The differences in the definition of a memory master according to various cultures\n\n\nHow to find more of Martin Faulks on the Web:\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://martinfaulks.co.uk/\n\nTwitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MartinFaulks\n\nYouTube Channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt8UUqwAccfhetgC7alponA\n\nMy favorite Martin Faulks Memory Improvement Demonstration And Discussion videos:\n\nDVD Memory Challenge:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3YoBeSKHvY\n\nMagazine Memory Challenge:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s34MR4as2PY&t=52s\n\nMemorizing A Whole Pack of Cards:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFHdC_ohK0A\n\nInitiation Into Hermetic Memory:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QatW_MeT_pY\n\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n#memoryexpert",

    "description": "If you want to improve short term memory, the only reasonable path is to get REAL memory exercise. \n\nAnd yes, I mean it when there's little evidence that any Memory Palace software of memory improvement app is ever going to help anyone even remotely as well as some people have claimed. \n\nNow, some people are going to run kicking and screaming from the notion that we're on our own when it comes to getting the mental fitness in that we need. But in this video, I'll be sharing some easy, fun and incredibly simple ways to get more mental fitness. \n\nI'm also sharing some great book references that back up my claims and some articles that show the potential for some huge nightmares we all face if we don't take care of our brains. \n\nThere are 3 memory exercises in total and I'm convinced that if you put them into action, you'll experience a boost in your memory.\n\nI also share the secret of \"elaborative encoding\" and show you how to do it using a simple set of mnemonic examples. You can do complete these exercises with or without a Memory Palace.)\n\nBut if you want to use the Memory Palace technique and don't know what it is, start with this playlist on what a Mind Palace is and why the term you use (Memory Palace vs. Mind Palace) matters:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R_mzDp76DZH5n5mG-ni72LC\n\nLook, I can go on and on in this description about why short term memory boosts are possible, but aren't you better off watching this video in full? \n\nHere's what will happen when you do:\n\n* I'll teach you how to never forget where you placed your keys again\n\n* I'll give you 3 POWERFUL memory exercises that improve ALL aspects of your memory\n\n* I'll give you a number of powerful book references that will help you even further (if you want to TRULY get ahead in life)\n\nIsn't that fair for achieving lasting brain power? \n\nEnjoy this video and these resources mentioned in Part Two of this playlist.

    "description": "A lot of people ask: How can I improve short term memory? \n\nWell, it's an interesting question... but also the wrong question. \n\nYou see, \"short term memory\" is a scientific term, and the terminology of memory science (as in all science) is always expanding. \n\nIn this video, you'll learn the real path to short term memory loss treatment by approaching all memory holistically. \n\nIt has nothing to do with short term memory supplements. There's no test or short term memory game that will help. \n\nWhat you need is the same thing the ancients used to memorize entire books and structure their minds. This approach truly is the best way to learn faster and remember more. \n\nSo if you want to dramatically improve your recall ability, this video is here to help.

And since she also teaches memory techniques, I asked her to spill the beans on what works best for her. \n\nLike most advanced learners, Barbara is a super-interesting person. That's why we also talked about her work on altruism and how it connects to memory. I liked her point about Bill Clinton's memory the best. \n\nFascinating! \n\nPlease share this interview and help spread the good news about Barbara's course and this interview.

    "description": "Once you've learned memory techniques, you'll probably want to give memory demonstrations. \n\nAnd even if you don't want to give them - you should. \n\nFor one thing, it's really the only short term memory test that will give you the feedback you need to determine where your memory skills stand. \n\nAnd you want to give yourself a working memory test as often as possible - memory demonstrations are the best way to do that. \n\nThis form of Memory Palace training can take a few different forms, so in this video I share some of my experiences, including how I relax myself so that I'm never nervous. \n\nIt's just a matter of letting the method of loci do its work in many cases. These memory tips will help you get your ego out of the way so you can focus on your memorization techniques. \n\nHere are some examples of memory demonstrations I’ve given and the tremendous Memory Palace exercise they’ve given me:\n\nReciting the Ribhu Gita from a Memory Palace:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgNQ9bU-nEg\n\nMemorizing Song Lyrics With A Memory Palace Hangout\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ8nchtB5TI&t\n\nAlso, you'll want to check out my discussion about memory training with 2018 USA Memory Champion and memory expert John Graham:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/memory-training-secrets-john-graham/\n\nDave Farrow and I have also talked about memory demonstrations on this Magnetic Memory Method Podcast episode:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/dave-farrow/\n\nIf you need help figuring out your first Memory Palace Network, get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit here: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nYou really can memorize anything, and the best way to improve is by making it real in front of an audience. \n\nLet me know if you have questions and I look forward to your thumbs up seal of approval and comments in the discussion.\n\nTalk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\n\nP.S.

You’ve just got to work out the mnemonic strategy you’re going to use. \n\nI suggest you focus on memorizing grammar mnemonic examples and in this video give you 9 suggestions that will help you learn the grammar of any language. \n\nThis video was inspired by this post and fruitful discussion on the Magnetic Memory Method Forum:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/forum/forum/memory-techniques-strategy-discussions/memory-palace-techniques-for-language-learning/77-grammar-in-the-mmmethod\n\nAs an additional resource, here’s a replay of a live stream where I’ve talked about memorizing grammar before at greater length:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClpywFhczBQ\n\nI also wrote many years ago about “Cracking the Code of Grammar Memorization” for your reference:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/cracking-the-code-of-grammar-memorization/\n\nBut before you memorize the rules that govern a language, make sure you know how to memorize vocabulary first. \n\nOtherwise, you’re putting the cart ahead of the horse. \n\nAfter that, you can make mnemonics for grammar rules quickly, easily and in ways that are effective and fun. You just need a solid grounding in the Memory Palace technique.\n\nAnd if you need help with creating a Memory Palace Network to contain all of your language learning words, phrases and grammar rules for Recall Rehearsal, please get this FREE Memory Improvement Kit here:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nThanks for the view, the thumbs up, comments and support of all the MMM memory training initiatives. \n\nTalk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nP.S.

    "title": "The Truth About Memory Improvement Games And Memory Training Games",
    "description": "Memory improvement games and memory training apps... \n\nSO addictive but are they worth our time? We now live in a world where technological advancements have made things SUPER convenient for us! But to what extent do memory improvement games really help us and our cognitive function? \n\nMost of the time, I hear people say “I don’t need to bother with remembering this now, I have a phone” or “technology was invented for a reason”. There are many arguments for and against these brain games, which is why the whole thing seems to be a controversial topic. For that reason, I decided to make a video about the truth behind these memory improvement apps. \n\nAs I suggest in this video, the best mind games have nothing to do with brain game apps. In fact, there are many many ways to improve your memory ORGANICALLY. While digital memory improvements can offer some marginal benefits, there aren’t that many research to support this. \n\nI wholeheartedly believe that these games are not what they say they are, and I can prove that there are much better ways and better tips for memory improvement that do not rely on these brain games. Your memory is improved when you train, apply and use the information that improves your life. This is the challenge needed to REALLY improve your memory and concentration instead of playing games out of convenience. I have dedicated my life into creating awareness regarding this fact which is why I came up with a memory improvement tool that would hopefully help us all. AND IT’S COMPLETELY FREE!\n\nFor my FREE Memory Improvement Kit that will show you the real challenge of memory so you can learn any language fast, memorize complex terminology and even entire discographies of lyrics, go here now: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nOn that note, I mentioned a few techniques from this kit in this video to make memory improvement easier for everyone without ANY ASSISTANCE! I made is as fun and easy as I could! In fact, I even gave a few examples that helps me when applying these memory TECHNIQUES which would hopefully help you as well :) \n\nREMINDER: your brain is sharp! This video is mainly about being prepared to perform, no matter what happens in your life. Turn your challenge into something that can improve your life! Keep calm and remember, your mind is sharp and it has the potential to achieve many things to improve your life if you would just allow it to work ;) \n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.",

One of the goals of this new playlist is to simply demonstrate searching through memory out loud while engaged in critical thought. \n\nFor next time, we're both going to read this article to pick up during our next discussion:\n\nhttp://www.d.umn.edu/~cstroupe/handouts/8906/Foucault_what_is_an_author.pdf\n\nPlease read it too if you want to join us in the comments on the next critical thinking video. \n\nShare your critical thoughts in the discussion and for FREE Memory Improvement training, visit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\n\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\n#magneticmemorymindset",

    "description": "Free webinar on the best discipline and consistency tools and tips that helped me get a PhD, have a great memory and build a business: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/dc\n\nWhy am I doing this webinar? \n\nWell, this recent cry of desperation from Larry nearly broke my heart.\n\nHe said…\n\n\"How can the Magnetic Memory Method work in internal medicine where there are 3 Zillion facts?\"\n\nYou see, when I was studying at university, I used to get overwhelmed and say similar things too…\n\nI’d read the great philosophers and wonder how I would ever catch up to the hundreds of books they had read. \n\nAnd in moments of desperation, I would think...  I wasn't \"one of those people\" who get to be professors because there was no way I could read so much so fast…\n\nWorse, I thought I wasn't gifted with a great memory.\n\nIn fact, I nearly failed out of grad school because of it.\n\nWe had these big end-of-year exams for the language requirement. We were required to read – and I'm not exaggerating – a couple hundred books. And then the professors would grill us on them for 2 to 3 hours straight.\n\nWorst part was…\n\nI'd study for hours and hours. And at the end of it all… I couldn't remember a darned thing.\n\nIt was around that time that I stumbled upon a few basic memory techniques.\n\nAnd to my great surprise…\n\nI could do them!\n\nIn that moment, it hit me that my problem had nothing to do with a \"bad memory\". My mind wasn't somehow \"faulty\" or \"broken\".\n\nAnd, if I just used the right approach…\n\nI really could read and remember hundreds of books.\n\nEven better, I could tap into a hidden potential of my brain that I had no idea even existed… a capacity to remember anything and everything I wanted to.\n\nIn fact, I even stunned my professors (and myself) by acing my finals.\n\nNow, I understand this all may sound a bit hard to believe. And you might also be thinking that it’s impossible in a field of knowledge with 3 Zillion facts.\n\nWell, we all know that exaggeration is usually our worst enemy. And that's why I'm putting together something incredibly exciting and powerful for you… \n\nSomething that will allow you to personally try out the method I used… and experience the hidden potential of your own mind for yourself. Without letting exaggeration get in the way of your success.\n\nIt’s well known by tens of thousands around the world that I’ve got something that will help you memorize nearly ANYTHING you want in just a couple months. (And have perfect recall too.)\n\nBut I'm not ready yet to show you how you can remove the feeling of overwhelm that comes from within. I can’t speak for Larry, and I’m certainly not saying he’s exaggerating because I don’t know. Maybe there are world class doctors who really have memorize 3 Zillion facts. But I doubt that’s true or necessary in anyone’s field. I just know that I’ve felt this way too. And the right memory techniques are the cure.  \n\nI'm still putting the final touches on it, so watch your inbox on Monday, July 23, 2018.\n\nNow…\n\nTo prepare for next week, I want you to do a quick exercise for me.\n\nTry and remember the last time you felt overwhelmed. How did you describe it? \n\nAnd if you could get past those limiting inner beliefs and exaggerations I managed to overcome and had a \"flawless\" memory… one where you could rapidly (and effortlessly) absorb new information and recall it perfectly the moment you needed it…\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nWhat would having that kind of memory let you accomplish?\n\nMaybe you'd finally become fluent in that new language you've been wanting to learn. Maybe you'd be able to ace difficult exams for school or for your profession. Or maybe you'd memorize long passages of scripture and deepen your faith.\n\nEven if it seems like an \"impossible dream\" to you right now, write it down anyway. \n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here, even if there are right and wrong ways of dealing with overwhelm. \n\nOK, talk soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnthony Metivier\n\"Memory Scientist\"\nCreator, Magnetic Memory Method\n\n\nP.S. Could you do me a favor? Would you mind sharing both your description of frustration and seemingly  \"impossible dream\" with me? (Just reply to this email.)\n\nThis will help me tailor my big plans for next week to your specific memory goals and better help you remove the “overwhelm monster” that might be holding you back.\n\nP.P.S.

    "description": "Do you find long form content difficult to concentrate on? Does paying attention to anything longer than a minute make your brain ache? \n\nIf you can’t seem to focus, you might be suffering from Digital Dementia or Digital Amnesia. \nIn this video, I’ll help you overcome this terrible condition. \n\nBut the question is: \n\nCan you really extend your attention span?\n\nWell, get ready to dive deep and discover how to come out on top by balancing long form content with short form content. \n\nIn this video, I give three reasons why long form content is so beneficial for you. You’ll also discover why long form content is going to get you the results you want a lot faster than short form content.\n\nSome of the techniques involve Magnetic Note Taking. For these check out note taking on the Magnetic Memory Method Blog here: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/note-taking/\n\nYou’ll find these habits of note taking really powerful! I also have the link to the YouTube live replay about note taking: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/f25MJ3CW1zI \n\nIf you want to know more about the value and power of mind wandering, here’s the book I mentioned in the video. This book is called Rest by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang.\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/rest-alex-pang\n\nNow, you might consider long form content as redundant and a deviation from the main topic. \nIn fact, a lot of people say, “Where’s the M.E.A.T.?” They don’t know what this word really stands for:\n\nMeaningless\nEdutainment\nAbsurdly\nThriving\n\nStop looking for the M.E.A.T. in short form content because it’s not all MEAT at all! The reality is that you have to process information over long periods of time. \n\nFigure out a way to submit yourself to long form content and long topics. \n\nThings worth knowing takes time. Read books multiple times. For tips on how to read books right multiple times, check out this blog/podcast on my Magnetic Rereading Strategy:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/rereading-strategy/\n\nUse memory techniques to make sure you actually have the substantial content in your memory.\nTo start, take my FREE Memory Improvement Kit.

    "description": "Can children use Memory Palace techniques even at an early age? How about as young as age then? \n\nIf this question puzzles your mind as much as it did mine, then this video teaser is for you. \n\nMany of us tend to think of memory techniques as something for mostly adults. But children can benefit from them too: even as young as age 10 (perhaps even younger).\n\nThe best part?  \n\nMemory Palaces are essentially a \"free resource,\" which means this memory resource is open to anyone who wants to use “spatial memory” and “location-based mnemonics” to memorize anything they want. \n\nIf you're still unaware of EXACTLY how to create a well-formed Memory Palace, please make sure you have my FREE Memory Improvement Kit. It shows you how to create and use a Memory Palace properly: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nMost parents want their children to excel in school. One way you can help them in their studies is to teach them how to learn effectively in a fast and easy way. The best way to memorize information is by using a Memory Palace just like what Alicia did. \n\nJohn Crosby, Alicia’s father, introduced Lewis Smile’s The Memory Palace to Alicia as an intro to the technique. Alicia used this book to memorize all of Shakespeare’s plays in historical order. The best thing here is that she's enjoying the creative process of using memory techniques. In her imagination, everything feels so real. \n\nTo hear more about Alicia's Memory Palace journeys, here's the full podcast episode: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/tap-the-mind-of-a-10-year-old-memory-palace-master/\n\nWouldn't you want your child to benefit from this level of confidence, the kind of confidence that comes only from real and lasting memory improvement based on the Memory Palace technique? Learn these techniques yourself so you can help children explore the world of Memory Palaces so that they can also partake in the memory benefits of it. \n\nOh, and please be sure that you're subscribed to this channel.

    "description": "Does Memory Improvement Music REALLY work? If you’re still seeking an answer to this question, you’re on the right path, In this video, I give you the truth about music and memory improvement. \n\nI made this video because I get a LOT of questions about memory and music. \n\nFor example, you may have heard of binaural beats or music tracks helping you improve your memory. But a lot of that is just fantasy that doesn’t lead to true focus or improved memory. Here's more on why:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/binaural-beats/\n\nSo the question is: “Does music really matter for memory?”\n\nI firmly believe that your memory is improved when you train, apply and use the information that improves your life. Music can be part of the memory improvement journey, but…\n\nIt’s not a way of avoiding the facts of memory. You really do have to develop commitment to the Memory Palace technique and get better and better and better at it through practice.\n\nFor my FREE Memory Improvement Kit that will show you the real music of memory so you can learn any language fast, memorize complex terminology and even entire discographies of lyrics, go here now:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nOnce you have a Magnetic Memory Palace network in place, here’s the very good news: \n\nYou really can train and practice memory techniques with music. In this video, I tell you how I’ve done it. Meaningfully. Not with another super intelligence memory music fantasy. \n\nWARNING! This video is not about study music for focus. It's about the role of music in memory training. \n\nTo that end, I also share another way of thinking about music and memory by practicing with the opposite of music for focus and concentration. There are also melodies and chants you can use and I share a few in this video. \n\nThen there’s the question of memorizing music itself. For that, you’ll need the Major System, or what I prefer to call the Major Method.\n\nIf the Major Method is new to you, it’s a simple way of remembering numbers that can be applied to remembering nows. Here’s how you can learn this method: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/major-method/\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-memorize-numbers-with-the-major-method/\n\nFollow it up with this material on memorizing music:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/music-mnemonics/\n\nI’d also love for you to listen also to my podcast with Jessie Villalobos. You’ll discover how memory techniques help Jessie in his work that involves remembering a lot of numbers: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/jessie-villalobos-magnetic-memory-method-review/\n\nRemember, memory techniques comes from doing. To drive you to take action, take note of the D.O.C. Principle: \n\nDoing is the Origin of Creativity\n\nDoing is the Origin of Control\n\nDoing is the Origin of Confidence\n\nDoing is the Origin of Consistency\n\nDoing is the Origin of Courage\n\nIt’s not just about learning about memory techniques. It’s about applying them in meaningful ways one S.I.P. at a time: \n\nS.I.P.\n\nStudy memory techniques\n\nImplement memory techniques\n\nPractice memory techniques with information that improves your life\n\nI don’t want you to miss my memory improvement tips and hacks.

    "description": "One of the most fun applications of memory techniques involves knowing how to memorize books. \n\nOn this hangout, we talk about how to remember what you read in depth. \n\nI used Tony Buzan's Mind Map Mastery and Richard Brookhiser's George Washington on Leadership for examples. \n\nIn addition to placing the topic of remembering what you read into a Memory Palace, we talked about using a mind map and the Major System or Major Method. \n\nI showed you how you can turn any Mind Map into Memory Palace with the Major System in play. \n\nAnd yes, Mind Map Mastery by Tony Buzan is a memory improving book you won't want to miss. Order it now. \n\nRest assured, you want both the Mind Palace and Memory Palace working in conjunction with a good Mind Map strategy. \n\nThe Mind Palace technique really isn't what it could be without it... \n\nAnd if you want to know how to memorize, the memory training you'll receive in this live replay will help immensely as you learn how to become a memory master. \n\nMemory techniques are fantastic and I hope you'll dive in and learn them. They're really the best way to memorize fast and easily. \n\nThanks for watching this replay and here are some of the links we discussed during the call: \n\nThe Memorize A Book Dare:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-zB_mGT0Zc\n\nHow to Memorize Textbooks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0nRcFFn680\n\nHow To Learn And Memorize Math, Numbers, Equations, And Simple Arithmetic\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb52tdacsig\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering...\n\nYes, the Major System makes sense if you want to know how to memorize vocabulary with the Memory Palace technique / Mind Palace technique. \n\nAs you'll note in this livestream... It's essential. And never forget:\n\nThe Method of Loci is ancient. But the Magnetic Station approach in a Magnetic Memory Palace using the Magnetic Memory Method is as modern as it gets. \n\nThanks for watching the replay and until we have a chance to speak again soon, here are some helpful episodes of the Magnetic Memory Method Podcast:\n\nBinaural Beats And Memory: Can This Crazy Music Make You Smarter?\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/binaural-beats/\n\nHow to Improve Memory For Studying (7 Powerful Tips)\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/improve-memory-for-studying/\n\nLee Escobar Magnetic Memory Method Review and Testimonial\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWgx5W5p0VM&t=5s\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Are you interested in learning memory techniques but somehow still doubtful that a Magnetic Memory Palace with properly Magnetic Mnemonic Imagery will really work for you? \n\nWell, if you’re looking for a Magnetic Memory Method review and testimonial, I have something very special for you today. \n\nThis Magnetic Memory Method review and testimonial comes from one of my best Magnetic Memory Method students and private memory coaching clients. \n\nIn this video, Lee Escobar shares his testimonial from along his memory improvement journey. \n\nAnd it’s reassuring to hear from someone who has achieved a lot towards accomplishing his dream goal of memorizing around 300 names using memory techniques better than the humdrum method  of loci at his live events. \n\nThese memory techniques techniques include the Memory Palace, the Major System and other elements of the Magnetic Memory Method.\n\nAs you’ll see, Lee Escobar’s most prominent issue was with remembering people’s names. He went from a complete struggle in this area to 200 names in just a short time after reaching out for a session with me.\n\nIf you want to eliminate the problem of forgetting names and faces, here’s the good news. \n\nI have a course that will teach you how. You can join it immediately or take a look now: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/remember-names-magnetic-memory-method-course\n\nJust like Lee Escobar, after taking the course, you’ll be able to remember 100, 200, 300 names (or more!) as you learn and use the memory techniques I teach in this exclusive course on remembering names.\n\nAnd if you need special attention, just get in touch. For qualified applicants, I offer one-on-one sessions so you can fast track your success just like Lee.  \n\nNo matter what you choose, committing to learn and study the Memory Palace technique for remembering names will give you incredible amounts of confidence and the benefits of accomplishment. \n\nBut I can only help you become a memory master if you take ACTION and meet me halfway. You can use these techniques for learning how to remember your passwords, foreign language vocabulary, or anything you wish. \n\nLee has done his part. \n\nNow it’s your turn. \n\nJust believe in yourself. \n\nYou really can learn how to become a memory master. And you can do it quickly if you just dive in and learn these memory techniques using the Magnetic Memory Method. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Are you aware that using digital devices deteriorates your memory through a degrading process called Digital Amnesia?\n\nSounds scary, right? \n\nIt is and rest assured: it would be really frustrating to have your information faded into oblivion.\n\nNot even using a Memory Palace for studying can stop it!  \n\nThis condition of forgetting things due to the advent of technology is often called something worse: “Digital Dementia”. \n\nThis may be your first time to hear these terms. And you might be asking, “What exactly is “Digital Amnesia”?\n\nGood question. Here’s the answer in full on the Magnetic Memory Method Podcast and blog:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/digital-amnesia/\n\nDigital Amnesia occurs whenever your mind draws a blank on the information you’ve stored on a device you trust. You save bookmarks on your browser and you never visit them again. \n\nDoes that ever happen to you? \n\nWhenever you stored an information to your digital devices and you place it somewhere, your mind draws a blank. Aren’t you tired of drawing blanks? More often than not, you can’t even remember what it was that you stored there. That said, you are experiencing Digital Amnesia. \n\nYou’re weakening your brain because you are developing a dependence on technology. People are not remembering phone numbers, passwords and other significant information. \n\nThe reason is that they let their dumbphones do the work. They are not aware that they are making themselves dumber and endangering their memory in the long run. \n\nDon’t let the areas of your brain responsible for memory to decay! You should know how to combat Digital Amnesia to preserve your memory. It’s essential to know that memory exercise and continual memory exercise is the best way to optimize your memory. \n\nUse concentration to access the information you might actually have in your memory. Give your mind the chance to figure it out to remember. \n\nLet me know in the comments below what your experiences are about Digital Amnesia.

    "description": "Have you ever ask yourself how to do Memory Palace Maintenance? Or are you wondering where you are going wrong with your Memory Palace journey? \n\nTo answer that, simply create a Memory Palace the right way the first time. If you set it up correctly, you don’t have to maintain it. It will maintain itself. \n\nIf you want to know how to create your Memory Palace correctly the first time, please make sure you have my FREE Memory Improvement Kit. This shows you how to create and use a Memory Palace properly: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nMaintaining Memory Palaces happens on its own when you get it right the first time. You don't have to maintain them because you should remember the journey due to the creation process itself. \n\nTo make this possible, you need to follow the simple recommendations. Draw your Memory Palaces and use them right away as quickly as possible.  Use Recall Rehearsal as part of the construction and creation of the Memory Palaces.\n\nAlso, I want you to bear in your mind these two points: \n\n1. Start using the Memory Palaces your create right away.\n\n2. Always use your Memory Palaces for information that matters. \n\nSeriously: \n\nMemorize information that is going to IMPROVE your life. \n\nIt is vital to continually create new Memory Palaces to expand your spatial memory. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause space contains all things. Your brain is made up of chemicals that exist in space (the space of your skull). The Magnetic Memory Method training is constantly changing the chemistry of your brain so that you can access information faster.\n\nAlso in this YouTube Live Replay, we discussed memorizing heavy duty concepts and weird names, correcting mistakes process, repetitions and recall rehearsal and a lot more. \n\nSo dive in and remember to take action. Nothing happens until you do something. I am hoping and wanting to get people doing memory techniques.

To experience the fullest benefit of what some call super brain yoga exercise, you're going to need to do more than that. \n\nBut the good news is that yoga really is a great way to get more from mnemonics. Yoga for concentration and memory combines well with the Memory Palace technique if you apply the two memory improvement exercises in particular ways. \n\nMeditation for concentration and memory also plays a role, and the Mind Palace approach does wonders when using a Memory Palace for studying. \n\nFor example, I like to use the Magnetic Memory Method modifications of the method of loci with Kirtan Kriya, to take one example. \n\nHere's a video by Gary Weber all about that:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehvokeZnXMM\n\nI've been practicing with this one as well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihhq0v07DB0\n\nYou'll also want to check out this material on how to improve concentration and memory on the Magnetic Memory Method blog and podcast: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-improve-concentration-and-memory-buddha-style/\n\nIn sum, yes, memorization techniques will help you discover how to increase memory power by yoga. \n\nYou can easily combine memory improvement exercises with a variety of yogic practices and learn the full truth of how to become a memory master along the way. \n\nEnjoy, and if you want more, get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit here:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nAbove all, have fun and keep yourself Magnetic!\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nMagnetic Memory Method\nhttps://www.magnet\nSubscribe to this channel for more memory improvement and Memory Palace tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nIf you enjoyed this video on memory training and mnemonic memory techniques, please help others by adding some captions.\n\nAnd if you have any questions whatsoever about how to increase memory power by yoga, just let me know in the comments section below.

    "description": "Have you come across aphantasia and wondered why you can't visualize? \n\nWhat about your mind's eye? Do you believe you don't have one? \n\nIf so, this video will reveal the truth about mental imagery and visualization. \n\nAnd this is IMPORTANT if you have aphantasia. My friend Gerrard Gosens is congenitally blind and still figured out a way to visualize information he needed to memorize. Check out our discussion about it there:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-930UmWv1FI\n\nHis story will help you and here's why:\n\nBecause if we all want to get better at creating mental images, we need to understand what they really are and how they relate to memory improvement and the Memory Palace technique that can make so much positive change to your ability to learn. \n\nMaking mental images couldn't be easier. But if you've ever said, \"I can't visualize things in my head,\" you've probably felt frustrated. \n\nActually, I never was frustrated, as you can hear me discuss in this interview with AphantasiaMeow:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0F9gOgGOqc\n\nIt seems I might even be on the brink of hyperphantasia!\n\nBut you really can make some bold actions. You can improve your memory and concentration. And you can use memorization techniques, the Method of Loci, the Memory Palace technique, Mind Palace technique and anything and everything that uses mental imagery. \n\nAnd you really cannot fail because mental imagery - properly understood - will increase your brain power. It will give you brain exercise. Your mental imagery psychology inner experience will shift and you will articular your ideas much, much better. \n\nHere are some links that will help you further if you have - or have been told you have - aphantasia. \n\nFirst, here's my full post and podcast on aphantasia:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/aphantasia/\n\nUse it to supplement my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nYou'll also want to check out my first video on aphantasia and read through the discussion posts:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l1DJXZyHmM\n\nHere's my 2019 aphantasia cure update:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Z88TSKejw\n\nThen check out Blake Ross and his post on Aphantasia: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/blake-ross/aphantasia-how-it-feels-to-be-blind-in-your-mind/10156834777480504/\n\nThis post might not help you with mental imagery and visualization, but it's useful for expanding your awareness of this topic:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/science/aphantasia-minds-eye-blind.html?_r=0\n\nAphantasiaMeow is also doing great work with helping people discover how to experience having a mind's eye:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA0ZUj7Wtmc&lc=\n\nAphantasiaMeow Website for help with aphantasia and an aphantasia test: www.aphantasiameow.com\n\nHere's Jonathan Levi on the topic:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n_KyqrPriQ\n\nThere are many more links to follow up on related to this issue.

Maybe not. \n\nBefore you decide, watch this video and learn how to make a Memory Palace with this FREE guide (better than any memory improvement supplement): \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nIn this video, we won't discuss how to use coconut oil for Alzheimer's, but I will discuss the origins of what might have been the coconut oil Alzheimer hoax (if it was one - no judgments here from me)\n\nIt's also not clear whether or not we can link coconut oil to brain damage or link coconut oil to neurological benefits.\n\nI can't say that coconut oil has helped with with anxiety and depression either, but it has helped in other ways. \n\nAnd that has included the benefits of coconut oil for memory loss (though not exactly in the way you might be thinking).\n\nMostly I'm concerned with the simple question of whether or not coconut oil can help people improve their memory. \n\nThe full presentation in prose and on the MMM Podcast is here:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/coconut-oil/\n\nOne thing for certain is that you can guzzle all the coconut oil in th world, but it's not going to help you overcome Digital Amnesia, Digital Dementia or the Google Effect. \n\nNot the way a solid Memory Palace network can. \n\nAnd when it comes to memorizing foods that improve memory, nothing beats a Memory Palace. You can memorize all the foods that matter for that goal in seconds flat. Here they are: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/foods-that-improve-memory/\n\nOne of my favorite coconut oil recipes involves memory friendly chocolate pancakes. Here's my wife's recipe and how to prepare them fast (they are chocolate pancakes with cacao powder to be more specific):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbv06gmm8S4\n\nSo...

    "description": "Looking for mind map examples for effectively remembering concepts from books? First, grab my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nThen settle in as I discuss learning faster and remembering more using a simple mind map and The Diary of a Bookseller by Shaun Bythell. \n\nIt's an extraordinary book rich with specific details worth remembering, as well as abstract intellectual concepts. \n\nAnd the best part about mind mapping is that you can use them in combination with a Memory Palace. Here's a full discussion of exactly how with World Mind Mapping Champion Phil Chambers:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/mindmapping-phil-chambers/\n\nAlthough I do not talk about how to mind map with mind map software, I strongly believe that if you're willing to get out a piece of paper, you'll help yourself develop a very strong memory. This will happen for you not only much more quickly, but with greater ease and longevity. \n\nI've made this video at a longer length so that you can start developing a mind mapping template for yourself. Obviously, you will want to supplement this with some formal mind map training, so here's my favorite mind map book of all time:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW6O2okqmO4\n\nThe top of mind mapping also relates to creative problem solving, which we chatted about here (replay): \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOKi8pe7C8M\n\nFor more on Shaun Blythell and The Diary of a Bookseller, why not order a copy directly from The Book Shop about which it was written? Here's the link:\n\nhttp://www.the-bookshop.com/\n\nYou can also check out Shaun Bythell's fun YouTube channel here: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0zVKvxP3P-U12-HxENHNfg/videos\n\nHere's The Book Shop Wigtown Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thebookshopwigtown/\n\nHere's my review of the book on Goodreads:\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2323644263\n\nWhat I don't mention in the review is that this book is really admirable because it speaks to the problems of Digital Amnesia, Digital Dementia and the Google Effect in ways that use the method of loci in prose. \n\nNo, the author may not have been aware that he's doing this, but linking important concepts of the modern world with locations is a kind of Mind Palace technique. \n\nAnd the mind map is a Memory Palace for studying and remembering more from books like these. \n\nSo if you want to know how to memorize concepts and improve memory both for yourself and the world around you, I hope you enjoy this video. \n\nHit the thumbs up and leave a comment, especially if you'd like to see more of my mind maps. \n\nThanks as ever and talk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com\n\nP.S.

Just understanding how technology affects memory can be a real chore because we need technology to figure out how to do it. \n\nAnd that means that each of us is caught in a kind of digital amnesia study of one. \n\nNot to get too carried away, but technology and human memory aren't always the best things to jam together. And memory loss due to technology is everywhere. \n\nIn fact, you can see the rise and impact of digital amnesia on every street corner and in every classroom, not to mention every home. \n\nSo in this video, we talk about how the internet affects our memory, but also ask how can technology help us as humans improve our memory? \n\nHere's the very good news: \n\nThe Freedom Journal is technology too: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/tfj\n\nAnd if we take the Google Effect seriously, then something like that can and will help us. \n\nFor more information on Digital Amnesia and its solutions, please visit this blog and podcast:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/digital-amnesia/\n\nEnjoy and please do let me know more about your own experiences with digital fasting.

    "description": "If you're wondering how to use Quora better and get the best Quora answers, we really all need to get together and start asking better questions. \n\nWhom am I to judge? \n\nI'm someone consistently pegged to answer questions about memory improvement by people around the world. \n\nAnd I'm honored. \n\nBut the Google Effect, a.k.a. Digital Dementia a.k.a. Digital Amnesia have really led to an issue where people are asking for hand outs without even trying to answer the questions themselves first. \n\nAnd that means low quality answers by default.  In other words, you won't get any answers even worth using the Memory Palace technique with, nor the method of loci, nor much else beyond people reaching and grasping after this and that on quora.com\n\nIn sum:\n\n1. When asking questions, be specific as possible\n\n2. Then , before reaching out, try to answer it as much as you possibly can on your own\n\n3. Document the journey of answering the question\n\n4. Analyze the data you gather\n\n5. Implement and take action on ideas where appropriate\n\n6. Seek out insights from specialists based on specialized questions that come from your experiences in steps 1–5\n\n7. Study constantly throughout the process and find communities that specialize in the area who can discuss angles with. \n\nBut understand that they can only help you shed light on dark areas by seeing the light you’ve shone yourself.\n\nFor more on how this works, incorporate the W.R.A.P. Technique. It’s discussed in depth here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxWLhAeIYOU \n\nThere may be other steps that you need to follow, but without specific questions, I’m afraid that most experts cannot help you. \n\nEnjoy the process and check out some of the other videos in this playlist about Technology and Human Memory: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R9ai_zHhAqJpimTx2MpoJmC\n\nThis playlist is all about combating Digital Amnesia, Digital Dementia and the so-called Google Effect.

    "title": "Ben's Magnetic Memory Method Question Re Language Learning Credibility",
    "description": "I got a great question from Ben recently regarding the Magnetic Memory Method for language learning. \n\nMore importantly, his question is about the credibility of using this method for language learning. \n\nLet me tell you:\n\nThis is a wonderful and important question. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause there are no short cuts in language learning. At least, not in the way a lot of people are hoping for. \n\nBut there are tools and strategies far better than any short cut ...\n\n... incredible and powerful ways that help you move faster and retain more words and phrases. \n\nImproving your memory and HOW you use it is one of those ways. It's not a magic bullet, but if there is \"real magic\" out there ...\n\n... that magic is to be found in the place where memory techniques meet your mind and the fundamental rules of your brain. \n\nThe overarching training I've put together is called the Magnetic Memory Method. \n\nIt's backed by the best science in the world. It comes from a memory tradition that is thousands of years old. There are memory athletes who use similar tools to demonstrate the power of any person's brain ... but above all ...\n\n... there is YOU. \n\nI have loads of stories to tell from the roads I've traveled using memory techniques as a fluency booster and cornerstone of what I call The Big Five of Language Learning. \n\nMy website is loaded with testimonials too:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/testimonials/\n\nBut at the end of the day, the Magnetic Memory Method is an approach that places the power of using memory techniques to improve how you remember vocabulary and phrases in your hands.\n\nIt essentially helps you see your mind as a laboratory in which you play the role of \"language learning scientist.\" \n\nAs in any lab, there are procedures to follow. They're all documented and ready to go. You just need to learn them and then reproduce the experiments that have produced success for so many others in your own lab. \n\nIt is the perfect science. \n\nAnd when you're ready, I invite you to bring these tools into your lab and use them to \"magnetize\" the words and phrases constantly slipping your memory into long term memory. \n\nFollow the universal principles and modify them to your own experience and you'll have no problem getting the information into long term memory. \n\nIt's fast, easy, effective and fun. Before you know it, you'll be like the hundreds of others who have asked me the most common question in the world: \n\nWhy aren't these memory and learning techniques taught in schools? \n\nThe answer is fun to discuss. \n\nBut that just takes time away from you learning your language. \n\nAnd it takes time away from you being one of those who is helping spread the good news about memory techniques so that others can learn in the absence of help from schools. \n\nWhen you're ready, if you'd like to give my new program Fluency a try, just click here: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt-fluency\n\nI'm confident you'll have the adventure of a lifetime, boost your fluency at measurable speeds, make new friends along the way and finally scratch learning that language off your bucket list. Wouldn't that be great? \n\nSee you inside! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony",

    "description": "Looking for a PAO system? Well, start with the basics of the Memory Palace first with my FREE Memory Improvement Kit:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nThen, whether your should or shouldn't use Person Action Object  (PAO) mnemonics isn't really the point of this live, but you will get some great insights related to this powerful memory tool. \n\nHere's an older Magnetic Memory Method Podcast about PAO/Person Action Object:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/mmmp-013-the-amazing-relationship-between-memory-serial-killers-and-bees/\n\nAnd here's one of the more recent questions that inspired this Magnetic Memory Method YouTube Live:\n\nI’d love to ask for your advice on a PAO system I am working on for my family to use:\n\nBackground:\n\nI have thought about encoding 8 to 12 digits along a journey in each location by using an enhanced PAO system from 0-99, I call PACO (Person, Action, Object + a Container) \n\nThe container is a different kind of object that only works because I ensure the types are mutually exclusive.  I plan to later add a discrete food object and a discrete pet to each double digit as well.\nSee the list below for example. The rationale for this is that I work in a data intensive industry (valuing and helping to buy/sell companies), where memorizing many figures, stats, and historical charts would be of great use. I’m not as interested in rapidly memorizing a deck of cards, though I wouldn’t mind spending some time on that later...\n\nTo support this system, I follow certain restrictions: \nThe Person can’t be a pet/animal type\nThe Object is usually a small thing done with a verb\nThe Container is a large thing that houses people/animals. \nI’m trying to make this a kid friendly system for my family and thus I stay away from the R-rated options \n\nMy long term thought is that I can have a person doing an action on an object frozen in my mind inside of a container. Each of these PACOs could be eating a food and own a pet. Thus, in one loci, if it is graphic and memorable enough, I can encode up to 6 double digit items. I’m just wondering if this is overkill and what may be the best way to get my brain to internalize the PACOs. My question is, should I develop a separate journey of 110 location (perhaps 11 rooms of 10 loci), which I use to memorize the PACOs? Also, if I start with just the traditional PAO and add the additional C later, will that be counterproductive to just memorizing all the options up front? Do you have any other advice on how I can most effectively internalize the system, so that I just about think of pictures in place of double digits?\n\n\nThank you for any thoughts on this topic!\n\n\n***\n\nMy thoughts on a pao memory system and the best way to make a pao are in this video, along with other Method of Loci corrections to the ancient art of memory and I can't wait to hear more interesting questions like these for discussion on future MMM Lives. \n\nTalk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\n\nP.S. Many people focus on creating a 0-99 PAO system. Make sure you do 00-99. It's better. :)",

And of course, you can always go a bit further and listen to my interview with Tony Buzan after this: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/tony-buzan/\n\nBut overall, I think understanding Giordano Bruno memory techniques and his overall philosophy is super important if you're serious about getting really good with memory techniques. \n\nSure, it's just another Memory Palace book at the end of the day, but the more you read, the better you'll understand and use the mind palace technique. \n\nAnd if you want to store a book in a Memory Palace, some of Bruno's techniques are going to be useful for that.\n\nDefinitely give it a read and let me know how you like it! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com",

I am able to create creative images that make me recall those properties, but then I sometimes find it difficult to trigger that image. It's a very long exam requiring several hundred mnemonics and each mnemonic is easy to remember, but I find it hard to know which one to use (I know the answer, but have difficulty allocating it to the question). I suppose I have to mentally file them in some way?\"\n\nIt's an amazing and important question.

Always make new Memory Palaces - even if you’re going to reuse “controls”\n\n2. You can’t make mistakes so long as you’re always making new Memory Palaces and using your controls. You cannot completely screw your memory up. \n\n3. Know your information that you want to memorize. Divide between permanent storage and short term use. This will guide your use of Recall Rehearsal. \n\n4. Know and understand the power and potential of ghosting and the Ugly Sister Effect. They’re similar but not the same and can always be an asset. There’s no reason why they should ever be a harm. \n\n5. Renovate existing Memory Palaces with caution. \n\n6. Experiment with virtual Memory Palace elements. \n\n7. Have a long term memory improvement learning project. \n\n8. Track and analyze everything.\n\n9. Always be reading. \n\n10. Try the Magnetic Memory Method if you’re not using it. And if you’re tried it before and left it behind, come back to it.\n\nFrom Kevin Richardson:\n\n“This is actually my second attempt at using the Magnetic Memory technique. I won't lie to you, the first time I tried making a memory palace wasn't a great success. So take heart, don't give up if you don't get everything right the first time. Treat it as a learning experience and I promise you, you'll get better quickly. I'm still only a fledgling Memory Palace maker, yet now I'm able to remember up to thirty kanji readings in a single day!

    "description": "Ever wondered how to memorize vocabulary when  you've hit a ceiling? \n\nYou know the kind I mean: \n\nThe ceiling of either complexity or exhaustion or boredom. \n\nWell, there are a few things you really need to do in order to deal with this - and we talk about each when it comes to using the Memory Palace technique in this exclusive Magnetic Memory Method YouTube Live. \n\nHere's the original question for your reference:\n\nI've watched a couple of your videos, and I am subscribed to your mailing list.  \n\nI used to use the LOCI technique for studying math, physics, chemistry many years ago, and only after stumbling upon your videos did I start to use it for studying languages, namely Chinese.\n\nSo I started with the rather ambitious goal of learning 5,500 Chinese words this year.  To cut a long story short, I got to more than 500 words with the LOCI technique and with 11 memory palaces; however, I found that it was a challenge to review - it took me 30+ minutes a day, it became a chore and on top of that, memory palaces with 50 items were hard to come by, and this coupled with the idea that I would need to times this by 11 to get to my goal of 5,500. \n\nI'm wondering if your memory course can help me achieve my goal without spending hours upon hours reviewing the words daily. I reached out to a memory champion Florian from http://memory-sports.com, and he mentioned that from his experience for such a large number of words, the LOCI technique would be rather time-consuming. \n\nSo that brings me to ask the question about how your approach can help me and how long it will take me to implement your approach.\n\nI really want this vocabulary (characters aren't important) to take my Chinese to the next level, and I spend about 30 minutes to an hour a day learning Chinese vocabulary currently. \n\n***\n\nLet me know your questions and if you're interested in next level memory training that will help you overcome any and all objections rolling through your head, check out this free training: \n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/yt\n\nThanks as ever and talk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony",

    "title": "Aphantasia And The Memory Palace Technique",
    "description": "Worried that aphantasia or the inability to see images in your mind will stop you from using the Memory Palace technique? \n\nDon't be. \n\nAs I discuss in this video and in greater depth on the Magnetic Memory Method blog, I don't have this condition, but I'm low on the visual threshold. Most of what I do involves thinking about  strange combinations of images IN WORDS, not HDTV - just as I had always done as an avid reader of books. \n\nHere's the full blog post:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/aphantasia/\n\nEven though I don't have aphantasia, I DO take it seriously. \n\nIt would be years before I started actively practicing \"seeing\" the descriptions in books - and yet somehow I still enjoyed hundreds of novels without seeing a think in my mind.\n\nThen this update on an what might give clues to an aphantasia cure emerged:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Z88TSKejw\n\nOver the years, I've invested in myself so that I can \"see\" something like imagery in my mind. But even to this day, the best results I get from memory techniques don't require HD television on the back of my eyelids.\n\nNever.\n\nIt's just thoughts.\n\nBut there are some people, on the other hand, who see images very easily in their mind. And the can benefit a great deal from spending more time with words and concepts.\n\nAnd just as a preview of something coming up, I'm doing some research now on \"aphantasia,\" a condition in which people can't visualize in their minds whatsoever.\n\nAnd yet here's the thing: \n\nPeople with this condition are amongst the most creative people in the world and Penn Jillette to take perhaps the most famous example, has talked about how he remembers things perfectly well so long as he verbalizes them.\n\nHe doesn't need to see anything in his mind at all to remember!\n\nPlus, one of the guys who did a lot of work on Facebook and has pics with Zuckerberg all over his page also has this condition. Not being able to see in his mind doesn't seem to have stopped him from remembering all kinds of numbers and achieving all kinds of great things in life.\n\nSo listen: no matter who or where you are in your imaginative life, there's no reason you can't learn, remember and recall anything you want for the rest of you life using simple memory techniques. And I can help you magnetize and empower beyond your wildest imagination.\n\nIf you'd like to hear Penn Jillette talk about his experiences with aphantasia, go here: \n\nhttp://pennsundayschool.com/episodes/ Find episode 174 and scrub to the 1h15m mark.\n\nAlso, AphantasiaMeow is also doing great work with helping people discover how to experience having a mind's eye:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA0ZUj7Wtmc&lc=\n\nHere's Jonathan Levi on Aphantasia too:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n_KyqrPriQ\n\nHope this helps you out and look forward to hearing your stories of triumph when you dive in with memory techniques no matter where you currently stand with aphantasia and the ability to see imagery in your mind. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier\nwww.magneticmemorymethod.com",

I'd only heard them once in my life and used an impromptu Memory Palace to memorize them.\n\nMonths later ... \n\nStill intact. \n\nSure, I had a bit of a pronunciation problem, but that's muscle memory. It's understandable that words you don't use for months that you only heard once don't exactly snap into place. \n\nBut what a GREAT feeling to be able to remember them! And all by doing something I really love: \n\nUsing my memory.\n\nAfter that, we were shooting video and getting into more of the particulars about how all this works. \n\nWe wound up getting a bit lost and keeping warm inside the bank machine area of a building.\n\nAnd that's when the threats and guns appeared. \n\nTurns out, that a guy didn't like me having the camera on while April was teaching me how to say, \"I'm lost\" in Chinese. \n\nGood thing the Magnetic Memory Method teaches relaxation as part of the memory technique ...\n\nYou certainly need to be calm when a stranger starts telling you what you can and cannot do.\n\nIt's hard managing your defensive instincts and memory at the same time.\n\n(You'll laugh when you see my reaction in the video and the guns that were there to keep us safe all along).\n\nSo yes, April and I survived.\n\nAnd the coolest thing is that I was still able to memorize \"I am lost\" in Chinese. \n\nAnd that's what this video about using memory techniques to learn Chinese is all about. \n\nWanna join me as I use a special tool to help with my Chinese? \n\nHere's something you gotta try:\n\nhttp://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/chinese-vault\n\nHave fun and talk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier",

But more news about that soon. \n\nFor now, here's a quick message I just emailed out that you might find interesting:\n\nA few years ago a lot of things took place all at once. \n\nThe short version of the story is that my research grant had ended. I had no job. And I had no home. \n\nI was living in a basement suite while housesitting for a Canadian author and photographer. \n\nLiterally a mattress on the floor. \n\nMy life was in shambles. \n\nI’d had success and lost it all. \n\nThen I tried to start a “mentoring” company. \n\nI couldn’t stand the idea of being a tutor. Students, I reasoned, don’t need help with their existing assignments. They need someone to give them assignments that make them so good at school they simply laugh at what their teachers throw at them.\n\nActually, that company didn’t do too poorly. \n\nThe only problem is that I didn’t know how to market it. \n\nAnd in truth, I wasn’t suited for the work. \n\nMy heart was in the right place, but I just didn’t have … “it.” \n\nThrough a mysterious set of twists and turns, I wound up discovering a number of people who had learned to master their lives. \n\nAt first, I was skeptical.\n\nSome days, I still am. \n\nAfter all, it’s NEVER as easy as people make it seem. \n\nBy the same token, it can be a lot easier. \n\nAnd one of the people who has made my life a lot is easier is Michael Hyatt. \n\nI’m a hard working fellow. \n\nWhen I take a training, I take it seriously. \n\nI follow the instructions. \n\nAnd I expect my students to do the same. \n\nOtherwise, there’s no point. \n\nNothing to be gained. \n\nIf you’re teachable, I want to reward you.\n\nI want to introduce you to one of my teachers. \n\nI want to give you every possible incentive to learn from him.\n\nAnd I want you to do it by clicking on this link and following the instructions on the page. (It’s a quick read with lots of enticing pictures, so don’t hesitate for a second to check it out.)\n\nThen I want you to enjoy what Michael Hyatt has in store for you. \n\nLater, I’ll be sending you some gifts later to thank you for taking action. \n\nThose gifts will make your 2017 even more fabulous. \n\nSome of you will get more gifts than others.\n\nBut all of you will receive the absolute best Michael has to give.\n\nBecause when I’ve simply followed the instructions teachers like Michael have laid out, I’ve gone from sleeping on the floor to living out things I only ever dreamed of before.\n\nThings like …\n\nTraveling the world … \n\nHaving time to learn a new language …\n\nTeaching hundreds of thousands of people around the world …\n\nClick the link at the top of the description box right now for information about how you can do the same. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony\n\nP.S.

    "description": "For the Top Resource in this video, click: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/bye-bonus\n\nHere’s the question I’m answering in the video in full: \n\nHi there and greetings from Finland!\n\nMy question is both simple and broad, and it has to do with your great post on memorizing textbooks. In short, one could formulate it as this:\n\nHow to effectively filter the most important bits of information to memorize when studying large and confusing topics?\n\nI'm a student of comparative literature and philosophy at The University of Helsinki. Recently my mnemonic efforts have concerned memorizing large courses such as \"Introduction to Epistemology\", including textbooks and lectures.\n\nThe information is obviously quite theoretical and the materials cover a bit of everything on the subject. Sometimes the lectures are ill-organized and materials only partly relevant to the subject.\n\nFor me, coming up with colourful images and creating well-functioning memory palaces is relatively easy. The hard part is to figure out what to memorize in the first place. In your post about textbook memorizing that would be the part of \"finding the big points and jotting them down\".\n\nFor example, with the \"Introduction to Epistemology\" course I used 90 % of my study time just filtering and organizing the messy theoretical information in memorizable chunks. And not only finding the right things but also shaping them so that the \"big points\" are actually big, memorizable, and dense with information.\n\nBut unfortunately I can't help myself feeling insecure and unmotivated. Have I really found the right things? Or have I just wasted my limited study time? And why does it feel so overwhelming – like comparing weight lifting with walking through the gym's sliding door after the practice.\n\nI'm aware that my question is a bit off concerning your method. But since I have understood that you have studied film and philosophy successfully with mnemonics, I would be very glad to hear your insights and tips on this.\n\nThankfully yours,\n\nMikael\n\nThe resources I mention in the video include: \n\nHow to Memorize A Textbook: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-memorize-a-textbook/\n\nThe Helsinki Memory Palace video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llo3Ee4Z6Us\n\nAudiobook Builder: http://www.splasm.com/audiobookbuilder/\n\nModern Intellectual Tradition: From Descartes to Derrida: http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/modern-intellectual-tradition-from-descartes-to-derrida.html\n\nClassic Rick Roderick video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDqDJJcJAOg\n\nAs mentioned in the video, please let me know how I can make Q&A videos like these better for you. \n\nAnd if you aren’t already subscribed, you can subscribe to this channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nThanks as ever for your support and talk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony",

The first is about tax law - kind of dry and boring, but I suggest exactly why that's the last thing to focus on. \n\nCrazy thing is, I'm now having so much fun revisiting Patrick Bateman in the impromptu Memory Palace that I can't stop thinking about VAT tax law ... Maybe I should become an accountant!\n\nI also go over the truth about Anki and other spaced-repetition software. If you want to use them in hybrid form with memory techniques, here's a solid understanding of how. \n\nHope you enjoy. Leave a comment, share the video and head over to http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/contact if you have questions you'd like to have covered on future live Facebook Live Q&A. :)\n\nHere's my Facebook page, by the way: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Anthony-Metivier-480537711995886/\n\nYou can join the Magnetic Memory Method Facebook group here as well: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/404833969708982/\n\nThanks for watching and talk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier",

Grab this FREE Memory Improvement Kit: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/free-memory-improvement-kit/\n\nIn this third video in my memorize a shuffled deck of cards series, I used an impromptu Memory Palace based on chairs just outside the cafe window. Normally I would not do this, but it had an interesting effect. \n\nI also used columns instead of linear lines of action and clumped the cards into groups of three or four. It works really well and sped up the process. \n\nIf you're learning to use memory techniques, I highly suggest you explore this column approach in either an established Memory Palace or one you build on the fly. It works great. \n\nTalk soon! :)\n\nSincerely, \n\nAnthony Metivier",

    "description": "How to Improve your Memory? Us this FREE Memory Improvement Kit: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/free-memory-improvement-kit/\n\nAs you know, I love to answer questions about how to use a Memory Palace and memory techniques to finally get results. \n\nIn this video, I answer a very specific question. It goes like this:\n\nI'm a med student in Minnesota that is a big believer in memory palace/loci techniques.  Before finding you on the internet I followed a couple of other folks, but I like how your system really helps to scaffold a persons memory skills from where they are to where they want to get.  But I'm in trouble and need your help.\n\nI haven’t been doing too hot on my exams lately and I'm in serious need of some guidance.  Basically, I want go be able to use this system to catalog and remember my lectures.  Since I have a lot of lectures (usually about 1 hour in length and  between 20-50 per course @ 4 courses per semester) I figured that it would be helpful to systematized the places and rules I use for my memory palaces.  So far my rules work well but the places I'm having trouble with.  I've been using Google maps to learn new neighborhoods in my city. \n\nWhat I would like to do is to take a city block with 10 houses and use those 10 houses as palaces for 10 lectures.  I'd like to maximize the amount of info that can be stored on each house by placing 6 pair (12 total) of analog clocks in consistent locations around the front of the house (Google only provides views of the house from the street or above).  Then the hatch marks on the clocks can be micro loci for more information.\n\nThe problem is that I think its too cluttered and it's taking too much effort to see and remember images.  I know the  images are 'sticky' enough because when I take the same scenes  and place them in a more spread  out palace, they work great.  Also, I think part of  the  problem is because I’m looking at the image as a picture and tracing the picture with  my eyes instead of being in the picture and walking along in it.  However, because I'm using the front of a house from street view there's really not a whole bunch of walking available to me.\n\nWhat I need are ideas on how to systematized large amounts of data that also allow me loci for the  requisite detail I need.  What I want to avoid is having a bunch of unrelated memory palaces for lectures in the same subject.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nHappy to help. Please get busy using the Method of Loci in your Memory Palace now that you know how to improve your memory strategically.",

You'll discover: \n\n* Why memory is like a bicycle everyone can ride (with some minor personal adjustments).\n\n* The real reason why you should ever be squeamish about using memorization techniques.\n\n* Why and how some of the most famous memory skills are applicable to learning any subject.\n\n* How you can easily create a Memory Palace system for instant use at any time.\n\n* Unique techniques that will have you literally \"tuning in\" on the your subject of study.\n\n* How to separate and organize information in the most effective manner for memorization.\n\n * And much, much more ...\n\nThese techniques have been used by real students and professionals,  most of whom previously considered themselves owners of a \"bad memory.\"\n\nDon't worry! None of these techniques are rocket science.\n\nFrankly, if you can memorize a short email address or the name of a movie, then you can use this system to memorize anything.\n\nBut there's really no time to lose.\n\nEvery day that you are not using this simple memorization system, you are literally stealing from yourself the joy of being able to recall an abundance of information as you easily expand the natural abilities of your mind.",

Car accidents, terrorist attacks and riots can make many things impossible to forget. Such events can can even lead to post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nUsually, though, stress punishes our bodies and minds without the need of catastrophe. Work, relationship problems and health can all create stress.\n\nStress gets in the way of goals and dreams. Important professional missions like:\n\nStudying for exams and professional certifications.\nLearning a language.\nRemembering the names of the important people you meet.\nBut stress distracts from these activities. Stress makes paying attention difficult and learning new information becomes almost impossible.\n\nIf anything, all you learn is how to be more stressed out.\n\nBut when you use memory techniques and mnemonics, a lot of great things can happen that will reduce stress and let you experience memory improvement.",

    "description": "http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/free-memory-improvement-kit/\n\nThis is Courante of Suite #2 in D Minor. The link above will give you a lesson in how to quickly memorize it.\n\nA lot of people ask me about memorizing Bach. I haven't written a book about it yet, but it will be focused on memorizing music for bass. \n\nWhy? Because it has four strings and that's what I play the most. In other words, I only use my system on bass. \n\nBy the way, it may look to you like I'm reading, but that's just because I \"forgot\" to look away instead of staring into space. LOL. \n\nAnyhow, to memorize Bach quickly, I use a memory technique grounded in the Memory Palace method I teach over at magneticmemorymethod.com. You can find some posts over there about memorizing music that will give you some insight into what's going on until I can get around to writing the book. :)\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\nMy Youtube homepage: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI\n\nOther resources online: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Metivier\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lorayne\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Buzan\n\n\nKeywords:\n\nmemory technique\nmemory improvement\nmnemonic \nmnemonics \nmemory skills \nmemory palace \nrote learning \nspaced repetition\nmnemonictv1\nmerkspruch \nlernspruch \neselsleiter \nmnemotechnik \neselsbrücke",

    "title": "How To Remember Hiragana Fast So You Can Learn Japanese Easier [Hiragana Mnemonic Examples]",
    "description": "Get my FREE Memory Improvement Kit here: http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/free-memory-improvement-kit/\n\nUsing the Method of Loci for hiragana when you start to learn Japanese is okay, but...\n\nThere's something better to help you learn hiragana. It's called the Magnetic Memory Method. \n\nThe technique doesn't 100% leave spaced repetition behind, but through the magic of mnemonics, it's one of the easy ways to remember hiragana that you'll never forget. \n\nBest part? \n\nYou can apply this same technique to katakana and kanji and even entire Japanese phrases. \n\nAnd if you're looking for a learn Japanese app, the Memory Palace is going to do you so much good. Just look at what Kevin Richardson has achieved (including sketches of his Memory Palace for Japanese notebooks):\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/learn-japanese-app/\n\nSince interviewing Kevin about his success using mnemonics for the hiragana, I've interviewed another student name Sunil Khatri. He's now a Japanse Memory Palace master! Listen in here:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/japanese-memory-palace-mastery/\n\nIf you're tired of rote learning and spaced repetition, then the alternative to using this \"time honored\" but dull and deadly techniques make this the most important free video training you'll ever see. In this 18-minute presentation you'll learn exactly how to build a Memory Palace and use it to memorize the Hiragana in 1.5 hours in less. Even better, you'll be able to re-use it for the Katakana and have a solid understanding of its application to the Kanji. \n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\nMy Youtube homepage: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI\n\nOther resources online: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Metivier\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lorayne\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Buzan\n\n\nKeywords:\n\nmemory technique\nmemory improvement\nmnemonic \nmnemonics \nmemory skills \nmemory palace \nrote learning \nspaced repetition\nmnemonictv1\nmerkspruch \nlernspruch \neselsleiter \nmnemotechnik \neselsbrücke\nhiragana\nlearn japanese\nkatakana\nkanji",

    "description": "Would you like to know how to learn 200 Words (Or More!) in ANY language ... In as little as only 10 days? \n\nIf you need this video in written form, check out this post on how to memorize vocabulary:\n\nhttps://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-memorize-vocabulary/\n\nIn this video: \n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language ... Using the Magnetic Memory Method (Advanced Memory Palaces)\n\nIf you'd like to improve your ability to learn and memorize foreign language vocabulary by as much as 100%, 200%, even 300% ... using simple memory techniques that you can learn in a few short hours (or less), then this may be the most important video course you will ever view.\n\nBelieve it or not, it doesn't matter if you have a good memory or not.\n\nThe information in this course will teach you:\n\n•Why memory is like a bicycle everyone can ride (with some minor personal adjustments).\n\n•The real reason why no one should ever be squeamish about memorization or learning a language.\n\n•Why and how some of the most famous memory skills are applicable to language learning.\n\n•How to create a 26 \"letter location\" memory palace network based on the English alphabet.\n\n•Unique techniques that will have you literally \"tuning in\" on your dream foreign language.\n\n•How to separate foreign language words in the most effective manner for memorization.\n\n• A simple strategy for memorizing the male, neuter and feminine genders (depending on the language, this is a process that some people consider the ultimate nightmare of language learning.)\n\n•Two secret ways to use relaxation to aid the memorization process. These two methods alone are worth the price of this course because they will literally eliminate stress from your body as you work on learning and memorizing foreign language vocabulary.\n\n•And much, much more ...\n\nThese techniques have been used by real language learners, most of whom previously considered themselves owners of a \"bad memory\" to make real strides in their foreign language learning efforts.\n\nDon't worry! None of these techniques are rocket science.\n\nFrankly, if you can memorize a short email address or the name of a movie, then you can use this system to memorize the vocabulary of any language.\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\nHow To Improve Vocabulary With Mnemonic Examples Playlist:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZ2FGJhR5R8KWTr94IJa1U8d8QU8QdRT\n\nFurther resources to consider...\n\n3 EASILY Solved Reasons You Get Bored With Mnemonics [Bonus: How to Memorize Spelling]:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne6ErMqW7fU\n\nMagnetic Memory Method Platinum Program:\n\nhttp://magneticmemorymethod.com/ytp\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemonics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!

    "description": "http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/free-memory-improvement-kit/\n\nIf you've ever desperately wanted to memorize poetry but absolutely hate the slings and arrows, the sound and the fury of repeating the same lines hundreds of times until they've become more annoying than beautiful ... then this may be the most important book you will ever read.\n\nBelieve it or not, it doesn't matter if you have a good memory or not.\n\nIn addition to improving your ability to memorize poetry by 100%, 200%, 300% (or more) ... using simple techniques that you can learn in 30 minutes (or less) ... the information in this book will teach you:\n\n• Why memory is like a bicycle everyone can ride (with some minor personal adjustments).\n\n• The real reason why no one should ever be squeamish about memorizing poetry.\n\n• Why and how some of the most famous memory skills are applicable to memorizing poetry.\n\n• Effortless methods used by the experts to create easy, effective and elegant Memory Palaces for storing poetry (and \"stealth\" methods that show you how to use them to recall poems right away no matter how long ago you remembered them).\n\n• Unique techniques that will have you literally \"tuning in\" on the poetry you read.\n\n• Exactly how often to recall poetry (a routine that lets people who are brand spanking new to memory techniques to memorize verse quickly and rapidly advance to mastery).\n\n• A simple strategy for turning boring places you've been into amazing Memory Palaces (learn this technique and you will be able to spin any place you visit from now on into Memory Palace gold).\n\n• Two secret ways to use relaxation to aid the memorization process. These two methods alone are worth the price of this book because they will literally eliminate stress from your body as you memorize poetry.\n\n• And much, much more ...\n\nThese techniques have been used by poetry fans, most of whom previously considered themselves owners of a \"bad memory\" to make real strides in memorizing their favorite poems.\n\nDon't worry! None of these techniques involve rocket engineering.\n\nFrankly, if you can memorize a short email address or the name of a movie, then you can use this system to memorize poems as short as a sonnet or as long as an epic.\n\nBut there's really no time to lose.\n\nEvery day that you are not using this simple memorization method, you are literally stealing from yourself the joy of reading, reciting and intimately knowing world class poetry as you easily expand the natural abilities of your mind.\n\nKeywords: \n\nMemorize poetry\nmnemonictv1\nmnemonics\nmemory skills\nmemory palace\nMerkspruch\nLernspruch\nEselsleiter\nMnemotechnik\nEselsbrücke\n\nMy YouTube Homepage: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdIwC3d4CRjrrQdaqZaNBpA\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI",

As a young man making money to help care for his couch potato parents while illegally downloading movies every night at the gas station, he unexpectedly learns that he is the progeny of the mysterious time-traveler, Doctor Zoo.\n\nDON'T LET THE BAUD INFECTION SPREAD!\n\nBut Lucas doesn't have time to dwell on the news of his true family history. After barely rescuing Lucas from a Viral Download Attack, the notorious Baud Hunter Cowboy Dan whisks him away to help him heal from a growing Baud infection. Caught up in a daring adventure, Lucas discovers that he has extraordinary mental powers far in advance of any other child of Doctor Zoo seen before ... including Cowboy Dan's own step-daughter.\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO, LUCAS PARKS, DON'T LET THE BAUD INFECTION SPREAD!\n\nLucas is under so much pressure to learn the skills needed to stop the Baud infection coursing through his system that he fails to notice just how dark and twisted his inner life has become. And once the Baud has him in their grip, they'll do anything to use Lucas as their pawn in a mission to destroy Doctor Zoo before his world-alerting Time Machine has a chance to exist.\n\nLucas Parks and the Download of Doom is Anthony Metivier's most riveting story to date, a searing, sensational, and thrilling ride with the most intense and spellbinding characters Metivier has ever brought to the page. Lucas Parks and the Download of Doom is Book One of The Baud Chronicles.\n\nKeywords: \n\nMemory Palace\nMnemonics\nCyberpunk\nMethod of Loci\n\nLinkback:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI",

    "description": "http://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/free-memory-improvement-kit/\n\nIf you've ever wanted to double, triple or quadruple your memory abilities, then this may be one of the most important books you will ever read. \n\nIn Warren Hilton's The Trained Memory (with an introduction and commentary by Anthony Metivier), you'll learn:\n\n* How to improve your memory using famous icons like the Mona Lisa so that you can easily create powerful mental imagery that will allow you to recall information with ease.\n\n* The secrets of using four memory processes that will literally \"unlock\" your memory abilities.\n\n* How to \"tune in\" on your memory capacities by cultivating a state of awareness in the present. \n\n* The importance of \"integral recall\" and how to use it so that you can overcome the deficits of \"ordinary thinking.\" \n\n* The basic principles of \"thought reproduction\" and how they can be used simplify complex groupings of information and ideas. \n\n* The art of compelling yourself to recall information, even when you don't feel up to it. \n\n* How to form the correct habits of memory and mnemonics so that you can memorize and recall information systematically and persistently. \n\n* How to use memory \"tokens\" to dramatically increase your recall. \n\n* The exact steps to take to improve your attention in order to improve sensory experience and imbue the mind with lightning quickness. \n\n* Daily morning routines and drills for increasing your mental capacity for observation, inventive thinking and positivity.\n\n* ... and much, much more. \n\nLook, none of these techniques require brain surgery, crazy math or rocket science. These are simple strategies that real people have used to achieve massive improvements in their memory abilities simply by learning a few quick tricks, implementing them and changing how they think about the muscle between their ears.\n\nBut there's really no time to lose. Every day that you're not using the natural abilities of your mind by having a dedicated memorization strategy, you are missing out on walking through an open the door that will make literally anything possible.\n\nKeywords: \n\nMemory training\nMnemonics\nFree guide\nWarren Hilton\n\nLinkback:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI",

These two methods alone are worth the price of this course because they will literally eliminate stress from your body as you work on learning and memorizing foreign language vocabulary.\n\n•And much, much more ...\n\nThese techniques have been used by real language learners, most of whom previously considered themselves owners of a \"bad memory\" to make real strides in their foreign language learning efforts.\n\nDon't worry! None of these techniques are rocket science.\n\nFrankly, if you can memorize a short email address or the name of a movie, then you can use this system to memorize the vocabulary of any language.\n\nBut there's really no time to lose.\n\nEvery day that you are not using this simple vocabulary memorization system, you are literally stealing from yourself the joy of reading, speaking and knowing another language in depth as you easily expand the natural abilities of your mind. \n\n\nKeywords:\n\nMnemonics\nlanguage learning\nmemory palace\n\nLinkback to course:\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/language-learning-online-magnetic-memory\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI",

I am using this method and sticking with it in other areas of learning as well. Recommend this book for those who want to learn Russian or any language!\"\n- DJD\n\n\"I've used different mnemonic devices before, and I like how this one adds a new layer. It takes a good amount of work up front, but helps in the long run.\"\n- Luke Creighton \n\n\"Metivier actually explains, meticulously, just how to go about building memory palaces and filling them up with the French words (or words of any language that uses the Roman alphabet) you want to remember. He tells you what preparation steps are necessary, gives examples of the kind of vivid imagery you're going to use, and even suggests a schedule in which you devote one day a month to each of the 26 letters of the alphabet. I'm 58 years old, learning French with an aim to be reasonably fluent in a year: thanks to this technique, I feel confident I can do it. I'm memorizing around 100 words a day now, and it's fun, too!\"\n- Fiona\n\n\"I have read and put into practice the ideas in this book. The ideas presented are not your normal for memorizing vocabulary. that is why the book is good. It presents several DIFFERENT ideas to you that are possible for everyone , if given the time and effort. don't dismiss this book. If you have struggled with memorizing vocabulary in the past this book will give you several suggestions that will help you tremendously.\"\n- S. Moore\n\n\"I have built the 26 memory palaces over the past week with 40 -- 50 locations per site. I've worked through your book and find it amazing that I can memorise a pack of cards and recite them back....I am struggling to believe this. I was I a meeting today with 20 people I have never met before, and I used the first 20 stations of the memory palace I built for the card memory exercise to remember names. I have always struggled with names before but I managed today to get this right. It felt good.\n\nSo far this process has been both successful for me and a huge amount of fun. I just thought I would write a short note, therefore, to thank you.\"\n\n- Stephen Bell\n\nOther Cool Videos On Mnemonics, Memory Techniques and Memory Skills\n\n\nMnemonics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FotHC2nlGrQ\n\nHow To Improve Your Memory with Mnemonics: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzFNBSpK6w\n\nMnemonics: Still Your Dear Friend: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=7tFp674luH4\n\nMnemnoics Memory Tricks To Remember Anything: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4voNYevvI\n\nMemory Training Consumer Awareness Guide: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ryDuTAkzc\n\nMemorize Middle East Countries in Less than 5 Minutes:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--L3rxBu4\n\nVisual Mnemonics Vocabulary Strategy:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=T-1_I_oZcuw\n\nA Memory Palace in Fiction?: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz6VKul9E08\n\nGRE word list!!MEMORIZE these words with mnemonics:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxRcWe7UrA\n\nMnemonics by Gaeri Summer:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=udlRSrFCkXY\n\nCar Crash Survivor Michael Gusman Talks About Mnemonics And Brain Trauma: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnW-2jqLcjw\n\nMnemonics for medical school:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9iaYXuJUNQ\n\nMnemonic wizards: incredible feats of memory:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=6vsYCSmBcM0\n\nFree Memory Training Guide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tEFpaPTqQ\n\nHow to Memorize | How to Remember Names | Memory Speaker\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2GI0huaV5s\n\nMemorize Concepts Using Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUC5N9QORhM\n\nHow To Remember More of What You Read with Simple Memory Tricks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bgghf81Zg\n\nMore Memory Tricks \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Gv3IHXxNs\n\nMemory Techniques: The Memory Palace System:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIx8pzYBlo\n\nGreek Alphabet: It's Easy To Learn The Greek Alphabet With Mnemonics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V4tc-5Kuh4\n\nJoshua Foer: Feats of memory anyone can do TED Talk:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0OmIO18-8\n\nHow to become a Memory Master: Idriz Zogaj at TEDxGoteborg:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ebJlcZMx3c\n\nA Matrix of Memory Palaces: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmc6OvP8K9k\n\nHow to Learn & Memorize the Vocabulary of Any Language - Using the Magnetic Memory Method:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AAhVOIwptI",
