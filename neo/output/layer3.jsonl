Reason & liberty are paramount-whether threatened by tyranny in places like China or elsewhere-because they are essential to human dignity and prosperity.

The West has been a custodian of this tradition of criticism, producing societies full rapid, stable, and genuine progress. The clearer people become on this connection, the more they'll recognize that these principles are what enable our civilization to be freer, safer, and more prosperous.
