    "title": "Should Christians Believe The Dead Are Conscious? (Panel Discussion)",
    "description": "This is a discussion between Christians regarding whether we will be conscious following death, but before the resurrection - think, \"Is grandma awake and aware right now, when she died two years ago?\" \n\nSteven Hafley: I’m a published author of “Until Death Be Defeated,” which is about the intermediate state. I also have two more books in the works. I was airborne infantry in the Army for six years, a former snake breeder, and I’m an XRP enthusiast. I live in Indiana, I’m 41, and I’m single. I also have YouTube channel called The Curious Kairos where I discuss my book and eschatology in general.\n\nNathan Bozeman: My name is Nathan Bozeman, founder of The Epitome, which is an apologetics ministry geared primarily toward defending the reliability of the Gospels and the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. The Epitome can be found on YouTube, and I go by Nathan Bozeman on X, formerly known as Twitter. I'm a full-time Christian radio host, so all of my apologetics work is done because it's a great passion of mine. I take an ecumenical approach to conversations within the boundaries of the faith because I believe it serves as a better witness to the world for Jesus when we can get along. My prayer is that everything I do serves to glorify Jesus out of an overwhelming gratitude for what He's done for me and that many would come to know Him through the work of The Epitome.\n\nChris Date: My calling—my desire, my passion, my mission—is to serve Christians by helping to reform their hearts and minds and inviting their help to reform my own. To this end, In 2017 I graduated summa cum laude from Liberty University with a Bachelor of Science in Religion, concentrating on biblical and theological studies, and in 2020 I graduated with a 4.0 GPA from Fuller Theological Seminary, where I focused on exegesis of the Old Testament in its original Hebrew. I’m an adjunct professor of Bible and theology at Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary, and I hope to teach full-time one day, once I can pursue a doctorate in Old Testament biblical studies. I’m a congregant and occasional preacher at Table of Hope Community Church in Puyallup, Washington, where I am being developed for eldership. I’m the public face of the ministry Rethinking Hell and the host of the Theopologetics YouTube show and podcast. I publish books and academic journal articles, speak at conferences, participate in debates, and minister whenever and wherever else the Lord gives me the opportunity. \nChris' books: https://www.amazon.com/Christopher-M....\nChris' channel:    / @theopologetics   \n\nJames Harding: My name is James Harding; I'm 25 years old; I'm from Quebec, Canada; I'm a freelance translator (English to French or vice versa); I am the reigning, defending, undisputed champion of the world in... nothing; I run a very small YouTube channel called “Study is Key” on which I unintentionally upload mostly response videos. Other times, I upload videos on whichever biblical topic or passage I find worthy or interesting enough to address; Lastly, since the very beginning of 2024, I've been a member of the Rethinking Hell ministry (thanks to Chris Date) and have published both 1) lengthy articles and 2) what I call “cheat sheets,” which are one-page, point-by-point treatments of individual passages or terms relating to Hell that people can print out before going to talk with a friend, family member or pastor to help them offer good explanations.\n\nAdam Terry: I’m Adam Terry and I run @curiouschristianity on YouTube and Substack. I am an aspiring author and self-proclaimed expert on Genesis 3:14-19. I am currently finishing a book on Genesis 3:16 titled It Was Never About Adam. I also champion Intertextual Hermeneutics as one of the best interpretive frameworks for the Bible and believe that there is a need to call Christians back to the Bible and its authority. I have done debates on many topics such as the intermediate state, annihilationism, Young Earth Creationism, and the Millennium. I have a passion for the Word of God but more importantly for the God of the Word. I hope to serve Christ’s church through my research, conversations, videos, and conduct of my life.",

    "description": "The rise of artificial intelligence is a game changer for how we relate to technology. AI raises practical and ethical questions about our future-questions that are currently generating a great deal of anxiety and hope. But AI also raises deeper metaphysical questions about selfhood and humanity. What does it mean to be a person? What gives human life value? Are human beings truly unique? If so, how? Though these questions are increasingly unavoidable, most people are underprepared to answer them.\nWhat is a Person in the age of AI? This is a topic that must be addressed head on. The implications are far-reaching and increasingly relevant. As we consider the reality of personhood, we come face-to-face with the most fundamental questions of life: who we are, and where we find meaning.\n\nDr. McKinney's Book: https://www.amazon.com/What-Person-Age-Jason-McKinney-ebook/dp/B0FKK4TVD7/ref=sr_1_1?crid=161DJCHCS0TOY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hZfysUcxt47S2rPQTDWObA526JYmnc0RUN78l0VVEyW7tzNdmfs7cJgZj8fNQQvA.xkDBiO65b3osSKMB1ZTHnn6YG3R2Z2MnjvHmOCVWecc&dib_tag=se&keywords=jason+lee+mckinney&qid=1756994271&s=digital-text&sprefix=jason+lee+mckinney%2Cdigital-text%2C89&sr=1-1",

    "title": "DEBATE: The Dead Are Conscious in the Intermediate State Between Death & Resurrection",
    "description": "This is a debate between Christians regarding whether we will be conscious following death, but before the resurrection - think, \"Is grandma awake and aware right now, when she died two years ago?\" \n\nDebate Thesis: “Deceased human beings are conscious in the intermediate state from death to resurrection.” \n\nAffirmative: Steven Hafley & Nathan Bozeman \nNegative: Chris Date & James Harding\n\nSteven Hafley: I’m a published author of “Until Death Be Defeated,” which is about the intermediate state. I also have two more books in the works. I was airborne infantry in the Army for six years, a former snake breeder, and I’m an XRP enthusiast. I live in Indiana, I’m 41, and I’m single. I also have YouTube channel called The Curious Kairos where I discuss my book and eschatology in general.\n\nNathan Bozeman: My name is Nathan Bozeman, founder of The Epitome, which is an apologetics ministry geared primarily toward defending the reliability of the Gospels and the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. The Epitome can be found on YouTube, and I go by Nathan Bozeman on X, formerly known as Twitter. I'm a full-time Christian radio host, so all of my apologetics work is done because it's a great passion of mine. I take an ecumenical approach to conversations within the boundaries of the faith because I believe it serves as a better witness to the world for Jesus when we can get along. My prayer is that everything I do serves to glorify Jesus out of an overwhelming gratitude for what He's done for me and that many would come to know Him through the work of The Epitome.\n\nChris Date: My calling—my desire, my passion, my mission—is to serve Christians by helping to reform their hearts and minds and inviting their help to reform my own. To this end, In 2017 I graduated summa cum laude from Liberty University with a Bachelor of Science in Religion, concentrating on biblical and theological studies, and in 2020 I graduated with a 4.0 GPA from Fuller Theological Seminary, where I focused on exegesis of the Old Testament in its original Hebrew. I’m an adjunct professor of Bible and theology at Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary, and I hope to teach full-time one day, once I can pursue a doctorate in Old Testament biblical studies. I’m a congregant and occasional preacher at Table of Hope Community Church in Puyallup, Washington, where I am being developed for eldership. I’m the public face of the ministry Rethinking Hell and the host of the Theopologetics YouTube show and podcast. I publish books and academic journal articles, speak at conferences, participate in debates, and minister whenever and wherever else the Lord gives me the opportunity. \nChris' books: https://www.amazon.com/Christopher-M.-Date/e/B01MS4LBGA\nChris' channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UCnlagBRu-t-9_tX6NivDfXw \n\nJames Harding: My name is James Harding; I'm 25 years old; I'm from Quebec, Canada; I'm a freelance translator (English to French or vice versa); I am the reigning, defending, undisputed champion of the world in... nothing; I run a very small YouTube channel called “Study is Key” on which I unintentionally upload mostly response videos. Other times, I upload videos on whichever biblical topic or passage I find worthy or interesting enough to address; Lastly, since the very beginning of 2024, I've been a member of the Rethinking Hell ministry (thanks to Chris Date) and have published both 1) lengthy articles and 2) what I call “cheat sheets,” which are one-page, point-by-point treatments of individual passages or terms relating to Hell that people can print out before going to talk with a friend, family member or pastor to help them offer good explanations.",

Published researcher working in the intersection of New Testament studies and Christian Theology. Currently working through the PhD program at Ridley College in Melbourne, Australia to study in the subject of Pauline theology.\r\n\r\n\"I am an avid researcher who is involved in presenting complex academic subjects in my local church body as well as in academic publishing in numerous peer-reviewed journals. My MA at Fuller Theological Seminary was centered largely in New Testament Studies with courses on Greek exegesis of Philippians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon. I am relational, collaborative, and an independent researcher who is will take the initiative to learn and think critically about the text of Scripture and its implications for theology and life.\r\n\r\nI am active in social media, podcasting and audio editing for numerous projects.

    "description": "Norman Geisler, and JI Packer were involved in the crafting of what is known as the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy. Geisler thought that Licona’s views placed him outside of what is acceptable within the Chicago statement. JI Packer passed away in 2020, and he has often been cited as agreeing with Geisler about Licona’s work. Yet, it’s also been suggested that Packer actually agreed with Licona, and thought his work could be consistent with the Chicago statement. On the one hand, Packer endorsed Licona’s book on the gospels, on the other, Geisler says the following, “Packer insisted that he strongly stands by both his affirmation of the ICBI statements on inerrancy and that Licona’s views were categorically contrary to it.”\n\nRecently, a critic of Dr. Licona (Dr. Bill Roach) has challenged Licona on his thoughts on Packer, as well as his understanding of the Chicago Statement, inerrancy, and inspiration. \n\nNow Licona, Dan Wallace, Paul Copan and others discuss what JI Packer actually said about these matters in their presence. \n\nPART ONE: https://youtu.be/x_A2waU3fFc?si=SnFbMbcgubt9TZc7\n\nPART TWO: https://youtu.be/Mf0RfMgGMzo\n\nLearn Formally: https://trinitysem.edu/\nLearn Casually: https://www.braxtonhunter.com/\n\nHelp us out and get ebooks, seminary-level courses, extra episodes, and more: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio",

Dunn, taken from: Craig, William Lane. \"Reasonable Faith\" 3rd ed. (Wheaton, IL; Crossway Press), 315. \"Son of Man\" was Jesus' favorite honorific title for himself. It is used 80-83 times in the gospels, and only 3 or 4 times outside of the gospels in the New Testament. I (Braxton) said, \"... I think, if I'm right, outside of the gospels this is only used one other time about Jesus...\" So, modify that to only 3 or 4 and the point is still made to, literally, ALMOST exactly the same degree.",

    "description": "Is Argument for GOD Consistent with SCIENCE?\nIn this video, the speaker discusses the cosmological argument and its relationship with science up to the point of the Big Bang. They clarify that they do not use science to argue for the Kalam cosmological argument, but rather \napproach it philosophically. The argument is seen as consistent with science until the beginning of nature, which is the focus of scientific study. Beyond that point, the discussion shifts to philosophy when considering existence without the physical universe. The speaker emphasizes the importance of philosophical considerations in understanding the concept of God in relation to the origins of the universe.",

    "description": "ATHEIST: If GOD Then No FREE WILL\nThe video discusses the reconciliation of belief in libertarian free will with belief in an omniscient God who knows the outcome of everyone he creates. The speaker explains that God's knowledge of the future does not cause individuals to act in a certain way, as knowledge is not causal. The concept of a modal fallacy is introduced to address the misconception that God's knowledge determines human actions. The discussion highlights the distinction between God's omniscience and human free will, emphasizing that one's actions are not predetermined by God's knowledge.",

    "title": "EXPERT Presents New Case for the SUPERNATURAL (W/ Dr. Joshua Farris)",
    "description": "Dr. Joshua Farris, a celebrated academic with dozens of published articles, discusses the creation of the self, consciousness, artificial intelligence, and reasons that God is the best explanation for the soul. He lays it all out in his new book, “The Creation of Self,” linked below. \n\nFrom the back cover of the book: \nSituated in broader science-and-religion discussions, The Creation of Self is the first book-length defense of a creationist view of persons as souls. This book therefore serves as both a novel argument for God's creation of selves and as a critique of contemporary materialist and emergent-self alternatives, critically examining naturalistic views that argue for a regular, law-like process behind the emergence of personhood. Author Joshua Farris argues on the assumption that persons are fundamentally unique individuals that look more like singularities of nature, rather than material products grounded in regularity or predictability from past events. By extending the basic intuition that we are unique and mysterious individuals, Farris develops a sophisticated analytic defense of the soul that requires a sufficient explanation not found in nature but made by a Creator who has intentions and the power to bring about novel entities in the world. The Creation of Self gives philosophers, theologians, and the lay intellectual grounding for thinking about persons as religious beings. It aims to help readers understand why recent scientifically motivated objections to the soul are unsuccessful, and why we must consider a religious conception of persons as souls as a common starting point.\n\nDr. Farris’ New Book: https://www.amazon.com/Creation-Self-Case-Soul/dp/1803410868\nDr. Farris’ Academia Page: https://rub.academia.edu/JoshuaFarris\nDr. Farris' Amazon Author Page: https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B088KV4X2H/allbooks?ingress=0&visitId=aa5a5cce-a304-4293-9e67-aa88f41550f1&store_ref=ap_rdr&ref_=ap_rdr\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio",

    "description": "What if the evidence and arguments for Christianity still leave you uncertain. Dr. Liz Jackson joins me to discuss why it’s smart to wager that Christianity is true. This might be just what you need. \n\nDr. Jackson’s Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@lizjackson111\n\nArticle on wager arguments from Dr. Jackson: https://philpapers.org/rec/JACPAF?fbclid=IwAR3z1snOriBgMLQO3g4O79QiDZLpdTzAtOG6KZ9OJ56VPiJnINKpbEUA1cU\n\nBelow is Dr. Jackson’s bio in her own words. \n\nI’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University). Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the School of Philosophy at Australian National University.\n\nI received my Ph.D. from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, and my BA in philosophy at Kansas State University.\n\nMy primary research is in epistemology, much of it falling at the intersection between formal and traditional epistemology. Recently, my research has focused on the relationship between belief and credence. I defend and explore implications of dualism about belief and credence. Dualism is the view that we have both beliefs and credences, and neither attitude is reducible to the other. My interests in epistemology also include (defending) epistemic permissivism, (arguing against) pragmatic and moral encroachment, and other issues in social epistemology (e.g. disagreement, epistemic paternalism).\n\nMy secondary research interests are in philosophy of mind, specifically the nature of belief, and philosophy of religion, specifically Pascal’s Wager and the nature of faith. I have further interest in decision theory, ethics and normativity, and metaphysics.\n\nMy non-philosophical interests include sports (especially basketball), traveling, avocados, coffee, weight lifting, cooking, and podcasts.\n\nDr. Liz Jackson: https://www.youtube.com/user/lizjackson111\n\nOur Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKBYjjPp7VtcaH3fewhznQ\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio​​\n\nMusic by Joakim Karud",

    "description": "Some Christians believe that they can reach a point in their spiritual growth at which they begin to live above sin. Few of us have likley met those, in daily life, who would claim this about themselves. Nevertheless, Christians maintain a belief in the doctrine of sanctification, a process in which they seek to become more and more like Jesus. Surely, there are many who strike us as taking that process more seriously than others.

    "description": "The reasons given by these TikTok creators for no longer affirming Christianity are THEIR reasons, whether we think they are GOOD ENOUGH reasons to reasonably conclude Christianity is false or not. It's important to point out where the intellectual problems reside in these objections, but these are human beings. They matter. While I hope to respond to what I consider problematic, Christians definitely need to recognize, from this, that sometimes unbelievers walk away for bad, but meaningful reasons. It may not be that these individuals provide what I consider to be intellectually powerful reasons to reject Christianity, but their reasons are still sometimes deeply personal. Christians may have the truth, but that doesn't mean we aren't often also unsympathetic, unkind or cruel. For this, WE should self-reflect. \n\nSUPERNATURAL STORIES PODCAST: https://podcasts.apple.com/id/podcast...\n\nLearn Formally: Trinitysem.edu\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\n\nHelp us out and get ebooks, seminary-level courses, extra episodes, and more: Patreon.com/trinityradio\n\n#deconversion #evangelism #TrinityRadio",

    "title": "When Division is Necessary",
    "description": "Cries for unity are common among evangelicals. \"Who cares what it says on the sign, as long as you love Jesus,\" say many who long for a church without unnecessary divisions that can sometimes cause such pain within the body of Christ. Amen! But, while it is tragic to see a lack of unity where it should be had, it is certainly tragic to pretend theological unity where it cannot exist. How should Christians think about this? Jude will help us with that answer. \n\nFrom the speaker: \n\nI AM THE SUM OF MY PARTS . . . \n\nGod has moved in my life through a number of powerful men and women of God from whom I have benefited greatly. There is nothing new under the sun, as it is said. For that reason, much of what you hear in these lectures is not unique to me. Most of it was likely gleaned from other sources. I want to be transparent about that and share my sources. In terms of biblical scholarship, I have been blessed by the work of Harold Hunter (my father), Craig Keener, David Allen, Malcom Yarnell, Tom Schriner, Johnathan Pritchett (with whom I co-host Trinity Radio), F.F. Bruce, Adam Harwood (with whom I have co-authored), Steve Gregg (with whom I have worked), and Bruce Ware.\n\nAs for Christian apologetics, William Lane Craig (with whom I have lectured), Michael Licona (a personal friend), Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, J.P. Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavor than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.",

For free ebooks, a lot more content with Braxton and Johnathan, and full seminary level courses, visit us at Patreon.com/trinityradio and prayerfully consider if perhaps you might support what we're doing. \n\nLearn Casually: Braxtonhunter.com\nLearn Formally: Trinitysem.edu\n\nLearn Jude with apologetic concepts in mind!\n\nFrom the speaker: \n\nI AM THE SUM OF MY PARTS . . . \n\nGod has moved in my life through a number of powerful men and women of God from whom I have benefited greatly. There is nothing new under the sun, as it is said. For that reason, much of what you hear in these lectures is not unique to me. Most of it was likely gleaned from other sources. I want to be transparent about that and share my sources. In terms of biblical scholarship, I have been blessed by the work of Harold Hunter (my father), Craig Keener, David Allen, Malcom Yarnell, Tom Schriner, Johnathan Pritchett (with whom I co-host Trinity Radio), F.F. Bruce, Adam Harwood (with whom I have co-authored), Steve Gregg (with whom I have worked), and Bruce Ware.\n\nAs for Christian apologetics, William Lane Craig (with whom I have lectured), Michael Licona (a personal friend), Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, J.P. Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavor than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.",

McLatchie presents a fully orbed case that includes evidence from Genetics and a case for Christianity.

There is nothing new under the sun, as it is said. For that reason, much of what you hear in these lectures is not unique to me. Most of it was likely gleaned from other sources. I want to be transparent about that and share my sources. In terms of biblical scholarship, I have been blessed by the work of Harold Hunter (my father), Craig Keener, David Allen, Malcom Yarnell, Tom Schriner, Johnathan Pritchett (with whom I co-host Trinity Radio), F.F. Bruce, Adam Harwood (with whom I have co-authored), Steve Gregg (with whom I have worked), and Bruce Ware.\n\nAs for Christian apologetics, William Lane Craig (with whom I have lectured), Michael Licona (a personal friend), Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, J.P. Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavor than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.\n\nLearn Casually: Braxtonhunter.com\nLearn Formally: Trinitysem.edu\nJimmy Akin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMdWfNX0Aw\nMichael Heiser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLXfoRqclOg",

    "description": "The host of one of the most popular philosophy of religion YouTube channels, @CapturingChristianity, has been investigating the claims of Catholic thinkers to see if they hold up. Cameron Bertuzzi has been a close friend, and that will be obvious from the video, but as he becomes more outspoken about the positive case for Catholicism, I suggested we talk about what it will mean for him (practically speaking) in life. If he becomes Catholic, how will his family react? If he doesn't, what WILL he affirm, and how will that impact his ministry going forward? Will Catholics offer Cameron a book deal to tell his story of searching through the evidence, and to what extent do opportunities like that influence his evaluation. Alternatively, as a protestant, he may miss out on benefits he thinks Catholicism offers.

This language likely provokes in you, thoughts of the future state of unbelievers, and what you understand about the nature of hell.

    "description": "As a concept, \"justice\" is the theme of Western culture, at present. What justice looks like for various groups, and with regard to varying injustices, is debated. This PUBLIC MESSAGE to Christians is not intended to speak to all the specific ways injustice should be resolved in the present socio/cultural climate. Rather, it is meant to be a call to clearly illustrate the theological hope of future justice that those who long for it may not despair as others who have no hope. \n\nThis was originally a session for the ReThinking Hell conference from 2021.",

For many who have deconstructed, what was taken to be scientific evidence against God's existence (or a lack of scientific evidence in favor of God's existence), was a major motivator for abandoning religious positions. Yet, there are many Christians who are also working scientists who do not share these concerns.

If you have never attended one of these ReThinking Hell conferences, plan to do that, and help them out by subscribing to their channel! https://www.youtube.com/user/rethinkinghell\n\nThough this fact does not affect the reasoning, or point of the presentation, it should be noted that since this talk was originally given, Alex O'Connor has updated viewers. He says he no longer struggles with the fear of hell. \n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio​",

We want to provide a place where you can ask questions or just listen to intelligent discussions about these types of conversations.\n\nWe do this through something we call One Life Explorer Edition. It’s a Sunday time we set aside once a month for people who want to explore and are open-minded but want to hear some good reasons why they should believe any of these types of things.\n\nThe subject of this conversation is consciousness. How your self-perceptions of the world can point somewhere higher and bigger than ourselves. It also brings up other topics like the existence of the soul, life after death, or even artificial intelligence. \nWe want to aid you in your exploration.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Braxton Hunter.\n\nVisit our website: onelifechurch.org/exploreredition to submit a question for our Q&A that will happen on the One Life Podcast, or text one in at 812-643-4377",

Whether or not one thinks Craig's comments are most appropriately applied to Clifton isn't really the point of this video. Scott is an incredible thinker, and presents his positions with great clarity. Craig's comments are highlighted because they are helpful in making the larger point I'm making in this video.

    "description": "Our Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKBYjjPp7VtcaH3fewhznQ\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio​​\n\nI AM THE SUM OF MY PARTS . . . \n\nGod has moved in my life through a number of powerful men of God from whom I have benefited greatly. There is nothing new under the sun, as it is said. For that reason, much of what you hear in these lectures is not unique to me. Most of it was likely gleaned from other sources. I want to be transparent about that and share my sources. In terms of biblical scholarship, I have been blessed by the work of Harold Hunter (my father), Craig Keener, David Allen, Malcom Yarnell, Tom Schriner, Johnathan Pritchett (with whom I co-host Trinity Radio), F.F. Bruce, Adam Harwood (with whom I have co-authored), Steve Gregg (with whom I have worked), and Bruce Ware.\n\nAs for Christian apologetics, William Lane Craig (with whom I have lectured), Michael Licona (a personal friend), Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, J.P. Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Matt Slick, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavour than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.",

    "description": "I believe that Genetically Modified Skeptic presents this material because he wants the best for individuals struggling with sexual frustrations of various kinds that he sees as springing from Christian attitudes about sex outside of marriage. His motivations, I think, are honest and caring. However, his video, in my opinion is one-sided. It presents possible dangers related to Christian views about the topic, to the exclusion of possible dangers related to secular views. It also overly simplifies the question of sex as a \"need.\" Further, viewers may not understand why I suggest that much of what Drew says presumes the falsity of Christianity. If Christianity is true, then as one of my patrons put it, \"If extreme unwavering self-hatred is occurring after a sexual failure and repentance, what needs to change is one's beliefs about God's forgiveness, mercy, patience, and the height and depth of his love, not one's belief about whether certain types of sexual behavior are right or wrong.\" If Christianity is true, spiritual healthiness is an extremely important part of the human experience. God knows far more about what is physically, psychologically, and spiritually healthy than anyone. \n\nOriginal Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU-zJCvhz4I\n\nArticles:\nPsychology Today Article: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hero/201603/is-porn-good-us-or-bad-us\nArticle from The Journal of Sex Research: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2013.772088\nArticle from The Open Journal of Preventative Medicine: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269795335_Sexually_Risky_Behavior_in_College-Aged_Students\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio​​​​​\n\nMusic by Joakim Karud youtube.com/joakimkarud​​\n\nSUGGESTED PRAYER FOR THE NON-CHRISTIAN(s) IN THIS VIDEO: \n\"Lord, thank you that I can know that you do love ___(name of the non-Christian in the video)___.

    "description": "Learn the book of Genesis with apologetic concepts in mind. \n\nFrom the speaker: \n\nI AM THE SUM OF MY PARTS . . . \n\nGod has moved in my life through a number of powerful men of God from whom I have benefited greatly. There is nothing new under the sun, as it is said. For that reason, much of what you hear in these lectures is not unique to me. Most of it was likely gleaned from other sources. I want to be transparent about that and share my sources. In terms of biblical scholarship, I have been blessed by the work of Harold Hunter (my father), Craig Keener, David Allen, Malcom Yarnell, Tom Schriner, Johnathan Pritchett (with whom I co-host Trinity Radio), F.F. Bruce, Adam Harwood (with whom I have co-authored), Steve Gregg (with whom I have worked), and Bruce Ware.\n\nAs for Christian apologetics, William Lane Craig (with whom I have lectured), Michael Licona (a personal friend), Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, J.P. Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Matt Slick, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavor than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.",

    "description": "When Jesus was confronted by the temptations of the devil, he responded with scripture. I do not believe I would deny Christ for worldly gain or the influences of my family or friends. I certainly hope I wouldn't. However, if I ever did it would only speak to my weakness. It would not speak to the truth or beauty of the gospel. As I've said many times, my faith is falsifiable in principle, and if one were to falsify it, I would be forced by integrity to accept that. Yet, breaking my loyalty to Christ will never come, I pray, because of the influences described by Doug. Further, since I have examined the criticisms of my faith and found them insufficient, I confidently add that I cannot imagine ever rejecting my Savior. \n\nTrinity Radio Extra (Our 2nd Channel): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKB...\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio\n\nSUGGESTED PRAYER FOR THE NON-CHRISTIAN(s) IN THIS VIDEO: \n\"Lord, thank you that I can know that you do love ___(name of the non-Christian in the video)___.

We took issue with her explanation of what she thinks a person who makes such comparisons might say. We responded to that. She makes clear in the original video that she doesn’t use that approach, and sees merit in what we’re saying, but then provides what she imagines one might say to the challenge. We were responding to THAT. Johnathan, who had not seen the entire original video said she was wrong. There are certainly problems with the justification she imagines some atheists might make, but that doesn’t mean SHE is wrong. We apologize if, in any way her position was unclear, and encourage viewers to watch her response video linked in the description. \n\nFULL PLAYLIST FOR THIS SERIES: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXLW9kZ8YS70dlCCr2Y1bdEigB8Mz2jwu\n\n10 Questions for Atheists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1SDYPaUNiY\n\nShannon Q: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8LHh1whgWY\nCrusade Against Ignorance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkAWM6mq_EE\nAnswers in Reason: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPzbi2ajl4Y&feature=youtu.be\nInstrumental Reason: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmEQ88-tMBU\n\nTrinity Radio Extra (Our 2nd Channel): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKB...\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio\n\nMusic by Joakim Karud youtube.com/joakimkarud",

    "description": "Jordan Peterson is just beginning to make his way back into the public eye after a long period of severe health problems, and I recently read his book \"12 Rules for Life.\" I’ve watched much of his series on the psychological value of the Bible, and have ingested most of his debates. Many Christians don’t quite know how to feel about Peterson. He’s clearly friendly to the faith, much like Benjamin Franklin was, but hesitates at important moments. Principally he has often said he doesn’t like the question of whether he believes in God. This has frustrated many listeners. In this video, we’re going to take a look at some of his comments about belief in God, and analyze some problematic perspectives he holds that get echoed in the church. We’ll also see one valuable benefit Peterson has to offer. \n\nOriginal Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L47oJxwp6yg\n\nTrinity Radio Extra (Our 2nd Channel): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoKB...\n\nLearn Casually: TrinityRadio.org\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/TrinityRadio",

    "description": "Learn the book of Genesis with apologetic concepts in mind. \n\nFrom the speaker: \n\nI AM THE SUM OF MY PARTS . . . \n\nGod has moved in my life through a number of powerful men of God from whom I have benefited greatly. There is nothing new under the sun, as it is said. For that reason, much of what you hear in these lectures is not unique to me. Most of it was likely gleaned from other sources. I want to be transparent about that and share my sources. In terms of biblical scholarship, I have been blessed by the work of Harold Hunter (my father), Craig Keener, David Allen, Malcom Yarnell, Tom Schriner, Johnathan Pritchett (with whom I co-host Trinity Radio), F.F. Bruce, Adam Harwood (with whom I have co-authored), Steve Gregg (with whom I have worked), and Bruce Ware.\n\nAs for Christian apologetics, William Lane Craig (with whom I have lectured), Michael Licona (a personal friend), Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, J.P. Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Matt Slick, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavor than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.",

If quantity matters, shouldn't the most popular team always win the Super Bowl? If quality matters, why do people you love sometimes die no matter what you do? \n\nIs it possible that your prayers have no supernatural effect and only serve to make you feel better?\n\nWould you ever admit it if that were true?\n\nIs there anything in your life that makes you doubt God's existence? \n\nHow would your life change if you had serious doubts about God's existence?\n\nWas Jesus white?\n\nWhy does God seem more likely to answer the prayers of a talented athlete than a starving child overseas?\n\nWhy does God Seem to hate Africa?\n\nIf a group of Africans swooped in to your community with the intention of converting you and your neighbors to their tribal faith, what would your reaction be?\n\nDoes God speak to you? \n\nIf God spoke to you and told you to kill someone, would you do it?\n\nIs God always watching you? How about when you're on the toilet?\n\nHow do you respond when someone who's not a Christian tells you about their religious faith? Do you listen and consider what they have to say or do you just ignore them because they don't believe what you believe?\n\nWhat do you make of Muslims who think the Koran is the true holy book?

    "description": "At the recent Rethinking Hell conference, Johnathan Pritchett delivered a presentation titled, \"Hell, the Gospel, and Sitting on the Fence\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg7AePz-AP4). Shortly after his presentation was published, YouTube atheist PineCreek published a nearly two-hour review of Pritchett's presentation titled, \"Hell is for Christians... not for Unbelievers\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTxSgAEVZ6g).\n\nIn this episode of Trinity Radio, Pritchett is joined by Chris Date from Rethinking Hell to respond to some of PineCreek's comments. Among other things, they discuss the relevance of the topic of hell to non-Christians, the reason for treating some doctrines as definitional of Christianity and others as secondary and negotiable, and why hell is by no means the only reason for believing in Christ.\n\nIn his presentation, Pritchett explained why he's comfortable remaining undecided between the following two Christian views of hell:\n\nTraditional view - Those who do not trust in Christ for salvation will live in hell forever, in immortal resurrection bodies, in some sort of torment.\n\nConditional immortality (Chris Date's view) - Those who do not trust in Christ for salvation will be raised, judged, and executed (capital punishment), never to live or experience anything ever again.\n\nLearn Formally: TrinitySem.edu\n\nMusic by: Amoeba Crew\nhttps://soundcloud.com/amoebacrew",

However, it's common for skeptics to point out that it doesn't mention God, and so it can't be an argument for God. Stephen Woodford's (Rationality Rules) video which claims to debunk the Kalam cosmological argument has been passed around in the atheist community quite a bit. Capturing Christianity's Cameron Bertuzzi responded, and Woodford wasted little time in firing back. In this video we'll take a look at Rationality Rules' dominant defense of his video, and answer the question: should apologists ditch the Kalam since it doesn't mention God?\n\nOriginal Debunking Vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EVGkl7lj_4\n\nCameron's Response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyu2KsLWreA\n\nStephen's Response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4GmgZBuEMU\n\nMusic (Listed as prescribed by the creator): \n\nJoakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud",

This cause much unnecessary confusion and contention.\n\nOn July 18th, an email with all parties copied, Sonny said, \"Hey Leighton, The best way to summarize our position would be to review the 1689 London Baptist Confession or the Westminster Confession of Faith (See Free will).\"  And even after Leighton literally copied and pasted chapter 9 (the one on Free Will) into the email and asking specifically what they affirmed, Sonny wrote back to all parties (including Theodore), \"Leighton, what you see in the confession is what we affirm...\"  Leighton put up a live video on the Soteriology 101 facebook page showing all these emails for his followers to read for themselves. \n\nThings also became unnecessarily heated when Theodore called his opponents \"brothers\" and then retracted that statement saying they were merely \"opponents\" and that he wasn't sure they were actual \"brothers\" due to their view of grace.",

Moreland, William Dembski, Michael J. Murray, James White, Matt Slick, Alvin Plantinga, and a host of others have impacted my thinking.\n\nBecause I have been so impressed with the structure, organization, and delivery of his own audio commentary, I personally made request to Steve Gregg (who has served as a visiting professor for Trinity) that I might follow his model. In fact, he was delighted with the idea that I might largely follow his teaching outline.\n\nWhy then, with so much great scholarship already available, would I want to add my voice? There are three reasons. First, I can imagine no more worthy endeavor than to study and proclaim the truths of scripture. Second, though I admire greatly the men listed above, I do not agree with any of them on all things. Third, God has blessed me with a humble audience that does not listen to these other voices.\n\nI hope that you will benefit from this passing on of knowledge.",

    "description": "God is the best explanation for the fine-tuning of the universe for life. Lots of people are familiar with what are commonly called \"design arguments.\" A more technical term is teleological arguments. Teleological arguments seek to demonstrate that the complexity of the universe strongly implicates the existence of a designer. The term teleological comes from the Greek word, telos which means “ends” or “purpose.” What are commonly thought of as design arguments can formally be referred to as teleological arguments because the intent is to show that there is a purpose or end (goal) in the furniture of the universe. As is the case with the cosmological argument, properly articulated teleological arguments are considered to be among the most convincing cases that can be set forth in favor of theism.\n\nIn this short video, I'll lay out one such argument Christian apologists use to demonstrate God's existence. \n\nLearn more at Trinitysem.edu and BraxtonHunter.com\n\nMusic (Listed as prescribed by the creator): \n\nJoakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud",

    "description": "I'm often asked what I think is the best argument for the beginning of the universe. It's a personal preference, I guess, but I like to start with the idea that God is the best explanation for the beginning of the universe. God is the CAUSE! \n\nIn apologetics circles, this is known as a cosmological argument. In this video we'll look at the kalam cosmological argument. This video is not intended to deal with all the specific objections. That will be covered in a later video. Nevertheless, beginners trying to understand what Christian philosophers (like William Lane Craig) are talking about when they use this argument, might find this summation helpful. \n\nLearn more at Trinitysem.edu and BraxtonHunter.com\n\nMusic (Listed as prescribed by the creator): \n\nJoakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud",
