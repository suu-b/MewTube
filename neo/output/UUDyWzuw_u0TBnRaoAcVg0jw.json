    "title": "Contradictions, Context,... and a Quiz Show",
    "description": "Yes. It's 2025, and this is an upload from NonStampCollector. It's the latest in my ongoing series of non-comebacks. I've been making non-comebacks now for far longer than I ever made videos consistently.\n\nI've produced this video to mark the fifteen-year anniversary of my most-popular video, \"Quiz Show: Bible Contradictions\". Fifteen years. (Repeat that to yourself in Morgan Freeman's Shawshank voice. I do. \"Fif-teen yeeears.\")\n\nAt this point I used to post social links etc.\nTwitter: I fucked that off years ago. Ugh. \nBluesky : @nonstampcollector but I never go there.\nI closed my BuyMeACoffee page.\nWebsite: but I don't think I've updated it for about a hundred years so don't bother.\nI've still got Pay Tree On : /c/nonstampcollector , and those kind folk are supporting this video. First time in three years. Thanks, friends.\n\nAll images in this video are copyright-free, taken almost entirely from Wikimedia Commons. The space images, and the more ‘modern’ images, are from Pixabay, Unsplash, Pexels, and such sites that require no attribution.\n\nThe drawing sequence towards the end is me drawing on the iPad, using an app called SketchClub (which must surely be the most underrated illustrating app on the App Store).\n\nI do not have a list of sources which would neatly lay out the authors and their works from which I draw these ideas, questions, conclusions, and ponderings. This script is the product of almost two decades of listening to debates, presentations, course lectures, interviews, etc from world-leading scholars in the field, as well as obviously reading their articles and books. Others of my videos include extensive defensive citations and footnotes, but having considered going to the trouble, I decided not to in this case as it would really only constitute quote-mining. This one isn't the result of any direct research carried out for the sake of a video, it's an organization and an expression of years and years worth of congealed knowledge, which I've gone over and over, and tested and refined in thousands of comment threads. Some sections of my script here are actually drawn from comment responses which, in some cases, I have actually saved as keyboard shortcuts and used hundreds of times over the years, so they might seem familiar to anyone who's ever read through my comment replies or heard one of the few \"Shorts\" I made last year.\n\nI obviously invite anyone to test my ideas by looking into scholarship into this fascinating and liberating field of study. Start with Ehrmann's \"Misquoting Jesus\" and test THAT against as much of the literature he cites in the bibliography as you can get your hands on. My other go-to authors are Dale Martin, James Tabor, and Robin Faith Walsh.",

    "description": "This comes about in response to being told, hundreds and hundreds of times over the years, that my having once been a believer, and then reading and learning enough to have become a non-believer, but then NOT going back to being a believer again when confronted with familiar, shitty, long-ago-debunked arguments for Christianity, indicates conclusively that I am CLOSED-MINDED. Sound familiar? Changed my mind on something huge, definitive, and life-changing, and not going back? \"CLOSED-MINDED!!\"\n\nRead on:\n———————————————\nWebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\nBluesky: @nonstampcollector (I basically quit Twitter/X.)\nPATREON: http://www.patreon.com/nonstampcollector\nDon't Buy Me a Coffee: despite the inclusion at the tail-end of this video, I decline all coffee now. I deleted my account at that site, so that link won't get you anywhere. I wasn't exactly drowning in coffees. Appreciation, though, to those who did buy me a coffee at any stage.\n\nAD: Hell isn't real, but hard drive crashes and computer thefts are.

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nI, like millions of others, was open-minded enough to have thought my way OUT of Christianity. Those who would criticise someone like me as being \"closed-minded\" aren't really getting what it means to truly look at ‘both sides’ fairly, as they so often insist that I should. Looking at both sides was what got me out of faith. I know I’m not alone in having the label \"closed-minded\" applied to me for having looked carefully at arguments that went against everything I wanted to believe, so much so that I had no choice but to relinquish the worldview I defined myself within, and enter a world that seemed utterly bereft of any stability or familiarity. Yeah, real \"closed\". \n\nAn earlier version of the script for this video included the famous quote about a mind, having been stretched by a new idea, being unable to return to its original dimensions. Once you've gone past ascribing godly infallibility to the bible texts, for example, and instead seen them for the purely human, flawed, mistaken, and naturally imperfect documents that they are, one can't simply go back to pretending that those tell-tale signs of their lowly origin are not really there.\n\nI’m hoping that this character (on the left) can be equally as infuriating as the guy I had interviewing Dr. Finch in my 2010 “Special Investigation: Evolution” video. (Remember him? \"Not even ONE!\") That guy PISSES PEOPLE OFF!\n\nWell I’m not sure that this was worth the wait or not, but it’s what I’ve got. I hope it meets with general approval. It's one for the choir, I know. Well, the choir has been very good to me.\n\nVERY SPECIAL THANKS to my most outrageously-generous supporters on Patreon:\nAnthony Guthrie\nJosh\nScience rocks\nNot to diminish, of course, the very very kind and generous support of many others, also. I truly appreciate that you'd want to help me get these things out.\n\n\nSwooshy sounds: CC2 from freesound.org, attribution to user RHumphries\nJail door sound: CC0 from freesound.org, user TurtleLG\nCoffee cup image: CC0 from Pixabay user Foundry.

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nMusic produced by me on iPad app Launchpad.\nArt created by me on iPad app SketchClub.\n\nMost of my research for this came from four main sources. They are:\nEhrman, Bart. (2005) Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. (Harper One)\nEhrman, Bart. (2005) Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew (Oxford University Press)\nMartin, Dale. (2012) New Testament History and Literature. (Yale University Press)\nTabor, James. (2012) Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity (Simon and Schuster)\n\nIt’s been several years in the writing, but with months and months going past between edits. I gave it a push last summer and again over Christmas. I discovered that I could go on forever adding and polishing, but I bit the bullet and ran with what you see here. I wish I was smart enough to insert, coherently, more of the incredible scholarly information that inspired this idea.\nThe characters here are a conglomerate representative of the authors of mainly Mark and Luke, but also to some extent Matthew. In the early stages of writing I was veering much more towards including more Matthew’s additions and edits, but only a few are still in there. I didn’t really look at John’s gospel for this.\n\nThis is a video made for Youtube in my non-abundant free time, not a doctoral dissertation. It is a work of informed satire, based on extensive reading, but nit-pickers will find nits throughout it to pick, so I want to address one of them from the outset. I am confident that the actual salient points and questions that the video raises are rock solid. One must distinguish between what is included for the sake of fashioning a coherent plot/script, including hyperbole, and the scholarly historical information the satire is founded upon. If you dispute the scholarship, take it up with the scholars, and if you can convince them, please do then bring it to me.\nFor example - to pre-empt the what I predict is the most obvious surface-level objection: I know who the author of Luke is purported to be, generally, and the purpose for his writing his gospel given at its beginning (and in the beginning of Acts). I’m not attempting to assert a fact claim along the lines of that the author of Luke was simply a random rogue copyist of Mark. That’s just a plot device, like satirists often use. I don’t for a second think that the gospel of Luke arose out of a copyist’s desire to simply alter bits and pieces of the text of Mark. What I’m attempting to portray, satirically, is the dissonance between what historians can tell us about the way the gospels were authored, copied, miscopied, and deliberately changed by individuals that we of course can’t know or identify, and the view held by many modern Christians: that each and every verse of each and every gospel is actual historical truth. Far from it: we can identify the agenda and motivations behind obviously deliberate changes that have for thousands of years been passed off as unquestionably true.\n\nFootnotes and quotes are available at http://www.nonstampcollector.com/blog/footnotes-for-the-gospel-of-luke-the-alternative-facts-gospel",

Insert the bible into a world where the goal is to cause the maximum misery and suffering to one another, and it fits right in: and the debate sounds almost exactly the same; just... upside down. \n\n___________________________\n\nThank you, Patreon patrons.

(https://www.youtube.com/user/43alley)\nThis is very much HIS video, and I can't recommend highly enough that you all go and sub to his channel and work your way through his back catalogue of great, hilarious, original & creative videos.\n\nI suggested this project to Alley a year ago, and have, since then, consistently been the world's worst collaboration partner. If I'd known how start/stop my year was going to be, I would never have put him through the bother! 2014 was a terribly, terribly busy for me, in terms of work and, of course, family. (Thanks to those who have asked how my boy is, by the way. He's doing wonderfully well, now almost 18 months old.)\n\nMy hat goes off to 43alley, I've always loved his videos, and I thank and admire him for his supreme efforts on this one. \nGO AND SUB TO HIM AND WATCH HIS BACK CATALOGUE!!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/43alley\n\nSO, what is this video? Well, it's a re-make of a poem I wrote back in 2009. The original video was longer, and full of naughty words like shit, fuck, fucking, god-damned, many more fucks, and a bunch more fuckings. I kind of got swayed by the argument that that did in some way limit that audience and watchability by those that I'd most like to see it. That AND a bunch of copyright-dubious images, which I don't like having up there nowadays. That video had 70,000 views as I typed this up (after 6 years), so it wasn't really going anywhere, and to be honest, and if I may be so bold, I thought it deserved better! I'd long wanted to re-make it.\nEarly last year 43alley made a video called \"Patton Oswalt - Sky Cake\" which was a departure from his usual style, but which I found really captivating, and, I thought, great for this Ode. Foolishly, he agreed to collaborate on this, and worked his ass off drawing pics, animating, designing sections, and incorporating new pictures from me as I had time to make them (rarely). We bounced ideas off of each other, but he did SO much more than I'd imagined and would ever have asked of him.\nGO AND SUB TO HIM AND WATCH HIS BACK CATALOGUE!!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/43alley\n\n**************************************************\n———————————————\nWebsite and blog: never updated, but http://www.nonstampcollector.com\nBluesky: @nonstampcollector (I basically quit Twitter/X.)\nPATREON: http://www.patreon.com/nonstampcollector\nAD: Hell isn't real, but hard drive crashes and computer thefts are.

What? And guess who screwed it up?\n\nIt suddenly occurred to me a few months back: the 40+ years-later accounts we have of the morning of Jesus's resurrection sound exactly like the way things would have played out if Jesus had wanted NOBODY to know about it. Curious. Why would THAT be? But then when you think about the insane theology behind it - it's actually no wonder. I think I know what happened. Here's my theory.\n___________________________\n\nAt times in the past few weeks, especially the last two weekends, I've actually sympathized with those who ask me why the hell I would spend so much time and energy on doing something like this. This video, especially the pictures, was a bloody marathon.There are lots of reasons for doing it all, though, and somewhere amongst them are things like simply the pleasure of creating something as close to as I'd imagined it as possible. Another has to do with simply the fact that this stuff is important to me- this insane religion really can control people's lives, and I find meaning in sharing the good news: it's a bunch of crazy bullshit that you are free to relieve yourself of at any time. \nI'm thinking of this as a \"concept-piece\". It was quite fun and challenging to write and turn into a coherent narrative. It ended up longer than I'd wanted, and I may have bitten off too much to chew through, with all the \"But you don't have a basis for objective morality\" stuff,... but whatever. I just wanted to bring the idea to fruition. Doing so has reminded me of how much I enjoy it, but also of what an incredibly time-consuming pursuit it can be. Wow, I'm spent. See you again in 2015. No- 16.\n\n______________________________\n\nWhoops: at 1:31 I invented a new book of the bible called 12 John.

This line of argument is so prevalent that I'm confused as to whether its proponents actually believe it or not; but either way, this video is my attempt to inject a bit of reality into this very important area of discussion.\nThe god of the bible mandated oppressive life-long slavery of foreigners - pretty much a concise description of one of the worst forms of human rights abuses the world has ever had to grapple with. It's as simple as that.\nNo, I don't hate God for mandating slavery, and no I don't believe that God is evil for mandating slavery. I don't believe that THIS god, the absurd god of the bible, is even extant, let alone worthy of any adjectives beyond that! This god's inhumane and ridiculously cruel commands say nothing about the god that they are ascribed to, simply because they are so obviously ascribed to a god by the men in whose image this god was made. \nDeal with it folks; your god is the brainchild of some particularly awful humans. The bible simply and clearly gets this very easy human rights question utterly wrong.\nAbandon it, and keep looking for answers.

That is, unless you think that He's loving, kind, perfectly fair and perfectly just, - in which case He's that. Never mind what He's apparently told us about Himself.\nThis is actually a re-make of one of my first videos, from 2008. The original video had, at the end, footage of an actual stoning that had taken place somewhere in the Islamic world, taken on a camera phone. The video was banned and taken down in 2009, and I didn't dispute the ban.\nI could never get around to drawing a stoning scene that I thought would have the same impact. A few months back I came up with the idea of seeing if people would like to draw cartoon pictures of a stoning that I could include in this remake. I made a quick video calling for submissions, and you can see the results here. \nI'm so happy that my request was met with such wonderful replies. \nThank you to all those who responded - there were many more than I could include, time-wise, in the video itself. \n\nWritten, performed, drawn, etc, by me.\nMusic written and performed by me via GarageBand on the iPad and the Mac.\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---\n\nChristian believers, you have a choice: either defend the story of this man's being killed by having an angry mob of barbarians pelt him with rocks as being the holy justice mandated by a fair and just god of perfect love,...\nor join the rest of the world in rejecting any deity's involvement in the story as a piece of insane fiction dreamt up by savage people hoping to convince somebody that their barbaric cruelty was mandated by a holy and unquestionable moral authority. It wasn't: it was fucking sick, AND YOU KNOW IT. \nThe bible is bullshit. Look elsewhere for perfect love.\n\nIsn't it funny, that if you took a random sampling of people from around the world, it would most likely be the CHRISTIANS amongst them, not the atheists, that would voice any disagreement with a statement declaring that stoning is, and always was, a monumentally unnecessarily cruel and inhumane form of punishment. As an atheist, I can say outright that it's a sick and disgusting method of execution- and the standard Christian response to that would NOT be to say that they agree with me, because that would condemn their god. Rather, the response I usually get is for them to say that since I don't believe in their god, that I don't have a moral framework upon which to base such a statement. \nWell - if the only option is a moral framework that declares stoning anything other than fucking barbaric, then I'm happier with the one that I have (or don't have)!!! \n\nIf you are convinced that there must be a god - a source of love and life and joy and morality and hope - then keep looking. Yahweh is about the worst candidate for that job that there could possibly be. Read the bible for more proof of that.\n\nFUCK: I can't believe I used the first person singular subject pronoun as an object pronoun.\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

What an embarrassment. In fact, practically any human being who has ever been born and survived to the age of 8 or so could come up with a better and more ethical set of instructions on how to behave and run a society than the bible. It would not have ownership of PEOPLE as part of its core tenets.\n\nWhy did humanity have to wait thousands of years for the Emancipation Declaration? Couldn't Yahweh have delivered it himself?

Well, it's obvious why - Christianity and its god is nonsense. There could be no clearer sign that Christianity is a man-made bunch of bollocks, than to look at its claims on objective morality. All these special pleadings about context and new vs old covenants are the dying gasps of a belief system that before long won't have anyone even TRYING to make it make sense. You'd be better off trying to argue that Joseph Fritzl is the greatest father that the world has ever known (within a certain context).\n\nLook elsewhere for an objective moral law giver, other than Christianity, for the god that you are convinced must exist. It can't hurt - and the bible has caused enough problems on this planet, with its contradictory and wicked claims and commands. Don't support, or give cover, to those who want us to base our modern societies around that absurd mess of a book. Be honest with yourself, and reject it, as people do who take a real, open, honest look at what it says. It isn't divine, it is appallingly man-made. Man-made as in MALE-made, too, quite obviously.\n\nThe graphics in this are taken from around the web, I don't claim copyright on any of them and this video is not being used by me to collect any revenue, and is being posted under a Creative Commons license.\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

I had a very, very hard time cutting this down, and in the end, had to split it up anyway, because youtube viewers simply don't click on much above about 4 minutes, let alone 16, which is about what this has ended up as.\n***I'm getting requests to hear the first take: it's gone. Chucked it out weeks ago. Listening back to it, it was flabby and slow. What you're hearing here is most of those ideas, whipped into shape, turned into one-liners rather than passages, and a few long lists of animals had to be dropped. I really wish I could have included the list of 40 or so Australian animals, but it was just too much of a halt on proceedings.\n\nThe SCRIPT of this video is at:\nhttp://www.nonstampcollector.com/scripts\n\nResearch on animal behaviors and numbers of species was not carried out in accordance with the strictest of academic standards, I freely admit. I went all over the net following leads on interesting animal facts FAR too much to ever keep records of where I'd been, and where I got each \"fact\" from. There's probably a few minor numerical and mathematical errors in here, but I am not making any claim to inerrancy so I hope you'll forgive me.\nNoah's long rant at the end came mainly from various articles on Wikipedia.\n\nMade entirely with Paintbrush, Audacity, and iMovie (since I'm always being asked).\n\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---\n\n\nA few mistakes:\n\nI said the references to unicorns are made in Numbers 22 and 24. It is actually 23 and 24. In fact, it's Numbers 23:22, I got my numbers muddled. (and 24:8). \n\nI called it \"AnswersInGensis.com\" when it's actually .org. However, .com will redirect you to the .org url, so let's just assume that back in 4000BC, they didn't have .org urls. \n\nHyenas aren't dogs, rabbits and ferrets aren't rodents. Who knew? Well, I certainly found out when the Pharyngula crowd started commenting!\n\nIn the script, I have Noah say that Answers in Genesis is claiming that bringing only 16,000 pairs of animals will be enough. Actually, the AiG claim is somewhat ambiguous, as it could be taken to mean only 16,000 animals, not pairs of animals. I've decided to go the generous route, in citing them as claiming 16,000 pairs, rather than 8,000 pairs. If an AiG-inclined person would like to dispute my interpretation of this, and insist that AiG is claiming that 8,000 pairs were enough, they're welcome to do so.\n\n\nFOOTNOTE #1\nOne of the references to do with the impossible amounts of water that would be required for such a world-wide flood:\nhttp://www.epicidiot.com/evo_cre/noahs_flood.htm\n\nFOOTNOTE #2\nhttp://www.creationtips.com/floodmount.html\n\nFOOTNOTE #3\nAs much as 12 U.S. tons (11 m. tons) of animal waste may have been produced daily.

Sure, taken on its own, 1 Cor 13:4-7 is very nice, but not as nice as other descriptions of love that human beings have come up with. And anyway - would you take advice about love from someone whose biography revealed them to be an appallingly UNLOVING character in the first place?\nThe bible demolishes itself as a useful source for anything, other than an anthropological study in the history of metaphysical wonderings, superstition, ignorance, and delusion. When you read the words on the pages of the bible, what you actually see is horror, fear, violence, anger, rage, jealousy (fuck it, I think jealousy is a pretty low emotion/characteristic), pettiness, death, fear, - the very worst of human nature. \n\nJust because there are a couple of nice sentences scattered throughout it to doesn't make up for the bulk of it being so revolting. \n\nIt's not as if nobody has ever come up with a better description of love than St. Paul. Anyone could. Many have. Let's leave the bible in the dustbox of history.\n\nA few weak points in this video? Yeah, probably. eg, the fine line between envy and jealousy, whether or not god condones smashing babies to pieces on rocks. They're certainly worth bringing up, and it's not as if the bible isn't already an impossibly mistranslated, confused self-contradictory document. I'm not claiming my video is infallible, just making a point. And anyway - smearing shit on people's faces? WTF? Deuteronomy 28? WWWTTTFFFFFFF???\nOnce again, let me assure my critics that I know christian doctrine rather well, and that I've read the counter arguments, for eg this one regarding whether or not God keeps a record of wrongs:\nhttp://www.gracecentered.com/does_God_keep_records.htm\nI know you can point to all sorts of examples of God being nice - but that's kind of the point, isn't it. There are examples of niceness, and also of the worst and most appalling cruelty. I'll happily admit the former, I have nothing to lose from it. Just please admit the latter, without making shit up out of thin air about how those traits of this god are less important. The old testament is fucking BRIMMING with them. God must have been very deliberate in seeing to it that those elements of his character were recorded and preserved in such VOLUME!\n\n\nAnd yes, that's my clunky organ playing.\n\nSorry to those who very kindly and generously volunteer to translate and subtitle these into other languages - it's really not going to work with this one, I guess, given that there's text already all over the page.\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

But given what he said on the subject throughout his whole life, I'd find that position pretty hard to defend. And what it had to do with his evil acts... well you get the idea of what I think of that argument.\n\nAstute viewers will notice that throughout the movie I don't blame Hitler's actions upon his being a Christian. Indeed -- was he a Christian?! Some may differ with me on this, but I say No, he wasn't. Not in any practical sense of the label. \nSaying his evil actions are linked to his status as a Christian either way would be as stupid as saying that they are linked to his moustache, or his atheism.\nIndeed -- that's the point. Atheist or theist, Christian or Hindu, Catholic or Lutheran: none of it matters. HE WAS A NAZI: ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? \nHe was a frigging NAZI, with incredible political power that he'd achieved through shrewd statecraft over many years. Obviously THAT is the lethal combination. Not his moustache, not his vegetarianism, not his atheism/religion.\nAs close as I could come to linking religion with his actions was actually a portion of the script that didn't make it to the final cut, in which a description of totalitarianism is read out, the contestants are asked to identify what is being described, and it plays out that after all, totalitarianism and religion sound an awful lot like each other. \nInitially I had intended to put the laugh segment last, but was afraid that the other sections might be too slow and boring to sit through, and people might leave before seeing all those fantastic quotes of Hitler talking about his love of the Creator etc. So -- if you think the vid goes downhill a bit after that, I kind of agree. It's just the best format I could come up with, and I tried them all, I think!\n\nGreat thanks to those who responded to my call for voice extras to carry out quite a task: recording themselves laughing their heads off for a full minute. \n\nTo the others featured in the ads (anyone who'd put themselves in front of a camera and declare that Hitler acted out of atheism deserves to be ridiculed. The ad breaks are my contribution to that ridicule.) : if you DMCA me for including your clips, despite their certainly coming under FAIR USE for criticism; I'll put the video file on mediafire and it will be mirrored on hundreds of channels within a few hours.

Just amazing tunnel vision -- Yahweh/Jesus is responsible for all the good, but absolutely NONE of the bad -- and there was a hell of a lot of bad in that guy's story; the pilot actually DIED, and they very nearly all met their doom. The guy who landed the plane was an experienced pilot too - (MIRACLE!) and the air traffic control helped out - but it was FAITH that got them through! With a dead frigging pilot in the plane! THAT, of course, had nothing to do with Jesus. \nIt's hard for me to remember when I had such a ridiculous world view, but I know I did once!\n\nThis video provided me with an opportunity to discuss the whole thing about the lack of thought that is SO EVIDENT in theists who think that if there is a god, (which they view as a necessity for there being anything in existence), then it must automatically be THEIR god. Or even that it must be a god that has rules and ethical standards (let alone standards of what to make your clothes out of or whether to keep your foreskin). \nI'm a pretty weak atheist in this regard -- I'd be pretty easily convinced that there must be some kind of starting force or originator -- (don't quote-mine me -- I haven't said that I believe any such thing). I certainly don't rule it out, but I haven't really come across any evidence to give me any idea of even the most basic characteristics of that \"force\", if it exists. But by no means does such an acceptance (or vague feeling) necessitate believing anything at ALL about the character of the creative force. There could be a creative force that we know absolutely NOTHING about! Why do people automatically assume that the character is knowable? Just because it says so in a ridiculous old book? Maybe the creative force is US!! Perhaps this life is what it's like when gods get drunk! Ever thought that? Or maybe it's fucking Yahweh! WE DON'T KNOW! None of the \"evidence\" presented up til now has been any good for ascertaining ANYTHING like a factual understanding of the situation.

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nThis debate has to change. Theists - when all of your arguments have been debunked, and you keep spouting them anyway, congratulations - you're not convincing anyone except the credulous and weak minded. Are you proud of that?\n\nI've often thought of opening up a second channel on youtube, on which I could engage in some debates with other users, but every time I ponder the idea I realise that 90% of the time I'd just be bringing people up to speed on what has already been answered a million times in the past. Screw that.\n\nThe way I see it, this debate ended a few decades ago. Everything that had been brought to the table then is what we're still seeing being brought to the table now. What we \"new\" or \"affirmative\" atheists are doing is trying to knock some nails into the coffin so that this whole thing can be put to rest in what Sam Harris so eloquently calls \"the vast graveyard of mythology\". \n\nTheists - you simply must educate yourself before you go opening your mouth about all these tired old topics. Evolution. 20th century killers. The U.S. constitution. Atheism and atheists, and what it actually is that they DON'T believe. When you spout them- you get knocked down by the sheer force of facts. When you spout them and then get corrected and shown convincingly that your argument is in fact false, --- and then spout them again - I'm lost for words. Where is the virtue in that? Where? How can you be proud of that? How can you support others whom you see doing that?\n\nI just simply, truly, and sincerely don't understand why christian theists aren't red with embarrassment that in these debates, their side so constantly and obviously relies on misinformation, falsehood and ignorance. How many times does one need to be told that 2 + 2 = 4 before they will stop insisting that it = 7?\n I. Just. Do. Not. Understand. This. Situation.\n\nWhy. WHY!?!?!? \n\nOf course not all christians are like this. And not even all of the christians who engage in debate are like this. To those sensible christians, I have this to say: \nWhy not join us in criticizing intellectual dishonesty like this even when it comes from your side? People who knowingly proclaim falsehoods from the podium (or pulpit) are not doing your side any favors in regards to spreading your message or enhancing your side's credibility (which is, you might have noticed, in crisis). People who do it are a liability to you. \nOne commenter suggested that I should have revealed at the end of the video that the moderator was in fact a christian, concerned with honesty and veracity. I wish I had included that. It would have made the video a hundred times better, but alas - 'tis too late.\n\n'Tis not too late for you, though. Please join us, for everyone's sake, in insisting that debates like this come to be characterized by honesty and intellectual integrity. In what other field of human endeavor or discourse does willful ignorance take center stage so consistently?\n\n\nAnd for fuck's sake, right-wing lunatics - get over this paranoia about socialism. And perhaps educate yourself even slightly about what socialism is and means. If you do, you might find that it has not very much at all to do with Democrats and Barack Obama - - - certainly not as much to do with THEM as it has to do with Jesus Christ. \nRight-wing paranoia over socialism is an insult to the memory of the people who died in actual socialist societies due to actual socialist policies.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nPositive vibes for the mighty Christopher Hitchens, who this week announced that he has esophageal cancer. \nWe need your esophagus, Mr. Hitchens, and the rest of you, so good luck with the chemotherapy (what can one say?) and get well soon. \n\n\nSome people have already kindly pointed out that this is not my best movie to date. No shit, Sherlock. :)\n\nClear skies, everyone. \nNSC",

    "description": "Your explanation for each and every contradiction here must have better explanatory power than \"Well, maybe it just got written down wrong or something.\" (Read on...)\n\n—————\nWebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\nBluesky: @nonstampcollector (I basically quit Twitter/X.)\nPATREON: http://www.patreon.com/nonstampcollector\nAD: I've been using Backblaze online backup for longer than I've been on Youtube. I fear neither hell nor total data loss. Try it here: https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/#af3049 . \nI'm proud to promote it knowing that it will very likely truly save someone's ass someday.\n————\n\nYes. Maybe it got written down wrong. Or copied wrong by some anonymous copyist along the way. Or mistranslated from the original language (Jesus and his followers spoke Aramaic, the New Testament was written in Greek). MAYBE SOMEONE GOT IT WRONG.\n\nWhat is wrong with any of those as explanations for the bible texts being in the shape they're in? Maybe it got written down wrong or something. That explains... ummm let me see,.... EVERYTHING, and requires no leaps of logic, no invented narrative glue, no convoluted excuses, no reliance on mysterious inconceivable underhand moves by an invisible deity who deemed it better to have his central, most important message to his favored species become filled with EVEN apparent errors, conflicts, and contradictions.\n\nHow NOT to respond to this movie:\na) By assuming that I have not looked into these contradictions with any level of depth and accusing me of not having tried to understand any kind of \"deeper meaning\". Wherever possible, I consulted christians' explanations. I've given them a good go. They're just shit.\n\nb) By saying that these aren't errors at all, rather, that they are simply copyist's errors. Uh- derr. A copyist's error is an error. I don't care what kind of error it is, just don't make the claim that the bible is completely free of errors, except for the cases in which there are errors, which are only copyist's errors only, which aren't really errors. \n\nc) If you agree with me that English translations of the bible contain errors, but you think that the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts are pure and therefore true - DON'T tell me this and then go on to criticise me and other skeptics for pointing out that the English translations contain errors! \n\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. That which can be asserted without evidence can be discarded without evidence. \n\nI know, and actually find to have some weight, the New Testament apologists' conundrum - namely that if all of the gospel accounts really did match exactly, then critics of the bible would instantly accuse the authors of having conspired together. So, if there are inconsistencies it counts against the bible, and if there were no inconsistencies, it would still count against the bible.\nWell - tough. The creator of the universe could have done a lot better. The only reasonable conclusion to come to is that the creative force that arranged the constants of the universe, gave birth to galaxy clusters, quantum physics and DNA, invented love, knowledge and truth, and is capable of any miracle he could ever come up with- had fuck all to do with this raggedy old contradictory book of bullshit.\n\nWhenever I make a movie about what the bible says, I'm talking about the actual words that are printed on the pages of the bible. Funny how I always get criticised for doing so, by people who agree that modern translations or English translations are inadequate and erroneous. \n_______\n\nI was very selective when deciding whether to include each contradiction in the script. Many that were listed on the lists and websites appeared to me to be either non-contradictory, easily explained, or simply too petty to really count significantly against the claim of biblical inerrancy. I drew heavily on skepticsannotatedbible.com , which actually has links to christian responses to each of the contradictions it lists, where one has been put forward. I read almost all of them and if the explanation sounded like a bunch of bollocks to me, then I dismissed the explanation and included the contradiction in the script. One of the criteria I used to ascertain whether I thought the explanation was good enough, was whether I thought a christian would accept a similar explanation for a contradiction in any other religions holy book, such as the Qaran or Book of Mormon.\n \nFor example:\nLookingUntoJesus.net has this pathetic explanation for one of the contradictions:\n\n\"The text which is called into question is Luke 2:2. If Jesus was born in the days of Herod (who presumably died in 4 BC), then how could Quirinius be governing Syria (who presumably began his reign in 6 AD)?\nThe trouble is in the English translation of the text, not in the text itself. Keep in mind that the New Testament was written in Greek, not English. Since the translators were not inspired, there is the potential for erroneous translations\".",

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nThe bible is revolting. It is sickening. It is nowhere NEAR as nice a book as what an ethical human could come up with, so why on earth does it have this reputation as having been written by the very author of love itself? It wasn't. It was written by human men - and pretty horrible men by the sounds of things.\n\nAnd why is it that it only ever seems to be the ugly bits of the bible that are ever taken out of context? Why don't we ever hear christians complaining of John 3:16 being taken out of context? \n\nLook, I know it's possible for things to be taken out of context. Creationists do it all the time, and it bugs the hell out of scientists and rationalists. Even I've been quoted out of context. Sure, it's annoying. But no context is large enough to write off some of the horrors of the bible. I mean - is September 11, for example, completely justified by recourse to a larger \"context\"? No, and neither are some of the horrors mentioned in the video.\n\nI had a conversation recently (on youtube) and we talked about stoning. It occurred to me, that as an atheist, I will never, ever be called upon to defend the appalling practice of stoning. However, a christian who believes that their heavenly father mandated stoning, does have some kind of obligation to EXCUSE those who practiced stoning, and to even implicitly, DEFEND the practice, seeing, as it was, Yahweh's favored punishment. \n\nTHIS is what's wrong with christianity. And yes, I know that there is more to it than that. But how warped are your morals, compared to those of an atheist, if the atheist can outright condemn practices such as stoning and burning alive, but you can't, due to your apparent deep personal relationship with the supreme moral law giver of the universe? You know, that supreme moral law giver who said burning people alive was OK? Something is seriously wrong there.\n\nOr, come out and say that the old testament laws were absolutely hideous! Come and join the rest of us. It's far clearer over here. No double-think. Come and live an ethical life based on what you TRULY believe about how best to live among others.\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

Maybe yours.\n——————————————-\n\nIt truly fascinates me to see these desperately bad arguments, so easily debunked and deflected, coming back at us time and time again. I dealt with one of them in a recent video called \"Atheists Secretly Believe in Yahweh\", and this video is a similar thing, about creationism's terrible arguments (if you can call them that).\n\nI know next to nothing about science - really, only what I've learnt by being interested in this debate for the last few years. And what is fascinating for me, is that the anti-science (creationist) side have such amazingly bad arguments. Their arguments are rarely, if ever, any better than utterly wrong. They're either flat out wrong, or make things up, strawman style, and then when their errors are pointed out, - they NEVER admit their mistakes, and seem to go on arguing the same things. It is just too plain to see to be a mistake - it's clear that as long as theyve got a flock of believers to preach it to, they'll keep on going like this, even when they are knowingly lying. \n\nSo this is based on a debate I recently heard between Kent Hovind and a christian who accepted evolution. Hovind just bulldozed his way through, spouting things that EVEN I know are wrong, and that, I have no doubt whatsoever, he has been corrected on time after time after time.\n\nIts also based on P.Z. Myers famous debate against Geoffrey Simmonds (early 2008) - a guy with doctoral qualifications who didnt know the scientific meaning of the word \"theory\", and used it as a pejorative. Quite a few elements of the script came from that exchange (whales, ignorance... etc).\n\nThere are so many \"arguments\" or \"tactics\" that they use repeatedly that I just couldn't squeeze into 11 minutes. \nThis video also came about by me realising how easy it is to get educated about evolution. I cannot recommend Dawkins' The Greatest Show On Earth highly enough. It is full of jaw-dropping information. It is an unbelievable privelige to be alive at a time that allows us to know so much about our universe. If I believed in a god, I'd be thanking it for allowing me to be alive at such an incredible stage in history, where so many mysteries are being, or have been, solved. Only a few hundred years ago - people didnt even know what stars were! Let alone dating rocks with atomic precision. Amazing.\n\nCreationists - get educated before you argue about these things. And when you're corrected, try to learn something. Can you imagine if Dr. Finch here refused to be corrected about Moses or Noah, and spouted the same mistakes the rest of his life, like Hovind is SURE to do once he gets out of prison?\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---\n\nThanks to Waldheri for coming up with the surname of the scientist when I asked for suggestions on Twitter. Charles seemed a reasonable given name to put with it.\n\nI also appealed to AronRa for help with the thing about the monkeys - but Im afraid, Aron, that your explanation went way over my head and I was too embarrassed to ask you to clarify further! I played around with it and am confident it isnt wrong. \n\nThe thing about creationists believing in evolution should a monkey give birth to a human is directly from Coughlan666.\n\"Whales don't live for millions of years\" came from a Skype conversation with BornInAsphodelMeadow.\n\nI had my doubts when I listened back to Dr. Finch's initial clarification about evolution not being about sudden random manifestations of complex things - it was re-worked about 20 times and I\"m still not 100% comfortable with it, but I let it in rather than go for another take.\n\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

Please don't miss my point that much, I'll be depressed that all my work was for nothing. \nI chucked this idea away several times before finally making it, because any video or statement that deals with A.Hhhtlrr and religiosity, usually descends into a futile argument throwing around quotes claiming that he both was, and wasn't a Christian, when the truth is IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL.

There are far too many to put into one video. Not to mention the reasoning behind Yahweh's attitude to things like foreskins and dead goats.\n\nPart of the inspiration came in the form of a book by Rick Warren that I happened to have contact with, called \"A Purpose Driven Life\", in which he teaches that the entire life purpose for every single human is to worship Yahweh. That's apparently why we're here. \nA being who makes something other than himself in order to be worshipped. That's not godly, it's pathetic! It is so small, so petty .... so essentially humanly fragile!! So I sent it up in this movie. Hey - he made the universe in order to house some beings who would worship him - it's not such a stretch to imagine that he might alter a few details of that design in order to get a little bit MORE worship, is it?\n\n\n____________________________\nBest comment so far: from BorgHub \n\"thank you satan for making us horny as hell and having our women bleed out of their vaginas\"",

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nI made this video to remind everyone of what a lovely character the god of the bible is.\nI'm sorry, folks, it is just too easy to pull out verses, chapters, and even books, to show him up as an insane psychopath.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering - yes, I read all of the arguments that claim that Jephthah's daughter wasn't sacrificed at all, whilst I was researching the video.\nSorry, apologists, those arguments just don't hold water. If they did, you'd think at least ONE team of biblical scholars would have come up with a bible translation that suggested as much. None have. Take it up with THEM before you bother with me. And in the meantime - please inform the christians and jews of the world that their bibles are inaccurate after all, if that's what you believe.\n\nIn all my videos, I'm going on what the words on the page of the bible actually say. \n\nMusic:\nStravinsky -   Firebird Suite\nHolst -   The Planets (Venus, and Uranus)\nWagner -   Der Fliegende Hollander, overture.\n\nSound Effects from The Freesound Project (www.freesound.org)\n(No, that wasn't me screaming, nor was I the king who gets stabbed in the guts).\n\nDAMMIT. Typographical errors. I know that the book of the bible is called \"Hebrews\" (as in plural hebrew), but I cited it without the \"s\" in two cases (but correctly in one case). I don't know why. Sorry.\n\nChronology is all over the place, for the sake of a coherent script, and for this I don't apologize. After all, we are told that Yahweh is eternal and doesn't change. \"The grass withers, and the flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever\" (Isaiah 40:8) \"Whatever is good and perfect comes to us from God above, who created all heaven's lights. Unlike them, He never changes or casts shifting shadows\" (James 1:17). \"I, the Lord, do not change.\" (Malachi 3:6)\nSo, I don't care if the events that I mentioned apart from Jephthah's narrative (such as Joshua, and King Menahem) are out of order.\n\nI put words into Yahweh's mouth in the first half, but only  along the following guidelines:\nHe has an intense interest in virgins and virginity. Indeed, the most important thing we are told about Jephthah's daughter is not her age, not her name, not her star sign, not whether she had a high or low IQ, but that she died having never had sexual intercourse. That's what she was:  a virgin - and thats all she was.\n\nI made Yahweh more interested in the sacrifice than the biblical account includes. However, keep in mind that Yahweh acted in Jephthah's favor after he basically offered to make a human sacrifice. The fact that Yahweh accepted this deal, rather than declining to accept on the grounds that it was immoral, is hardly made any worse by having him take an thinly veiled interest in receiving the human sacrifice.\n\nThe presence of servants is assumed, but SOMETHING has to explain Jephthah's obvious surprise and severe disappointment that it was his daughter who came out of his home first. If you'd like to argue that it was wrong of me to invent characters like that, and that the deal was struck with the only possible candidates for the sacrifice having been only a wife and a daughter, then feel free - I don't think it will get you very far.\nSome suggest that he expected an animal to walk out of his house first. Really, c'mon. I gave you the list of the numbers of animals slaughtered by Moses, do you think Yahweh would be satisfied with a single goat wandering out of Jephthahs front door?\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nReferences cited below.\n\nInspiration for this one came from listening to a debate between Christopher Hitchens and Frank Turek, co-author of \"I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist\"\n(Geisler, N and Turek, F. Crossway Books, Wheaton Illinois, 2004).\nTurek's first 20 minutes were very much like the first three of this video  ie, the arguments from cosmology, teleology (the apparent designed nature of the universe), and morality. Some parts of it are direct quotations, other parts are paraphrased, and others I picked up from other theists' videos/writings. To be fair to Turek, he acknowledged that these arguments did NOT lend credibility to the bible on their own, and invited Hitchens to a debate that would deal with the reliability of the bible. I ask, though  if you're going to admit that the cosmological argument doesn't prove what you want to communicate, then why bother using it? Christians arent REALLY interested in making atheists into DEISTS, are they? (That's certainly NOT what they're called upon to do in the bible).\n\nThese cosmological-type arguments are just so broad and general, that it is a MASSIVE LEAP to go from them, to suddenly arguing for a deity whose name you know, whose values you know (on such things as dietary restrictions and opinions about how you should cut your hair, and, of course, opinions about foreskins), and who apparently has called you into a personal relationship with it. A leap SO MASSIVE, in fact, that no Christian would ever accept it from a Muslim, or vice versa, let alone from a Hindu or a devotee of ancient Egyptian gods.\n\nSo this video is not aimed at, or attempting to parody, Frank Turek, but is aimed at those in the youtube Christian community who seem to think that their faith is defended by recourse to the cosmological argument. \nFolks, it is NOT. \nIt never WILL be. \nSee how ridiculous it seems to you when it comes from someone of another faith? In fact, I found a site that uses ALL of the cosmological arguments that are usually used in defending Christianity, being used to \"prove\" the accuracy and truth of the Quran. \nHere it is, see if these arguments convert you to Islam:\nhttp://www.creationofuniverse.com/index.html\n\nThe point of having the atheist remain silent throughout is an attempt to point out two things:\na) that the more theists use these arguments, the more they are simply doing their opponents' work for them, and\nb) that we as atheists (or more correctly as anti-theists, as I consider myself) can simply CONCEDE so many arguments and that are intended to stump us. CONCEDE the point, and show the christian that the argument does NOTHING to help them. NOTHING.\nWhat rocks dream of : NOTHING!!!!\n\n\nSo what explains the incredible numbers and precision at the moments following the big bang? \nI DON'T KNOW! \nBut hey, theist:::: neither do you.\nAnd that's OK.\n\nMaybe it was The Goddess...? Maybe it was Great Spirit...? Maybe it was mass consciousness....?\nMaybe we'll never know....!\n______________________________\n\n\nOther sources of information for this video:\n\nThe Hitchens/Turek debate can be seen on youtube (in pieces) or at: \nhttp://www.vimeo.com/1904911\n\nhttp://www.indiayogi.com/content/indgods/brahma.aspx\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas\nhttp://www.egyptianmyths.net/amon.htm\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun\n\n\nThe quote about he ratio between the gravitational constant and the electromagnetec constant came from:\nhttp://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/atheismintro2.htm   (accessed April 29 , 2009).\nI dont know whether its scientifically accurate  but being as the character is quoting a religious website for religious purposes, I dont mind if the information is inaccurate.\n\nHawking, S.

If the miracles somehow prove that Jesus WAS in fact a god in human form, but all he could be bothered to do was turn water into wine and heal only a few hundred, or even a few thousand people with his magic saliva, then really - what  is the use or good of such a god? Think of what a visiting, omnipotent deity COULD have done - but in this case, apparently, chose not to!!!!!\n\nAnd this is meant to be that god's main advertisement of its existence! Walking on water in front of a few of his mates, for the benefit of billions and billions of people who, if they don't believe in his divinity and surrender control of their souls to him, will be sent to burn in agony for eternity.\n\nPeople - DOES THIS RELIGION MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL?????\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---\n\n**** VIRGIN BIRTHS****\nThere appears to be some disagreement about which of the virgin births I listed are in fact accurate reflections of religious traditions, especially Krishna, Horus and Mithra.\nMy main source for that list was : \"Shaken Creeds: The Virgin Birth Doctrine, a study of its origin\" (2003) by Jocelyn Rhys (Kessinger Publishing). Other sources were \"God is not Great\" (2007) by Christopher Hitchens (Published by Twelve), and Wikipedia.\nI have rechecked these sources in light of the disputes that have come up. I admit to the error of listing Krishna on the basis of the Rhys book- I misread the passage dealing with Krishna. A genuine mistake... However, Hitchens DOES list Krishna as having been recognised as being born of a virgin. \nWhilst I admit to the research error on the matter of Krishna and will take greater care next time, I put it to you that it still stands, that by NO MEANS WHATSOEVER was Jesus' birth to the 'virgin' Mary the first ever such miraculous conception ever recorded in a religious tradition. By the time the Jesus story was first written down, the idea of virgin deity-births was OLD, and had been done many, many times, and an omniscient Yahweh would have known this. Even if 50% of my list was put there in error, the point would still stand. \n*******************\n\nInspiration for this one came from a link I was sent, to a website called Ebon Musings. Check this link. A couple of things on this page stood out as so wonderfully and scathingly accurate, and got me thinking.\nhttp://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/guestessays/religion101.html\n\nI'd like to say here that the first comment which included the word \"evolution\" came only 12 hours after the video was uploaded. Thanks for that, that's a new record. Let's see if we can get it quicker next time though, shall we?\n\nPLEASE go and look up that incredible rant in Deuteronomy that I quoted at the beginning of the video. It didn't really relate to the theme of the vid but it is a fucking classic passage, of Yahweh the bitter, wretched, old arsehole in the sky, spewing his violent hatred of mankind into the faces of his dearly beloved \"chosen\" people. Deuteronomy 28. One of my new favorite bible passages.\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

I wonder if the dogmatism came along as quickly as in THIS example?\n\nThis is definitely one for the atheists and anti-theists. I don't expect religious folk to really get this one.  I probably won't do much debating on this, I get sick enough of explaining myself on what I think are EASY satires to understand.\n\nHUGE thanks to youtube user BigAtomicBird for the Portuguese (and English) subtitles. A huge job done entirely voluntarily!\n\nI say on my channel page that I don't like or attempt to argue against the existence of a God. I think it's a difficult thing to argue, and there are far better minds than mine at work on that anyway. This video is probably the closest I'll ever come to arguing against there being a God, and in fact, I'm actually arguing against the terrible kind of theistic thinking that promotes ignorance and stultifies inquiry into the natural world, the kind of thinking that says \"If we don't know the answer to the question, then that OBVIOUSLY means that GODdidit!, end of story.\" \nThese characters (some viewers have suggested naming them Ray and Kirk!) don't know the reason that the seasons change. Goddidit! Once upon a time, people didn't know what caused rainbows to appear. Goddidit! How did the bacterial flagellum motor develop? Goddidit! How did life originate? GODDIDIT!!!! So, so lame.\n\n\n\nBah!! I have to confess to an error. The biblical cure for leprosy involves TWO birds, not FOUR as I read in the script. (I wonder how many birds were involved in the cure that actually ended the scourge of leprosy?)\n\n\nThanks for your support and thanks for enjoying my vids. They are great fun to write and make.\n\nFull name: The thing that made the things for which there is no known maker and that causes and directs the events that we can't otherwise explain and doesn't need to have been made and is the one thing from which you can ask for things that no human can give and without whom we can't be fully happy and is unlimited by all the laws of physics and never began and will never finish and is invisible but actually everywhere at once and who is so perfect that even if he killed millions of people including babies he'd still be perfect and who is so powerful and magical, he could even make a virgin pregnant if he wanted to.\n(Oh, the bloopers!!!

(However, with the invention of eternal punishment in hell, one could argue that existence under Jesus is worse than under Yahweh: at least with Yahweh, once you were dead, he was finished with you!)\n\nWhat's certain is that we can only pity the people who lived in a time when the law of the land was based on Yahwehs ideas about justice and love.\n\nWhen biblical references are given in this video, Yahwehs eventual responses are either direct quotations from scripture, or accurate representations of the scriptural accounts of the actions he took. (eg, although he didn't say 'frigging' in the Bible, he DID cause a wall to fall, killing 27,000 people, and he DID order that children, infants, and camels be killed, etc).\nI confess to an error though: Yahweh did not send his spirit to help Samson kill just 30 more people. Samson's last murderous act was a massive suicide attack, and \"he killed many more when he died than while he lived\" (Judges 16:30). I noticed the error when putting the finishing touches on the video, so I apologise to both Yahweh and Samson for not giving credit for so successful a massacre where it was due.\n\nAnother error pointed out Feb 8: it was Elisha, not Elijah, who was teased by the kids and on who's behalf Yahweh had the kids savagely ripped limb from limb by wild bears. I'm not sure whom to apologise to for this: I guess Elijah. I'm sure he was a sick fuck in other ways (most Old Testament characters were), but perhaps I slandered him by making him out to be the bald-headed pussy fairy-boy that Elisha actually was.\n\n\nMUSIC: Mainly \"Uranus\" from Holst's Planets, the piano piece at the end is from the finale of Saint Saens' Carnival of the Animals.\n\n\nHint to creationists: \nThis video is about neither evolution nor the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, dont talk about those topics in your responses.\n\n_____\nIn German:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHQvL_7bZP8",

Maybe yours.\n——————————————\n\nPerhaps by now youve heard it all before. The first two installments generated debates that each led to the next one being written, in order to demonstrate the illogical nature of the arguments I kept getting.\nMost argumentative responses focused on words. Free and choice were bounced back and forth again and again, from dictionary to dictionary It seems that apologists for the Bible are happy to accept a choice that is almost identical to blackmail, as long as it can still bear the label choice, which, yes, blackmail does too, I guess.  The other main response Ive gotten is the charge that Im angry at Yahweh for giving us such a loaded, coercive choice. Ahh  no, I dont believe in Yahweh, I dont believe Yahweh has ever done anything, so Im not angry at him. Do you deny Santa because youre angry at him for not giving you presents at Christmas any more?\n\nSo, this final part is intended to acknowledge that yes, in fact, blackmail, coercion, threats, and extortion ARE categories of choice. It is focused on what KIND of choice one might expect from an infinitely capable, infinitely loving, and infinitely wise deity. If nothing else, I hope it demonstrates that the free choice that Christians praise Yahweh for is nowhere near as free or loving as what a perfect being could offer. Its more like that free choice (YES, OK, it IS a choice!!!) given by the store robber pointing the gun at the guy behind the counter and demanding that he hand over the cash. Therefore, if we follow logic (ahem) we come to the predicament of acknowledging that Yahwehs choice doesnt measure up to anything LIKE being worthy of being credited to the divine, in fact it fails dismally, and therefore, the whole damn thing is a bunch of bullshit.\n\nDo you find this video offensive? Well, Im offended that throughout history, and even still today, people have been, and are being, paralysed with fear of being condemned to an imaginary torture chamber after death- indoctrinated from childhood that they need to grovel and beg for mercy, and that nothing they can humanly do can save them from endless pain and suffering. Im offended that people I know, love and respect have had these bullshit ideas put into their heads, and had it influence their choices ALL their lives, constantly weighing their thoughts and actions against the need to please the imaginary slave master who alone can rescue them from the imaginary torture that he himself threatens to dole out. \n\n\n———————————————\nwebsite and blog: http://www.nonstampcollector.com\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/nonstampNSC\n——————————————---",

And would they still be revered after having done so?\r\n\r\nIf Moses or King David had killed the same number people as Hitler, or Stalin, would Christians be as happy to hold them up as heroes? \r\n\r\nHow far can Holy War go before it becomes unholy?",

Basically I copy/pasted their arguments from the comments page, adapted them to a new scenario, the \"choice\" to pay taxes, to see if they stand up to scrutiny in a different context.

It doesnt look very free. If any human parent or friend can give free will to others better than God can, then that doesnt say much for God being perfect.\n\nIt could just be that the whole thing is a bunch of bullshit designed to scare children and blame the victim.\n\nHere are the biblical verses which I referred to and quoted, and which Im sure people are going to accuse me of having misinterpreted and taken out of context. \nRev 3:20\nJohn 5:22\n2 Timothy 4:1 \nRevelation 20:15\nLuke 16:24\nRomans 6:13\nRomans 5:15\nRev 20:10",
