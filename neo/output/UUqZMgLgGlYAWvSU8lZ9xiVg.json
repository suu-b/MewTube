That’s enough time for Aura to start scrubbing your personal info off these data broker sites, without you lifting a finger.\n\nTo support us on Patreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\nIn less than ten seconds, Nick Fuentes exposes the fatal flaw in Divine Command Theory: he claims morality is whatever God commands… then admits he wouldn’t follow a command because it would be “cruel.” And with that single word, the whole worldview collapses.\n\nIn this forensic breakdown, we track the trap step-by-step: the Euthyphro Dilemma, the “today” pivot that destroys the Old Testament escape hatch, the special pleading, the semantic retreat, and the frantic frame-control once the contradiction is visible to everyone watching.\n\nThis isn’t about “owning” anyone. It’s about recognising the rhetorical patterns that launder authoritarian obedience into “morality”—and why that’s so dangerous when people start treating inner voices as divine instructions.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--",

Fu*king Aquaman?\" should have ended it. The meme went nuclear, the mockery was merciless, and Ben Shapiro became the internet's favourite example of climate denial brain rot. Five years later, he'd learned absolutely nothing—and somehow gotten worse. \n\nIn this breakdown, I trace the evolution from simple economic illiteracy to sophisticated emotional manipulation, showing how Shapiro weaponised the suffering of climate victims as rhetorical shields for the very system killing them. You'll see him deploy Appeal to Normalcy to convert political choices into natural law, exploit False Dichotomies to make renewables vanish from existence, and appropriate anti-colonial language to defend fossil fuel extraction. The centrepiece: his confident 2021 declaration that China and India would never lower emissions. That same year, India hit their 2030 Paris target nine years early. By 2022, China was investing half a trillion dollars in renewables annually.

When Representative Eric Swalwell asked basic questions about what's in them, Kash delivered one of the most spectacular self-immolations in Congressional testimony history—claiming he both hasn't reviewed the files AND knows exactly what's not in them. \"I don't know the number, but it's not that.\"\n\nThis video breaks down one of the most devastating techniques in debate craft: the Double Bind. When wielded effectively, it forces your opponent to choose between two equally damaging options—and Eric Swalwell deploys it here with surgical precision. From the opening trap (\"Did you close the files or keep reading?\") through the methodical numerical descent (a thousand, five hundred, one hundred) to the final killing blow (\"Do you think it might be your job to know the number?\"), this is a masterclass in extracting accountability from someone determined to evade it.

Subscribe through my link for 40% off unlimited access this month.\n\nTo support us on Patreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\nTucker Carlson recently went on Steve Bannon's War Room and blamed hurricanes on abortion—not climate change, abortion. But this isn't just about one absurd claim. This video dissects Tucker's entire monologue as a masterclass in Red Pill epistemology, where mainstream science becomes a Matrix designed to keep you asleep. From claiming a demon scratched him in bed to declaring the atomic bomb caused American secularisation, Tucker constructs a self-sealing worldview immune to criticism. Each fallacy builds on the last—false precision, burden shifting, bandwagon appeals, false dichotomies—until disagreement itself becomes evidence of spiritual blindness.\n\nWhat makes this particularly dangerous is how Tucker positions his opponents. He compares Janet Yellen to biblical Canaanites, a group God commanded to be exterminated. This is where political disagreement transforms into cosmic warfare, where compromise becomes betrayal and violence becomes obedience. We trace how \"I was scratched by a demon\" escalates into justification for dehumanisation, mapping the descent of conspiratorial thinking from personal experience to political extremism.

This forensic breakdown reveals the exact techniques Alex deployed to trap Dinesh into admitting that biblical verses hindered abolition while being completely unable to cite a single verse condemning slavery.\n\nYou'll witness the specific moment Dinesh concedes the Old Testament God \"acts like a tribal God\"—philosophically collapsing divine command theory in a single parenthetical admission. I'll show you how Alex systematically closed every escape route: demanding textual evidence when Dinesh appeals to sermons, exposing the seventeen-century gap between Christianity and abolition that coincided perfectly with Enlightenment philosophy, and forcing confrontation with Leviticus 25's explicit instructions on buying slaves based on ethnicity.\n\nThis breakdown identifies every fallacy Dinesh desperately cycled through—red herrings about Enlightenment racism, appeals to popularity citing \"millions\" of abolitionists, genetic fallacies dismissing straightforward readings as invalid, and that spectacular moment of relativistic escape when he suggests texts mean only what readers make of them. You'll learn exactly how to recognize when someone's defending interpretation rather than content, when historical outcomes are weaponized to avoid textual accountability, and why Dinesh's final \"So?\" to genocide represents complete moral collapse.\n\nBy the end, you'll understand the precise pattern of apologetic deflection—and how sustained pressure on the actual text reveals there's nothing beneath the rhetoric but selective memory and comfortable distance from what's plainly written.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nThe 1 Question That Makes Christianity IMPLODE: https://youtu.be/FMhWJqIFR3Y?si=2xm-KxYjaT4O9ENH\n\nTravis  @Pangburn 's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UCm5J1Fu_dHgBcMTpXu-NXUw \n\n @CosmicSkeptic 's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@UC7kIy8fZavEni8Gzl8NLjOQ",

You'll witness the exact moment a U.S. Senator who claims Israel's enemies are America's enemies realises he can't provide a single example to support his own confident assertions.

In this episode, Stephen Woodford of Rationality Rules sits down with Kai Bevan, the Cambridge medical student whose calm, scientifically grounded approach dismantled Charlie Kirk's abortion arguments in front of a packed audience.\n\nWe break down the viral moment when Kai responded to Kirk's claim about conception being \"magical\" with a simple, devastating line: \"It's not magical, Charlie. We know about this.\" But this conversation goes far deeper than one memorable quote.\n\nKai reveals the strategic thinking behind his approach: why he chose friendliness over confrontation, how he challenged \"life begins at conception\" as a premise rather than accepting it, and why grounding morality in suffering creates a stronger framework than appeals to souls. He walks through his real-time thinking during key moments, from recognising Kirk's burden-of-proof flip to handling the dementia patient reductio without losing composure.\n\nThis is a masterclass in staying scientifically precise and rhetorically effective when facing someone trained to overwhelm you with emotion and aggression.

Most importantly, I'll do what Kirk desperately hopes his audience never does: actually open the Bible and read Leviticus 25's authorization of lifelong, hereditary, ethnicity-based slavery. \n\nBy the end, you'll recognize this exact strategy everywhere in modern political discourse - because facts are optional when confidence is king.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--",

But what happened when that signature tactic met someone who wouldn't be bulldozed?\n\nCambridge medical student Kai Bevan exposed the machinery behind Charlie's rhetoric in just minutes. When Kirk couldn't defend his abortion stance with science, he pivoted to mysticism about souls. When pressed on DNA, he fumbled basic biology. When cornered on his \"unique markers\" argument, he literally called \"timeout\" like it was a schoolyard game. By the end, Kirk was reduced to calling conception \"something magical\" - an admission of intellectual surrender that got the audience laughing.\n\nWe track all of Kirk's dodges in real-time: the signature move of deflect, dodge, and attack that he used in every debate. But Kai's patient, precise responses demonstrated exactly how these evasive tactics crumbled when someone refused to be derailed. The result was Charlie's worst debate performance, where his one trick didn't just fail - it collapsed entirely.\n\nTo support us on Patreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nEpisode 1: Exactly How Charlie Kirk got SCHOOLED by a Cambridge Student: https://youtu.be/9O7y50cNb7c\n\nEpisode 2: Feminist SPANKS Charlie Kirk With This 1 Ancient Trick: https://youtu.be/GRLV5Is-Pc4\n\nOriginal video: Charlie Kirk + Q&A / Debate | Cambridge Union: https://youtu.be/dkiM-z0Mzyg?si=fYEUfVJoj9puzE9R\n\nCharlie Kirk + Q&A / Debate |  @cambridgeunionsoc1815: https://youtu.be/dkiM-z0Mzyg?si=hZ88J7n85lLPB6J0",

This isn't your typical senate hearing highlight reel. This is a masterclass in exploiting the fundamental weakness of Trump's movement: their blind loyalty to their dear leader. In this forensic breakdown, I identify the devastating combination Sanders uses - a double bind trap merged with divide-and-conquer strategy - that forces Kennedy into an impossible choice: denounce Trump as part of the corrupt establishment (political suicide) or admit vaccines work (ideological suicide). What makes this tactic so lethal against MAGA logic is that it divides their conspiracy theories from their cult worship, forcing an impossible reconciliation. I'll show you exactly how Sanders weaponizes Trump's own pro-vaccine statements, why the \"corrupt pharmaceutical industry\" defense collapses when Bernie asks \"So is Trump corrupt too?\", and the precise moment Kennedy realizes he can't reason his way out. You'll learn why this approach works where fact-checking fails - you can't reason MAGA out of their delusions, but you can force them to choose between their conspiracies and their dear leader. The man who built an empire calling vaccines poison suddenly discovered nuance when his cabinet position hung in the balance.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule",

This isn't about watching someone get \"owned\" or \"destroyed\"—this is about understanding the precise rhetorical techniques authoritarians use to dismantle language itself. In this forensic breakdown, I identify every fallacy, every pivot, and every self-defeating contradiction Richard employs while literally claiming \"Whites are Native Americans\" and redefining crime to excuse political violence. You'll learn to recognise the specific patterns of racial gatekeeping, semantic fraud, and tribal justice that define modern far-right discourse. From ethnic interrogation tactics to the weaponisation of instability, I'll show you exactly how Mehdi Hasan's razor-sharp redirections expose not just bad arguments but the authoritarian worldview beneath them. Most importantly, you'll understand why Richard's audience—who initially applauded his racism—ultimately voted him out, and what this reveals about the fragility of extremist rhetoric when confronted with principled clarity.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--",

This technique involves forcing opponents to confront the horrific reality behind their comfortable assumptions, leaving them speechless through pure moral force. In his debate with Rabbi Kushner, Hitchens delivers one of the most brutal Hitch Slaps ever recorded - a piece of rhetorical dynamite that is seldom seen at this level of devastation. What makes this moment legendary isn't just how he transforms a confident rabbi into a humiliated example of his thesis that religion poisons everything, but how he simultaneously silences an entire audience by making them complicit in their own moral failure. This is a phenomenal rhetorical move that's extraordinarily difficult to pull off - it requires perfect timing, moral authority, and the ability to reframe optics in real-time. In this forensic breakdown, I'll show you exactly how Hitchens constructs this devastating moment, why it works with such brutal efficiency, and how you can recognise and deploy similar techniques when confronting moral blindness disguised as humour.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nDebate Christopher Hitchens vs Harold Kushner, Peter Gomes God 2009: https://youtu.be/ZxhOh75jn4Q?si=P4NA-tJaTkIFuFoF",

This isn't just another debate fail compilation - this is a masterclass in how extremists are using democracy's own tools against it, and they're not even hiding it anymore.

From his citations of Nazi theorist Carl Schmitt to his admiration for Franco's dictatorship, I'll show you exactly how modern fascists operate in plain sight - and why they're getting applause for it.

When Kirk rolled into Cambridge expecting another easy win against \"woke students,\" he had no idea a young feminist armed with anthropology, economics, and devastating logic was about to turn his entire playbook against him. In this exclusive interview, Tilly breaks down her preparation strategy, explains why she opened by declaring \"I'm a feminist\" (brilliant tactical move), and walks us through the exact moment she realised Kirk would never answer a single question directly. From the \"smiles-per-capita\" zinger that brought down the house to her surgical use of reductio ad absurdum, she exposes every technique she used to trap Kirk in his own contradictions. Most importantly, she teaches how to handle topic-hopping, bad-faith actors, and why answering \"I'd have to look into that\" actually shows intellectual strength. This isn't just an interview - it's a tactical breakdown from the woman who made Charlie Kirk rage-quit his own talking points, and she's teaching you exactly how she did it.\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nTilly's YouTube channel: @blondepraxis \n\nTilly's Instagram: instagram.com/tilllllly.y\n\nTilly's TikTok: tiktok.com/@blondepraxis\n\nTilly's debate tutoring services: https://unillect.com/",

Prince Andrew, sitting in Buckingham Palace across from BBC journalist Emily Maitlis, believed he could clear his name over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, he unravelled in spectacular fashion. From claiming he was “too honourable” to explaining away allegations with a Pizza Express alibi and even insisting he couldn’t sweat, Andrew offered up a masterclass in rhetorical self-destruction. What began as an attempt at damage control became the scoop of the decade, a moment so disastrous it ended his royal duties within days. In this forensic breakdown, I dissect the opening minutes of the interview—where Andrew is at his most prepared—and show how even his rehearsed defences collapse under scrutiny. We’ll look at his minimisations, euphemisms, and fallacies, from cherry-picking and hedging to blame-shifting and appeals to ignorance. Maitlis, armed only with precise questions and silence, let Andrew destroy himself in real time. By the end, what’s revealed isn’t just a PR failure, but a portrait of privilege so detached from reality it couldn’t recognise disaster as it unfolded.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nWe get tags.",

Through systematic analysis, we identify Kirk's use of multiple fallacies, including false cause, straw man arguments, and repeated red herrings. Middlehurst employs one ancient philosophical technique to devastating effect, exposing internal contradictions in Kirk's reasoning, particularly regarding happiness metrics and gender equality. The exchange demonstrates the difference between performative debate tactics designed for social media clips versus substantive philosophical discourse. We analyse each logical failure, fact-check statistical claims, and examine how Middlehurst maintains argumentative discipline despite constant attempts at derailment.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nEpisode 1: Exactly How Charlie Kirk got SCHOOLED by a Cambridge Student: https://youtu.be/9O7y50cNb7c\n\nOriginal video: Charlie Kirk + Q&A / Debate | Cambridge Union: https://youtu.be/dkiM-z0Mzyg?si=fYEUfVJoj9puzE9R\n\nCharlie Kirk + Q&A / Debate |  @cambridgeunionsoc1815 : https://youtu.be/dkiM-z0Mzyg?si=hZ88J7n85lLPB6J0\n\n@RealCharlieKirk",

In this episode of Fallacy Forensics, I break down how David and Greg exposed Peterson's rhetorical tricks, forcing him to admit he \"doesn't care about common parlance\" (aka he's just playing word games). From his refusal to answer a simple question about the Polynesian god Lono to his absurd claim that knowledgeable atheists are \"secretly religious,\" this might be Peterson's most embarrassing debate performance ever. Using my signature fallacy analysis, I identify over 12 logical fallacies Peterson deploys in just 20 minutes. This is Peterson's reverse Cathy Newman moment—and it's glorious.\n\nEnjoyed this episode?

While archaeologists found interesting evidence of a first-century garden with rock-cut tombs, Cameron inflates this into confirmation that John's Gospel provides eyewitness testimony—despite being written 70+ years after Jesus died. I break down his \"six confirmations\" to show how finding standard Palestinian agricultural remains (olive pits and grape seeds) somehow becomes evidence for supernatural claims. This is a perfect example of how Christian apologists misuse archaeology to support their theological agenda, doing a disservice to both legitimate scientific work and honest faith.\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nCameron's original video: What We Just Found at Jesus' Tomb is WAY Bigger Than Anyone Realizes: https://youtu.be/Fo8psCgni3U?si=jwsYXPVDKxE2frer",

From bans on kava and dancing to brutal “Tanna Law,” Christianity steam‑rolled Tanna’s kastom culture… until the islanders flipped the script. They built bamboo rifles, carved control towers, and trained for the day cargo planes would rain salvation. Today, the John Frum movement still marches beneath Mount Yasur, pledging loyalty to a prophet who might parachute back any moment. How did colonial oppression, WWII supply drops, and a cultural survival instinct create the world’s most ironic religion?

Verse‑by‑verse we tear through Exodus 21, Leviticus 25 and Deuteronomy 15, unearthing child chattel, captive brides and debt‑slaves branded for life—facts any modern moral compass finds chilling. Josh shows how these statutes mirror other Ancient Near‑Eastern codes, why the “hard‑hearted” loophole falls apart, and how apologists keep recycling claims he’s refuted for years. Expect primary‑source receipts, historical context, and a few well‑deserved facepalms.

    "description": "Join us for the third and final episode in our series examining the apologetic acrobatics of Michael Jones and Dr. David Falk. Dr. Joshua Bowen, Dr. Kipp Davis, and host Stephen Woodford explore how non-experts often present themselves as authorities on topics outside their expertise, particularly regarding the conquest of Canaan and Egyptian control in the Levant. We'll dissect problematic methodologies, unsupported historical claims, and the disturbing \"humans as orcs\" analogy used to justify biblical genocide narratives. Through extensive scholarly citations and careful analysis, this video demonstrates how apologetics often relies on dehumanizing rhetoric and misrepresented evidence to defend morally troubling biblical accounts—even when those accounts lack historical support. This deep dive into apologetic tactics reveals why scholars find these arguments not just historically inaccurate, but ethically concerning.\n\nTo support us on Patreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\nTo support us through PayPal (thank you): https://www.paypal.me/RationalityRules\n\nTo visit the DEBUNKED card game website: https://www.debunkedcardgame.com/\n\nTo follow Steve on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RationalityRules\n\nTo tweet with Steve on X: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\n--\n\nReferences:\n\nEPISODE 1—Christian \"HISTORY\" is an ABSOLUTE Trainwreck | The FAILURE of Inspiring Philosophy | Rationality Rules: https://youtu.be/GFhGznpzT7M?si=ACyhDxdViR8Yj9Ny\n\nEPISODE 2—Christian \"SCHOLARSHIP\" Collapses | The MELTDOWN of Michael Jones: https://youtu.be/-0xuG8wYLnU?si=D8ePq_q9hKrCRoKd\n\nChristian 'authority' OUTRAGED: Jesus' First Miracle Was a REMAKE! https://youtu.be/0Ds7MJaCb_I?si=O-rzxy2N94Nn_VbG\n\nLIVE! with Q&A: Correcting ‪@InspiringPhilosophy‬ & ‪@JoelKorytko‬ on Deuteronomy 32, El and YHWH | Kipp Davis: https://www.youtube.com/live/HVQConPaYpA?si=E_VHn_g0mYPoXW-O\n\n–\n\nDr. Kipp Davis\n\nTo support him on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/kippdavis\n\nFollow Kipp on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DrKippDavis\n\nIf you would like to help Kipp with the completion of his new book, \"Propaganda & Rituals: Religions of Ancient Israel & the Bible\" (working title), then click here: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=U4YYY68KYGHUY\n\nTo buy Kipp's 14-hour, 18-lecture course, \"Real Israelite Religions: Facts on the Ground and Propaganda in the Bible,\" and own it for life: https://sales.mvp-courses.com/israelite-religions/?affiliate=mythvision\n\nFollow Kipp on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DrKippDavis\n\nDr. Joshua Bowen\n\nApologist FAILS to whitewash Elisha and the Two Bears | Dr. Paul Copan: https://youtu.be/h_UKLPe2GT4\n\nThe Atheist Handbook to the Old Testament: Volume 1: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B094RF3CF3/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0\n\nThe Atheist Handbook to the Old Testament: Volume 2: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B431SZTD/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1\n\nDid the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0CC13NMZR/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i2\n\nFollow Dr. Josh on Twitter: https://twitter.com/djhammurabi1?lang=en-GB\n\nMesopotamian Civilisation Facts: www.digitalhammurabi.com\n\n--\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 The Beard of Dreams\n04:18 When Non-Experts Claim Expertise  \n21:11 Changing One's Mind vs. Methodology Issues\n33:14 The Academy Conspiracy Theory\n41:32 Egyptian Control in Canaan: The Expert Battle\n49:57 When Garrison Towns Aren't About Control?\n1:05:33 Scholarly Consensus vs. Apologetic Claims\n1:13:00 “They Were VERY Evil”\n1:23:16 Humans  as Orcs: The Dehumanization Problem\n1:33:05 Josh is hypocritical?\n1:36:57 Let’s Get it Straight\n1:40:16 Nine Hours!\n1:41:02 Love the Scholars!",

Coming from someone who's been on both sides of populist movements (Brexit), I break down why Democrats missed these key warning signs and lost touch with working-class voters. Beyond just analyzing what went wrong, I dive into how progressive voices are being systematically outgunned by well-funded conservative media, and what we can do about it. After staying up for 24 hours watching election results, here's what finally clicked about why facts alone don't change minds and what we're all missing about Trump's appeal.",

While Ross speaks about his feelings of loneliness and lack of purpose, the underlying narrative is that his upbringing in a same-sex household was to blame—a common and harmful argument within evangelical circles. We’ll dive into the broader implications of this message, challenging the idea that traditional family structures are the only path to healthy development.

    "description": "Please be sure to check out GMS' wonderful content! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG1uayRlzz3ahT8ISRdyw7Q/featured\n\nThis, is homeopathy – Debunked. So let’s start by explaining exactly what homeopathy is. Put simply, it’s an alternative medicine (do you know what they call alternative medicine that works? Medicine), that asserts that “illnesses can be treated with minute doses of substances that in large doses would produce symptoms of the illness. Or as the creator of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann put it ‘like cures like'.\n \nFor example, Aconitum is an extremely poisonous plant that causes (among other symptoms) nausea, headaches and diarrhoea, and so homeopathic advocates assert that because influenza causes the same symptoms, a homeopathic remedy for influenza can be made from Aconitum.\n\nSo with that said, you might be wondering, “How exactly is homeopathic ‘medicine’ made?” Well, to create a homeopathic remedy for influenza, for example, a homeopathic ‘technician’ grinds Aconitum into a very coarse grain, mixes it with either water, alcohol or a combination of the two, and then thoroughly shakes the solution.\n\nFrom here, the ‘technician’ then mixes one part of this solution with ten parts water, alcohol or a combination of the two, and then puts it through a process called ‘succession’, which is a deliberately verbose way of saying ‘it’s shaken’. And finally, this process (which is called ‘potentization’) is repeated until the solution is as diluted as desired, which is normally 30 times, which, to put this into perspective, means that you’d need to drink 8,000 gallons of the final solution to ingest one molecule of the original solution – (which is more liquid than the average person drinks in twenty years!).\n\nAnyhow, there’s just a taste of the content within the video :)\n\nAnd here’s the links to the research that I reference within the video.\n\n1.

It’s a long story, and not one for the description of a video, but I was nearly one of the millions of victims of circumcision, and so ever since the inception of this channel I knew that I’d one day take the topic, and now I have.\n\nIn Europe, male circumcision is largely viewed as a cruel and unjustifiable mutilation of a baby’s genitalia, and a result, it’s rarely practiced. In fact, in Denmark, less than 2% are circumcised (seriously, 98% are intact)!\n\nBut in the U.S, over 50% are circumcised, and many of them (perhaps including yourself) falsely view it as a ‘surgical vaccine’, claiming that it’s a necessary protection against HIV, penile cancer, and so on… but I assure you my friends, these claims do not withstand rationality – they’re false and fallacious, and I’m going to prove it to you… but not in this video. Instead, I’m going to prove it to you on the channel Counter Arguments (linked to above).\n\nBefore that, I just want to quickly explain what Counter Arguments is all about, and I want to personally recommend a few of their outstanding videos. In short, it’s a channel that challenges and counters arguments, such as, ‘Atheists Have No Morals’, ‘Black People Can’t Be Racist’, and ‘America Is A Christian Nation’. It is, at least in my opinion, one of the best channels on YouTube, and it’s one of my all-time biggest inspirations – and so needless to say, this collaboration has been a true honour.\n\nAnyhow, without further ado, here’s the link again – I’ll catch you there my fellow apes! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z5OESt3TCg&feature=youtu.be\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules",

    "title": "9 Proofs of Evolution (Why Evolution is True) Ft. Holy Koolaid",
    "description": "My fellow apes, click here to subscribe to Holy Koolaid: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvoUDoDu-cKIb11rg4ODDQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nAnd here's a link to watch me and Holy Koolaid take on the misconceptions about evolution (remember to subscribe!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAPSQ1zqfY8&feature=youtu.be\n\nHoly Koolaid's patron: https://www.patreon.com/holykoolaid\nHoly Koolaid's Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/holykoolaid/\nHoly Koolaid's Twitter: https://twitter.com/holykoolaid\n\nThe evidence for evolution comes from every branch of science that remotely interacts with organisms. This includes, to name but a few, anatomy, biology, embryology, genetics, neurobiology, and paleontology – which in turn includes every sub-field of these sciences, such as anthropology, biogeography, chronological dating, comparative anatomy, fossils, molecular biology, and the list goes on and on and on and on…\n\nThe point being here is that everything we objectively know about the natural world both supports and improves the theory of evolution by natural selection, whether we like it or not! This is 9 Proofs of Evolution – Why Evolution is True.\n\nNow to present all of the evidence for evolution would take eons, and would bore even Darwin, Dawkins and Jay Gould, and so if you’re really interested in reviewing all of the overwhelming evidence for evolution, then this video isn’t it… what it is, however, is just nine lines of evidence from several fields of study which by themselves alone make a very convincing case.\n\nNeedles to say, please watch the video for an adequate explanation of each line of evidence, as what follows is just a brief outline (due to a cap on description length).\n\n1. Forelimbs of Whales: \n\nWithin their flippers, whales have, just like the forelimbs of land mammals, finger, hand, wrist, and arm bones, which can be easily explained if these bones are repurposed forelimbs, but are remarkably hard to explain if they’re not, as after all, these bones have very little in common with non-mammal fins, and yet a great deal in common with the forelimbs of land mammals.\n\n2. Hind legs of Whales:\n\nWhales have strange bones that look like shrivelled hip, thigh and shin bones where land mammals have hind legs, and some of these bones, such as these (on screen)  from a bowhead whale, even have what appears to be a ball and socket joint… further still, palaeontologists have found numerous species within the fossil record that have unique similarities with whales, but also varying sizes of hind legs.\n\n3. Left recurrent Laryngeal nerve in Mammals:\n\nWithout getting to technical, this nerve runs from the brain to the voice box, which should be a distance of a few inches, but instead it goes down into the chest, loops around a main artery, and then goes back up to the voice box, which in the case of the giraffe results in a 15 foot detour… “A mistake that no engineer would ever make!”\n\nHowever, in animals without a neck, such as fish, the most direct route for this nerve is indeed by navigating round the artery, and hence, if mammals evolved from fish-like ancestors, we can easily explain why this absurd design exists. But if, on the other hand, we want to insist that it was deliberately created this way by a designer, then, well, we certainly can’t call this designer intelligent…\n\nUnfortunately, due to a cap on description length, you’ll have to watch the video to see 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n--\n\nDNA Similarity Explained:\n\nWithin this video I mention that we share X% of our DNA with certain organisms, and I stress and emphasis the words ‘of comparable DNA’ because that exactly what it is… of the DNA ‘that is comparable’, we share X% with these organisms. However, there is plenty of DNA in all of these organisms that is so different to ours that it can’t be compared, and this is why some studies show as low as a 90% similarity between humans and chimps, while other studies show as high as 99% similarity. It all depends on how you measure it.\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\nAs always, thank you kindly for the view, and I hope this video helps you defeat those assert that evolution has no evidence!

    "description": "The assertion that vaccines cause autism was first made in 1998, when British surgeon Andrew Wakefield and eleven other co-authors published a paper for the peer-reviewed medical journal, The Lancet. Within, Wakefield asserted there is a strong correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism, and suggested that parents avoid the MMR vaccine as a protective measure.\n\nNaturally, this caused major concern among scientists and the general public alike, and it lead to many enormous studies being conducted with the aim of confirming Wakefield’s findings – but none of them did. Not one – zero. No matter the number of children studied, the methodology used, the location of the study, or the agenda of the authors, not a single study verified Wakefield’s finding, and this resulted in his paper being completely discredited.\n\n--\n\nNow I would post the rest of the script here too, but YouTube only allows so many characters and I’d rather use this space to provide links to all of the references within the video, and of course, to my social links and Patreon – and so:\n\n1.

    "title": "Matt Slick’s Transcendental Argument – Debunked (TAG / Presuppositionalism Refuted)",
    "description": "Over my short time here on YouTube I’ve had a fair amount of requests to take on Matt Slick’s Transcendental Argument for god, and I can understand why. On the surface the argument seems hard to understand, and in turn, hard to debunk, but as the philosopher Alex Malpass demonstrated to Slick himself, it’s not. It’s actually easy to convey and easy to debunk. The difficulty is in how Slick presents it, and in how he conflates it with another one of his arguments – which I’m not going to take on within this video. This, is Matt Slick’s Transcendental Argument – Debunked.\n\nSo first and foremost, links, all the links!\n\n• Alex Malpass destroys Matt Slick: https://youtu.be/HUR49lBH1iE\n• Alex Malpass destroys Matt Slick again: https://youtu.be/0ynBtakYh_E\n• Matt Dillahunty destroys Matt Slick: https://youtu.be/rb1mfKJU6bo\n• Scoot Clifton… you guessed it, DESTROYS Matt Slick: https://youtu.be/D8dePAhDMh4\n\nNow with that out of the way, I want to stress that within this video I expose and explain several flaws and fallacies within Slick’s Transcendental Argument in detail, but for a brief summary (extremely brief), here’s a shorter version.\n\nBlack and White Fallacy:\n\nWhen Slick states that “if the no-god position, atheism” he is conflating the ‘Christian god does not exist’ proposition with, and only with, the atheist position (which is not the only ‘Christian god does not exist’ position); Buddhism is a ‘Christian god does not exist’ position; Hinduism is a ‘Christian god does not exist’ position; Egyptian Polytheism is a ‘Christian god does not exist’ position; and the list goes on and on and on and on, meaning that even if the atheist position cannot account for logical absolutes (which is an assertion I don’t accept), it does not logically follow that only the Christian god can.\n\nOr in other words, Slick’s third premise commits a subtle, but game-ending, Black and White Fallacy, because it implicitly asserts that only one of two positions can account for logical absolutes (that being Christianity or atheism), when, as we’ve just demonstrated, these aren’t the only positions.\n\nFind and Replace:\n\nAnd finally, I’m going to point out just one more ridiculous flaw with Slick’s argument… if we switch the word ‘god’ with ‘Zeus’ then the argument proves the existence of Zeus, because, ‘If the no-Zeus position, atheism, clearly fails to account for Logical Absolutes from its perspective, then it’s negated, and the other option is verified.\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thank you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video helps you defeat those who would use Matt Slick’s Transcendental Argument against you in the future.",

    "title": "The Free World's Blasphemy Law - Debunked (Stephen Fry Blasphemy)",
    "description": "Blasphemy law is, and has always been, a disgrace to any culture that calls itself “free”. As George Orwell once said, “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”\n\nNow we often hear that the Western World is free, and indeed, much of it is – within the confines of decency we’re free to act as we wish, and we’re entirely free to think and speak as we wish… that is, unless you live in Denmark, Finland, Greece, or Ireland - then you're free to say whatever you want unless it’s something mean about the Abrahamic god – because, you know, an all-powerful god is vulnerable to mean words… \n \nThis, is The Free World’s Blasphemy Law – Debunked.\n\nLink to Stephen Fry on god: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-d4otHE-YI&t=\n\nThroughout this video I primarily explain why free speech and blasphemy laws are incompatible, and that Free speech is the right that allows us to secure and defend all other rights. It is the foundation of a free society, and that therefore I would argue that either these \"free\" countries must abolish their blasphemy laws, or we should no longer refer to them as \"free\".\n\nFrom here I pin-point several other flaws with blasphemy as a whole, but for a very brief summary (extremely brief), they are as follows: \n\n1. Blasphemy Laws are a Ridiculous:\n\nBlasphemy laws are a @&%*ing joke... and I swear on purpose - because likewise to swearing, blasphemy is a victimless crime. A Christian doesn't get hurt when someone swears or says something mean about their divine North Korean, they get offended – and funny enough, Fry's response to people getting offended is second to none: \n\n\"It's now rather common to hear people say 'I'm very offended by that' as if it give them certain rights... it's actually nothing more... it’s simply a whine [...] it has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase; 'I am offended by that' well so fucking what!\n\n2. Blasphemy Laws Exist to Preserve Ignorance:\n\nAnd this brings us to the real reason why blasphemy law exist. It’s not to defend an all-powerful god, because such a being would be necessarily impervious to offense… it exists to preserve religious ignorance, because deep down the religious know that their beliefs cannot withstand rationality, and they know that the application of criticism will dissolve their undeserved privileges – that, is why blasphemy law exists.\n \n3. An All-Powerful AND All-Loving god Certainly doesn’t Exist:\n\nFry is absolutely correct when he calls the Abrahamic god a mean-minded maniac, because if this god exists and truly is all-powerful (as its proponents do indeed claim), then the state of the universe proves, without a doubt, that this god is utterly, utterly evil.\n\nTo illustrate this, I’m going to quote Epicurus, a man who lived three-hundred years before the inception of Christianity, and who within this one quote alone entirely eviscerated the idea of an all-powerful and all-loving god for good:\n\n“Is god willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him god?”\n \nHence, if an all-powerful god exists then it’s necessarily not all-loving because evil exists. \n \n4. Fry Illustrates Real Morality:\n\nAnd the final point I want to make is that when Fry stated that he wouldn’t want to get into heaven on the Abrahamic god’s terms, he demonstrated true morality and real benevolence, because unlike the religious, who Appeal to Authority for their morality, Fry demonstrated that he actually cares about the wellbeing of others… \n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thanks you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you point out that many “free” countries aren’t actually free.",

    "title": "Argument from Miracles - Debunked (Miracles Explained)",
    "description": "On Sep 6th, 1946, an Airliner flying from New York to San Francisco unfortunately crashed, killing everybody onboard except a two-year-old baby boy called Peter Link… therefore, an all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful god impregnated a virgin with himself, so that he could later sacrifice himself to himself to save you from a sin that you didn’t personally commit… makes sense right?\n\nJokes aside, The Argument from Miracles is one the most requested videos that you’ve asked for, and so, here it is – the Argument from Miracles – Debunked.\n\nVideos referenced:\n\n1. Frank Turek being… Frank Turek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-4pKs8f7HY\n2. Frogs falling from the sky: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uN5elpiDsk\n3. Darren Brown – Miracles for Sale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6hhikoAKVU&t=\n4. Matt Dillahunty being as awesome as always: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAuFJKQh83Y\n\nThroughout the video I pin-point several flaws and fallacies that those who use the Argument from Miracles tend to commit, but for a very brief summery (extremely brief), they are as follows:\n\n1. Don’t Support Theism:\n\nSo the first flaw to reveal, in my not so humble opinion, is that the vast majority of miracles wouldn’t prove the existence of a god even if they were indeed true… Or in other words, they don’t support theism.\n\nFor example, even if it were unimpeachably true that a man called Jesus resurrected, this would not, in the slightest, prove that the universe had a creator! Nor would prove that Jesus turned water into wine; that he healed the blind; that he walked on water; or that he was born of a virgin… all it would prove is that a man called Jesus respawned, and that he had terrible lag, because it took him three days!\n\n2. Argument from Ignorance or Personal Incredulity Fallacy:\n\nThe second and perhaps most obvious flaw with miracles is that they almost always commit either an Argument from Ignorance or a Personal Incredulity Fallacy. To illustrate this, consider the following:\n\nThroughout history there have been numerous accounts of flightiness animals raining from the sky – and needless to say, on just about every occasion, someone somewhere has asserted that a miracle has occurred, because, “there’s no other explanation”.\n\nNow of course, it’s fair to say that flightless animals don’t just fall from the sky, but one can’t simple assert that a miracle has occurred simply because there’s “no other explanation”… that would be, and is, an outrageous Argument form Ignorance! It is, in essence, “we don’t know, therefore god”.\n\n3. Burden of Proof:\n\nAnd this brings us comfortably to a necessary question that is extremely effective at exposing a third fallacy that ravishes miraculous assertions – this question is, “how exactly can we distinguish a miracle from an unlikely natural occurrence that we are yet to comprehend?”\n\nIt’s a very simple question, but it’s a brilliant one (if I do say so myself) – because it forces the proponent to bare their Burden of Proof rather than allowing them to shift it to you by appealing to ignorance. It indirectly emphasizes that they are the one asserting that an event has violated the laws of nature, not you, and so they bare the burden to prove this.\n\n\n4. Appeal to Emotion and/or Anecdotal Fallacy:\n\nTo illustrate this I show a clip from Darren Brown’s show. Now the point of me showing you this clip is to predominantly point out two additional fallacies that are rampant in miraculous claims. The first is the Appeal to Emotion Fallacy, which occurs when pastor Shaun manipulates both the recipient’s and the crowd’s emotions by shouting and invoking their deeply held beliefs; and the second is the Anecdotal Fallacy, which occurs after the show when a crowd member asserts that they witnessed a miracle, when they didn’t… the charlatan simply lied about the extent of the recipient’s condition and then presented evidence of things that the recipient could already do as if he couldn’t…\n\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thank you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you defeat those who would use the Argument from Miracles against you.",

    "title": "The Flat Earth Conspiracy - Debunked",
    "description": "For those of you unaware, the Flat Earth Conspiracy asserts that the earth is flat, and that consequently all of the evidence for a global earth is either invalid or part of a grand conspiracy; this includes all photos that depict the curvature of the globe, GPS devices; the trajectory of the sun, moon, planets and stars; moon phases; lunar eclipses; and time zones.\n\nBut it doesn’t just stop there – by implicit extension, proponents also denounce Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, most of Physics and Astrophysics, and on occasion even Evolution by Natural Selection! It really is the motherload of conspiracies, because it insists that all scientists, from all countries, and that all governments have, and are, perpetuating this enormous conspiracy in order to either somehow profit financially, or, I kid you not, to make the average citizen reject the Abrahamic god… This is the Flat Earth Conspiracy – Debunked!\n\nHere are links to the videos referenced:\n\n1. Cosmic Skeptic’s:10 Flat Earth Arguments DEBUNKED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKiI5k-_iaU&t=\n2. Neil deGrasse Tyson: Flat Earth, Fake Science & Space Exploration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuwjWZV8EA0\n3. Toy car sent into space: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpnoOmQwyP0\n4. Vertical curvature of the earth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU&t=\n5. Amateur Rocket Reaches 121,000 ft.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQw_C5KLhFM\n\nNow needless to say, there are thousands of “proofs” offered by Flat Earth proponents, and to address them all would take a significant amount of time and would bore even the most intrigued Flat Earth enthusiast, and so what I’ve decided to do is to address what I believe is the root of the conspiracy, and at the same time cover a few of the most prominent arguments.\n\nThis root is, in my opinion, one unfortunate fact, and two particular fallacies. The unfortunate fact is that our educational system has failed us; or as Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it, “This is a deep failure of our educational system [...] There’s something deeper going on in our society that somehow enables people to believe they’re making cogent arguments when they’re not. You know what I think it is – the way we teach science is, you’re just some empty vessel and we pour this science into you and then you regurgitate it on an exam – where as science is a way of thinking; it’s a way of understanding and probing the operations of nature.”\n\nAnd the two particular fallacies are as following: the first is the Common Sense Fallacy, which occurs when someone appeals to first-hand sensory experience (normally being eyesight) as if it’s infallible. And the second is the Personal Incredulity Fallacy, which occurs when someone is either unaware of how something works, or finds something difficult to understand, and therefore asserts that it can’t be true.\n\nFor example, the Flat Earth Society states that, “The evidence for a flat earth is derived from many different facets of science and philosophy. The simplest is by relying on ones own senses to discern the true nature of the world around us. The world looks flat, the bottoms of clouds are flat, the movement of the sun; these are all examples of your senses telling you that we do not live on a spherical heliocentric world.”\n\nNow to be fair, many of these assertions are true – our senses do in general tell us that the earth is flat, but here’s this thing – they also tell us that this image is moving, but it’s not; they tell us that these two red lines are different sizes, but they’re not; and they tell us that these lines are bent, but, again, they’re not.\n\nThe point being here is that arguments that appeal to our perception and senses, such as the assertion that the “Earth Looks Flat”, that “Clouds Look Flat” and that “Stars Don’t Move”, all commit the Common Sense Fallacy, because they act as if our senses can’t be mistaken, when, as we’ve just proven, they clearly can; our senses can be fooled, and therefore they are not reliable. This is something that should be demonstrated in school…\n\nAnyhow, the description length can only be so long, and so for more please watch the video (what you doing reading this anyhow?! ^^)\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thank you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you combat Flat Earth proponents.",

    "title": "Reza Aslan - Debunked (Reza Aslan Owned)",
    "description": "Well, what do we have here? That’s right, Sergeant Major Professor Regressive Reza Aslan, spewing vacuous crap with the Bill O’Reilly of the Left, on what can only be accurately described as the Mecca of Regression… This is Reza Aslan – Debunked.\n\nLinks to excellent videos on this subject:\n\n1. David Pakman’s “Reza Aslan Cannot Be Trusted” https://youtu.be/E9RmAo6XVAA\n2. Counter Arguments’ “Religion Is A Language” https://youtu.be/kyliqqbxOlo\n3. Squishtronic’s “Regressive Presents Reza Aslan” https://youtu.be/TFtTE4KOfKM\n4. The Rubin Report’s “Reza Aslan’s Lies and Media Bias” https://youtu.be/5nedlxtisCQ\n\nPEW study: http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf\n\nUNIFEF study: https://www.unicef.org/media/files/UNICEF_FGM_report_July_2013_Hi_res.pdf\n\nThroughout the video I pint-point several flaws and fallacies that Aslan frequently commits, but for a very brief summery (extremely brief), they are as follows:\n\n1. Argument from Authority: \n\nA fallacy that pretty much entirely defines Aslan is the Argument from Authority, as he frequently attempts to either substantiate his claim, or discredit the claim of someone else, by citing an authority (normally himself) rather than evidence.\n\n2. Liar:\n\nAslan has been proven on numerous occasions to be a pathological liar who ignores evidence against his narrative and uses statistics selectively.\n\nFor example, he has asserted that female genital mutilation is not an Islamic problem, but rather, it’s a central-African Problem, and he has referred to a UNICEF study that a. didn’t substantiate his claim, and b. did not account for FGM rates in many non-African Muslim majority countries.\n\n3. Redefines Language:\n\nA third despicable flaw that Aslan frequently commits is the redefining of language.\n\nFor example, as one of my top three favorite YouTubers, Counter Arguments, entertainingly demonstrates within his video titled “Religion is a Language”, Aslan has on numerous occasions defined religion to be exclusively a “language – and just a method of communication.” “That’s what religion is. It’s a language – that’s all it is.” “If you believe that there is something beyond the material world – that there is something that is truly transcendent, then you need some kind of language to talk about it, to make sense of it – that’s all that religion is”.\n\nNow this claim is obviously nonsense… religion isn’t just a language. To quote Counter Arguments, “Metaphorically speaking, religion can be many things… religion is a university, in that educators can cite it when teaching philosophy as well as supposed history and science; [and] religion is a government, in that it legislates what you can do, what you must do, and what you should not do…”\n\n4. Ad Hominem:\n\nAnd finally, this brings us comfortably to a fallacy that Aslan absolutely adores, and one that he very frequently employs alongside his untouchable Arguments from Authority… it is, of course, the Ad Hominem Fallacy.\n\nFor example, when Sam Harris, by referring to a PEW study, asserted that an alarming amount of moderate Muslims support and endorse extreme beliefs, Reza replied not by addressing the argument or the study, but by attacking Harris’ character: “There’s a reason that I don’t write books about neuroscience, because, I don’t have an expertise in neuroscience. I write books about what’s going on in the Muslim world because I have an expertise in what’s going on in the Muslim world.” \n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thank you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you see through Reza Aslan.",

    "description": "Over the last five years Stefan Molyneux has risen to fame, and while I personally enjoy a lot of his content, I maintain that a great many of his assertions are disastrously flawed… and his Universally Preferable Behaviour (otherwise known as UPB) is one of them. What follows is a refutation of the Five Proofs that Molyneux offers, and hence, this is Universally Preferable Behaviour Debunked!\n\nAs promised within the video, here’s a link to Common Sense Atheism’s review of UPB (of which I found very useful in my research, and I highly recommend). Give him/her some love! http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=75\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the flaws and fallacies within Molyneux’s Five Proofs, please watch the video, but if you just want a brief announcement of some of the flaws, they are as follows:\n\nThe First Proof is flawed because:\n\n• Premise two is a False Premise.\n\nThe Second Proof is flawed because:\n\n• Premise one is Begging the Question, and;\n• Premise four unjustifiably smuggles in the word “acceptance”.\n\nThe Third Proof is flawed because:\n\n• Premise two is Begging the Question;\n• Premise three is a False Premise, and;\n• Premise four is a False Premise.\n\nThe Fourth Proof is flawed because:\n\n• Premise one is either pedantic or a False Premise;\n• Premise three commits an Ambiguity Fallacy, and;\n• Premise four is a Non Sequitur.\n\nAnd finally (thanks for sticking around people!), the Fifth Proof is flawed because:\n\n• Premise one is Begging the Question, and;\n• Premise two is Arbitrarily Assigning Significance.\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thank you kindly for the view, and I hope this video helps you defeat those who would use Stefan Molyneux’s Universally Preferable Behaviour against you!

    "title": "Islam is a Religion of Peace - Debunked (Islam is Peaceful - Refuted)",
    "description": "The claim that “Islam is a Religion of Peace” is abundant, and it has been the mantra of “moderate Muslims” for eons. In this video, I’m going to try and demonstrate why the facts simply don’t support this assertion, and in doing so, reveal Islam for the violent and oppressive religion that it is. This is, Islam is a Religion of Peace – Debunked!\n\nHere’s a syllogistic presentation of this argument (for clarity purposes):\n\n• Peace is defined as a lack of conflict and a freedom from fear of violence.\n• Islam acts according to and in seek of, peace.\n• Therefore, Islam is a religion of peace.\n\nIn my opinion, when someone employs this argument the first thing to do is to identify exactly how they’re defining the word “peace”. The reason being is that there are two versions of this argument; the first is one in which the proponent is sincerely asserting that Islam is a religion of peace as defined colloquially, and the second is one in which the proponent is periodically using an Islamic definition of the word “peace”. Hence, this is why it’s important to get them to define “peace” from the outset.\n\nTo debunk the second version first, because, you know, screw logic, it’s important that we first understand what exactly Islam means within the Islamic world. The word “Islam” is derived from the Arabic word “salaam”, a word literally meaning “peace”, and Islam as a religious practice refers to a person submitting herself or himself to the will of Allah in order to seek eternal peace and tranquility.\n\nOr to put it more bluntly, in the Islamic world, Islam is the definition of peace, and therefore Islam is, by definition, a religion of peace. Now if this isn’t an obvious example of Circular Reasoning, I don’t know what is…\n\nWhat’s more is that when the proponents of this argument use the colloquial definition of the word “peace” within their first and third premises, but use the Islamic definition of the word “peace” for their second premise, they’re actually committing a classic Equivocation Fallacy.\n\nBut what about those who sincerely believe that Islam is a religion of peace as defined colloquially?\n\nWell, to be brief (there is a word-count on descriptions).\n\nProponents of this argument assert that the countless atrocities that have been committed in the name of Islam are the exclusive acts of fanatics, extremists and militants taking Islamic teaching out of context… However this is flat out nonsense. See my video on “Criticizing Islam is Islamophobia – Debunked” for more details, or whiteness the opinions of “moderate” Muslims on topics such as homosexual rights, the rights of woman, the punishment for apostasy etc., http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf\n\nA second assertion that the advocates of this argument make is that we must judge Islamic history by the standards of civilization of its time (not by our own standards). But this is nonsense, as, for one, Islam has always claimed to be the final and unalterable revelation from the almighty, and that by extension its teachings are final. According to Islam, all of Muhammad’s actions were moral and to now claim otherwise is a giant contradiction.\n\nFinally, some assert that Christianity is also not a religion of peace… that while this is true, is irrelevant.\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thanks you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you defeat those who would use the argument that Islam is a Religion of Peace against you.",

    "title": "The Argument from Ignorance - Debunked (The Appeal to Ignorance - Refuted)",
    "description": "To state it clearly, an Argument from Ignorance occurs when either a claim is asserted to be true because it hasn’t yet been proven to be false, or when a claim is asserted to be false because it hasn’t yet been proven to be true.\n\nFor example:\n\n• You can’t prove that there isn’t a mirror universe of our own;\n• Therefore, there must be one out there somewhere.\n\nHowever, in a typical argument from ignorance for a god – the specific type we’re going to focus on for the rest of this video – a theist will propose a scenario that cannot, or currently cannot be adequately explained by our current understanding, and they will then “fill the gap” with an assertion of their god. Hence this argument is often referred to as the “God of the Gaps” argument.\n\nHere’s a link to Potholer54’s video on Bill O'Reilly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUo9Tk0A-s\n\nSo, while there is a much larger explanation in the video, here in the description I’m going to get straight to the objections with these arguments (due to restricted word-count).\n\n1. They attempt to shift the Burden of Proof.\n\nWhen two parties are in discourse and one asserts a claim that the other disputes, the party who is asserting the claim has the Burden of Proof to substantiate it. However, in an Argument from Ignorance the claimant insists that the other party must prove their claim false – and in doing this they attempt to shift the Burden of Proof.\n\nTo go back to our life from non-life example, the theist attempts to shift the Burden of Proof by insisting that unless the other party can prove how life started they’re justified in believing that their god divinely intervened.\n\n• 2. Most commit a Black & White Fallacy.\n\nA Black & White fallacy occurs when a party presents two choices as the only possibilities, when in fact additional options cannot be ruled out; and in the case of our life from non-life example the theist asserts that either life emerged spontaneously from nothing, or that their specific god created life, without justifying why these two options are the only possibilities.\n\nIn doing this they’re once again attempting to shift the Burden of Proof. It is the theist that is claiming that only two options exist, and so once again it is the theist that has the Burden of Proof to substantiate this claim. It is not up to the disputing party to disprove their assertions or provide additional possibilities.\n\n• 3. Many commit a Personal Incredulity Fallacy.\n\nA third major flaw that many, but no all Arguments from Ignorance have, is that rather than relying upon universal ignorance, they actually rely upon the personal ignorance of the theist, and in doing this, they commit a Personal Incredulity Fallacy.\n\nA great example of personal incredulity is when Bill O’Reilly infamously said to David Silverman that “tide goes in, tide goes out – never a miscommunication; you can’t explain that!”. Because O’Reilly didn’t – or, let’s be honest, probably still doesn’t understand that the moon’s gravity is responsible for the rise and fall of sea levels, he asserted that a god – his very specific god, must be involved.\n\nOf course, there are many, many more flaws and objections to be had with Arguments from Ignorance, but likewise to all arguments, it only takes one premise being discounted for the entire conclusion to crumble apart, and in the case of all Arguments from Ignorance it is particularly the shifting of the Burden of Proof that is this devastating flaw.\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thanks you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you defeat those who would use an Argument from Ignorance against you.",

    "title": "The Watchmaker Argument - Debunked (Teleological Argument - Refuted)",
    "description": "As most famously presented by William Paley in his theological work titled “Natural Theology”, the Watchmaker Analogy (teleological argument) is a recurring argument for a designer, which, by way of analogy, asserts that complexity requires a designer.\n\nThe way Paley put it is essentially as follows: if you were walking across a field and saw a watch lying upon the ground, you wouldn’t assume that it had come together by chance because it’s too ordered and complicated. Rather, you would assume that it had a conscious and intelligent designer. By way of analogy, Paley then went on to argue that because life and indeed the universe is ordered and complicated, it too must’ve had a conscious and intelligent designer.\n\nThroughout the video I pint-point several flaws and fallacies that those who use the Watchmaker tend to commit, but for a very brief summery (extremely brief), they are as follows:\n\n1. False Analogy:\n\nAn analogy is a comparison between things that have similar features for the purpose of explaining a principle or an idea, and in this case, Paley insists that a comparison can be made between the complexity of a watch and the complexity of the universe, which both imply that they had a designer.\n\n2. False Cause Fallacy:\n\nEssentially, like all False Cause Fallacies, the Watchmaker Argument mistakenly confuses correlation with causation. It recognizes a relationship between complexity and designers, and then concludes that one necessarily implies the other.\n\n3. Ignores Evolution by Natural Selection:\n\nIt completely ignores evolution by natural selection. Without getting into it too deeply, natural selection has been completely and utterly proven to be an unconscious process that has given rise to countless complex and purposed organisms. The watchmaker argument ignores this in the attempt to substantiate it’s black and white fallacy (deliberate designer or randomness).\n\n4. Special Pleading:\n\nIts core premise asserts that purpose and complexity requires a designer, and so if we draw the Watchmaker Argument out to its logical conclusion – that there is a god and that it created the universe and everything in it, then by applying the argument’s logic to itself we must conclude that this god too had a designer, and so on and so forth for infinity…\n\n5. Contradiction:\n\nThe Watchmaker Argument is self-contradicting. The argument first assumes that a watch is different from nature, which it indirectly claims is uncomplicated and random. However, it then states that since the universe is so complicated and ordered it too must have a creator. Thus, it gives the universe two incompatible and contradicting qualities.\n\n6. Shoemaker:\n\nThe Watchmaker Argument doesn’t imply a designer – it implies that there are many designers. After finding that watch upon the ground, imagine if you then saw beside it a shoe. Would you assume that a watchmaker made that shoe? Of course not – you would assume that a shoemaker made it. \n\n7. Ex Nihilo\n\nThe Watchmaker Argument acts as if a watchmaker creates a watch from nothing, when this simply isn’t true. A watch, like all human creations, is a rearrangement of energy and mater that already existed.\n\n8. Doesn’t Support Theism:\n\nThe Watchmaker Argument doesn’t support theism. Even if it were accepted as a sound argument, it would only prove that a universe had a universe designer – and that’s it. It wouldn’t prove a particular religion to be true.\n\n9. Incompetent Design:\n\nAn all-powerful and all-loving god would not create organisms with the type of suboptimal design that can be seen in nature. Meaning that either that god isn’t omnipotent or that it isn’t omnibenevolent – or both!\n\n--\n\nFollow me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Rationalityrules\n\nTweet with me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RationalityRule\n\nAnd if you’re feeling particularly generous, support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/rationalityrules\n\n--\n\nAs always, thanks you kindly for the view, and I hope that this video will help you defeat those who would use the Watchmaker Argument against you.",
