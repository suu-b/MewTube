I pulled it up out of the weeds a little bit, but the reason I started wanting to write it is that I feel like the use of morality as a way of controlling people has become much more powerful than the use of morality to help people order their lives and society better. \n\nLike, we have a president who has been openly unfaithful to every wife he's ever had, but to many he's seen as a moral actor because he promises to control people in ways that feel like a moral imperative to some people. \n\nI don't like it!! \n\nBut as I got into the subject I realized that perhaps it is worth saying that this project here and this community has a deep morality. I usually talk about this as \"values\" but perhaps it is time to own our morality...to take it back, and to be proud of it.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://werehere.beehiiv.com/subscribe\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn",

    "description": "To find your senators and representative: https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials\n\nTALKING POINTS\nYou're usually leaving a messge on an answering machine so there's a good chacne you can stop and try to record a different way.\n\nINTRO\nWho are you and where do you live\n\nSEPARATION OF POWERS\n1. Affirm that you both believe in the constitution\n2. You also agree that Congress (the house and senate) are the ones who write laws and decide how money is spent.\n3. Executive orders are not laws, but are being treated like laws. \n4. You can also say that this is contrary to the idea of separation of powers that the nation is based on.)\n5. Treating executive orders like laws degrades separation of powers, which isn't just some fun idea, it's the reason why our democracy has lasted this long. \n6. Treating executive orders like laws degrades the power of congress, and you're not sure why your representative is so keen to give away the power the constitution grants them.\n\nUSAID\n1. USAID helps America. It helps america by:\n a. increasing our influence in the world\n b. Making other countries more stable\n c. Making it less likely disease outbreaks will reach Americans\n2. Everyone agrees USAID should continue it's life-saving missions, including Marco Rubio, who runs USAID. \n3. I don't understand why, given that, the majority of USAID's life-saving work has been suspended. \n4. I don't htink anyone even knows who made that decision, and that is scary and very weird and also illegal. \n\nFINAL APPEAL\n1. We have a shared belief in the greatness of this country and it's systems.\n2. I hope you will stand up for the constitution and for USAID.\n\n\nSCRIPT\nHey, I’m YOUR NAME (also sometimes good to list your address), I live in your district, I didn’t vote for you. But I did think that you believed in the founding document of this nation. No…I do think that. I do think you believe that congress, the branch of government you are elected to, creates laws and decides how the nation’s money will be spent, and that executive orders are not laws. You have principals and responsibilities that extend beyond loyalty to the president. The more you sit back and let this happen, the more it harms the country. \n\nWe both know that USAID helps America by increasing our influence in the world, making other countries more stable, and decreasing the chances that disease outbreaks will reach our soil. I think you will eventually stand up to Donald Trump taking away your power, the question is will you be one of the people who stands up first, and I hope you will. \n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://werehere.beehiiv.com/subscribe\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn",

I think it's, like, 50% right. But really important to note here that the fact that I got a ballot with democrats all on the bottom was both unlikely and guaranteed. Like, it was unlike that I would get one with all democrats on the bottom, but guaranteed that SOMEONE would. So conspiracy theories are really:\n\nOne part distrust in systems\nOne part not knowing how systems work\nOne part the universe presenting you with information that confirms your anti-system biases. \n\nAnd, of course, all three of those things lean on each other. Not understanding systems because they are massively complex leads to distrusting those systems. Not trusting systems leads to being more likely to falsely misattribute something random to something malicious. And then of course you have all of the magnification systems of the news media and social media and wall-to-wall bad actors who just want to win elections.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://werehere.beehiiv.com/subscribe\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn",

What a thing...\n\nOne thing I didn't include in this video beacuse I'm not 100% sure it's true...the UK ended up being such a good place for coal production hundreds of millions of years ago in part because it was, I think, very wet. Trees can totally break down and release their carbon back into the atmosphere very quickly if FIRES can happen, but in swamps, fires can't happen, because everything is so dang wet. So  wet places with lots of vegetation were very good for coal production.

I did see some folks who were like \"The boob in a door tweet ruined the book for me\" which makes me think: \n\n1. I probably should have found another way to make the point April's tweet is making after I heard from people that it was weird (even if I was technically correct that a real woman would absolutely tweet that tweet...since lots of real women have.)\n\n2. I worry that sometimes \"It vital that we are aware of the inequities of the world\" that can be interpreted as \"I should lot allow myself to enjoy perfect things and also I should be hyper vigilant for anything that may be imperfect...and thus I should not enjoy anything\" that I think is not great. \n\nBut hey, it's always been a mess out here.

Examing why and how it happens...like, what's going on in my own brain, and also in the systems I'm interacting with, is very important in my work. Creating content based on definitely bad / misleading information is one of my big worries.\n\nThese are all really weird and complicated examples that I could spend a further hour or two discussing. Like, for example, that (depending on your start date and the data set you use) the relationship between rent and income can be shown to diverge substantially or stay very close together (though, not in 2022 or 2023, where all data sets show them diverging in the US.)\n\nThe NOAA data one is the most fascinating to me as I honestly think that the internet's response to the information is a kind of classic misinformation / degradation of trust cycle where an organization says something that is then misinterpreted by people online and then the misinterpretation is assigned to the authority (who never said it) and used to degrade the authority of that organization. \n\nA CHALLENGING INFORMATION LANDSCAPE\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

You can read more about it here: https://www.edf.org/revamped-cost-curve-reaching-net-zero-emissions\n\nAnd thanks to the folks at the center for negative carbon emissions at ASU: https://globalfutures.asu.edu/cnce/\n\nThere is much more to say about this graph...the big things being that it, of course, is guessing about the present and does not even attempt to predict the future. There are things that aren't even on the curve (like advanced geothermal) that I think are likely to be super important in our path to decarbonization because, right now, it's mostly unproven technology (though proven more and more every year.) Another thing it doesn't account for is energy costs going down, especially at certain times of the day (when there is lots of sun and wind) and that could substantially change the equation for Direct Air Capture of CO2. \n\nAnyway!

I took a little time this year to go through and watch all of our reunion videos and get a little weepy about all of the things we have been through and how this went from something very silly and tiny to something very silly and big. And also serious...maybe too serious sometimes. This video makes me want to be sillier and smaller, but also I want to go bigger and more interesting...it's a conflict! Let's do both!

And I don't want people to think I've been miserable doing this work. But I have found that I am, to some extent, who I am. There are things I can do and of course I am extremely grateful to have the opportunities I have. But when I definitely *had enough* and was still working really hard and feeling very stressed, I could tell that I needed new motivations.\n\nOne motivation is wanting to do things that are very interesting and special for this community, which is why John suggesting we work with Partners in Health in a big and long-term way was so exciting (honestly, in part because it felt quite risky!)\n\nThe thing I wish was different about me is that I wish having or not having money did not affect my motivation as much as it did. I thought it wouldn't, but I was wrong. I was much more motivated by making money up to a certain point than I thought I was, and when that motivation went away, I was upset that I had such a need to find new ways to motivate myself to do hard things. \n\nI don't think I said it enough in this video, but I feel (aside from some frankly unnecessary challenges with my body) pretty certain that I am one of the luckiest people on the whole earth, and that's not hyperbole, I think it's simply true.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Like Trump is great at it, Elon Musk is a great at it. It's definitely not a skill that only comes when you're a good person, so that's something I try and think a lot about...just because I'm good at something doesn't mean I'm good. \n\nAlso, one of the difficult exercises of all of this is that I understand that the core is different on different platforms, and that the way people feel when consuming different kinds of media matters a huge amount.

    "description": "The Grant: https://forms.gle/HBtAdt7zedrtzbZ48\nPizzamas: https://pizzamas.com/discount/HANKSENTME\n\nAs I upload this, I am realizing that there is a pretty huge part of my life that I barely ever talk about publicly. I mean, that is also somewhat true of family things, but business isn't traditionally seen as a thing to be private about. There are lots of people who have big, full careers just talking about the business of their business. I myself have felt the pull to create that kind of content and have done it!\n\nBut I stopped a while back as I realized that talking about the inside operations of my business was always sharing other people's stories as well as my own, and that's weird without asking for permission. Plus, my perception of a situation is never going to be exactly the same as someone else's. So I stopped doing it. I even put a little sign on my computer that says \"DON'T TWEET ABOUT WORK\" to remind me. Even this video felt like it was on the edge of sharing too much, though it is almost all about me. \n\nI feel like there's a relationship between the \"I tweet about what a good boss I am boss\" and the \"wife guy.\" And we've seen times when those bosses hve proved that they are not great bosses. I am also not a great boss...I know that there are some out there, but it's not an easy thing to do. It's especially hard when you have both the inclination and opportunity to be constantly distracted by other things!\n\nSo yeah, that's why I don't talk about the biggest part of my professional life on the internet. If my businesses were just my business, I would, but it's not. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Today is the last chemo day of my current treatment plan!!\n\nI will feel terrible next week, and then I will mend up a bit before I start radiation, which will take a while but /should/ have significantly less impact in terms of symptoms. I will also have a fairly important scan next week at some point, and I'll have a big hunk of time before I hear back about the results...so that's quite scary!\n\nSo, fingers crossed and all that...you never really know how it's gonna go but it seems like it's going well so far. I would definitely be very happy if this is the last of the chemo I ever have to do, but also, just grateful to have these tools.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Well, yknow, It’s a weird one, but I make stuff about the things I’m thinking about and this is definitely one of them! It’s such a wild thing that we talk about cancer in a unified way when it is many hundreds of different diseases. Cancer isn’t a disease, it’s a way for disease to happen. And even with something as treatable as Hodgkin’s there are lots of ways it can be more or less dangerous, and sometimes it gets really stubborn! So far that isn’t happening with me, but I am very aware that it could. I’m not a population, I’m just one person, so I get to be on one side or the other! It’s good to actually understand what it all means.

Glad to be through the worst of the first treatment, but obviously I've still got a long way to go. I wouldn't want everyone to think that Day 7 is indicative of how you feel while you're doing chemo...if you had seen me on Day 3 I would have been 100% horizontal. \n\nI hear it tends to get a little worse every time (though I've got some tips for how to maybe make a few things hit a little less hard!)

    "description": "In all likelihood, Montana's TikTok ban is impossible to implement, both legally and practically. A national ban would be a really significant loss, and I think it's worth recognizing that. The current frames I've been hearing are \"TikTok is trash so of course we could ban it\" or \"TikTok is a treasure so of course we shouldn't ban it.\"\n\nA content platform is not its code, it is its cultures. To destroy that is a truly dramatic step and I hope the people considering doing that understand what they are proposing. I hope they are motivated by more than a distaste for social media and trying to look \"tough on china.\" But, honestly, I don't know.\n\nI think we've gotten ourselves into quite a pickle and I think it's OK to say \"I don't know what to do about this.\"\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Today on TikTok (after I made this video) I saw a guy arguing that we have a very small window between understanding the potential affects of AI and actually deciding what we can and should do with it. I don't really agree, I think that we both have no window at all (in that, you cannot put this genie back in the bottle) and a window that will be open for a very long time. \n\nWhen we encounter new technologies, we learn their powers and their dangers and that always takes quite a long time, and then, after that, we develop tools (mostly in the form of taboos) for how they should and should not be used. But you literally can't intelligently form the taboos until you have experienced the negative outcomes. \n\nI don't know what the negative outcomes will be, but I bet there will be a ton. And we're not going to have the systems to handle those negative outcomes for a long time...potentially a generation or two. That's how it's been with the internet, and that's why I'm worried about changes stacking up on changes. It's gonna be a tricky time. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "I think, for example, that pretty much every question about \"cancel culture\" is a question poorly phrased because \"cancel culture\" means at least 20 different things, from celebrities going to jail for sexual assault to viral \"karen\" videos. It's impossible to be right about cancel culture but very easy to have an opinion on it because every person has a different definition. It is a question, like the math test in the video, seemingly intentionally designed to create conflict. \n\nThere are so many mechanisms of how our disrupted world gets so messy and weird and bad, but the fact that it's much easier to argue about stuff when opinions are easy to form, and it's much easier to form easy opinions when questions are wrongly stated is actually new to me!!\n\nAlways learning!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nIf you're in Canada, you can donate here: https://pihcanada.org/hankandjohn\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "In which John gets curious about when the median human being lived, and along the way learns something surprising about the human story.\nLINK/SOURCES:\nYou can make a one-time or monthly donation to support better maternal and child healthcare in Sierra Leone here: http://pih.org/hankandjohn\n\nMost of the population data in this video comes from the Population Reference Bureau, especially this excellent article: https://www.prb.org/articles/how-many-people-have-ever-lived-on-earth/ That's also where I learned that life expectancy in Iron Age France was 10-12.\n\nThe graphs and much of the information on life expectancy at various ages comes from Our World in Data, which is amazing. Here's their article on life expectancy over time and across communities: https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy\n\nTheir article on child survival and mortality statistics: https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality\n\nAnd their article examining mortality in the distant past: https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past\n\nI mostly relied on PRB info for global populations at various times, but this research summary from census.gov was also helpful: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/international-programs/historical-est-worldpop.html\n\nHere's my math for why most people have never been 20: Of the first 100 billion people who lived, at least half (the most prominent researchers in the field consider that estimate on the low end) of people died before 15. Counting the 3% or so who died between 15 and 20, that means that probably at least 53 billion of the first 100 billion people died before the age of 20. Of the most recent 10 billion who died (most of whom were born between 1800 and 1950), over 30% died before the age of 20. That takes us to a conservative estimate of 56 billion of the 110 billion people who've died so far. (2.6 billion people are CURRENTLY under the age of 20, so even if you look at the entire population of humans, it is probable that most people have never been 20--hence the title.)\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

On the national level, that's extremely common, and it's becoming more common on the local level. But I think that is /only/ because we are letting the conflict drive us into cynicism. I feel like, as long as the conflict machine (which is very clearly mostly driven by a reactionary right-wing set of fears) is in charge, it's going to get harder and harder and harder to solve even a single problem.\n\nSo I'm not saying, \"Let's stop with all the conflict!\" because there is much to fight for and disagreement is the energy of democracy. But if everyone is hopeless or only fighting to beat the opposition, not to actually win progress, nothing gets solved. And I think part of pushing back agains that is being grateful for leaders who are finding ways to succeed without dumping gasoline on the fire. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

That's what happens with almost all good legislation. Of course, there will also be some bits of this that won't work as intended and they'll probably be big news stories. When you've got like 150 different pieces of a bill, not everything will be perfect! But it is quite a big deal for me to see America making these investments...even if I'm not gung-ho on all of them, and some of them legit piss me off...it's an amazing step that I did not think we would be making. \n\nInterview with Jesse Jenkins - https://youtu.be/ZrfRbr_xbOE\n\nInterview with Administrator Regan - https://youtu.be/W_xH_51Enqg\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "We don't mean to be sneaky...ok, maybe we do...but not to you! \nAwesomeCoffeeClub.com\n\nToday I was reminded that my video about the James Webb Space Telescope from 2011 turned out to be a big deal internally for people working on JWST. It had undergone a lot of setbacks and not hitting budgets and there were a number of people who were starting to feel that maybe it would never happen, or wasn't worth the costs. \n\nThat was dragging on the people working on it, and then this rando YouTuber makes a video about how you can make the world better by decreasing suck, but also by increasing awesome. That seems to have become a big deal among some folks who worked there, and they even passed out \"I Decrease Suck\" and \"I Increase Awesome\" buttons to people working on the project. \n\nAnother way this community sneaks around and has impacts far beyond its size. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "I don't not watch movies because I don't watch stuff, I just consume so much stuff generated by YouTubers and podcasters and authors other independent creators that I don't ever really think about movies. I think this is also why movies make me cry so much...they're just a much more effective medium for conveying emotion. Character+story+people's actual faces+music+cinematography can sometimes just SLAM into me and totally break me down. So it's actually unusual for me to get through a movie without crying. I often can't get through a PREVIEW! Especially when it's family stuff. \n\nI have been testing negative for a few days now and am back home, but here is my video from when I was trapped in a hotel room for a week!! It was not the best time, but I did get to watch a lot of great movies!!\n\nThe next day after this I watched Annihilation, which is WAY outside of what I usually watch, but I love Jeff Vandermeer books and they did a truly amazing job of capturing his bizarrity. I loved it, even if I was very scared for much of the time. I cried twice. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

The authors of another paper were mislead, though it would have been easy not to be mislead because they're scientists.\n4. Peer review did not catch the stat because it was a background stat, not part of the papers methods or results which peer review doesn't spend much (if any) time on.\n5.

And it's hard to say that the people playing those politics haven't been well-rewarded for it, so honestly I'm not sure what we can do. \n\n41% of Americans live in a home with a gun, a percentage that rose quite a lot during the pandemic. We aren't going to ban guns in America. Some people might want that, but it doesn't matter because it is impossible. But there are lots of strategies we can put in place to actually make guns safer. Other countries have done it. The only thing standing in the way of us doing it in the US is wild, unfounded fears that are being manufactured and sold by people trying to consolidate their power. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

There are lots of reasons for him to back out of the deal as well, including the fact that, if he doesn't he becomes the bogeyman. He has a tremendously strong brand, but even his personal brand would take a beating in such a controversial role. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

But I wanted to try to express that the people trying to restrict access to information and human rights do not speak for me or for all Christians. \n\nAlso: I made this video before the leak of the U.S. Supreme Court's apparent decision to overturn Roe. (I am traveling a lot for the turtles movie and I'm making things on an unusual schedule.)

    "title": "How do you cross the Sad Gap?",
    "description": "In which John tells the story of how he escaped the despair of feeling like nothing could ever be done about anything, and how in learning more, he became more optimistic about the future.\n\nSome other strategies for crossing the sad gap that stood out to me in comments to Hank's video:\n\n1. There is very little evil - Almost no one thinks they are evil, or that their beliefs or policies are malicious. If you had a different life, you'd have different values. \n\n2. Listen to the people who are working on solving the problem and research their past successes. There are many ways in which the world is better than it was a generation ago. Find the people who are helping to drive these successes and pay attention to them. Pay attention as well to the people who are calling out the problems we face in new ways that will help us to tackle them better.\n\n3. Connect with individuals: Building relationships is both a way to cross the sad gap (because you'll find that you're working/thinking/volunteering with people who are also trying to solve the same problems that are important to you) and a way to learn more deeply about the challenges you care about.\n\n4. Believe in the possibility of humanity. Look to the moments when we have shown real solidarity and taken meaningful steps to make the world suck less. Look to the way the people of Damascus responded to the plague, or the ways systems have been built to better serve our shared needs.\n\n5. You can only have one first priority: This is what inspired today's video!\n\n6. Be grateful for the work of others. On the problems you don’t have time to interface with deeply, do not think “this problem will solve itself” think “there are wonderful people who I trust to work on this.”\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

I don't know to what extent this is an artifact of the structure of people communicating and to what extent it is an artifact of the way the social internet is built. \n\nI also think that there are some people who think that The Sad Gap is the honorable, correct place to be. As if you are a bad person if you get out of the place where you only feel hopelessness and outrage. I am, frankly, OVER THAT. I think it's making things much worse. I never thought it was the right thing to do and the moment I realized that other people did, I got very worried. \n\nAnyway, it's taken me a long time to think about this stuff and articulate it and I am very curious about what other people think so please leave comments, I will be reading them voraciously. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://eepurl.com/Bgi9b\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "The more I think about this, the more interested I am in how it is a lens on a bunch of broader phenomenon. Right now, there are a bunch of pieces being published about how particular groups are upset or worried about sticking with daylight time all year round rather than standard time. But, if we were going to be sticking with standard time all year round, there would also be a bunch of articles about why that's bad. \n\nWe only talk about the drawbacks of the things we are doing, which means we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the drawbacks of the alternatives. Tricky business...\n\nAnyway, the only way we fix this is if enough people don't care...so that's where I'm at. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Ukraine and Russia: What Caused the War?",
    "description": "In which John explores historical and political context to understand what caused the Russian government's invasion of Ukraine, and how we arrived at this awful now. There is a LOT of misinformation in comments, so why not read directly from SOURCES? But first, CORRECTIONS:\n\nThe official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian. \"National languages\" as a phrase was confusing. I should've just said that 30% of Ukrainians speak Russian as their first language. Also, the etymology of \"Ukraine\" is not settled as \"borderlands.\" Many Ukrainian linguists argue that the etymology of Ukraine comes from words meaning \"In My Land,\" not \"borderlands.\" Thirdly, I  misspelled Kyiv as Kiev. If I made further mistakes, let me know and I'll amend here.\n\nNow, SOURCES:\n\nPutin's claims that Ukraine never had \"real statehood\" have been stated in both essays and speeches. Here's some coverage of one such speech: https://time.com/6150046/ukraine-statehood-russia-history-putin/\n\nAnd a fact-check of the same speech: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/23/fact-checking-putins-speech-ukraine/\n\nIf you want to read Vladimir Putin's essay where he expounds his theory that Ukraine \"was created entirely by Russia,\" you can read Putin's meandering, surreal, ahistorical essay about it here: http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181 (This is an insecure site owned by the Kremlin so bear that in mind)\n\nThis article goes into far more detail about Putin's theory of Ukraine's illegitimacy than I could cover in the video: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/world/europe/putin-ukraine.html\n\nYou can learn about the Holodomor here: https://www.britannica.com/event/Holodomor or at this thoroughly researched wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor\n\nAnd about Stalin's forced deportation policies here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union\n\nPutin's reference to assault in the context of invading Ukraine: https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-macron-meeting-quote-obscene-lyrics-show-russia-ukraine-demands-2022-2\n\nThe 1991 Independence referendum results: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Ukrainian_independence_referendum\n\n\nHuge thanks to Rosianna Halse Rojas for editing the script and help sourcing images.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "You Don't Want a Gas Stovetop",
    "description": "OK, so I was both passionately disorganized and time-limited so here's a little more information:\n\nProblems with Gas Stoves\nThey release fairly dangerous chemicals into your home, including nitrogen dioxide which is quite bad for you. A recent meta-analysis of dozens of studies showed that kids who live in a house with gas cooktops have a 41% higher chance of experiencing asthma.\n\nThey introduce a significant danger of fire and explosion, especially in homes with children or people with memory problems. \n\nThey are harder to clean than induction cooktops. \n\nThey get much hotter than induction cooktops.\n\nThey heat up far more slowly and make cooking take more time.\n\nVERY IMPORTANTLY household methane use is actually a really big contributor to climate change and we are going to have to, over the next 30 years, stop doing it. People don't care about their hot water heater as long as it's reasonably priced and works well, but people have emotional connections to their gas ranges, and that could be a really silly reason to make climate change significantly worse.\n\nThe only advantages of gas cooktops over induction:\n\nThey can (though this isn't always the case) have a little more control over heat than induction (though induction cooktops /can/ have that control, they just sometimes don't). \n\nInduction cooktops don't work with copper, aluminum, or glass cookware. \n\nAt the moment, the cheapest gas ranges are cheaper than the cheapest induction cooktops (though government incentives SHOULD CHANGE THIS PLEASE.) \n\nTHINGS I LEFT OUT OF THIS VIDEO\nThere are places (I live in one of them) where we will likely need to deliver gas (possibly hydrogen, but who knows) to people's houses because it sometimes gets below -20 degrees F and it's hard to make heat pumps work well at that temperature. But in the next 20 years, it's completely possible that that problem will be solved. \n\nRegardless, 90% of people in the US live in places where it never gets that cold. That percentage is increasing as people move to warmer places and the colder places get warmer. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "description": "Now that I'm thinking about this, I can't stop thinking about it. I remembered it because a friend of mine told me a story about when she was once at a hot spring and she went from pool to pool asking everyone if they'd like to participate in 30 seconds of silence and she got everyone on board, but then, 15 seconds after they started, some guy said \"THIS IS BORING.\" \n\nLike, it's very easy to immediately and /only/ examine the person who did the dumb thing. My brain wants to know what the heck is wrong with him! How drunk was he? How selfish!?\n\nBut if we assume that that experiment works sometimes, but not every time, we realize that taking a continuum of human decisions and forcing it into a binary, you would always only have one of two outcomes.

It (and fear) are most effective on people who struggle with self worth (which is to say...y'know...basically everyone, but also some people more than others.) In particular, people who might have been told that they would have a lot of status but then ended up not getting it might be very susceptible to both fear-based and superiority-based content. Interestingly, the fear and the superiority almost always go hand-in-hand. Like, \"here are the people you are superior to, and here is why you should be afraid of them\" is a wildly engaging thought.\n\nAnyway, this is really intense and I hope we all get through it.\n\n2:00 So...

The book in question: https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781609387181/narratives-nerdfighters-and-new-media\nKeeping this video to four minutes meant glossing over a lot of details that I think are interesting/important relating to the assignation of value in online communities, but one that I really want to highlight is that money is not the only form of currency online. As the book explores, attention is an important and valuable resource that is extensively exchanged online.

    "title": "My Physicalmental Illness",
    "description": "In which John discusses labyrinthitis, OCD, categories, the body in thought, and the body in pain.\nTWO MAJOR NOTES:\n1. Stigma is complicated. When it comes to stigma around mental illness, I've found this paper extremely helpful (I reread it often): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248273/ One heavily stigmatized illness not mention in the video is HIV, and there has been a lot of research around the causes (and the consequences) of stigma w/r/t HIV; I recommend this overview: https://www.icrw.org/publications/common-at-its-core-hiv-related-stigma-across-contexts/ \n\nBut in general, illness is stigmatized partly based on our ability to treat them/our level of understanding, partly based on who tends to be most affected by them, and partly based on what the illness does and which bodily systems it affects (like, colon diseases are stigmatized in a way that heart diseases aren't). All of this has real impacts on health and healthcare delivery. Consider, for instance, this famous study showing racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/)\n\n2. This is largely coincidental, but I think it's interesting that it's possible to imagine a patient with OCD being treated with both the medications that were used to treat my labyrinthitis. Althought it is not widely administered, meclizine (which is primarily an anti-nausea medication; you may know it as dramamine or antivert) may have some ability to treat so-called \"diminished gating\" in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3895242/), and diazapam (commonly known in the U.S. as valium) is often prescribed to treat severe anxiety and panic attacks. (With regular use, patients often become tolerant to diazapam and/or physically dependent upon it, so it is often--or should be, anyway--prescribed with constraint and careful monitoring.)\n\np.s.

    "description": "Science is a human-created process that is undergoing constant revision and it is the best tool we have for uncovering truth. It's not a bunch of facts, it's not an ideology. It's imperfect and influenced by bias, but it is also very good at decreasing the affects of bias. \n\nForcing science to stand up next to systems that use entirely different rules is super frustrating, and I have been very disheartened by how effective that has been for getting people to abandon expertise for some guy who has opinions. \n\nBut I am also frustrated by people who treat science like it's an ideology...who take whatever is the current consensus and attack people who want to add to it or challenge it as if they are anti-science or a political opponent. \n\nThe nice thing is that we do have lots of randomized controlled trials for several different vaccines so, like, let's definitely do that. But we also need to keep investigating anti-virals and treatments for sick people because, like, we're not out of the woods yet...\n\nSources:\nA good general article to read if you want to know more:\nhttps://theconversation.com/a-major-ivermectin-study-has-been-withdrawn-so-what-now-for-the-controversial-drug-164627\n\nLatest and most robust analysis shows ivermectin is not a good COVID Treatment: https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab591/6310839\n(this only looked at randomized controlled trials, which compare people in the same situation who got either a drug or a placebo and no one knew who got what.)\n\nObservational Studies find Promising Results: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X20319598?via=ihub\n(observational studies give people the experimental treatment to see how they do, but they don't test that against a placebo, just against the general background, which makes them much less reliable.)\n\nIvermectin Study Used Faulty Data: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns\n\nBig New Ivermectin Trial: https://www.principletrial.org/\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

THAT'S THEIR JOB AND THEY LIKE IT!\n\nBut when someone asks me, \"Why did it seem like vaccines were going to solve everything, and now it doesn't seem like they are?\" that's not a question to get mad at, it's a normal question that people have about their world. But then there are the questions that people have because they've been engaging with the professional misinformers. Questions like, \"Why don't you think the vaccines are more harmful than the virus when...**some long string of quacky theories about hidden vaccine-related illness**\" and the answer is just like, \"Because you're being manipulated and everything you just said was a lie.\" The answer I want to have to that isn't \"stop lying.\" Instead it's \"I am so grateful to the people who made these vaccines (and their distribution) possible, and who have freed me from some of the frustration and fear that I've experienced over the last year, and people saying that those folks are evil or ignorant are doing them (and you) a tremendous disservice.\"\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "title": "Gene Editing and Intelligence: A Bad",
    "description": "There was so much more I wanted to talk about here...it's a hard subject for 4 minutes. Obviously the bad thing being glossed over in the beginning is \"Well, so we're going to create a race of smart people to 'help' everyone else? Yeah that sounds like it will go fine! DEFINITELY NOT DYSTOPIAN AT ALL\"\n\nBut that's so obvious on its face that I wanted to take look at it from the deeper perspective of what the heck we think intelligence even is. If you want to hear more good thoughts, this episode of the Ezra Klein Show with Tressie McMillan Cottom is amazing: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-tressie-mcmillan-cottom-transcript.html\n\nAnother thing is that it seems likely that identifying traits that result in them being smart, is much more about what traits result in the the ability to acquire the mental tools and systems that we call \"intelligence\", rather than /having/ intelligence. Because I don't think intelligence is a thing on its own, I think it's a skill.\n\nWhich leads me to the last thing, which is that we might have really good systems for helping people with certain traits acquire intelligence. That's not the same thing as the traits being \"intelligence.\" If there were different systems, different traits would lead to the acquisition of intelligence. \n\nAnd ALSO humans are just not as individual as we like to imagine...we build systems out of people, and our focus on the power of individuals is much more about cognitive bias than it is about reality. \n\nAnd, of course, we know so little about any of this that everyone talking about it is bound to be wrong, including me, about the eventual impacts of gene editing, especially with regards to intelligence. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "title": "A Thought is Not an Idea",
    "description": "Thanks to Simon Vin, the brain behind \"https://dayssincehankgreenlaststartedanewthing.com/\" - You can see more of his work here: https://rith.id.au/\n\nYou can apply for the product lead / cofounder position here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvZpBqJF0540eo5WfPuCM6nk9zhhuCOIwoXXy1ZQOgk78kkA/viewform\n\nI've heard people talk a good deal about how ideas are useless without implementation, but I don't hear many people talking about the fact that an idea isn't even an idea if it doesn't have both an objective and a path to achieve that objective. \n\nIt used to be when someone asked me, \"How do you become a YouTuber / TikToker / whatever\" I would say, \"I don't know, I did that 15 years ago, it's different now.\"\n\nAnd hey, that's true...but it's not useful. What I say now is, \"What do you actually want...it sounds like you have a thought, and that thought is 'that looks like a cool job.' But I need you to have an idea...what's your objective, and what are some things you've noticed that might help you get there.\"\n\nThe other thing that is more and more obvious to me every year is that all three of these things...thoughts, ideas, and implementation are deeply effected by available time, money, relationships, skills, and knowledge. \n\nAs I've gotten more into the world of business, every year I have more money, relationships, skills, and knowledge, and less time. Which makes me think, \"Hey, I should probably be spreading these resources out among people who have more time.\" But that takes TIME! And that's a useful thought \"Hey, I have noticed that as you go through life, most resources increase except free time.\"\n\nAnd that makes me think about how inequality functions, and how older people have hoarded all kinds of capital, not just financial. And that makes me not want to be that person. But those are all thoughts...a way to actually fix it would be a course or book (or just YouTube channel) that shares that knowledge. But because I don't have the time for it, I'd need help with it, and since help would cost money (unless I was treating it like a charity) it now needs new thoughts about how something like that would be marketed, shared, and produced. \n\nAnd then that creates thoughts about whether my insight would actually be valuable in a constantly changing world. \n\nRegardless, it becomes very clear that my thoughts are deeply informed by my experiences and knowledge, my ideas all take into account acquired capital and being able to say, \"Oh, this is solvable with the amount of money I currently have\" is a remarkable power, and implementation is much easier having run a couple businesses for ten years...but, like, sharing and acquiring that knowledge is hard...which I guess is why business school exists? \n\nI wouldn't know. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "description": "In the video I describe a worry that it is selfish to feel nice in a world that remains full of bad things. I'm not sure if selfishness is the right word, but I don't know what the right word is? \n\nI do not want to feel the mix of rage and powerlessness that I often feel. But I do want to remain unsatisfied at the inadequacy of our response to injustice and suffering. I don't know if rage is the right emotion for me, or even anger. I think hunger is a better word...something that primarily motivates me toward action. And part of the cycle of hunger is enjoying eating, right? Like, at the end of a day of hard work, good food is a joy...it's not a stop to the gas station just to fill up the tank, it's a marvel. \n\nThe achievement necessary to get vaccines developed and into people...it could have been better, and rollout remains imperfect, but it's a marvel of humanity. It's something that I believe really deeply that we need to celebrate. Nothing is perfect, but this is really amazing, and I am down to indulge in some good ol' fashioned joy that this is happening. \n\nThat doesn't mean that I'm going to remain satisfied or complacent for the whole rest of my life! There is still much to do, but I kinda want to try and enjoy doing it. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "description": "I guess one other thing that I would say is that the frustration people like me sometimes have about how we don't all use the same systems of measurements or whatever is, like, I get it, it's frustrating. But ultimately, homogeneity had utility when it comes to whether we're talking about kilometers or miles, but there are lots of ways in which it is better for us not to have perfectly fluid, barrier-less communication. \n\nThe deeper societal thing I was thinking about is how there are so many arbitrary communication tools that could speed communication for some people, but actually stand in the way of it for others. Clothes and memes and shows and style and whether you learned about the categorical imperative in college...like all of that stuff can give shared systems for communication and...vibing. But they can also be little speed bumps that exclude people or make you less likely to feel like you're getting along with someone. So they can be arbitrary and useful and harmful all at the same time. Things are complicated! That got too big way too fast to fit it into the video as I had structured it so I gave up!\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "description": "It turns out, from what I can tell, that the reason your glasses get harder to see through, is that globs of sebaceous oil somehow leap from your skin to the inside of your glasses. Those oil globs then prevent light from going directly through the glass, creating the streaks that I am constantly seeing. Which is why you need a glasses cleaner that dissolves oil, not just water and toilet paper. Though, water can be very important, because tiny salt crystals will absolutely scratch your lenses if you rub them around. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "description": "I keep hearing people talk about whether it was Facebook or Fox News or Donald Trump who led us down this deep mess of radicalization. But it's feeling more and more to me like those are all the same things. Donald Trump is the essence of a conservative radio host. Facebook hosts Fox News, Trump's decisions and tweets determine what's on Fox News which determine what he's thinking about, which controls what's happening on Facebook which informs Fox News which informs Donald Trump.\n\nThe deeper mechanism is that, if you let this self-reinforcing feedback loop run, everyone in it gets more radicalized every day. That's true on the left as well, just much less so. Why that is, is easy to speculate about, but I'm certainly not certain. \n\nThis is a real mess we're in, and I think it's important to recognize that social media is just media now. We are all influencers, and we all have a responsibility to use our creation and our attention in ways that aren't destructive. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "title": "How We Teach: Individualist Stories",
    "description": "I'm sorry if this one is dense! Rarely do I feel like I really need more than four minutes, but this time I did!! Two things I've been thinking about:\n\n1. When I say that shared worldviews and knowledge helps us communicate and work together, I don't mean that we CANNOT work together without shared stories...obviously we can! I just think that education provides us with shared knowledge that allows us to work together more effectively. I honestly think this is one of the main benefits of college education...just giving people shared frames to simplify communication. Which, of course, is terrible when higher education is denied to people who can't afford the ludicrous costs and then people are like, \"There's just some reason why it's a little harder to work with people who didn't go to college\" or, worse, \"This person doesn't know about X or Y thing and so they must be stupid\" when, actually, they just didn't get the EXACT SAME education as you, asshole. We need to get better at working with people who do not have shared frames, and that should be part of education.\n\n2. Being the kind of person for whom barriers to success were basically non-existent does NOT mean that success is guaranteed. Both luck and hard work are necessary even when there are no barriers. But the absence of a barrier is not the same thing as luck for me. To me, luck is writing a Harry Potter song that got me invited to a Harry Potter convention that resulted in me meeting a conference organizer who helped me build VidCon. Luck is not being born with enough money in the bank that I never had student loans...while almost all of my peers did have student loans. That's structural inequality. I think getting confused about that can lead to a lot of successful people thinking that, just because they had to work hard AND get lucky, that anyone on earth could have had the same outcome with the same luck and hard work. \n\n3. Oh, and also, turns out there were three. Success is arbitrary and it is what you decide it is and individualist narratives are also narratives that re-inforce a very specific thing as the best possible outcome. While many people find a great deal of satisfaction in lives that won't be written into books AND THEY SHOULD. \n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://pih.org/hankandjohnmatch\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

With whatever the heck we were doing!?!?\n\nAnyway, Pizzamas begins next week!\n\nNote: I made this video yesterday when there was not quite so much NEWS in the world, but honestly I don't know if I would have done anything different. I think it's very early to have many thoughts other than, like, compassion is not forgiveness...it is not something you do for someone else, but something that helps me understand the world better. And when I say I don't want Donald Trump to suffer, that includes with illness, but it also includes me not wanting him to suffer from the way he is terrified any loss of power, or that he mistakes cruelty for toughness, or that he seems to believe that illness is a character flaw. \n\nDonald Trump's suffering has caused suffering in the lives of millions of people, and not wanting him to be ill does not have any affect on whether someone is furious and sad and frustrated by the suffering his suffering has wrought.\n\nAs for what his diagnosis means, I don't know. I am a little sick of the amount of uncertainty this year has brought, but I also don't have much choice in the matter, and I shouldn't pretend to know things when I don't know them. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://secure.pih.org/a/be-the-match-for-sierra-leone\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

    "description": "The thing to remember here is that finding life on another planet tells us one of very two things...and we will be able to figure out which thing pretty quickly. Either:\n\n1. The life will contain clear signals that it is related to life on Earth, which will tell us that life can and does travel between planets. This would be huge, and it we could even potentially track how long it has been since the two lineages diverged.\n\n2. The life will contain clear signals that it is not related to life on Earth, which would tell us that life can arise relatively easily, and mean that the Universe is filled with living systems. It would also allow us to study a living system that is not our's which is one of the most exciting things I can imagine. \n\nBut again, it's entirely possible that life is rare, and that it only arose once in our solar system.

Well, we kinda have, we did an algebra course in partnership with Arizona State University: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_QINscHY3Q\n\nBut also, it's down to a general frustration we have and a disagreement about what to do about that frustration. The frustration is that, if you teach mathematics in a way that will help students do well on tests, that is a very different course from one that focuses on the beauty and joy of math. Crash Course's goal is to always be both of those things at the same time, but we've had a hard time figuring out how to do that. \n\nI'm not saying it's impossible, just that we've hard a really hard time figuring out how to do it. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://secure.pih.org/a/be-the-match-for-sierra-leone\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

The college experience is valuable, and that's a LOT of what people are paying for. I think it's safe to say that, if you're mostly paying for streaming video, $50,000 is too much. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  \nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nLearn more about our project to help Partners in Health radically reduce maternal mortality in Sierra Leone: https://www.pih.org/hankandjohn\nIf you're able to donate $2,000 or more to this effort, please join our matching fund: https://secure.pih.org/a/be-the-match-for-sierra-leone\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org\nBook club: http://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/",

But inspiration is, for me, 99% things I already know and 1% something I'm adding. \n\nThat's fine! That's not something to be ashamed of or to feel like an imposter because you're not really adding anything.

Clint Smith's essay on becoming a parent in the age of Black Lives Matter: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/becoming-a-parent-in-the-age-of-black-lives-matter/612448/\n\n2. Professor Carol Anderson on 1919 and now:\n https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/in-1919-the-state-failed-to-protect-black-americans-a-century-later-its-still-failing\n3. Ibram X. Kendi's \"The American Nightmare.\"\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/american-nightmare/612457/\n4. I also recommend The 1619 Project: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html\n\nBOOKS: Here's a selection of books and essays I've found helpful in learning about racism and its centrality to American life:\nIbram X. Kendi's \"How to Be an Antiracist\" and \"Stamped from the Beginning\"\nCarol Anderson's \"One Person, No Vote\"\nAudre Lorde's \"The Uses of Anger,\" which can be read here: https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1981-audre-lorde-uses-anger-women-responding-racism/ \n(And also Audre Lorde's essay collection \"Sister Outsider\") \nTa-Nehisi Coates's \"We Were Eight Years in Power\"\nToni Morrison's \"The Source of Self-Regard\" \nMari Evans's \"I Am a Black Woman\"\nJames Baldwin's \"The Fire Next Time\" \nCameron McWhirter's \"Red Summer\"\nJacqueline Woodson's \"Who Can Tell My Story,\" which can be read here: https://www.hbook.com/?detailStory=who-can-tell-my-story\nZora Neale Hurston's \"Barracoon\" \nIsabel Wilkerson's \"The Warmth of Other Suns\"\nHarriet Washington's \"Medical Apartheid\"\n\nLastly, some of you have asked us what you can do to help, or what we're doing. I look to leaders in affected communities for those answers; one guide can be found here: https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/# On a personal level, Sarah and I are focused on 1. supporting underfunded public libraries that serve large African American communities, and 2. criminal justice reform, including the misuse of bail to jail people who have not been convicted of a crime. For more info on that, check out https://bailproject.org/\n\nHank has been focused on fundraising for https://www.nlg-npap.org/ but again, we think it's critical to begin philanthropy from a place of listening, and in both our cases, we learned about these organizations and priorities from listening to people affected by anti-Black racism in the U.S., and we are still trying to listen and learn.",

    "description": "Crinoids are freaking great. \n\nMore info on DFTBA! If you have an order that hasn't shipped yet, it will ship, we're just not entirely sure when. The state of Montana has requested nonessential businesses close down until at least April 10th, but it will likely be longer than that. We will re-open! \n\nWe should be able to send out all orders we received up until this morning, but if you had an item on pre-order, that may not ship. If you need to request a refund or something else, our customer service folks are still working! hello@dftba.com\n\nBecause we need to have one person in the warehouse for security reasons, it's possible that a few simple orders (including bizarre beasts shipments) will still go out, but don't hold your breath, it depends on how much work we need to do to keep things stable. \n\nThanks to everyone who has bought stuff from DFTBA.com over the years. We built a reserve fund for a rainy day, and though we did not expect things to get so soggy we will be able to keep our staff paid during this sucky time. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "This video was recorded after our tour got cut short (for obvious and completely understandable reasons.) We're all searching for clear and simple information right now, but while there are lots of things that we know (we need more testing, there are ways to slow spread and that will protect the most vulnerable populations and help keep the healthcare system from being overwhelmed (and they include handwashing, social distancing, and ending large events.)) But there are also a lot of unknowns. And there are lots of people who have reasons for wanting us to think things are more certain than they are...but they just aren't. \n\nBut the outcome does depend on us...but also the outcome depends on us taking care of ourselves and not letting the stress, loneliness, and uncertainty of now control us. Part of that, for me, is reaching out and talking to people...whether that's on the phone or online...but doing it in spaces that are not performative and are not public. That might be a private chat, a video game, a phone call, or just some nice long emails. Find your way and reach out to the people who matter.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "(tour information below)\n\nI just want to settle this and be done with it but, guess what, that's not going to happen. If you haven't seen the video, don't watch it, it's dumb. One person asked another person not to recline, and she didn't....which, to my eyes, is definitely impolite. But then he jiggled and punched and jiggled her chair to try and get her to move, which is shows a lack of coping skills that boggles my mind. \n\nThe recline debate is a perfect one...you are given a seat and you are given a choice...but it is also zero sum...when you recline, you take someone else's space. And so, given the modern airplane seat situation, you are given the choice to inconvenience someone else (and yes, that's really what it is, sorry recliners!) So I come down on understanding that it can be annoying when the seat goes back, but sometimes I understand it's necessary. \n\nWe will face many imperfect situations in our lives, many of them caused by other people, and often we will see those people as acting in unjustified ways but, like, storms are also imperfect, so is illness...we need to see some of these differences of understanding not as flaws, but as simple unavoidable imperfections in society.\n\nAlso, just a note, if you imagine every situation as a battle, you will win more battles, but you will also be constantly losing them.

    "description": "If you want to spend a little time with one of the best pictures humanity has ever taken, you can do it at this website right here: http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/glimpse360/aladin\n\nThe Spitzer mission ended this week after more than a decade of operation. When it first launched, in order to eliminate all sources of infrared radiation, the telescope had a store of liquid helium on board that kept it just two degrees warmer than interstellar space. Eventually, that helium ran out, and it kept doing its mission, but eventually its ability to take these amazing photos degraded and now the mission has ended. \n\nPart of the reason it created this amazing image was to map out potential candidates for future examination by other telescopes, particularly the James Webb Space Telescope which will launch (fingers crossed) in March of 2021. It's also an IR telescope, so it will give us even better views of our galaxy (and others.)\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "The third season of The Good Place made me think a lot of things. Like, too many for a four minute video, but also, I think I managed to shove a lot in here. \n\nOne thing I didn't get it as that there's actually a bad side to the way folks like me like to engage with the world. There's the curiosity about why the world is the way that it is, that's good. There's a desire to make the world better, that's good. But there is also a real interest in, like, just finding reasons why things are bad. It's a cognitive bias towards \"the world sucks\" and I kinda hate it. It's generally strongest in backlash to the popularity of something, and I kinda hate it. \n\nI think people can sometimes conflate a desire to care for the world with a desire to tear down LITERALLY EVERYTHING. And when people actually do get off on tearing things down just for the fun of it, it delegitimizes the real problems. Folks who like to see things in a fairly simple way see that behavior and they think, \"Oh, that's just liberals, they hate everything.\"\n\nWe need to do more than hate, we need to see the world through more than just the lens of judgement and objectivism.

Sierra Leone has the highest maternal mortality rate in the world, and one of the highest child mortality rates, and we believe that can change with long-term investments in Sierra Leone's healthcare system. The project will be announced later this month, and this video explores some of the why.\n\nThanks to Jon Lascher at Partners in Health for the pictures of the Koidu Government Hospital before PIH arrived, and for taking a look at this script.

    "description": "A balanced carbon cycle produces as much CO2 as O2, and yet, there are 209,460 ppm of oxygen in the atmosphere and only 440 ppm of CO2 (up from the recent baseline of 275).\n\nMy first thought was that the CO2 is temporarily stored in vegetation, but the vegetative carbon sink doesn't store anywhere near enough CO2 to affect the O2 levels in the atmosphere. If we burned ALL THE VEGEATATION ON EARTH the oxygen concentration of the planet would drop by less than 1%. \n\nThe CO2 storage of live vegetation is massively important for global warming, but it has no effect on our ability to breathe. \n\nSO WHY CAN WE BREATHE!? I got curious, so I made this video.\n\nThanks to this article for starting me on the path to making this video: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/no-the-amazon-fires-wont-deplete-the-earths-oxygen-supply-heres-why\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "This is a thing that is happening right now, and (taking a page from the global warming playbook) a think I've been hearing from Bolsonaro's supporters is, \"Who even knows how bad it is...deforestation is actually down.\"\n\nIt's so sad to watch us play with words and numbers when the reality is obvious to anyone with eyes. \"Deforestation\" is down because when you don't count burning, and we don't know how much land has been burned because it's still burning and determining the extent of a forest fire is extremely labor intensive. It takes time to do these surveys. But what we do know for sure is that the number of fires is up all over the Amazon. \n\nAnd we also know that Bolsonaro's government had decreased inspections dramatically, put military officials in charge of environmental organizations, and fired every scientist who publicly disagrees with him. \n\nThere has never been a greater reminder that nationalism is a disaster of an ideology, and that how we imagine the world and who we end up voting for matters. A lot. \n\nMORE INFO\nhttps://theintercept.com/2019/07/06/brazil-amazon-rainforest-indigenous-conservation-agribusiness-ranching/\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/08/01/deathwatch-for-the-amazon\n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010JD015174\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3OWgb0Bv-A\n\nhttps://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/5-ways-help-amazon-rainforest?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic-social&utm_content=2208amazonfire&utm_term=organic-social&pc=GLJ002001\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DrJoeHanson/status/1164243637250732032\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/amazonian-rainforest-near-unrecoverable-tipping-point\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49212115\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! https://nerdfighteria.com/nerdfighteria-newsletter\nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "In which John discusses The Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s, a story from U.S. History he learned about only recently. SOURCES:\n\nThe most comprehensive history of this period I found is a book called Decade of Betrayal by Francisco E. Balderrama and Raymond Rodriguez. It was there I first learned the story of Jose Lopez.\n\nThe wikipedia article about The Repatriation of the Great Depression-era is quite good: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Repatriation\n\nThe 2017 paper that found the deportations either has no impact on U.S. unemployment or else made it slightly worse: https://www.nber.org/papers/w23885\n\nThis NPR story connects some of the current concerns about immigration to the Repatriation: https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/08/437579834/mass-deportation-may-sound-unlikely-but-its-happened-before\n\nThis analysis found that a majority of the most commonly used U.S. history textbooks do not mention the deportations that occurred during the Depression: https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2006-04-04-history-books_x.htm\n\nI got the map in this video from this page that is also a good introduction to the land annexation that happened due to the Mexican-American War and the Gadsden Purchase: http://www.thomaslegion.net/americancivilwar/mexicancessionlessonstudentsandkids.html\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "I'm not an economist...and I don't actually know how to define value, but I know that fewer people taking medicine while more money gets made is /not/ creating value because it means there's more pain and suffering in the world. I think we, more than anything, need to realize that the definition of value is something that isn't settled. \n\nSorry if this isn't what you were expecting. Ultimately, the money we have to spend is the best money we spend...but if there aren't systems in place to drive down the costs of those needs, we will spend everything we have on them. Those sources of extreme value: health, education, and housing being the big ones, can't be treated as if every drop of value should be extracted because, if that happens, the person will be impoverished by that system.\n\nCheck out Mariana Mazzucato's work wherever you can find it.\nhttps://marianamazzucato.com/\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "I got to see an Ocean Sunfish (Mola mola) up close and personal at the Monterey Bay Aquarium recently and I fell in love. These things are the superlative of superlatives. They are the biggest bony fish, they lay the most eggs of any vertebrate, and grow the most from egg to full size of any vertebrate. Yes, they're silly looking, but the whole thing about evolution is, whether we can figure out why or not, things don't survive if they aren't good at /something/.\n\nSea turtles and mola mola, despite having deeply different lineages, actually share a lot of characteristics. They have the same shaped flippers, they both have beaks, they both rely on their size to protect them, and they both create lots of babies in the hopes that only a few will survive (though, Mola mola take this to a different level.) They're also both basically the same shape, which is super weird.\n\nAnd here's a wild thing, even though sea turtles evolved from land-dwelling reptiles, mola mola-like fish have actually been around for 100 million years while sea turtles have been around for over 200 million years. \n\nNow, I'm just guessing here, but this is possibly because they share a food source. That food source is low quality but abundant. It also doesn't move fast. So the mola mola evolved not for speed, but for efficiency. These flippers (like the ones that turtles and mola have) don't move you fast, but they also don't use much energy. \n\nThe fecundity of sunfish might also have something to do with the variability of their prey. Jellies are notorious for being extremely abundant year and then disappearing the next. In a situation like that,  you want to have the ability to rapidly increase your population and rapidly reach the age of maturity so that you can take advantage of prey population explosions.\n\nResearch Assistance from Deboki Chakravarti\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "TOUR DETAILS: https://www.hankgreen.com/events\n\nOnce I started thinking about this video, I saw more of these lies at every turn. They're common in political speech, and insidious in their usefulness. Often, once you click on the headline or watch the video, you even find out that you had taken the wrong message from the headline. And then, in that case, you feel like it's your fault that you misunderstood...but let me tell you, no one things as much about headlines and titles as the people who write them. They know /exactly/ what they're doing. \n\nAnd you might think, \"But if it's explained in the article...no one got hurt, right?\" Except that the vast majority of people who see a headline do not read the article...the headline IS CONTENT and needs to be treated that way. \n\nThe innocuous headlie is REALLY common on YouTube. Video titles like, \"We need to talk...\" or \"I'm done with this!\" create the lie that a big deal is happening, which makes you click...and find out that, like, their swimming pool has a leak. Like, I've done that, and I feel less bad about it when the lie someone might walk away with isn't about, like, global warming or the future of America.\n\nI just think we need more precise language than \"clickbait\" because sometimes, clickbait isn't bad...and there are lots of different ways clickbait works.

    "description": "This video was so dang fun to research, which, of course, I feel super guilty about because, like, real people died. But, after watching the HBO miniseries, I knew there was more to the science of this. I've also heard a lot of stuff from both credible and non-credible sources that just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The idea of the \"graphite tipped rods\" for example is just a simplification for broad audiences. But I've also heard smart folks talk about how RBMK reactors have a positive /fuel/ temperature coefficient, which is not true. No nuclear reactors do, since fuel that reacted more as it got hot would be the kind of thing that would explode every time. \n\nHowever, for a moment, because water had become such a vital part of the neutron absorption in the reactor, it did have a positive temperature coefficient...meaning that getting hotter made it hotter which made it hotter which made it hotter. That's a coefficient for the entire reactor, and it's due to the \"positive void coefficient\" where, as the water got hotter, it got less good at absorbing neutrons. \n\nUsually that would be more than counter-acted by the negative fuel temperature coefficient, which is why they thought it couldn't explode...but it was not in this particular circumstance. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

This is the very kind of increase that is terrible news because coal fired power plants have long lives and, once built, they tend to burn at full capacity for decades in order to pay for themselves. \n\nAn increase in (regulated) fracking in Asia could help with an immediate end to new coal plants in China and India, which is probably the most important short-term goal to help curb the climate crisis. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

They also don't just grow the jellyfish, they have huge tanks of algae that they feed to the tiny animals that the jellyfish eat.

Ultimately, what we're dealing with here isn't simple in terms of causes, problems, or solutions. We do see that economics are already making renewables more attractive. That is the path of least resistance, but it is also the slowest way to go. \n\nWe need governments to take action but that is an extremely tall order with a global crisis and competitive nations. Will this ultimately be a force that drives us apart? Or will it be something that brings us together. \n\nThere is actually a more positive way of looking at the outcome of Game of Thrones thus far...a common enemy brought an end to some, but not all petty squabbling. And maybe the unification brought by an external threat created an alliance that will show that one last squabbler a very bad time. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

No. It's all business, and I think employees at every level should be given the capacity and the tools to understand the value of the work they are doing, and what role they play in a business. I also think that we should be opening the door to allowing more people who aren't like, passionate about becoming billionaires to be interested and aware of how business works. \n\nI recognize that I come at this from a somewhat bizarre and very privileged perspective, but I deeply want more diversity in business...and I don't mean \"people of all genders and skin colors\" I mean \"people who don't all subscribe to the particular worldview you are presented with in business school\" (though, for clarity, I think having people of all genders and skin colors and backgrounds would HELP WITH THAT A LOT).\n\nANYWAY!

    "description": "I thought this video was going to be a fun top ten list, then I realized that most of the theft in America is the rich robbing the poor. Literally! Not even in a roudabout way...literally not paying them for more than twenty billion dollars of work every year. This literally theft. No one goes to jail. Ever. It's cool. Don't worry...we have a minimum wage...ish.\n\nThe folks who defend wage theft say that:\n\n1. Minimum wages prevent certain work from getting done...like work done by undocumented immigrants and the very very poor. These people wouldn't have jobs at all otherwise! The laws are too strict! \n\n2. Most wage theft is just poor management. The companies don't know it's happening! It's just the floor managers who are causing these problems!

    "description": "So, today I went in for a routine medical procedure, and I wanted to talk about it to:\n\n1. Remove some stigma\n2. Give some advice\n3. Make it clear that preventative medicine is important!\n\nMy procedure went great and Katherine filmed about 6 minutes of me being an absolute dork...I have provided only a few select bits for you. I still have moderate inflammation in my distal colon, which is normal for me, but still something we'd like to try and treat. At the moment (for other IBD people) I'm on Mesalamine (anti-inflammatory) and allopurinol (immunomodulator.) I was diagnosed in 2005 and, after first being diagnosed and getting it under control, have had either mild, moderate, or no symptoms on and off. \n\nBut IBD certainly isn't the only reason to get a colonoscopy! In fact, everyone should get one on their 50th, 60th, and 70th birthdays (unless there's a risk factor.)\n\nMy only advice...treat yourself well on your prep day, know that you're not going to be able to do much, and know that you can do the thing!! \n\nMusic in the video is Sampo B-1201BW from\nhttps://andrewhuang.bandcamp.com/album/tv-video-games\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "There was a time when we thought we were going to move our explainers off of our main channel and build a business making just explainers. But it turns out they're just tremendously difficult and expensive to make, especially when you don't have the charisma of a known and trusted face to fall back on in the moments when you don't have full-screen graphics. \n\nThat project, sadly, died in favor of us spending more time on Crash Course and SciShow. \n\nI think it's very important to understand what a powerful rhetorical tool an \"explainer\" can be when it is used to convince rather than explain, and how easy it is to make a bad explainer and have relatively few people notice. \n\nIt's also really important to ask ourselves why we trust the voices we trust, how that trust was earned, and constantly examine whether that trust is worthwhile. There are many ways to get information right now, and we can and SHOULD be very choosy!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "title": "Does \"The Press\" Hate YouTube?",
    "description": "Ultimately, news is mostly news when it's bad. When it's more nuanced, it tends to be for smaller audiences that are aware of a topic. This is a thing. I remember when YouTube culture was first growing, there were a fair number of positive articles about YouTubers. It was so new that it's very existence was interesting. We're in a different time now, largely because of how influential and popular the platform has become. \n\nUltimately, people who care about YouTube don't read a lot of legacy publications, which those publications automatically have:\n\n1. Some amount of antagonism toward YouTube because they might be frustrated by their loss of market share to people who don't have the same level of rigor, accountability, or professional training they do.\n\n2. An audience that has a very simple understanding of the platform, and so is not interested in nuanced takes. \n\nSo if the articles are negative it's because:\n\n1. Maybe antagonism, though I think that's the smallest part.\n\n2. They're creating content that their audience will be interested in (which is what we're all doing.)\n\n3. Negative news is actually the more interesting, uncommon, and important stuff and there are reams of research and discussion about this and it's nothing new. \n\nBut it's also vital to remember that \"The Press\" is extremely broad. That many of these articles were actually vitally important. That one bad OpEd doesn't destroy the reputation of an entire publication. That a few bad articles doesn't destroy the reputation of the ENTIRE INSTITUTION OF THE PRESS WHICH WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY DEVASTATED WITHOUT.\n\nIt's also important to note that, guess what, I am also \"The Press\" and I have no points of accountability outside myself before I push publish, and neither do most of the big, culturally influential YouTube channels. Giving over 100% of our media consumption to single-perspective, unaccountable, untrained YouTubers is...it's bad. We shouldn't do it. Even as much as I really really love many of them.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "We didn't build good security into the telecom system because we didn't anticipate that, someday, scammers would be able to call thousands of people per minute, because before computers, that idea was completely ludicrous. \n\nAn important thing to remember is that anyone who calls you when your name is on the Do Not Call list is breaking the law. But there is no good way to find them as they can disappear as fast as they appear.\n\nWe have had to change a lot of how telecommunications law works to start combatting this, and absolutely it could have happened faster if telecom companies and the government weren't resistant to change. But it's also a hard problem to solve. We've built this system, and it works really well all day long every day...we just made it work too well...so well that it really isn't that hard to set up a robocalling scam...which is why a thousand or so people have done it...thus making all our lives miserable. \n\nBut as I say in the video, if you only need 1000 people out of 300,000,000 to ruin something for money...they're gonna do it. \n\nHere are some articles I read:\nThis one's real long but gives a lot of good background\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/how-robo-call-moguls-outwitted-the-government-and-completely-wrecked-the-do-not-call-list/2018/01/09/52c769b6-df7a-11e7-bbd0-9dfb2e37492a_story.html\n\nShort and older article/NPR story, but still relevant. \nhttps://www.npr.org/2015/11/18/456355120/why-it-s-hard-to-put-an-end-to-unwanted-robocalls\n\nWhat Phone companies can do but aren't\nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/phone-companies-can-filter-out-robocalls-they-just-arent-doing-it/\n\nThis one also has tips on how to stop them if you care enough\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-youre-getting-so-many-spam-phone-calls-2018-10-12\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

So the money DFTBA.com makes is profit from providing services to creators (including Complexly.) Complexly (and all of our other creators) will keep making money as normal. So DFTBA's profit is going to PIH, while the money Vlogbrothers makes from selling stuff is still going to Complexly as it's an important part of how we keep the lights on!\n\nBusiness is fun!

    "title": "What is Burnout?",
    "description": "If you take anything away from it, it should only be that burnout isn't one thing, and that you can learn more about what you're experiencing by asking yourself if it's a fuel problem or an opportunity problem. Fuels can be addressed by finding a new story to tell yourself. Opportunity is harder to address, it takes longer, and sometimes, because of the deep inequality in our societies, cannot be addressed. \n\nThis is the article everyone is talking about: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work\n\nAnd here's a good one from Slate in response: https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/01/burnout-millennials-capitalism-buzzfeed-essay.html\n\nAnd here's a video from my friend Rosianna: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPztftCyKDU\n\nA lot of discussion around burnout is pretty specific to people who have opportunity, but have been sold the wrong kind of fuel for too long. Being grateful for and recognizing the opportunities we've been given is, I think, very important. \n\nI also think it's important to find good fuel and do good work and work hard. I don't love the idea that burnout is a problem of being over-worked. I think it's more a problem of being overly convinced that work is the most valuable (or even only valuable) thing we do in our lives. It's especially important in our twenties, and the American reliance on all-capitalism-all-the-time is, I think, a really big part of how people have used that situation to exploit workers and put them in situations that are unsustainable. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

    "description": "It's no surprise that de-humanizing thieves is easy, they de-humanized us first. But when Mark Rober let us get inside of some package thieves houses and cars...I felt a little like they weren't what I expected...even if I didn't know exactly what I expected.\n\nThat left me at a loss...so I decided to talk to a few people...some who had engaged in package theft and one psychologist, Dr. Robert Tyminski, who wrote \"The Psychology of Theft and Loss.\" I've come away from that feeling like I understand this phenomenon a lot better, though I still feel like it's way more complicated than I really get. And as I say in the video, understanding this behavior does not excuse it, and this behavior still makes me really frustrated and mad. \n\nMark Rober's Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxhDk-hwuo\n\nDr. Tyminsky's book: https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Theft-Loss-Stolen-Fleeced/dp/0415830893\n\nAndrew Huang's new album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0nvEn4Mpg\n\nThe full conversation between me and Dr. Tyminski: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOIQefDSvtk\n\nAnd here's what was up with two of the situations being staged (From Mark Rober)\n\"I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help. To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package. It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the 'thieves' were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.\"\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\nListen to The Anthropocene Reviewed at http://www.theanthropocenereviewed.org\nListen to Dear Hank and John at http://www.dearhankandjohn.org",

Like, there is an obligation that comes along with having an audience, and also one that comes along with being a respected member of a community.

As someone who has a LOT of advantages, it is very clear to me that I have them. But I also think that everyone watching this, just by virtue of having access to high speed internet, also has a lot of advantages that might not be as obvious. \n\nAs I say in the video, if you spend time with people who have your same advantages, they don't seem like advantages. And then when someone comes along and tells you that your normal is actually inequality, that can feel like an attack...like Heath finding out that he's ripped up Snickers' wedding flowers. Heath, in that moment, felt attacked by Snickers....like the guilt was something Snickers was doing, not something Heath's own mind was doing to attempt to help him behave differently in the future. \n\nAt least, that's the really drawn out metaphor I've decided to go with, I guess!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "The Rigged Election",
    "description": "President Trump exercises his power by having no concern for the truth. It's OK for him to lie because he sees lying as a way of flexing. He lies, the media fact checks, he laughs. It's not about reality, it's about winning. I've started to understand that I live in that world...where, for my president, the truth isn't interesting. A firehose of lies, and an army of perplexed fact checkers, signifying nothing. \n\nBut when the lies turn to rot in the foundation of the system, when what sounds good to Trump one day is talking about how an election where he loses isn't a legitimate election, that's where it gets scary. It gets scary because, in one way, it's nothing new...of course President Trump lies about voter fraud, he lies about everything. \n\nAnd yet, on the other hand, it still shocks me, because the people who love him were supposed to love America...the constitution...tradition. The moment he started saying things like, \"If we lose, it's rigged\" I thought that would mean something to them. But it doesn't seem like it does. It seems like they love a strongman who looks powerful, even if that strongman is breaking the one fundamental institution that our government is based on by calling on his followers to not accept the outcome of an election that he doesn't win. \n\nAre you registered to vote: https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/\n\nDo you know how you want to vote: ballotready.org/\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

John is always such a kind and thoughtful and careful person, but so many of the GIFs in this list were him being angry or upset or frustrated...of course GIFs are in many ways units of emotion, and so of course emotion is going to be conveyed in them, but I think it says something that the most common emotions were forms of anger. \n\nAlso, someone please explain the book sniffing to me!!\n\nVidCon Australia: http://vidconaustralia.com/\n\nVidCon London: https://vidconlondon.com/\n\nPodCon: https://www.podcon.com/\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Looking for a job is the absolute worst. The people giving the jobs have to do everything they can to be efficient, while the people who want the jobs (and aren't being paid to apply for them) need to do so much work to try and convince the other person that they're worth hiring. It's a huge power imbalance, but there's no other way for it to work (as far as I can tell, anyway.)\n\nRejection is super awful and every time I've applied for a job and not gotten an interview I felt terrible. Every time I got an interview and didn't get the job, I felt even worse. But when you find the right position, it can be really wonderful. Let's be honest about the actual situation, which is that not getting a job has no bearing on your worth as a person, and it's completely possible, likely even, that the company ended up hiring the wrong person.\n\nBut they have limited resources and had to make a call.

    "description": "I don't think having a following on the internet means you have to never engage or defend yourself. But I think that you have to behave differently than you would if you didn't have a following. And I know that thinking about this from the perspective of the person in the robot suit is like, \"Oh, boo hoo, you're rich and famous I'm so sorry someone was mean to you once.\" But now that the internet exists, occasionally the once infathomable distance between a few people chatting in their social space and a super mainstream celebrity, occasionally collapses to literally no distance at all.\n\nCelebrities don't feel like anything more than people...they look in the mirror and see their soft, squishy bodies. So when they walk in on a group of people saying terrible things, it's understandable that they would react. But those people are seeing the robot suit, not the person. \n\nBut I think we should realize that we're all wearing robot suits these days, and that we're all a lot more powerful than we think we are. It's very easy to go too hard these days, whether you've been building your suit for a decade or whether you're just a simple quiet person with a Twitter account. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Esther Earl died in 2010, and when her family asked her how she would like to be remembered on her birthday, she gave the most good answer possible and said she wanted us to celebrate love among family and friends. Which is why, Every August 3rd, people take a moment to say \"I love you\" to the people they care about.\n\nNone of these problems are new, but it just gets harder to believe that strangers are worth investing time in as you get older. That's not a true belief, but it is a belief. And it's one of the reasons why community organizations (like churches, clubs, or volunteer orgs) provide so much value. They give us ways to imagine strangers as having more value, and provide shortcuts to finding people we'll be more likely to mesh with. School and work can also provide those services. \n\nBut when we're exposed to /so many/ people that seem so valuable and cool through social media (either because they really are living exceptional lives or because they are only showing the exceptional parts) we lose sight that what makes people big deals isn't their lifestyle or how exceptional their job is...it's just that they are people. If we could remember that, I think it would be a lot easier to make and maintain friendships as adults.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "All of this is much easier to see in retrospect, which I think is telling. It's hard to see bias in the moment, and it's easy to feel justified in simplifying the stories of your adversaries when you're in the middle of what you see as a war. But that's why it's good to look back at things like this. \n\nI think it's fine to create content for any age that accurately portrays the difficulties we face as a species...that's a completely apolitical act. But while the creators of Captain Planet will tell you that each of the villains represents the extremes, not the norms, none of those things are (at least in the beginning) modeled in nuanced ways. I am particularly troubled by the portrayal of the laborers as sub-human. It's one thing for billionaire Looten Plunder to be terrible (and yes, his pony tail is appropriately grotesque) but modeling the people who are laboring as garbage collectors or machine operators as monsters, at this point, downright pisses me off. \n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Just so exciting! \n\nAlso, when I say \"this\" ends in death, I think I mean \"everything eventually\" and not so much \"vlogbrothers.\" Obviously, I am very uncomfortable with the idea that the vlogbrothers channel will end in the death of one of us and I don't know how to feel about that, which is, I guess, a pretty big part of the human experience. \n\nIf you find the hammer please let me know so that people will know it's been found.

While she has been in those TV shows I mentioned, most of her work is in theater, which you can find out about here: http://theteamplays.org/\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Why is the Disney \"D\" So Weird?",
    "description": "I am so bummed that this video isn't 15 minutes long. There is so much more to discuss. The Disney brand is fascinating, including the ways in which that brand reaches so far beyond any set of words or bands and into a deep cultural idea. It is, in some ways, outside of what we usually consider a brand, and in other ways maybe the most powerful brand outside of, like, nation states. \n\nThanks to these people for their knowning or un-knowing help:\nKevin from http://www.youtube.com/defunctland\nLindsay from https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube\nPencil Bandit: https://pencilbandit.com/shop\nKade Fisher: https://www.deviantart.com/jarvisrama99/art/Disney-Signature-Logo-Evolution-680691589\n\nHere's a good tidbit I had to cut from this video...in 1922, which Ubbe Iwerks (co-creator of Mickey Mouse) first met Walt Disney, Walt was 19 years old and was literally practicing variations on his signature! Disney's constant variation of his signature apparently started at an early age, and the piece of his signature that he seemingly couldn't settle on was the D. In the end, it was likely not Disney who created this iconic D, but someone working at the company after his death. \n\nWalt Disney was obsessed with the \"Disney\" image...with his own image and that of his creations. That was certainly unhealthy. It also probably had some seriously negative consequences on him and the people around him. But it also played a part in creating something wonderful.\n\nI REALLY HOPE I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING TOO WRONG IN THIS VIDEO!\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

That denominator is something that unifies us, and so I'm going to try to watch some World Cup this year. I don't know how on Earth I'm going to find the time to do that, but I did just buy a temporary TV subscription so I could get it. \n\nThanks John.\n\nI hope this video is broadly unifying.

    "description": "Oh My....you're in the description. So, the way I tended to deal with the question of free will in my earlier days was that I of course make decisions, it's just inevitable that I will make the decision I made. The fact that it was inevitable did not make it not a decision. The fact that it could be pre-determined what I would do with my free will did not mean I didn't have free will.\n\nOf course, it did. To me that seems like a palliative. Now, instead, I just choose to not accept something that I know is true. I do the same thing with regard to universal meaning and my inevitable demise. And, honestly, there a trillion other truths I ignore every day, so I think it's OK.\n\nI also recognize that the question of Free Will is far from settled among the philosophers and scientists and physicists and all of those people. This isn't a \"does free will exist\" video, it's a \"here's how I react to the fact that lots of people thing it doesn't\" video. And so, maybe this video shouldn't have been called intentionally ignorant maybe it should have been called \"I don't want to know!\"\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

First, our world in data is an AMAZING resource: http://ourworldindata.org\n\n1. The world population divided into tenths: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8j2rso/each_section_has_10_of_the_worlds_population/\n\n2. Peru and Somalia are bigger than you might expect: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8jif61/the_true_sizes_of_peru_and_the_usa_with/ and \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8f5vua/the_true_size_of_somalia/\n\n3. Mean years of schooling have risen worldwide: https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education\n\n4. CO2 emissions over time have risen. https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions\n\n5. So has the temperature almost everywhere on Earth: https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/11/graphics-climate-change\n\n6. This fascinating map of global borders shows how new most nation states are, and how recent their borders were established: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/7ndxz9/i_tried_to_find_the_date_of_origin_for_every/\n\n7. A dramatic increase in the percentage of births attended by trained healthcare workers has contributed to a dramatic decline in maternal mortality worldwide: https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality\n\n8. I'm not one of those people who think we're on the verge of conquering death, but we are delaying death significantly, although much work remains to be done, especially among impoverished communities. But in the last 35 years, life expectancy has increased by over ten years in most nations. Nothing like this has ever happened before--we've never seen a consistent, worldwide increase in life expectancy. Like, never. So that is worth celebrating. https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy\n\nIf you want to email me about sponsorship: sparksflyup -at- gmail.

It's a good job, but it's also a job that not everyone can have or should have. And I think, when we want something too much, we end up doing it even when it turns out we don't actually like it...or we do it in a way that isn't productive because it feels like winning even when it's destructive. \n\nA thing I've noticed a lot about creators who have come up recently (the ones I spend time loving, anyway) is that they've spent time developing either a craft (which includes film making and story telling) or other skills and knowledge that allow them to build a channel as, like, a professional gamer, an artist, an animator, even a linguist or an engineer. It's still hard...but that stuff tends to require less work and a less cut-throat attitude because you can find smaller niches that are still great and supportive and exciting. \n\nI've had such a crazy run on this platform, and in the public eye...and I think I've come out of it with a pretty stable identity and healthy attitude...I hope I can find good ways to help other people deal with both getting big and not getting big in this odd new world.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Edibles have different effects than smoking which has different effects from vaping. Different strains have different amounts of THC and CBD and that matters. These are both psycho-active compounds and they both have effects on your brain. That's why they get you high, but the highs are different and the effects (and thus potential negative side-effects are different.)\n\nBut it's also very hard to even STUDY marijuana because it's illegal...so this is both another reason to decriminalize (to make research easier) and a reason why it's more complicated (we don't know for sure how many of the negative effects we've teased out. \n\nWhat We Know about Marijuana\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yewlM8CtbQU\n\nWhy is Weed Illegal?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJlqsdezhhk\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

It wasn't clear until 2016, but my biggest concern is that we're still only at the beginning of this. It turns out that affecting human perspective is not all that complicated.\n\nRight now, we're at the point where computers have gotten good at teaching themselves to keep our attention with content that humans are creating. I'm deeply worried about what happens when the computers get good at not just serving up, but creating the content. Advertisers are already working on that exact technology, and if it helps them sell detergent fine. \n\nBut if it gets good at selling ideas, we'll be in a new era of human history. I don't know if Congress will be savvy enough to regulate that, and I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg will be good enough or even powerful enough to control it.\n\nThanks to John and Taha Khan (https://www.youtube.com/user/KhanStopMe) for advising me on this and helping me get things right. \n\nThanks to Grant from Three Blue One Brown for the neural network image.

    "description": "There is literally an entire book about these two letters: http://amzn.to/2GyJyla\n\nIs OK the most popular word in the world? That depends on how you look at it. It's been argued that it's the most /spoken/ word in the world, but I have to call BS on that. The most spoken word has got to be \"the\" or \"I\" or the equivalent in Mandarin. \n\nBut Popular is a more subjective measure...and one that I'm choosing because I think that \"OK\"s adoption as a loanword is so extremely common. Now, there may be words that have been adopted into more languages...I'm thinking of \"taxi.\" But \"OK\" is adopted for everyday conversational use, whereas \"taxi\" is only for specific situations. So that's the completely subjective argument I'm using to say that \"OK\" is the most popular world in the world.\n\nSo, something that didn't fit into the video...we think of memes as these new-fangled things, and definitely the way they spread now (and the speed at which they spread) is different, but acronyms from comical mis-spellings indicate that memes have been around for a long time, we just didn't call them memes. And the fact that the Democratic Party latched onto one to try and promote a candidate that had a less-than-american-sounding feels much more 2018 than 1838 to me. Van Buren was actually the first president who wasn't of British ancestry (or British himself) which was a big deal at the time. \n\nAnother thing I didn't get into the video...the creation of OK a little bit depended on our society becoming more text-based and literate. Telegrams helped this, but newspapers did as well. The extent to which these technologies revolutionized our society and our ability to communicate fast and wide is really hard to understand now, but is maybe the kind of thing we should be thinking about as our own world is being revolutionized by new communication technologies. We don't know, ultimately, what the affect will be. But they will be long-ranging and maybe invisible, just as OK has been for the last 175 years. \n\n\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "I could have kept making this video for days...but I think the biggest, most interesting thing I left out is that having certainty about what is valuable and awesome and cool is really great. Knowing without question that every moment I sunk into loving that band was /worth it/ was really nice...it meant I didn't have to fret about whether I was wasting in my time.\n\nThese days, we really REALLY value being able to make our own individual minds up about every single thing, but I kinda miss the days when I could just deeply and suddenly believe that whatever John thought was cool was cool. It was less effort, but also less stressful. I think the way we're living right now is definitely the weird way, and it results in a whole lot of stress and anxiety and maybe sometimes even depression. \n\nI'm not saying we should go back to living in a world where whatever the leader of the tribe said was the thing to do was THE THING TO DO OR YOU DIED. But maybe a little bit more faith in other people's tastes would be a little more relaxing. \n\nOK!

    "title": "The Best (Recent) Book Covers Including MINE!",
    "description": "Pre-Order now :-) http://www.hankgreen.com\n\nOK, this is exciting and scary. So, while I wait for the time at which we are all coordinated for this thing to go live let me tell you how this worked.\n\nFirst, the designer got the manuscript, then they read it, then they sent me three sample covers that I did not like. They were obviously rough mockups, but I didn't like the direction. There was good energy, but all of the fonts were hand-written and, honestly, I wanted it to look visibly distinct from a John Green book. \n\nSo then I sent them a few things: \n1. Three images that I really liked that were not book covers. They all had bold colors, repeating patterns, and felt illustrated but now hand-drawn.\n\n2. A few of my favorite recent book covers.\n\n3. A few lines, less than 400 words about what I really hoped for that included this sentence: \"Getting the mix between high energy and fun and deadly serious is something I thought a lot about when writing, and it's hard, but it may be an impossible thing to hope for in a cover design.\"\n\nThen a few weeks went by during which time I was assured that a lot of time and thought were going into sending a long a more finished product that took my thoughts into account. I feel very lucky that I got to have this much feedback.\n\nWhat I then got in my email was five designs...three of which were color variations on the final product. And I was like, \"YES! THIS!\" but then of course I had some thoughts. I asked for some other color treatments, and I also suggested adding the eyes to one of the Carls, which I think is a very cool touch. In the end, I went with one of the original color schemes but was glad I had seen the others anyway. And with a couple of very very minor finishing thoughts we had it. \n\nI have a lot more thoughts on covers and I could critique great design all day, but I only had four minutes. I feel bad that there are so many great covers out there (and on my bookshelf right now) that I didn't get to talk about, but there are only so many minutes in a vlogbrothers video and only so many hours in a day!\n\nThanks everybody, I hope you like it!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Dear Young People, You Terrify Me",
    "description": "Once I started writing this video I realized that there was a great deal that I wasn't going to be able to fit into a 4 minute video. There are times, like when I'm watching a Logan Paul video or reading about Tide Pod challenges that the natural response for an older adult is to just overwhelming anxiety for next generation.\n\nAnd, indeed, I've watched as bad ideas (much worse than tide pods) have taken over young people in a way I did not expect and am extremely stressed out by. I worry a lot about people who figure out how to capture this energy for their own gain and do not consider the responsibility that their power brings, or think that they are righteous when they are in fact leaning into culturally destructive ideas.\n\nBut also, I have found the level of responsibility pretty paralyzing. John and I have both been shying away from cultural criticism on this channel because, like, I feel more and more drawn to stability and that means compassion for people who are intolerant, but don't necessarily know they are. And I feel like people often (maybe rightfully, I don't know) get roasted for that kind of behavior. \n\nSo this video was a surface-level discussion of a deeper and more intense thing that I've been experiencing, and that is pushing me a little bit away from four-minute explorations of culture because:\n\n1. I don't know if I have the guts to put myself on the line for things that I completely recognize I might be wrong about.\n\n2. I don't know if internet-based, echo-chamber-riddled discussion about any of these things is actually helping. \n\nAlso, a thing I cut from this is how, just like genetic mutations usually do nothing, I believe we can freak out about cultural changes that actually have no real effect on people. And sometimes the changes are absolutely negative. The way brains are set up after new dopamine channels open around puberty to when the frontal cortex finishes developing in the mid-20s is a recipe for indulging in bad ideas, and individuals certainly suffer when that carries them to the wrong place. Culture at large can suffer as well. \n\nBut it can also mean great things...great change...great action. And that's how I'm feeling right now. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

A little about how Missoula treats these maker stamps. Everyone sorta unanimously tries to protect them, so you'll walk around and entire sidewalks will have been replaced, but the one square that has the makers stamp will have been left, even if it's a little cruddy and eroded and cracked. Sometimes, when they have to be replaced, people will even cut the stamp out and sink it in the ground next to the sidewalk. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "This is a really wonderful and important article: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/ophelia-dahls-national-health-service\n\nDFTBA Pin Pals: https://store.dftba.com/products/dftba-pin-pals\n\nNerdfighteria Census: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9fS7vUP-yw&feature=youtu.be\n\nThanks, Sean!!\n\nI say in this video that I can't even actually endorse bitcoin because I see a shadow of a lot of familiar foolishness in it. It's very easy to see the flaws in our existing financial systems. It's too hard to move money around, big institutions take a cut when they don't deserve one, and it gives governments too much control over what people do with their money. \n\nBut it's easy to misunderstand or even be completely ignorant of the problems new systems will create. It's proven very easy to steal bitcoin from people, and once it's stolen the privacy of bitcoin makes that theft impossible to investigate. Transaction fees actually have started to rise, and already governments are placing the exact restrictions on bitcoin that they have on other money because people are using it to buy illegal things, avoid taxes, and launder money from illegal activity. \n\nWhether or not I thought it was a good currency or store of value, I would not want to be be involved with any of that. But, nonetheless, I am very thankful for Sean's bitcoin and am very happy we were able to give its value to Partners in Health.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "So...do you reform or revolt...that is the question. To me the question isn't whether we reform, it's how. And I would like to talk some about that. I think there's an easy argument to make that much of the problem with YouTube isn't YouTube's problem, it's a cultural problem, and this article in The Verge (that I agree with only partially) talks about that the best I've seen so far: https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850798/logan-paul-youtube-social-media-twitch-moderation\n\nThere isn't a way, at least right now, to create a YouTube alternative that would work for creators. Many people have tried...some are trying right now...but I don't think it's possible. So we have to do our best to make this platform and this community the best thing we can. And that's hard and long and it might feel foolish since, ultimately, it's not a democracy, it's a corporation, but it's where we are. And I think there is space to make it better, but we won't be able to do that unless there are good ideas that are getting pushed and implemented. So, let's go there. Please please share your ideas.\n\nHank\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

There is nowhere to run, and we don't want the unpleasantness of engaging with the fight, so we flee into fear and it eats us because we literally have no defense against it. \n\nIf you'd like to learn more about stress and our physiological responses to it, here's a SciShow on how presistent stress harms our bodies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViWCk74Bu8k\n\nAnd here's a Crash Course I did on emotion, stress, and health: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbSRXP0wik\n\nAlso linked in this video is the video I did on hankschannel on the processes I've used to deal with things I can't deal with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8wIiypS_g\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

And they make things that are better than the things I make. I also am not trying to say that I don't think the stuff I make is good, I think \"good\" is a combination of time, skill, talent, and ability to choose and understand your own objectives. I just shave on time spent and do my best to optimize the other stuff.\n\nThis is what I do, not what I suggest other people do. \n\nIn general, when people try to sell you on some life-vision for being an ULTLA EFFECTIVE PERSON, what they're really trying to do is make you feel like you haven't accomplished enough or aren't awesome enough, and thus need them to become the thing you should be but which you're being held back from by some lack of knowledge. I hate that shit so much, and I really hope I'm not doing it here. Every person will find different ways of doing things that help the world and other people, which is the important thing. \n\nBut...don't let perfection hold you back from making things or doing things.

    "title": "What's This Video About?",
    "description": "This video is two different videos, sorry about that!\n\nSome great Star Trek TNG Episodes\nIf you watch Star Trek TNG from the beginning, which I heartily suggest you do, you will notice that it...kinda sucks. The first and second season have very few episodes that knock it out of the park. \n\nThe good news is that Star Trek happened before TV dramas started being serialized, so with the exception of (very important and rewarding) character development and universe backstory, you can pretty much watch any episode of Star Trek TNG you want to in any order. \n\nThis is NOT the case for later series..DS9 in particular was part of the push for serialized \"you must watch every episode or you will fall behind\" style TV. \n\nSo, without further ado, here are some of the most \"What's it About\" episodes of TNG, that also have great story and (most importantly) great Picard monologues.\n\nSeason 4 Episode 21 - The Drumhead. Especially important given current political conversations.\n\nSeason 2 Episode 9 - Measure of a Man. I am a big fan of episodes that focus on Data so...this one. \n\nSeason 5 Episode 25 - The Inner Light. I think about this episode all the dang time.\n\nSeason 4, Episode 14 - Clues. Just a really inventive and exciting tale of successful diplomacy, which isn't easy.\n\nI mean, I could keep doing this all day...but that's a good start. \n\nThanks the Ryan Ruark and MZ Chase for help with the title!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nPreorder John's new book, Turtles All the Way Down, out October 10th 2017!

SOURCES BELOW.\nHank is publishing a novel next year! https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/books/youtube-star-hank-green-first-novel.html\nBut before then, we are going on tour to celebrate my new novel, Turtles All the Way Down: http://www.turtlesallthewaydownbook.com/#tour\n\nSOURCES: \n\nHunter-gatherers have less famine than agriculturalists: http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/1/20130853 This gets into some of the archeology and analysis of human remains that indicates that hunter-gatherers lived on average longer and healthier lives than agriculturalists.\n\nThe Case against Civilization inspired this video and includes the statistics about how much hunter-gatherers work in food acquisition and domestic labor: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/the-case-against-civilization\n\nThis article also explores some of the complexities of agriculture's development: http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/07/15/485722228/where-did-agriculture-begin-oh-boy-its-complicated\n\nThe book discussed in \"The Case against Civilization\" is called AGAINST THE GRAIN, and while I disagree with a lot that's in it, I also think it's an interesting read and outlines both its case for why cities developed and other people's cases. I also leaned on the book SAPIENS by Yuval Noah Harari for some of the theories about why cities developed.\n\nOur World in Data is an amazing resource for understanding long-term trends in human history. That's where I got the graph about the dramatic reduction in absolute poverty the world is experiencing: https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/\n\nAnd also the graph about the declining number of hours worked: https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours/\n\nAnd lastly, the median U.S. household income really is higher (even after adjusting for inflation) than it ever has been before: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nPreorder John's new book, Turtles All the Way Down, out October 10th 2017!

    "description": "Throughout this video I say \"probability curve\" when a statistician would say \"probability distribution.\" I just want to say that I'm aware of this, and that it's a choice I intentionally made because I felt like it made it easier to understand. \n\nWhile I would very much like to get deep into probability functions, what they mean, and how they work, I don't know if that's necessary to understand the world with curves. And this isn't just about climate and weather, pretty much everything is better understood if it's understood in terms of probability functions. And I generally like to see the world not for the collapsed reality dot, but for the function underneath. It's why winning at gambling always feels empty to me, I know that the underlying function has my losing even if happened to get lucky. So, in a way, gambling is always losing, even if you win. \n\nI know I'm an armchair statistician, and that lots of people will be annoyed by the language in this video, but I hope you can forgive me!\n\nGiraffe Love Shirt: https://store.dftba.com/products/giraffe-love-3-0-shirt\n\nCrash Course Film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TARsoxST0tQ\n\nHealthcare Triage on Guns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZzmgqpwG-s (four parts)\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nPreorder John's new book, Turtles All the Way Down, out October 10th 2017!

    "description": "Race is uncomfortable for me to talk about, and I often have the impulse to, like, stay in my lane, to just amplify voices that are more credible than mine as a white man who knows nothing about racism except for the times when I discover my own bias. \n\nBut I have been encouraged by Black friends and Black Nerdfighters to talk more about this stuff because, like, I'm an American too. Watching the situation in Charlottesville unfold was a horror, and it's been terribly present in my mind ever since. America has a shameful history, but we also have a history of progress, and that continues now as we fight against a new wave of hate that has found new life. \n\nI also want to be clear that having racist thoughts does not make you a Nazi. We all have bias, we all have fear, and sometimes we even have hate. It's what we do with those things that matters. Do we give in to irrational bias...or do we work hard to keep the hate from creeping in. \n\nHere are some other great and important things I've read this week:\nRhett McLaughlin - Thoughts on Confederate Statues from a Southern White Male: https://medium.com/@rhettmc/thoughts-on-confederate-statues-from-a-southern-white-male-b81a2693113d\n\nWhat white parents can do for black parents right now - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2017/08/17/what-white-parents-can-do-for-black-parents-right-now/\n\nThis thing about \"white pride\" https://twitter.com/AdrianXpression/status/897978833151852544\n\nWhite Americans Have to Make a Choice\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/08/white_americans_can_end_the_fight_over_confederate_monuments.html\n\nSecret Project - email already went out, you can read it here: http://mailchi.mp/b89eabef63d4/build-a-turtle-cake-happy-birthday-john\n\n\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nPreorder John's new book, Turtles All the Way Down, out October 10th 2017!

What many of them come down to is, \"Is college worth the money\" or \"I feel like I'm being eaten alive by my student loans and I don't know if it was worth it.\"\n\nThe short answers is that, on average, college is very worth it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_N7MAr98CI\n\nThe long answer is that, as college gets more expensive, it becomes /less likely/ to be worth it every year. Which is why college needs to stop getting more expensive.

That's not true, I think you should be able to if you want to, but there are lots of good reasons to not want to, and very much support people who are more interested in working for other people, especially if you work for me! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!\n\nBut small business is extremely important, it helps even out inequality, ties communities together, and employs over half of working Americans. Small businesses hire faster than large ones, and employ more people per dollar they make. \n\nAlas, there are lots of structural efficiencies to being big, and lots of ways big companies build their \"moats.\" And just by virtue of the way capitalism works, it is sometimes easier to go from 400 to 800 employees than from 1 to 2. \n\nHere's a selection of the articles I read and resources I used while making this video: \n\nThe Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is a great primary source for this stuff\nhttp://www.gemconsortium.org/\n\nWhat is driving the dramatic slowdown in IPOs\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/1c57c7de-6e20-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa\n\nThe Myth of the Millennial Entrepreneur\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/the-myth-of-the-millennial-entrepreneur/490058/\n\nMillennials are obsessed with side hustles because they’re all we’ve got\nhttps://qz.com/711773/millennials-are-obsessed-with-side-hustles-because-theyre-all-weve-got/\n\nAmerican Entrepreneurship Is Actually Vanishing.

    "description": "I have always thought that sex ed and statistics should be the same course. There's no better way to show how vital stats is to your every day life than to look at statistics. Probabilities are so easy to misunderstand, and there are a lot that go into understanding the outcomes of sexual activity. \n\nThere's a ton I didn't get into here...like that a common trap is that, in a pinch, one might have unprotected sex with no negative outcome, and that makes it /feel/ much safer for future times. Which, I think, is a common trap people fall into.\n\nThere's also the fact that a 2% chance sounds pretty tiny, but it really does mean that, on average, if you have 50 couples using condoms perfectly, one of them is going to get pregnant in any given year. That's gonna seem weird and surprising and improbable and unfair to that couple, but statistically, it's exactly what we expected. Probabilities eventually collapse into reality, and then that couple no longer has a 2% chance of probability, they have a 100% chance, because they're pregnant, and everyone else has a 0% chance.\n\nBeing one of the two percent isn't that weird. \n\nHere's the video I made on probability in 2010 that I'm actually pretty proud of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpvE0Co66nU\n\n\nMost of the information used in this video came from the AMAZING AND WONDERFUL Guttmacher institute: https://www.guttmacher.org/\n\nContraceptive Use in the US: https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states\n\nUnintended Pregnancy Rates: https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/unintended-pregnancy-united-states\n\nIUDs Cause Decrease in Unintended Pregnancies: https://www.vox.com/2016/3/2/11148108/unplanned-pregnancy-larc-iud\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nPreorder John's new book, Turtles All the Way Down, out October 10th 2017!

    "description": "Patreon Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOCTt-O9TR8\nDHJ Animation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPxXZu_N0g4\nVidCon: http://www.vidcon.com\n\nSo, to be clear, I've done a thing here that you shouldn't do, which is apply population statistics to individuals. But i did it for a good reason...uh...fun?\n\nOf course there are many things that are likely to affect your age of death as much as or more than your current age (income, location, race, medical history, etc.) But also you gotta understand (and statisticians will hate this video for this reason and probably others) that the an average of life expectancy doesn't tell you much at all about when an individual will die. For example, an change in child mortality changes life expectancy far more than a change in elderly mortality because the addition or removal of small numbers to an average will affect it dramatically.\n\nThis is why you'll often hear that the life expectancy in some period of time was 35 years old. That makes it sound like people were all dying around 35, but in fact ages were distributed all over, but there were far more deaths of children and babies, which pulled the average way down. 80 year olds in the middle ages weren't, like, some kind of mythical creature. \"Life expectancy\" just isn't a super useful statistic for telling you what length of life to expect.\n\nAlso, it's not even /that/ good at telling you things about public health. People are supposed to die, so a better measure (which Australia actually uses) is \"Years of Potential Life Lost\" or YPLL\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_potential_life_lost\n\nThe US has a surprisingly bad YPLL because of suicides, drug overdoses, homicide, and car accidents. \n\nThat allows you to study whether diseases kill lots of people who are at the end of their lives or people who might otherwise live a quite a long time. Like, dementia kills mostly very old people while suicide and accidents kill lots of  young people. We shouldn't give those deaths the same weight. \n\nAnd then lastly, if you want to go all the way down this rabbit hole, you should google \"Global Burden of Disease\" which endeavors to measure beyond years of life lost and into the quality of those years. Like, disease can cause life-long chronic pain or disability, and those things should be considered as well as death. \n\nOK, I am surprised by how much I just typed about this!\n\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "The Paris Accord: What is it? And What Does it All Mean?",
    "description": "At the heart of the desire to get America out of the Paris Agreement seems to be three things: \n\n1. Nostalgia. The focus on coal, an energy source that is becoming uneconomical even in developing countries, and that employs very few people in America can't have anything to do with anything except an imagined fondness for a world that probably never existed. These people are right that fossil fuels have been great for Americans and also for the world. I think the people who worked and fought to use fossil fuels to make people's lives better did good things. I also think we need new paths and to retire old ones.\n\n2. A push to have countries care only about their own interests. Climate change is the best example that this doesn't work. And that's very scary for people who are skeptical of globalism. It may seem to them awfully convenient that the people who want a more global society happened to find this disaster that can only be solved by a more global society. \n\nOf course there are some that are purely economically motivated, but while those people are powerful, there aren't many of them. But these are the things that really resonate with large numbers of people. And when you're trying to defend  your worldview, you'll make some magnificent mental leaps to do it...like that every scientist ever is lying about how CO2 absorption works. \n\nThere are a couple Twitter threads that I really enjoyed on these topics. here they are. \n\nVi Hart: https://twitter.com/vihartvihart/status/870413832732250112\n\nAdam Conover: https://twitter.com/adamconover/status/870025080041910272\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Your Neighborhood, Your Life Expectancy",
    "description": "In which John discusses the astonishing degree to which an American's zip code affects their life expectancy, and why life expectancy varies so much within the United States. Also discussed: Regional variation in life expectancy in Canada and other rich nations, how much smoking reduces your life expectancy, the relationship between exercise and longevity, and more. SOURCES/INFO:\n\nInequalities in Life Expectancy among U.S. Counties, the study that was just published showing that life expectancy varies by 20 years within the U.S. depending on your location. (It's fascinating! Really!) http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2626194\n\nAn NPR summary: https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/08/npr-life-expectancy-can-vary-by-20-years-depending-on-where-you-live\n\nLife expectancy in my hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana varies by more than 14 years depending on your ZIP code: http://www.savi.org/savi/documents/Worlds_Apart_Gaps_in_Life_Expectancy.pdf\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's cool app that tells you, based on your ZIP code, your life expectancy: http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/interactives/whereyouliveaffectshowlongyoulive.html\n\nLife expectancy for smokers is 10 years shorter than for nonsmokers: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/\n\nPhysical activity can expand average U.S. lifespans by 4.5 years: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/PhysicalActivityLifeExpectancy\n\n Life expectancy in Canada varies by income quintile, but by less than it does in the U.S. http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/department-ministere/state-public-health-status-2016-etat-sante-publique-statut/page-4-eng.php\n\nThis study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62591/ explores life expectancy variation within countries over time, finding that in most rich nations (Canada, Germany, Australia, etc.) life expectancy variation has declined since 1980, while it has steadily increased in the U.S. This is also where you can see that life expectancy among people with the highest incomes in the U.S. is (very slightly) higher than life expectancy among high income Canadians.\n\nLastly, LET'S TALK ABOUT LIFE EXPECTANCY. Dr. Aaron Carroll of Healthcare Triage explains it here better than I can: http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/how-flawed-is-life-expectancy/ But basically, there are a number of factors that go into life expectancy that can cause variations--especially when it comes to miscarriages/newborn deaths--but most of those variations are between countries, not within them. (i.e., it is not the reason for the huge geographic discrepancy in the U.S.) In the field of healthcare outcome analysis, there are other complains about life expectancy--it can be affected by things that have little to do with healthcare (like violence and accident rates)--but that's not of concern here. In summary, the longevity disparity between rich and poor in the U.S. is real, and it is very high by international standards.\n\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "It's real easy, it's not about winning an argument, or getting upset or angry, it's about letting your voice be heard. http://5calls.org\n\nI hope I was fairly coherent in this video. I'm just getting over a cold and I still feel crappy and like my mind is working at about 50% normal speed. I ended up editing this video non-linearly...meaning I didn't originally say all of these things in this order. \n\nSo it's possible I messed up some of my original points...I'm sick and tired OK! \n\nBut hopefully the point comes across...it's bullcrap to believe that money can take on the role that actual human contact and human appreciation. More and more, we are moving labor behind the scenes, where no one can see it and where it is very efficient and unobserved. Like, I used to talk to at least one person if I had to buy a USB cable, now I click buttons on Amazon and people who I will never see (or even think about) work to get my USB cable to me as invisibly as possible.\n\nThis might (/might/) be economically a good idea, but it is not good for human satisfaction and happiness, and that worries me. A lot, actually.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Can You Trust Mainstream Media?",
    "description": "When people ask me how they can trust anything anymore it just makes me so sad. Yes, publications have a perspective, acting without bias in our world is impossible. And I get frustrated when i see papers not trying to present themselves without bias the way they used to. \n\nBut the idea that the \"Mainstream Media\" is the more corrupt of the institutions spreading information these days is nuts. I have watched papers come after YouTube for what I see as a mostly manufactured story. But these larger institutions have far more protections against reporting false stories, and a far greater responsibility to the truth than today's \"non-mainstream\" options. \n\nThese other options tend to be driven entirely by ideology or profit with basically no responsibility to the truth. But they've succeeded handily in breaking down the credibility of the press, which is in turn breaking down the credibility of truth in general. \n\nSo, if I didn't answer it for you in the video, let me answer the question in the title now. If you are looking at news, actual news and not an op-ed, you can trust the information reported in mainstream media FAR MORE than almost anything else. It may have a perspective, but the information itself will be trustworthy. \n\nAnd I am happy to take a stand for an institution that I honestly think we would be screwed without (even if a couple bits of it have taken unnecessary swipes at YouTube in the past few weeks).\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Watching revenue tank in early April was terrifying, but it also got us thinking about lots of other ways to support this content which I am excited about. \n\nYouTube has created a smoother (still rocky) path for independent creators to start making revenue, but the automatically sold advertisements have always been a the kind of prices that only very large channels can make significant revenue (we are lucky enough to run some of those.)\n\nWe need more systems and better systems to help independent creators make good stuff on the internet, and spending actual money (rather than spending time and attention watching ads) is vital to that.

Intros here: http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/the-state-of-us-health-aint-so-good/ and here: http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/how-do-we-rate-the-quality-of-the-us-health-care-system-introduction/\n\nThe Kaiser Foundation has up-to-date stats on where people get their health insurance--the ACA exchanges get coverage to about 6% of people, 49% of people get coverage through their employers (or their family's employer), 20% through Medicaid, 14% through Medicare, and 9% are uninfured: http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\n\nHealthcare costs in the U.S. are very, very high compared to every other wealthy country, and have been for decades: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States#Overall_costs\n\nA Medicare-for-All program would lead to lower overall healthcare costs in the U.S., but also a lot of job loss (possibly as many as two million): http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/news/economy/sanders-health-care-plan/\n\nEven modest reductions in health insurance subsidies--like those proposed in the GOP repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act--would lead to tens of millions of people losing insurance coverage: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52371\n\nOther topics discussed include the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the relative modesty of Obamacare as a health care reform, and the benefits and tradeoffs of Bernie Sanders' proposed single payer healthcare system, Medicare for All.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "In which Hank kayaks around a lake that was bought with the destruction of fragile and irreplaceable ecosystems and also men's lives. Also, like, a lot of money. \n\nAnd he likes it.\n\nLake Powell is the reservoir created by Glen Canyon Dam. A reservoir is a lake formed by a dam and right there in the name you can see it's main purpose...to reserve. It was part of the Colorado River Storage Project, the goal of which was to store water from the flood times to be used during the dry times. And it's worked, it has allowed a lot of people to live and far in arid parts of the South West US. \n\nIt's also a very pretty and very cool lake that a lot of people enjoy recreationally. But the fights against dams on the Colorado river were a huge part of the early environmental movement in the 1960s, and the reaction against technology that that movement created set up a dichotomy that I don't love.\n\nI am a big fan of the environment, but I often think that a bias toward \"naturalness\" (whatever that means) can cause a lot of pretty big problems, like a fear of vaccines or genetically modified foods. \n\nThere are lessons to learn from these projects, of course. Glen Canyon Dam's construction left it vulnerable to floods, which almost caused a massive disaster in the 1980s. And so there is much to be said for caution.\n\nBasically, it's complicated...and I like having a chance to look at a complicated issue and admit that I'm a little bit on both sides.\n\nHere's a documentary about people who want to remove the dam:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eCytLfHaPw&t=3759s\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "I don't really know what this budget is meant to do aside from raise military spending dramatically while keeping spending almost exactly the same as it is now. It's remarkable how close they kept the actually dollar amount spent. The Bloomberg article below has the best look at some of the individual programs that are being cut. \n\nWhen looking through sources you might see that different organizations have different numbers for how much has been cut. Different organizations have counted differently. Some don't include the mandatory spending in the number (mandatory spending can increase, but there's no way to stop it from increasing.)\n\nI'm bummed about a lot of this budget. A ton of NASA's Earth Science (which is both efficient and valuable) is being scrapped. So many programs that help people who need it, especially the after-school and educational assistance programs. It will be interesting to see how the fight goes in congress. \n\nA selection of sources I used:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-budget/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-budget-proposal.html\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-presidential-budget-2018-proposal/?utm_term=.dd20e4af17d6\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Just something I've been thinking about for a while. \n\nHow to Know if you have ADHD\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx13a2-unjE\n\nSciShow Psych\nhttp://www.youtube.com/scishowpsych\n\nI am very lucky to have found myself (and gotten myself) in a situation that is well suited to the quirks of my personality. But I still find myself sometimes unintentionally hurting people, annoying people, or letting people down even though I often know the exact mistake I am making. \n\nI'm not saying that means I have ADHD, I just want to continue to understand the mistakes I make, that I am prone to making them, and develop habits to stop myself. This channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q is full of tips I find useful, and there are a number of habits I've developed on my own. \n\nFinally, here's a thing I didn't say in the video. I've struggled with worrying that if I get diagnosed, I will blame the disorder instead of myself and let that excuse my behavior. I know that's dumb, because if I'm being impaired by something, I should know and take the steps to reduce that impairment. But part of me always wants to believe that I'm strong and smart enough to handle any curve ball I get thrown without letting myself or other people down. \n\nI think that might be a pretty destructive way to look at it, which is why I'm glad I've allowed myself to get support from friends, family, and professionals over the years. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Hoping for an Airport Reunion: One Refugee Family's Story",
    "description": "In which John goes to the airport--not, for once, to fly somewhere, but in hopes of seeing a family of Burmese refugees reunited. Thanks to Saw Kyar Aye and Thet Thet for sharing their story with me and for inviting me to the airport on that fateful day. SOURCES BELOW!\n\n\n\nSponsor our 10k run here: https://www.gofundme.com/100Days10K All proceeds go to Exodus Refugee International, a local nonprofit working with refugees resettled in Indianapolis: https://exodusrefugee.org/\n\nSources:\n\nForced labor remains a huge problem in Burma, also known as Myanmar, and those conscripted by the army into labor are often beaten and sometimes executed for desertion (or just for being injured): http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2082814,00.html\n\nRefugee resettlement does not increase crime rates in the United States. This study explored the relationship between crime in communities and refugee populations, finding an association (but not causation!!!!) between refugee resettlement and lower crime rates: http://www.renewoureconomy.org/research/is-there-a-link-between-refugees-and-u-s-crime-rates/\n\nIn general, immigrant populations commit crimes at a lower rate than native born populations in the United States: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime#United_States and also https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798\n\nThen there is the question of whether immigration reduces wages. This is VERY HOTLY CONTESTED, so I'm going to try to be careful here. The best/most readable overview I've found is here: http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21688938-europes-new-arrivals-will-probably-dent-public-finances-not-wages-good-or but it focuses on the effect of refugee populations on European economies. Because refugees entering the United States are more thoroughly vetted and also more likely to be highly educated, in the U.S. refugees are less likely to decrease wages--i.e., they almost certainly don't. More info here: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/us/immigrants-arent-taking-americans-jobs-new-study-finds.html\n\nThen there's the question of whether a large influx of immigrants affect wages or unemployment. That's not super relevant to the U.S. right now, because we have relatively few refugee resettlements here, but it's an interesting side note. The WSJ has a good overview of the cloudiness here: http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/01/does-immigration-suppress-wages-its-not-so-simple/ The Brookings Institute claims that \"on average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and incomes of Americans.\" https://www.brookings.edu/blog/jobs/2012/05/04/what-immigration-means-for-u-s-employment-and-wages/ Other studies have found that large influxes of immigrants do depress wages for some low-skilled workers: https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/popular/NR2016.pdf And then of course there are studies that show the problem with the studies that show the problem with the other studies. It's complicated. Some day I'd like to make a video about the incredibly complex relationship between immigration and wages/unemployment/economic growth, but not today. \n\nFor those looking to learn more about the current political situation in Myanmar, here's a more recent, deeply disturbing story about forced labor of the persecuted Rohingya minority in Myanmar: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-forcedlabour-idUSKCN0PC2L720150702 To be clear, the family I discuss in this video is not Rohingya; most Rohingya are Muslims. Saw Kyar Aye and his family are Christians of Chin ethnicity. But Chin people have frequently been targets of forced labor initiatives.\n\nHuge thank you to Sara Hindi and everyone at Exodus Refugee International for making this video possible. Thanks also to Mark Olsen for his videography and editing genius. Any mistakes are mine alone.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Human Life Is Getting Better. Faster Than Ever Before.",
    "description": "Read and be inspired by the 2017 Gates Letter: https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annual-Letter\n In which John discusses the annual letter from Melinda and Bill Gates, and how it shows that the world is getting dramatically better. Since I was your (average) age, global poverty has dropped from 30% to under 10%. Child mortality has been cut nearly in half. And by the time the average vlogbrothers viewer is my age, absolute poverty and child mortality should both be extremely rare everywhere on Earth.\n\nThere is a lot of bad news. It is real. It is important. But it's also important to take a step back and look at the human story over time, and each year the Gates letter offers us that opportunity.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nOur World in Data is an amazing resource for understanding changes over time in the human condition, from literacy rates to life expectancy.

Foreign aid since 1990 has been been better targeted, especially when it comes to health care. There is a longer and more academic overview of the research here: https://www.oecd.org/dev/34353462.pdf\n\nLess than 1% of the U.S. federal government's budget goes to foreign aid: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/26/the-u-s-foreign-aid-budget-visualized/?utm_term=.48e0f09380d8 (...unless you count defense aid, then it is like 1.2%)\n\nAny other questions, feel free to ask in comments!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "POSTERS HERE: https://store.dftba.com/collections/refugee-art-posters\n\nYou can choose how much you want to donate, but the minimum per poster is around $10.\n\nAlso, there' a $150 package that includes ALL of the art!\nhttps://store.dftba.com/products/all-17-refugee-art-poster\n\nSo, look, I never want to complain about the situation I am in, because it is so so wonderful. But having a platform means that I never really know how much I should be using it to affect change, or what the most effective strategies for that would be. If I did a third of the things I had ideas for, it would be too much, and yet I am always left feeling like I'm not doing enough.\n\nAnd, let's be honest, I don't know the best path forward...I'm a video blogger. But I do want to act for the things that I believe in. \n\nAnd I also want to do my best to do that without attacking the people who disagree with me. I know that's a little controversial in these days of Nazi punching, but it's way too easy to imagine that every person who likes Donald Trump is the same as Milo and Richard Spencer and they're just not. \n\nSome of them are terrible, absolutely, but 50% of Americans still approve of the job he's doing and I'm not ready to write off those people.

    "description": "On the evening of the election here in the US, I tweeted my most re-tweeted tweet ever: \"I know many many wonderful people who are dedicated to making the world a better place and that's a thing that will not change tonight.\"\n\nI know that lots of people are hopeful and pleased that we have a new president today. I am not. I am very worried. Many of the things I care about most, our new president is actively antagonistic toward. \n\nBut that tweet is true no matter who controls the @POTUS Twitter account.\n\nI am not just hopeful, I am excited about the future. And much of that has to do with these great people who I am lucky enough to work with. I know that I'm their boss, and they know that too, but I hope they also know that our goal isn't to create money, it's to create value. It's to make things that people love, and that they care about, and that maybe even help them become better people.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly drained by the political climate where you live, I suggest looking to the people  you know in the real world rather than the ones you imagine are taking over your country. My guess is that there's a lot of hope there.\n\nMusic: Michael Aranda\nhttp://youtube.com/whatimdoingrightnow\n\nUnedited version of this video here: https://youtu.be/_8ot1a_3WOM\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

But cave paintings remind us that what we think of as history is a tiny fraction of the human story.\n\nHUGE THANKS to Rosianna for helping with all the images: http://youtube.com/rosianna\n\nWerner Herzog made a beautiful documentary about the Chauvet paintings called Cave of Forgotten Dreams.

    "description": "In which John Green discusses the \"real\" unemployment rate in the United States, and how different ways of calculating jobless rates have led to vastly different conclusions about the health of the U.S. economy. SOURCES BELOW!\n\nOther questions addressed include: What is the difference between the U1 unemployment rate and the U6 unemployment rate? Which one is the better measure of unemployment? What percentage of Americans are employed? And what percentage of those unemployed are looking for work? And what does it all say about the present and future of the U.S. economy, and our divisive political discourse? Thank you to Rosianna for all the charts and graphs! http://youtube.com/rosianna\n\nThe information in this video came from:\n\n1. Trading Economics has great and visually intuitive explanations of the U-3 unemployment rate over time in the United States: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate\n\n2. BLS stats about labor force participation rates and how many people out of the labor force say they \"do not want a job now\" https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea38.htm\n\n3. Information about the civilian labor force participation rate can be found here: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART and the labor force participation rate for those between 25 and 54 can be found here: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU01300060\n\n4. This is a highly detailed article that I found helpful looking at causes of the decline in labor force participation: https://econsnapshot.com/2016/02/11/understanding-the-decline-in-us-labor-force-participation/ An easier to read overview at the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/09/06/the-incredible-shrinking-labor-force-again/?utm_term=.0a056f64b354\n\n5. Real median household income in the United States is, after adjusting for inflation, rising but not yet to pre-recession levels: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N\n\n6. This article explores how we try to have internationally comparable unemployment rates: https://stats.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2000/06/art1full.pdf\n\n7. This web site has an easy-to-use interface that allows you to look at the U-3, U-5, and U-6 unemployment figures over time: http://www.macrotrends.net/1377/u6-unemployment-rate\n\n8. This has up-to-date figures all unemployment measures (including U-1 and U-2, which aren't discussed in this video): http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/05/charts-whats-the-real-unemployment-rate.html\n\nI think that's it. If you have any specific questions, let me know and I'll try to add sources here.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

First, I have to say that I said \"I\" a lot in the first paragraph because I was focusing on my own life but, of course, I had a lot of help doing those things I did (most of all from John.)\n\nSecond...we've had ups and downs in the strength of this community, and it's also a certain amount of scary for me when it seems like the focus of it is not as much values and goals, but me or John as people. There's a weird line between being the doorway into something bigger and more interesting and getting...stuck in the doorway. \n\nI want you to like me, but I don't want you to be here for me. I want you to be here for whatever message I'm sharing that day, whether it's one of joy and silliness, or of compassion, or of knowledge. \n\nBut I also think I can sometimes be distracted from the importance of what we're doing here on Vlogbrothers by all of the new things that this community has allowed us to do. And since Vlogbrothers is still just me and John, while our other things have whole teams, it's easy to get dragged into those things by the great ideas those teams are having. \n\nWhich is a bummer, because I don't want to be distracted from our work trying to figure out how cohesive and constructive community can find new ways to exist as the old ways are working for fewer and fewer people. \n\nThank you for an amazing 10 years...good god, how lucky am I...\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

I'm uploading this on a quiet Thursday evening and I want to say two things:\n\n1. My leave has been a really reflective time and one of the main takeaways from that reflection is how grateful I am for the support of this community and that we get to do cool and good things together.\n\n2. The conference business is weird and difficult. I'm still dealing with some of the financial fallout from NerdCon: Stories. But it's so so worth it when I hear from people who say that VidCon or NerdCon is one of the best or the best times they have all year. I think it's so fantastically important that we gather together in the real world when we can and love things together. I'm so proud to help facilitate that for so many people.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Unfortunately, this year this somehow fell into my paternity leave, so I'm not going to be doing that.\n\nBut I did want to pre-make one video, and this is that video. Other guests will be filling in on my other Pizzamas days so there /will/ be 10 total Pizzamas videos. \n\nThis video was filmed at Zoo City Apparel, the place here in Missoula where they print our shirts (also Rhett and Link's shirts, and VidCon's shirts, and a bunch of others.) I always like spending time there, seeing the hard work and attention to detail that they put into printing for us. They're very cool people. \n\nThis Pizzamas we've also got a cool thing I didn't talk about this in this video because I wasn't sure it was going to be a thing. One of our shirts, Duncan's \"Hot and Fresh\" is only available in a $39 \"Pizzamas Pizza Box.\" It will be delievered to your doorstep in the pizza box and has a pizza cutter, a notepad, and an apron in it as well. \n\nThere's a bunch of other stuff at DFTBA.com/pizzamas as well like pajama bottoms, pet leashes, and stickers. \n\nYAY PIZZAMAS!!\n\nThank you so much to all of the designers who helped out with Pizzamas this year.

    "description": "Montana has had a very strange thing happen this election. A gay, American Indian, Democratic woman was nominated to run against the incumbent (former Navy Seal, Ryan Zinke). Stranger still, several times she has polled within the margin of error.\n\nFull Interview Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeMerAkiO3I&feature=youtu.be\n\nTo be clear, it was always (and remains) unlikely that Superintendent Juneau will win, but government is defined by more than just the winners of elections. Who we consider, how close races are, and the conversations that they bring to the table. \n\nI wanted a chance to just talk with Superintendent Juneau...with anyone really...who has a knowledge of government and also faith in government. I don't think that any politician is free of blame when it comes to hyper-partisanship, but I don't think we can move away from it without humanizing politicians and asking them to humanize each other. \n\nYou can find out more about Denise Juneau here:\nhttps://denisejuneau.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/denisejuneau/\n\nThanks to Nick Jenkins, Nicole Sweeney, and Caitlin Hoffmeister for getting up way too early in the morning to help with this. And, of course, to Superintendent Juneau who took time out of her ridiculously busy schedule to talk to me.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "This year has hit me right in the faith in humanity. It's hard to even pick which thing about it has upset me the most. And when I was writing this video, I just kept putting down more and more and more words...it was very hard to stay on one track.\n\nAnyway, I'm bummed out, but I just do my best to remember that the people I know in the real world are more than 90% super great, which means that's probably also roughly true of the general population. \n\nSo that's something!\n\nThis article that Joe Hanson sent me was helpful though (if a little thick): https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/16/rebecca-solnit-hope-in-the-dark-2/\n\nAlso, if you're wondering why I'm voting for Hillary Clinton, it's not just because I think Donald Trump believes the whole world is a game for him to win at any costs, and that his presidency would significantly increase the odds of apocalypse (though they would still be quite low). It's also because she's accomplished a great deal of good in her career, which I talked about a bit here: https://www.facebook.com/hankgreen/posts/10157157580065487\n\nAnd, unlike a lot of people, I actually relate to her a lot, which i talk about here: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com/post/151433613535/i-totally-get-wanting-to-support-hillary-in-this\n\nDo I have problems with Hillary? Sure...but they're mostly with things that I don't know /anything/ about, like how to conduct the foreign and military affairs of the most powerful country in the world. I feel like we do that wrong in the U.S.. But I also freely admit that I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to that stuff, and I think it's pretty weird that so many people think they do.\n\nAnyway. Humans are great. We've got our issues, but I'm quite proud of us...even in this pretty unpleasant year.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Absolute poverty is EXTREMELY complicated, and it's very difficult to sort out which levers need to be pulled to reduce it in a community, but kiva is now focusing much more on experimenting with more levers, from zero interest loans to working with organizations that approach poverty holistically instead of just functioning as banking institutions.

    "description": "Awesome Sox Club: https://store.dftba.com/collections/awesome-sox-club\n\nThere are actually a couple of other happiness-increasing technique that is somewhat non-intuitive, is shown to increase happiness in repeated studies, and is fairly easy to implement and difficult to reverse: Having a dog or cat. \n\nIt appears that being needed by the animal makes the human feel as if they have intrinsic value which...I mean it would be nice if we had that without pets but, there it is. If you want the best bang for your buck, I would suggest a small dog or cat from the pound as it will eat significantly less food than a bigger animal.\n\nAnother life change that actually effectively increases long-term happiness on average is marriage. This seemed a little too hairy for this video though. Also, DEFINITELY NOT DOSE-DEPENDENT. One spouse...better for happiness. Two spouses USUALLY NOT.\n\nSo there you go...get a pet, get hitched, and shorten your commute. You need to get home anyway, so you can feed your dog!\n\nSOURCES:\nHomeownership doesn't increase happiness: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/realestate/homeownership-the-key-to-happiness.html?_r=0\n\nShort Commute = $40,000 raise\nhttp://www.npr.org/2011/10/19/141514467/small-changes-can-help-you-thrive-happily\n\nCommuting Linked to Lower Life Satisfaction\nhttps://uwaterloo.ca/recreation-and-leisure-studies/crunched-time-commuting-linked-lower-life-satisfaction\n\nCommuting and Metabolic / Cardiovascular Health\nhttp://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(12)00167-5/abstract\n\nCommuting related to lower social activity and lower general trust\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4509867/\n\n10 Things Commuting Does to your Body\nhttp://time.com/9912/10-things-your-commute-does-to-your-body/\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Frankly, I'm sick of it. \n\nAnd I'm sick particularly of Donald Trump leveraging fear into hate. The list of things he wants me to be afraid of is so long that the thing I have become afraid of more than anything is him.

    "description": "Race and Racism Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMs_JcuNozJb-5TJ3uuvqPzQVjO_XarED\n\nIt is very easy to discount the experiences of other people, especially when our experiences are very different and our relationships with them may already be strained by prejudice. And yes, people on all sides are casting out in anger because we want someone or something to blame for recent tragedies. But this is not a simple issue, it will never be simple. But there are very clear data showing that the criminal justice system values Black Americans differently than the average American. And that is a problem that must be confronted.\n\nThank you to Ashley Ford, Ahsante Bean, and Nathan Zed for looking over this script for me.\n\nSOURCES\n\nBlack people are 2.5xmore likely to be killed by police. And unarmed black people 6x times more likely to be killed by police than unarmed white people:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/07/11/arent-more-white-people-than-black-people-killed-by-police-yes-but-no/?utm_term=.b86ba5236595\n(in the incessant debate, claims that if you look into the data you see a very different story invariably cherry pick data.)\n\nBlack people more likely to get plea deals with prison sentences:\nhttp://www.crf-usa.org/brown-v-board-50th-anniversary/the-color-of-justice.html\n\nA more granular study shows that Black people and Hispanics are more likely to have officers use force on them even when they are complying with law enforcement:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/13/why-a-massive-new-study-on-police-shootings-of-whites-and-blacks-is-so-controversial/\n\nThis study also found no difference in the use of lethal force, in the communities studied.\n\nBlack people face longer sentences for the same crimes in the same situations even when accounting for multiple violations, whether they had a public defender, their economic status, and whether they're on parole:\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002\n\nPolice have difficult jobs and that some of the communities they are tasked with protecting are very dangerous. Many officers do not want to work in those communities, so it is difficult to find police officers to do that work. It is stressful work.\n\nThe fact that there is racial bias in the criminal justice system is not a condemnation of police. Police need to be obeyed and supported because laws are want make our society function. But there is racial bias and it should be admitted, confronted, and we should do our best to deal with it. Because our society has a belief that black lives matter less...which is why we stand and say Black Lives Matter.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

It's funny how these things can sneak up inside of you. \n\nSince I didn't actually check in on my health in this video, and I'm sure people will be curious, I do feel better. My sinus headache is persistent, but the cough is chilling out finally (which is good because I separated some connective tissue from my left lower rib, which is making the coughing hurt pretty bad.)\n\nThe colitis is under control after an alarming Dayquil-related symptom spike. My medicine is working very well for me, even if it makes my immune system less good at its job.\n\nThanks for your support of me, but more for supporting the people in your lives who need it more than I do. I have more support than any one human deserves :-)\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Because I know that's what you're here for. Boom.\n\nIn America, every person has two senators that represent them in the Senate, they are the senators for your state. You also have a representative, you can find out who your congress people are here: http://whoismyrepresentative.com/\n\nThen you can google those people and find their addresses. You can also google them along with any issue and find a fair amount about how they vote on stuff.\n\nYou also have people who represent you at the state level...you should feel free to write one of them a letter as well.\n\nIf you live somewhere else, use your fingers and push on the letters on your physical or software based keyboard until Google / wikipedia tells you how your country works. I do not know. \n\nYou wanna look at my letters? Oh, how intimate!\n\nI basically sent the same letter to both Steve Daines (Senate) and Ryan Zinke (House) who have very similar positions. It's this one:\n\nTo the Honorable Steve Daines,\nMy name is Hank Green, I own a business in Missoula creating education media. I’m proud to employ over 20 Montanans. We just moved into a nice new office downtown if you would ever like to come visit.\n\nI am writing this in the wake of the attacks in Orlando. Not only were 49 people killed in that night club but, the night before, a colleague of mine, Christina Grimmie, was killed by a man with a violent history who had purchased two guns the week before. \n\nI know that we are Montanans and that guns are a part of our history and our culture. I have no interest in ending my neighbors access to firearms. However, we have a problem, and we need to take steps to address it. I believe it is time for you to consider a change in your position. I would like that you consider working to:\n\n1. Ban the sale or transfer of assault rifles such as the ones used in the Orlando, Aurora, and San Bernardino murders.\n2. Allow the CDC to study gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nI know this is a lot to ask, and that it is unlikely that you will change your heart on any of these issues. But after losing my friend, and knowing so many others did this weekend as well, I could not, in good conscience, move forward without asking this of you.\n\nThank you for your public service,\n\nHank Green\nMontanan, business owner, and educator.\n\n---\n\nThis one is to Jon Tester...we agree more often:\n\nTo the Honorable Jon Tester\nMy name is Hank Green, I own a business in Missoula creating education media. I’m proud to employ over 20 Montanans. We just moved into a nice new office downtown if you would ever like to come visit.\n\nI am writing this in the wake of the attacks in Orlando. Not only were 49 people killed in that night club but, the night before, a colleague of mine, Christina Grimmie, was killed by a man with a violent history who had purchased two guns the week before. \n\nI would like to thank you for your support of common sense gun regulations. You provide the exact kind of leadership on this issue that I would ask of you. I know this is not an easy position to have in Montana, and that your moderate views hurt you. Don't think that goes unnoticed. \n\nAfter the recent shootings, I'd like to ask you to work in Congress for the following: \n\n1. A ban on high-capacity magazines for rifles\n2. Re-instating funding for the CDC to study and fund the study of gun violence as a public health issue.\n\nI am very pleased to be able to support you and look forward to doing so in 2018. Thank you for your public service,\n\nHank Green\nMontanan, business owner, and educator.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "In which John discusses the storied tradition of non denial denials in American politics. From Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton to John Edwards to Chris Christie, politicians have been denying things without actually denying them for decades. As the Presidential election approaches in the United States, we're already seeing a lot of the same language that has long been used to evade and obscure, so I thought I'd make a video about it.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "It's funny, for such a little thing, I've thought a lot about this. I often feel bad for feeling bad about it. Like, driving a taxi is not a great job, and I'm sure drivers deserve to be paid more. But I also really dislike attitudes that enable people to break trust and take advantage of other people. And I really dislike being taken advantage of. It's a really unpleasant sensation and it makes me suddenly wary that it's happening all the time. And, often, that wariness results in me thinking I'm being ripped off when I'm really not, which then just makes it look like I have a massive chip on my shoulder. \n\nFinding the right balance between being open to the world and protecting yourself from being exploited isn't easy. But I'm lucky to be able to be fairly open and take risks that other people might not be able to afford. \n\nAnyway, just a story I wanted to share.\n\nINFO ABOUT TOUR AND STREET TEAM\n\nWanna be on our street team?

    "description": "Everyone always asks me why on Earth I live in Montana. Well, a lot of reasons. But an important one is that I have to stay a little bit disconnected from this culture, or I stop being a fan and I start getting competitive. I always want to be a fan...I want to be driven primarily by how much I like the stuff that's getting created, and not by comparing myself to it. \n\nI think a little of both is certainly healthy, but I never want the competitive bit to outweigh the happiness and enthusiasm that comes with being a part of such a cool creative community. A community that is doing brand new stuff and changing media and changing culture and having a really great time, too.\n\nTHANKS TO ALL OF THE GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY. Even as we struggle with how it's grown (and growing), even as some creators have disappointed me and this community, I have been consistently surprised by how many of the people making stuff on the internet are just enthusiastic, driven, good people. And I think audiences have a lot to do with that...so thanks to the communities of all of these people for very intentionally choosing to support and watch creators who don't suck.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Brazil's Government is Falling Apart...and it's Good News?",
    "description": "During the presidency of Lula Da Silva, billions of dollars in bribes were taken to allow construction companies to overcharge the government-owned oil company, Petrobras. Now, Brazil has corruption, but it's actually pretty good for a developing country. But the people of Brazil have come to expect more, and they have been left down. \n\nCurrent president, Dilma Rousseff, was chairwoman of Petrobras during the period of corruption, but no one knows whether Lula or Dilma were involved or aware. But Lula was under investigation before Rousseff appointed him to be her chief of staff, a move that means he can no longer be prosecuted by a normal court. \n\nI think this whole thing speaks very highly of Brazil. A reckoning had to come, and I'm pleased the citizens are holding the government accountable. However, I can't stop seeing parallels between the awful partisan situation here in the U.S. and the lack of skepticism people in this story have when it comes to believing awful things about their political opponents.\n\nUsing this scandal to clean up Brazil must be done, but using it to score political points or gain power is going to rip the country apart. \n\nThis is an epic story, and no one knows where it ends. Whether Rousseff retains power and who gets elected once the house is fully cleaned out will say a lot about how this very young democracy handles its economic and cultural growth when people's perceptions are controlled largely by social media. \n\nI think there are many good things in Brazil's future, but leaders will have to do more than fight for power. They will have to actually lead.\n\nThanks to \nAlex Cuadros: https://twitter.com/alexcuadros\nRafael Prince: https://twitter.com/rafaelprince\nAnd all of the Nerdfighters at Nerdfighters Brasil on Facebook.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "The Politics of \"Parks and Rec\"",
    "description": "I fully expect that this video won't resonate with a lot of people, and I get that. For one thing, some of the issues we face and the rhetoric we hear are legitimate and unsupportable attacks on groups of people in the U.S. and the world. It is difficult (and often seems unnecessary) to look past those attacks to see the humanity of the people waging them (especially when the attacks seem inhumane).\n\nAdditionally, many people will say that this kind of moderation will only weaken \"our side.\" That we need energized, angry people because that energy and anger (and fear) translates to votes, which is how change happens. But frankly, I'm not sure if I should worry more about the hatred or the politics at this point.\n\nI'm trying to do my best to remember that other people feel attacked as well...even if it seems totally irrational to me. And that both I and they are getting the most negative, distorted, evil-looking version of their opposition in their feeds. \n\nI do not see a country-wide solution to this though...and that terrifies me. Leslie and Ron, though fictional, give me hope.\n\nMusic: Wallpaper - Kevin McLeod - Incompetech.com\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Doing the Hard(er) Thing (and some very bad news)",
    "description": "Basically the thing that I didn't say in this video was...if I can't make myself get up an hour earlier in the morning even if that would make my life much better, how am I supposed to do all of the things that everyone says we need to do to live more morally. Especially when the number and intensity of those things we should be doing seems to constantly increase (along with the price of many of those things.)\n\nDo we have an infinite amount of energy to intentionally make our lives a little less enjoyable for the common good, or is there a limitation there? Is that limitation only in my head? Probably, since I have a very easy life and yet still find it difficult to do relatively easy things. Yes, indeed, despite what I said in the video, there's definitely no \"ice cream cake breaking point,\" but it is still hard to do the hard(er) thing. \n\nMaybe there is no limit to the number of difficult things we each can do but, instead, a limit to the number of difficult things we can choose to do. Which is why taking choice out of the matter helps me do hard things much more efficiently.\n\nTHE BAD NEWS\nI've talked about this a tiny bit elsewhere, but Lemon (my beautiful and ridiculous dog) is very sick. She has bone cancer and it has gotten worse fast. She's pretty uncomfortable now and every day is harder for her. She's beautiful and loving as ever, but she is in a lot of pain and it's very hard for her and us. \n\nThanks for all of your kind thoughts.\n\nGreyhounds make wonderful companions and they are always in need of homes. If you would be interested in adopting a greyhound, I would highly recommend it. And if you'd like to donate to your local greyhound adoption center in Lemon's memory, we would love that.

    "description": "In which Hank responds to and adds to an article John wrote about Millennials (http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/stop-patronising-young-people-and-start-listening) and discusses how uninteresting it has become to discuss generations as homogenous, and also why we seem to talk about what's wrong with one group without discussing the problems they face.\n\nI think we're really good at picking out negative attributes...those are the things we notice, and they're the things we write about. Sure, I'm concerned that young people won't vote, but I also understand that it is difficult to be civically engaged in a world that is divorced from your reality. I also feel like people raised in the world of deep partisanship and access to infinite information (all of it sensationalized) find not just politics but life itself overwhelming, as if every decision they make is an opportunity to either save or destroy the world. \n\nI myself was born in 1980, the cutoff between Generation X and Millennial, and while I'm fairly old I also spend a lot of time interacting with and thinking about young people, so I guess it's unsurprising that I'm sympathetic. But talking about the behavior of young people without talking about the challenges they face is dumb. And talking about one or two tendencies to behave slightly differently than other generations and then blaming that on one or two new-fangled parenting techniques (helicopter parenting) is just /awful/ sociology.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Why Are Vegetarians Annoying? (An Exploration of a Cultural Rift)",
    "description": "In which Hank delves into the meme of the annoying vegetarian, where it comes from, why it annoys us, and what's really at the root of it all.\n\nIn researching this video, I found that a lot of the numbers we throw around when talking about how bad meat eating is for the environment are really confusing and occasionally just wrong.\n\nThe most damning report (which I have quoted before) from WorldWatch turns out to have a bunch of obvious problems. Like, it counts the exhalations of livestock as a carbon emission. This isn't accurate as all carbon exhaled by livestock was recently extracted from the environment by the plants that the animals eat. I was pretty frustrated to find that WorldWatch had made this mistake (or worse, stuck by it intentionally.)\n\nIt's all further complicated by the fact that making a cow in America is actually far more efficient than making it other places. Often times we'll talk about how the food being eaten by animals could be eaten by people, but that's not always the case. Raising corn for animal consumption is much easier and cheaper and requires less resources and can be done on less-fertile land than raising it for human consumption. \n\nSo, I came out of this video with a more nuanced view, but nonetheless knowing more than ever that less meat eating means more food for more people with less impact, which is what we need most of all in this world right now. \n\nI hope this video isn't too controversial. The number one thing I wanted to say is that I wish I were better, and I will keep working toward that, but that it is also OK to be an imperfect person in an imperfect world. And so it is possible to agree with all arguments in favor of vegetarianism and remain an omnivore. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "Year End Survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9CR8YDL\n\nCORRECTIONS: \n1. Julius Caesar was not technically the first emperor of Rome, he declared himself dictator for life but did not establish a hereditary monarchy. His cousin, who succeeded him, Augustus, established the monarchy and was thus the first emperor.\n\n2. I mispronounced Aloysius Lilius. It's like \"Allowishus\" which is a name I had heard, but never seen spelled!\n\n3. The picture of Rome I used was MUCH LATER than 46 BC\n\nIn which Hank goes deep (but not too deep) into the reasons why our calendar begins on January 1st, and why January 1st is when it is. I left a lot out, actually, like why Numa was so down with January and where the names of all the months come from. It's pretty fascinating stuff. \n\nAlso, I'd like to say that just because things are arbitrary does not mean they aren't valuable. I think New Year's is a lovely holiday and I am super down with celebrating it, even if the day that we happen to celebrate it on is not special in any way at all (except that it happened to be the date of the new moon 2061 years ago.)\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "20% off Almost Everything Until Monday: http://www.dftba.com\n\nDear Hank and John (our podcast) is on iTunes and Soundcloud and wherever podcasts are free.\n\nIn this video I start out thinking about how easy it is for me to forget how cool my life is and then extend that to all of humanity because I think that this is kinda how humanity is. Now, I don't think the way we focus on problems (or are focusing on problems right now) is necessarily the most effective, but it's undeniably human. I think we need to focus less on who are opponents are and more on what we are actually trying to achieve. More and more in America, I see the discourse as \"The problem is those people who are in the way of us solving the problem\" rather than \"The problem is the problem.\" It turns out solving problems (especially human problems) is very complicated and it's very easy to misunderstand the stakeholders and people's worldviews and human nature and to think that the opposition is evil when in fact the opposition is simply different. \n\nI dunno...this year is going to be really hard. If you think the campaign rhetoric is toxic now, wait until next October. Ugh...terrifying. Let's try and do nice things for each other and get outside of our bubbles and try and understand that other people are people and they've had whole lives of maybe bad experiences and maybe bad conversations that have led them to think maybe bad things. \n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "title": "Is Success a Bad Idea? (Pizzamas Day 9 of 10)",
    "description": "FINAL DAYS http://store.dftba.com/collections/pizzamas\n\nI'm not sure if I really got to the point I was trying to get to in this video...I had to cut a good bit out to fit it into four minutes. But I guess I feel like when people compliment me on my success they are putting me inside of a certain worldview that I don't believe in, but that is seen as universal by them.\n\nWhat I think is important is financial and social security. But being perceived by society as important is a really weird thing to base \"success\" on because it is necessarily something that only a small percentage of the population can have. Not because people don't have the important skills and talents, and not because they aren't dedicated and amazing and helpful, but because it comes down to the distribution of finite resources.\n\nWhether those resources are money or the control of others or the attention of others, basing a person's value on the unequal distribution of those resources is a bad idea and I don't want to be a part of that system, or a part of the way that people justify it to themselves or to society.\n\nIf I am successful, it is because I have accomplished many of the things I have set out to accomplish and those things have had positive impacts on people's lives. I am certainly not unique or special in having done that...in fact, I would say, the vast majority of people are successes when that definition is used, which is a thing that I truly believe. I think most people die successful, and I think imagining a world in which success is some kind of rare commodity is wrong.\n\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "So the thing I /meant/ to talk about in this video was:\n\nIf the distribution systems available to stories affect what kind of stories get told, then think of all of the wonderful stories that simply aren't being told. Information that simply never had a way to get out in its most effective way.\n\nWe all know that some stories are better movies than books, or better books than movies, but for so long publishing companies and book sellers (and book buyers) shunned short-format fiction because it didn't make sense financially. \n\nIt was hard to ship around, not a great value for the reader, and hard to make money on for the publisher. So most short-form media we ingested was video or non-fiction (magazine articles.)\n\nBut now that there's a simple system for digital content, suddenly serialized novels and novellas are in high demand. The kind of content that wasn't produced for a generation now has an audience again. But what about all of those amazing short stories and novellas that we didn't get in the intervening time?! Maybe all of those creators were writing novels and we got great work out of them but, then again, maybe we didn't.\n\nAnd now we have all of this infrastructure built up around novels. not just in book stores, but in our own minds! The idea of novels, their importance. Not to mention the fact that most classes you can and will take will focus on that format because that's the format that has, for the most part, existed. And teachers might even discourage students from publishing in other formats because they're \"not legitimate\" or because the teachers grew up in a world where there was no market for that. \n\nBut instead, in this video, I mostly just yell at you without saying anything because my brain is totally fried. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND!\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

They were highlighting my own ignorances and bias...we know so little of each other...but what I have found is that the vast majority of people are good, and this debate rests wholly on the idea that that is not true of Muslims. \n\nMany people have begun to believe that in this country and it terrifies me, because it is based on nothing except fear and prejudice.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

Albeit on a smaller scale, I make the same irrational purchasing decisions and choose my own very temporary pleasure over the alleviation of real suffering every single day. Part of that is just being required to participate in culture or else be very socially uncomfortable, but it's also just straight up selfishness. I do not know how to counteract this except through force, which is why I believe in taxes, even if I hate paying them :-).\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

    "description": "It wasn't just hard to communicate this, it was surprisingly hard to come up with them. When we're confronted with negative experiences, we want to analyze them and think about them and remember them for future use. But with positive emotions, we often just feel them and enjoy them, which is wonderful, but also leads to us putting less weight on them and it seems like they take up less space in our minds. No one feels comfortable shouting at the world about how great their day was, or what a cool person they met. Recognizing and harping on the positive experiences we have is a great way, I think, to both have a better outlook on life, and have more positive experiences. So that's what I did in today's video.\n\n----\nSubscribe to our newsletter! http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/ \nAnd join the community at http://nerdfighteria.com  http://effyeahnerdfighters.com\nHelp transcribe videos - http://nerdfighteria.info\nJohn's twitter - http://twitter.com/johngreen\nJohn's tumblr - http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nHank's twitter - http://twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's tumblr - http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com",

If you can break the vicious cycle of low incomes leading to low harvests, agricultural productivity per hectare (NOT HECTACRE) can increase dramatically, as we've seen in China and Brazil. It seems boring, I know, but this is a big reason hundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty in the past 30 years. So hopefully it will happen in Ethiopia!

    "description": "Due to brain fog, I didn't explain any of the copyright stuff particularly well, but (in summation) a photographer is suing the Wikimedia Foundation (the people who create Wikipedia) for acting as if a photograph is in the public domain when he believes it is not. The only way to determine who is correct is to have a judge decide...that's how copyright law works, which is really weird. \n\nI mean, the question also becomes, if I drop my camera and it takes a really great shot...do I own that picture or not, just because the force of gravity took it. \n\nAlso, I'm curious whether the work of a non-human owned by a human (like a dog) would pass to that human. Just like something created by a piece of computer software would be owned by the person who owns the software. It doesn't change this case because no one owns that monkey. \n\nANYHOW!

    "title": "Towering Mountains of Ignorance",
    "description": "This was a somewhat challenging topic to take on in four minutes, so here's a little more explanation. \n\nI'm not saying that we don't know things...we know lots of things. But particularly when it comes to social and cultural and economic stuff, we really don't. It's so hard to run experiments on the real world, that we tend to do the studies and then no one changes their mind and everyone explains the data in a different way. \n\nBut you can run the \"Harry Potter\" experiment again with different inputs because \"Harry Potter\" can only happen once. \n\nOf course, there are people who are much better at guessing than other people because they know much more about the situations. People who understand, at least, what is and is not possible (which is an excellent place to start if you're trying to, say, create an independent Palestinian state.) \n\nSame goes for running a business...you will never take the most successful course, because there are infinite courses and only one maximum one. But some people are very good at finding good courses because they understand their customers and their markets and their employees and have fairly accurate constructions of reality as it relates to their business. \n\nBut the idea that it is the responsibility of every person to have an opinion on everything that matters...and then cling to that opinion as an important part of their identity, sucks. I don't like it. \n\nI would rather we discuss these things in terms of values, which is really where our opinions tend to arise from anyhow. So when asked \"how do we create more jobs in America\" we don't really try to answer that question. We try to answer the question \"How do we create more jobs in America while promoting our own personal values?\" \n\nFor things like \"How do you end a war\" or \"How do you feed hungry people\" or \"How do you eliminate poverty?\" I'm going to admit straight up that I don't know...and defer to the experts because they know a heck of a lot more than me. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. So, yay, I DON'T KNOW!!!",

Make sure that you're headed to a part of town you'll be safe in and have a very good and stable plan for getting home.\n\n2. It's usually pretty easy to meet performers after the show, but they often have to move their own equipment and the venue will require them to be out by a certain time, so understand if they can't hang. \n\nIf you have any other advice, make sure to list it in the comments. \n\nThere are still tickets for a few of our shows if you want to come: http://edwardspoonhands.com/post/89196780970/harryandthepotters-poster-illustration-by",

Enjoy.\n\nHomestar Runner - http://www.homestarrunner.com\nI really believe this is one of the internet's greatest treasures. You could spend weeks rummaging around in here, and I encourage you to do that. There are not a lot of things that are simply as joyful and peculiar and deeply pleasing in my life as Homestar Runner. Just remember that, back in the day, my entire dorm would run to the nearest computer when we heard a new sbemail was out. \n\nAll Your Base - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fvTxv46ano\nThe thing to remember about All Your Base Are Belong to Us is that it was a self-sustained project that involved the willing collaborations of hundreds of individuals. The promotion of the original meme, the photoshopping, the musicians who created the synthesized voices...people were creating it simply because they loved being a part of its creation. \n\nThe End of the World - http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/end\nI don't know why this caught on so hard or who the creator was or where they are today, but it is a wonderful thing",

    "description": "Animal Wonders on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/anmlwndrs\n\nThis was a hard video to squeeze into four minutes, I had to leave a lot of information in the cracks. If a city of 70,000 people simultaneously contained dozens of the most influential humans in all history, it simply can't be that there was something special about those humans, the odds are just too great. \n\nIt's about circumstance, and one of the most important parts of that, and one thing that I admire greatly in people and am lucky enough to have found some of on my own, is the deep belief that your goals are important. Important enough to get out of that comfy bed. Important enough to overcome the apathy and ennui. Important enough to work hard and make sacrifices for.\n\nAmazingly, a lot of those things that people become extremely passionate about and believe in so insanely deeply are, on their own, completely arbitrary. Like Football...people train their entire lives, wreck their bodies and destroy their health to put a ball over a line. It is important because it is important...and that's true of all of the great human endeavors. We are the deciders...the great trick of great people is convincing yourself that what you're doing is so important that it's worth sacrifice to achieve. \n\nAnd I am very grateful to Nerdfighteria for inspiring that belief in me for the last seven years. I've never questioned how important and wonderful this is, and that's because of this community.",

There's a really huge audience of very young women on YouTube, and I'm really worried about them basing their self-worth on whether they appeal to guys. That seems to be how the world is set up. I'm a dude, of course, so I'm basing this on what I've seen on YouTube and IRL, but I don't think I'm crazy.\n\nI should have said in the video...this isn't meant to be relationship advice. There are lots of good people out there with whom to have relationships, but what they're \"looking for\" doesn't necessarily correspond with what they actually want or need. That \"love at first sight\" moment is pretty much the least interesting moment of a relationship (despite being one of the most exciting.)\n\nThe song at the end is Marilyn Hanson, which will be on my new album which is coming out...oh...less than a month from now?

They're a band that a friend of mine was in from 2001 to 2005, you can get their second album on Bandcamp for free (or pay for it, because it's great http://leewards.bandcamp.com/.) This song was on their first album, which was never released so, like, only a few dozen people have ever heard this song before.\n\nAnd now, because of this video, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people will hear it! That's REALLY WEIRD!\n\nI find it very strange that there is so much wonderful music in the world that no one will ever hear again....just lost...forever...like a goose in the wind.

The Internet is getting faster. Cancer mortality is decreasing. And the Colts are in the NFL playoffs. In short, there are many reasons to be hopeful that 2014 might be the best year on record for humans, even if much of this growth is not (currently) sustainable.\n\nMost of the statistics in this video came from the UN: http://unstats.un.org/UNSD/Demographic/sconcerns/income/default.htm\nOr from Human Progress: http://humanprogress.org/\nOr from the wikipedia article about motor vehicle deaths: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year",

Oh, and there is a surprise.\n\nThe Foundation is now a real, actual charity, which means your donations are now tax-deductible. (At least in the U.S.) You can donate directly at http://fightworldsuck.org/. Thanks to very generous anonymous contributors to the Foundation, every dollar you donate up to $125,000 will be matched. And because the Foundation to Decrease Worldsuck has 0 overhead, every penny you donate will go to p4a charities chosen by the nerdfighter community.",

    "description": "In which Hank talks about apologies. \n\nI've been thinking about it a lot because some of my good friends did dumb things, realized how dumb they were, and made very good apologies, not because they're good at apologizing but because the legitimately feel bad for the harm that they've caused. \n\nOn the other hand, some other people on the internet seem perpetually convinced that the world is out to get them and that they are in a battle to confirm that they are always right. But, y'know, you're never always right, and the fact that you didn't intend to hurt someone has no bearing on whether or not you hurt someone. \n\nChescaLeigh's video was really helpful for me and is more specific to when you get called out on being inappropriate or hurting an entire group of people with your language or actions...she is REALLY AMAZING... \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xJXKYL8pU",

John argues that employer-dependent health insurance privileges employees over entrepreneurs, thus limiting innovation, growth, and job creation.\n\nCheck out Henry's videos: http://www.youtube.com/minutephysics and http://www.youtube.com/minuteearth\n\nThis is part two of a three or possibly four-part series about health care reform and the Affordable Care Act.

Who's at fault? Insurance companies? Drug companies? Malpractice lawyers? Hospitals? Or is it more complicated than a simple blame game? (Hint: It's that one.)\n\nFor a much more thorough examination of health care expenses in America, I recommend this series at The Incidental Economist: http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-makes-the-us-health-care-system-so-expensive-introduction/\nThe Commonwealth Fund's Study of Health Care Prices in the US: http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Issue%20Brief/2012/May/1595_Squires_explaining_high_hlt_care_spending_intl_brief.pdf\nSome of the stats in this video also come from this New York Times story: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/health/colonoscopies-explain-why-us-leads-the-world-in-health-expenditures.html?pagewanted=all\n\nThis is the first part in what will be a periodic series on health care costs and reforms leading up to the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, in 2014.",

    "description": "In which Hank talks about our cognitive bias toward bad news, how that affects us, and why there are, in fact, lots of reasons to be optimistic about the future of humanity on the Earth. All of this was inspired by the people I met in Seattle while helping launch this Kickstarter for a space telescope (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1458134548/arkyd-a-space-telescope-for-everyone-0?ref=live). \n\nAlso, one of the guys behind that project wrote a book that heavily inspired this video and it is really really good and very interesting. I suggest you buy and read it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451614217?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=1451614217&linkCode=shr&tag=vlogbrothers-20\n\nNow I want to be clear that I don't think humanity is safe, or that we're not in the middle of a significant mass-extinction event, or that we're royally screwing up the planet, or that future generations won't be astounded by our arrogance...\n\nI do, however, think that there is a very good chance that humanity will still be creating and solving problems thousands of years from now. Because creating and solving problems appears to be the two things we're best at.\n\nAwesome moving graph came from http://www.gapminder.org",

    "description": "When I was growing up, the stigma surrounding homosexuality was so severe (not in my household, but in the broader culture) that I feared I was gay because of tiny little signs that actually had very little (or nothing) to do with sexuality (like enjoying the music of the Village People). That confusion was terrifying to me because this stuff just wasn't talked about culturally (even though my parents were super-supportive.)\n\nBecause that was hard for me, I assume that it's hard for lots of other people, so I wanted to make a video about sexual orientation in a frank and adult way, talking about identity, love, sex, and attraction. But since my own experience is pretty limited (being pretty much totally straight) I asked some friends if they'd like to share their experiences and thoughts. \n\nThanks VERY much to:\nHannah Hart http://www.youtube.com/myharto\nTyler Oakley http://www.youtube.com/user/tyleroakley\nZe Frank http://www.youtube.com/user/zefrank1\nMeg Turney http://www.youtube.com/user/megturney / SourceFed\n\nFor thinking great thoughts and sticking their neck out there for me. \n\nAlso, Hannah has a whole series on coming out and sexual orientation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ_8O929WOA&list=PLaUGyW1LBjMuP1Dma5o9W_eAGsshQ5nrR\n\nMusic: Inner Light from Incomptech http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300021\n\nCrisis hotlines by country:\n\nU.K. 08457-90-90-90\n\nAustralia 13-11-14\n\nCanada 1-800-448-1833\n\nBelgium 02-649-95-55\n\nNew Zealand 5222-999 or 0800-111-777\n\nFrance 01-45-39-40-00\n\nGermany 0800-111-0-333\n\nArgentina: 54-0223-493-0430\n\nAustria: 01-713-3374\n\nBarbados: 429-9999\n\nBotswana: 3911270\n\nBrazil: 21-233-9191\n\nCanada:\n\n519-416-486-2242 (Ontario)\n\n1-888-787-2880 (Alberta)\n\n1-866-872-0113 (British Colombia)\n\nChina:\n\n(852) 2382-0000 (Hong Kong)\n\nCosta Rica: 506-253-5439\n\nCroatia: 01-4833-888\n\nCyprus: 357-77-77-72-67\n\nDenmark: 70-201-201\n\nEgypt: 7621602\n\nFinland :040-503-2199\n\nFrance: 01-45-39-4000\n\nGermany: 0800-181-0721\n\nHolland: 0900-0767\n\nIndia: 92-22-307-3451\n\nIreland: 44-0-8457-90-90-90\n\nItaly: 06-705-4444\n\nJapan: 3-5286-9090\n\nMexico: 525-510-2550\n\nNetherlands: 0900-0767\n\nNew Zealand: 4-473-9739\n\nNorway: 47-815-33-300\n\nNew Guinea: 675-326-0011\n\nPhilippines: 02-896-9191\n\nPoland: 52-70-000\n\nRussia: 8-20-222-82-10\n\nSpain: 91-459-00-50\n\nSouth Africa: 0861-322-322\n\nSweden: 031-711-2400\n\nSwitzerland:143\n\nThailand: 02-249-9977\n\nUnited Kingdom: 08457-90-90-90\n\nUkraine: 0487-32715",

    "description": "John on the Late Late Show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjjWhLxf-o\n\nOnce when I like 10 years old, I was sitting in a school auditorium...I looked at all the people, and the (required) fire exits in the room. And I thought to myself that there weren't enough doors to save everyone in every situation. In order to do that, you'd have to make the whole building doors...but it wasn't worth it...so there must be some calculus to determine how much trouble / money a human life was worth. \n\nI was right...and it's not an inhuman thing, it's important to know. And in this video, we talk about the monetary value of a human life. It's variable...depending on whether you're talking about selling the individual moments, or ending the life forever. But I don't think it should be...if we're willing to sell all the individual moments of our lives for $2M, why would we then value the act of not dying at far more than that? Maybe it's because we treasure our histories more than we treasure the moments yet to come, but that seems wrong to me. \n\nSOURCES: \n$130,000 - http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html\n$500,000 - http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52561-2005Jan31.html\n$500,000 (for organs) - http://gizmodo.com/5904129/heres-how-much-body-parts-cost-on-the-black-market\n$9,000,000 - http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/business/economy/17regulation.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0",

It was pretty hard to choose what thoughts I've had to turn into this video...I had about seven ideas for Thoughts from Places videos...that's just what being on a trip like this does to you. There's so much to think about! Too bad we're DEAD TIRED!\n\nBut this idea was overwhelmingly interesting to me, and has hit me really hard on this trip. I also got to see Charles Darwin's grave who was the man who figured out that just as individuals are a continuum of events, life is a continuum of species, all inter-related. A city is a series of events, ideas, constructions and occurrances, just like a human life...just like all life, and just like all culture and even all technology. \n\nBeing in a place where those continuums are more obvious (especially to someone who does not always see them) it feels very special and inspiring and exciting to be a part of the human endeavor.",

    "description": "In which Hank discusses why life is so terrifying, and why that's OK. \n\nOh, and also, we're playing Carnegie Hall: http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2013/1/15/0700/PM/John-and-Hank-Green-An-Evening-of-Awesome/\n\nSo Charlie made this video\nWhich prompted these people to make these videos:\nMichael Aranda http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPsVQHu5lA4\nMyles http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0VYcJGcz3Y\nMickeleh http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6FyaoUAD0U\nWheezy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi04oCcCICQ\n\nWhich prompted me to make this video\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ph1Oe5_LkU\n\nAnd then the comments on that video made me want to make the video above.\n\nThis is especially weird because this is very similar to a video I made on HanksChannel, though spruced up for Vlogbrothers. But the real point I want to make is that making things is terrifying, and making our selves is the most terrifying creation of all, and we have to do it every single time we meet new people, which is why that's scary. But it's OK for it to be scary, because that's how you know something's worthwhile.\n\nAlso, the other point is...we're all scared.

But then again, maybe not. \n\nNot only would Puerto Rico's statehood be a very uphill battle to a supermajority in Congress, it also remains an extremely divisive issue with the commonwealth. But it is fascinating that Puerto Rico remains, in effect, a colony of the United States and has been an autonomous country for all of four weeks (after the Spanish gave it up and before the US took possession) in it's 500 year history.\n\nIt's important to note that the question on the ballot was an odd one (I didn't have time to talk about this in the video). It was a two-part question, first asking if people wanted to see Puerto Rico's status change (a majority did) and then asking, if it did, how they would like it to change (even if they had just said that they /didn't/ want it to change.)\n\nA large number of people did not answer the second question, indicating that the majority that favored statehood may have been overwhelmed by the people who didn't want any chance mixed with the people who wanted full independence or a different commonwealth status. \n\nNonetheless, the portion of Puerto Rico favoring statehood continues to increase, and this is an issue that we will have to face some day.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "title": "Understanding the National Debt and Budget Deficit",
    "description": "In which John discusses the US national debt, the federal budget deficit, plans for shrinking or eliminating the deficit, and tries to provide some context to the political rhetoric and statistics that are constantly thrown around in an election season. Along the way, I hope you'll understand why the United States' sovereign debt hasn't led us to an economic crisis, but also why budget deficits need to shrink in order to ensure that credit remains inexpensive and the US continues to enjoy the trust of the world economy. (Friendly reminder: Educational videos, by extensive precedent, are allowed to be longer than 4:00.)\n\nHere's why I think the gold standard is a bad idea: 1. By restricting money supply to the supply of gold, you risk shrinking the money supply just because of a shock leading to a disruption in supply from mining. This creates a lot of volatility in the money supply for no reason. 2. The gold standard limits a government's ability to respond to changes in the market, which can (and has) led to unescapable deflationary spirals. 3. Far from inspiring investor confidence, its implementation would crush it: http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/gold-369936-standard-money.html\n\nPosters and stuff: http://dftba.com\nMy tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\nMy twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "It's Hanko de Mayo! We all know Hank loves the James Webb Space Telescope, so hopefully he'll like our gift. In addition to his gift, nerdfighteria is celebrating Hank's birthday by letting our elected officials know that Increasing Awesome through scientific exploration is important to us. You'll find the email I wrote my congressperson and senators below. You can copy it, amend it, or write your own. Here's how:\n\nAMERICANS:\n\nFind your congressional representative here:\n\nhttp://www.house.gov/representatives/find/\n\nAnd your senators here:\n\nhttp://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\n\nClick through to their contact pages to email them.\n\nNON-AMERICANS:\n\nI do not know how to email your representatives, but I do know that it is possible in every democratic country, and since the James Webb Space Telescope is a collaboration among many nations, it's likely that your government is involved. So let them know how much space exploration and science funding matter to you!\n\nHere's my letter:\n\nDear Congressman Carson,\n\nMy name is John Green. I'm a voter in your district, and I'm contacting you to ask that you work to increase federal government support for NASA and other scientific initiatives. NASA projects like the James Webb Space Telescope offer us the opportunity to understand the very beginning of our universe. For centuries, government-backed scientific programs have improved the lives of every person on the planet, and they are a gift to every person who will live after us. It's vital that the United States lead the world in increasing awesome through scientific exploration and discovery. So please support NASA and projects like the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nIt's a big universe. And it is our privilege and responsibility as human beings to work to understand and appreciate it.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn Green\n\nHUGE thanks to everyone at NASA and Northrop Grumman who made Hank's present possible, especially Ron Birk, Charlie Atkinson, and Rolf Danner. And thanks to Michael Gardner at ecogeek for facilitating the whole process.

Examples of poor policy making include  congress's failure to secure long-term funding for the FAA (which should be easy, since it's paid for entirely by a tax that most travelers are more than content to pay), Congressional Republicans' refusal to pass a long-term highways bill (which makes road work more expensive than it needs to be), and by congressional Democrats refusal to consider sensible medicare reform that might bring better health care outcomes to more older Americans while bringing cost savings to Medicare.\n\n(To be fair: Some congressional democrats want to reform medicare; a few congressional republicans thought the whole FAA debacle was an embarrassment; and one noted Democrat, President Barack Obama, has consistently expressed support for smart reform of Medicare, despite huge blowback from his party.)\n\nAll this while biking a 30-mile loop around the great city of Indianapolis.\n\nHolden Caulfield Thinks You're a Phony: http://www.dft.ba/holden\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "(It occurred to me while editing that you are not actually able to confirm that I ever put on pants.) In which John travels to Amsterdam--where he lived for two months while finishing The Fault in Our Stars--to promote the Dutch edition of the book. Along the way he visits places that were important to him and to the made-up people in his novel, including the Spui Square, the Beninghof, a bathroom that you must pay to enjoy, the Vondelpark, the Anne Frank House, the hotel de Philsosoof, takes a ride on a canal boat, and listens to a mathematician discuss infinity.\n\nThanks, as always, to the extraordinary community of Dutch nerdfighters for their support, and to my Dutch publisher Lemniscaat for bringing me back to the city I love so much.\n\nCORRECTION: What I meant to say is that Hazel incorrectly concludes that the set of numbers between 0 and 1 is smaller than the set of numbers between 0 and 2. In fact, they are the same size. (Check out the wikipedia article about infinite cardinality for a few proofs of this mind-blowing fact.) Anyway, I don't know why I said whole numbers when I meant to say numbers.

The internet is coming into its own as a powerful political force, and just in time to face serious threats. \n\nNote: All buskers in this video received at least a $5 tip. Posting a video of a busker is a really interesting intellectual property discussion, actually. If I were to take 20 videos of that one man band and create a YouTube channel all about him and then make a bunch of money off of it and not give him any, that would clearly be wrong, but it would not (as far as I can tell) be illegal. He's performing in a public space and I am thus allowed to record him. It's another example of the rule \"don't be a dick\" being far more important than any law congress can pass on copyright reform.\n\nWe are entering a brave new world here, thank you for standing up for the internet, helping to defeat SOPA and PIPA, and thinking deeply about these issues.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

They want to create a system whereby any website in America could be turned off at a moment's notice. And if they can do it, don't worry, they will. \n\nWebsites will be so afraid of this new power that they will not wait to be censored, they will censor themselves, stifling the culture of creation that has become so powerful on the internet. \n\nCongress will never be able to keep up with the people who want to infringe on copyright, but they will be able to track down and stomp out casual users who want to cover songs, create mashups, GIFs, videos, let's plays, and commentaries. \n\nThey'll do a great job of scaring legitimate users while missing the real violators, who have enough expertise and free time to get around whatever blocks the government puts in place. \n\nIt's idiotic...technology has created a new paradigm for content creators. They cannot legislate this technology away, and even if they could they shouldn't. \n\nPlease contact your senators and representatives, and tell them to vote against the Protect IP and SOPA bills. Tell them that you think copyright law is important, but constricting the freedom of the internet is not the way to do it.

    "title": "Hackers, Cyber crime, and a New Kind of War.",
    "description": "In which Hank talks briefly about the fundamental shift in espionage, warfare, crime, and activism that may re-define our age. \n\nMore about Stuxnet here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g0pi4J8auQ\n\nwith a pretty in depth article here:\n\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9185919/Is_Stuxnet_the_best_malware_ever_\n\nHackers have been mounting increasingly sophisticated attacks. Billions of dollars have been stolen, and even more has been lost in the form of stolen intellectual property and infrastructure damage. Stuxnet proved that a computer hack can do real-world damage, and if it can be done once, I doubt we will be able to stop it from being done again. \n\nUnlike traditional warfare, we frequently don't know where cyber attacks come from. And with the right team of people, an attack could be pulled off that could destabilize the entire world. It's pretty scary stuff.\n\nOn a lighter note...I've started up my gaming channel again: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\n\nTOBUSCUS POSTER: http://www.forhumanpeoples.com/\n\nDEFINITIONS:\n\n\nHacker - a person who can manipulate computers and technology, but more usually a person who breaks into computers that they should not be inside of. \n\nVulnerability - a problem in software that can grant access to data and processes that should be kept secret, like passwords or credit cards or the controls to a nuclear power plant. \n\nExploit - Software or procedures that allow people to take advantage of vulnerabilities. This will often come in the form of a simple script that anyone with even basic computer knowledge can run.\n\n0-Day Exploit - An exploit that has not been released into the wild. Only the hacker, and possibly his or her close associates, know about the security hole at this point. A 0-Day exploit for an operating system can be sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhite Hat -  A hacker who uses his skills for good, informing organizations of security holes in their software, often these people are just referred to as security experts.\n\nas ooposed to: \n\nBlack Hat - The sort of hackers that we generally call to mind when we hear the word Hacker.\n\nPatch - Software update that fixes the vulnerability. Often patches are not applied and exploits remain in-use for years.\n\nScript Kiddies - Armies of unskilled, usually young people who just run scripts that hack targets for hackers above them in an organization.

The bike taunting story is true, but it's also a metaphor. Bullies bully because they are weak, not because they people they're bullying are weak. Their weakness makes them so frightened that they have to find some way to feel stronger. \n\nAnd, of course, the person getting bullied also feels tremendously weak and inferior, but it's important to realize that bullying does not come from a place of strength, it comes from weakness and fear. The more they bully, the weaker they become. \n\nThis is why I am unsurprised to discover that many of my physically weakest friends are in fact the most brave.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

It had a huge effect on me. \n\nNow, with the program ending, we will need to find new ways to reach low-earth orbit, and also new ways to expand manned exploration beyond low-earth orbit and into the rest of the solar system. \n\nWell, I got to talk with Mike Massimino, the Astronaut who's always going on Conan, Bobby Braun, NASA's Chief Technologist, Lori Garver, the Deputy Administrator at NASA and...yes Charlie freaking Bolden - NASA's Administrator.\n\nCharlie Bolden's boss is...yes...Barack Obama.\n\nNASA has clearly embraced the spirit of Nerdfighteria and I can't tell you how much that means to me. Thanks to NASA for understanding how amazing this community is. And, also, thanks to Nerdfighteria, for being awesome in the first place.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "In which John celebrates financial independence by explaining how minimum-wage summer jobs can become incredibly lucrative if only you save some of your money in a retirement account. In the US, the most common retirement accounts are called IRAs (IRAs have tax advantages), but any investment account will do. Just sock the money away in a low-fee diverse mutual fund, wait 50 years, and enjoy the magic of compound interest.\n\nCaveat: Obviously, I am not a financial advisor or investment professional. I am a novelist. Also, while it's a good idea to start an IRA in high school for most people, it may be a BAD idea if you're planning to seek financial aid from a private college in the US, because they might count your retirement savings against your financial aid application. (If you attend or will attend a public university, this is unlikely to happen according to my research, although again, I am a novelist, not a banker.)  \n\nThere are a LOT of nerdfighters in the voting round for YouTube NextUp Europe.

    "title": "Google Is Alive!",
    "description": "In which Hank attempts to define what life is, argues that Google is in fact alive (albeit poorly) and then proves that individual lives have no (or extremely little) value for their own sake...with mouthwash. \n\nTo be clear:\n\n1. I am not arguing that Google should be treated like a sentient life form. If Google is alive, it's alive the same way a virus is. The fact that it's alive does not change its ethical status. It is very interesting though.\n\n2. While I don't value the individual lives of the bacteria in my mouth, I value \"life\" tremendously and believe that one bacteria in a world otherwise devoid of life would be the most precious thing on that world. But seeing as how there are trillions of bacteria within four feet of me right now, I'm not particularly concerned with their welfare. So \"life\" is not a good qualification for \"value.\"\n\n3. I have done some further research and it appears that the Mrs. Gren thing is not so much criteria for life (though they are often referenced as criteria for life) it's more like \"properties\" of life...as we know it. I'm less interested in describing life than I am in determining what makes one thing alive and another thing not alive. Describing what we've got is easy, deciding the status of something that may (or may soon) exist is an entirely different matter.\n\n4. I'm very interested in people's thoughts about about the \"want\" theory, though, obviously, this is a loose definition of \"want.\" Does a plant really \"want\" to turn toward the sun...no. What I'm saying is more \"reacts to it's surroundings in order to fulfill its needs.\" But \"Life Wants\" just sounds so much better. The question of whether Google (or fire, for that matter) is reacting to its needs in order to fulfill its needs is an interesting one, but I don't really think that computer programs \"want.\" They don't have needs, they have instructions....but how different is that from the instructions that bacteria have from their genes?\n\nFinally, Google does satisfy Schrodinger's criteria of increasing order using available energy. I think Schrodinger's criteria is, in fact, better than mine since you can't argue that fire meets it (as fire increases entropy) and it makes me feel as if Google is, in fact, alive. \n\nHowever, using this criteria, one could also argue that an automated factor that turns plastic into toys is also alive, as it would be using energy to decrease entropy. If it is truly autonomous though, that almost seems as alive as a virus to me.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

Also, past years, if we can ever figure out how make YouTube videos go back in time. \n\nAlso, I would like to offer this video to graduates of schools (or whatever it is they have) on other planets. \n\nSo...to all of you...get ready to...KEEP LEARNING! With less structure and fewer metrics for success.\n\nLyrics??\n\nGood Morning John, and all of the rest of you\nI come to you now from this familiar vestibule\nwith advice for the graduates of college and high school\nA familiar format, the well meaning nice tool\nwho'll grant you this, a afternoon's savor\nfor cash or a favor,  food with no flavor\ninspring advice for the next few days\nYou'll do well, have some of this koolaid. \n\nIt's time, you must bite of the cherry of life\nIt'll taste like fear and hope and diet coke and rainbows\nBut don't be surprised when the pain grows\nthis is kinda gonna suck, you can't abstain though\n\nThere is no \"do not\"\nThere's no effin try\nThere's no \"I don't wanna\"\nIt's life...If you don't like it then die\n\nWait no, I'm not condoning suicide\nJust trying to be motivational\noverly sensational\nYou get it, I'm sure\nSo I abjure \n\nOh, you don't know what Abjure means?\nEhhhh..maybe you're not as prepared as you seem\nIt's like rejecting an error but with a bit extra care \nI'm pretty sure they should have taught you that\nI'm making a point, you don't know jack\nThe best of you can hope to have been taught to learn\nTo yearn for more that you'll still have to earn\n\nYou're not ending learning, you're ending this one structure\nAnd OK, I'm starting to sound like a schmuck, sure\nBut you're gonna keep learning, one way or the other\nWhether it's how to make change or be someone's mother\nOr make music or toffee or coffee or spread sheets\nOr hotels or laws or web sites or bed sheets.\n\nAnd don't think \"but I majored in lit I won't do that $#*%\"\nI majored in chemistry, what did I do with it?\nI make videos for nerds, an entrepreneur\nI taught myself 90% of what I've learned\n\nAnd that's normal, average, boring, but true\nAnd for most hearing this it's be true of you too\nIt should be, if it's not, that life's hardly real\nAnd that's scary, sure, be wary but deal\nInsecurity is something you will always feel\n\nThe deep dark yawning pit of the next step of your life\nMight look like a fall but it could be a flight\nAnd who knows, that pit might be filled with ice cream\nmaybe you're lactose intollerant, but you get what I mean\n\nOr maybe pain and failure is all that's awaiting you\nI'm just baiting you. \nWhether your facing hell or a festival\nMy point here, right now, is grab it by the testicle.\n\nMake it your bitch! This is all you've got!\nYour one shot, it's short, it's actually probably not\nBut while you grab life by the balls be careful with people\nDon't be a creep or you might find a deep hole\nSuccess might be however you define it\nBut if you define it wrong, you're never gonna find it.\n\nOr even if you do, it'll suck to know\nthat you got there at the expense of those\nwho you love, or would have, if you'd ever even tried\nBecause it's not he-who-has-the most toys when he died\nIt's just life, and if you're not at least trying to be happy then why?\n\nSo  ONE you don't know jack, TWO be nice to others.\nWhether you become executives, or barristas or stay-at-home mothers\nAnd lastly, have fun, OK that's all, I think I'm done\n\nAnd, that was a pretty good denoumont\nSo uhhhh...I'll see you on wednesday John.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "In which Hank talks about the 0.45% of the federal budget devoted to space education, and what NASA is doing with that money. \n\nJust an aside, my friends often say that we shouldn't be spending money on space when we have so many problems here on Earth. And I understand that argument. But I think that mentality is flawed. We can't wait until all of our problems are solved (which they will never be) before doing amazing, inspiring, ambitious things. \n\nIf we have nothing great to aspire to, nothing great to fight for, then what do we have? Will we spend the time and energy necessary to make the world a better place if we don't have great things to aspire to?\n\nI know it's a complicated issue, it's almost like talking about the psychology of an entire planet. But I know what drives me to make the world better, and it isn't knowing how horrible it is. The greatness of the world is what makes me want to make it better, and NASA has done more to uncover and create awesome than any other government agency. \n\nThat's just how I feel. \n\nThanks to NASA for their help with this video, it was really amazing to work with them.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

The coolant systems that would prevent this from happening were disabled by the tsunami. Cracks in the fuel rods created an environment allowing hydrogen to form, which concentrated and then exploded several times destroying both the primary and secondary containment structures at at least one reactor. \n\nThe result is that the reactor needs to remain cooled or else radiation from the meltdown will be released to the environment in significant quantities. The people working to keep the reactor from overheating are risking their lives to do so, and we all hope they will be able to stabilize the reactor without harm.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "The James Webb Space Telescope is the successor to the Hubble's throne. In order to pick up extremely faint infra-red signals from extremely distant stars and galaxies, the JWST has to be extremely cold. Any noise from the IR radiation of the Sun or Earth would make it impossible to see as far into the past as scientists want to. \n\nThus, the JWST has to be a million miles from the earth, protected by a six-layer heat shield as big as a tennis court. This will allow the Webb Telescope to peer into the deepest reaches of space, through clouds of dust into stellar nurseries and back in time 13.4 billion years. \n\nNot only will we get the most detailed views of our universe ever, but the JWST will provide insights into how solar systems, galaxies, stars and even the Universe were formed.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "Pizza Shirt: http://dftba.com/pizza Planet Money: http://dft.ba/-b6g\n\nIn which John Green discusses the insane story of how the United States of America ended up subsidizing the cotton industry in Brazil so that America could continue its own illegal subsidies of its cotton farmers. This year and every year until we end our illegal cotton subsidies, the U.S. federal government will pay $147 million of American tax dollars to Brazilian cotton farmers to make up for our illegal subsidies, which amount to more than $3 billion most years.\n\nThere's no question that American cotton subsidies create jobs, but there's ample evidence that the same $3 billion could be used to create MORE jobs, either through more efficient direct government stimulus or through just not spending that $3 billion and allowing private industry to create jobs with that 3 billion in capital. This is (one of the reasons) why economists generally hate industry-specific subsidies.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

(You can google \"project for awesome\" to watch some past p4a videos.) Soon there will be an official thumbnail to use for your video--we'll explain how to do that--and then on December 17th at noon pacific time, we'll all simultaneously upload our p4a videos to youtube. The project will continue with all of us watching and commenting upon p4a vids and then on Saturday, there will be a huge live show hosted by Youtube from Los Angeles.

    "description": "In which Hank proves that he can think too much about ANYTHING by thinking too much about Tongue Twisters. It's all about the sibilant fricatives baby. Tongue twisters are actually a universal game that all people play regardless of language. The best ones have a few qualities:\n\n1. They will trip you up\n2. They're fun to say when you get it right\n3. Opportunities for Embarassment\n4. Excellent Rhythm and cadence and possibly rhyme as well.\n\nPsycho-linguists (yes, that's a thing) still don't know exactly why tongue twisters trip people up, but they do know that it has more to do with the mind than the tongue. But the point is that speech is far more complicated and wonderful than we generally give it credit for, and tongue twisters are one of the few opportunities we really get to enjoy how amazing it really is.\n\nNon-English Tongue Twisters:\nDenmark: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_FaH5CGA1k\n\nNorwegian: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N7AOGw4nxE\n\nCroatian and French: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liODkBry0xM\n\nCantonese: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akTySXGx27g\n\nNorwegian: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFj9dUr93JE\n\nSpanish: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2i48XoJclw\n\nDutch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnLShj6_wpo\n\nSwedish: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnPIMg9-1TM\n\nRosie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh7tUAWIbAQ\n\nIcelandic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5LXT74N_mk\n\nDutch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hsv_qvZdWk\n\nFrench: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnZMM9pS8wE\n\nDutch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNMuZgSl8no&feature=youtu.be\n\nPortuguese: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znMBHapPR6g\n\nAmahric: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUp1EZ-KaGw\n\nNorwegian: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8YkAwPL5xg\n\nJapanese Nutshot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBfYW_CnYSw\n\nSpanish: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUduNKe7aw&feature=youtu.be\n\nDanish http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOdbDBdxt-k\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

You make a video in support of a charity you wish to support, and hopefully lots of people will watch and favorite and comment upon the video. P4A videos are particularly awesome and effective when they're well-edited videos that show us how the organization you support changes lives for the better. There are lots of ways to do this, but here are a few examples:\n\nShawn's video for the uncultured project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJubQzKYMGg\n\nTyler Oakley's video for the trevor project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsMkM2sEXNE\n\nKristina Horner's video about First Book: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb35Qkb8weQ\n\nSuch videos are often useful to the charities in question, too, so don't be surprised if someone from the organization contacts you! Thanks for participating in the project for awesome, nerdfighters.

He talks some about The Rocky Horror Glee show, which, if you're wondering, he liked about 50% of the time, which is a pretty low percentage in his television viewing experience. And he talks about Fable 3, which is giving him a pretty hard time these days...keeping him up late trying to save his citizens from almost certain doom.

And let me be clear when I say...NEARLY EVERY SONG ON GLEE IS AUTOTUNED. I don't know why they do it...the kids can sing...but they do it anyway, which I find extremely annoying. \n\nBut it's cool for a few reasons too. \n\nBut I think the big reason that I have an issue is that Rocky is about an experience. People often take it out of the theater and wonder \"what's the big deal?\" Because, without the theater experience, it isn't a big deal. The \"big deal\" of it is that the people who watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show made movie-watching a two-way experience. They became part of the movie...and they will forever be a part of the movie...if only in my head. I can't hear the lines of the actual songs anymore...I hear the callbacks. \n\nI don't know how glee will handle it, but I anticipate that they will strip out all of the interesting things about RHPS and just sing a few songs. Who knows though! \n\nBut if you're over 18...you should go try and find a Rocky Horror showing in your area...because it will be an experience...it might be awkward...it might be conusing...but it will be an experience.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

Now it's almost 80. And that number is increasing every year. If it keeps increasing at that same rate, the average lifespan of a child born in 2008 will be 98 years old.\n\nTeen pregnancy, smoke and drug use have all decreased significantly since the 1990s\n\nRates of cancer have decreased steadily in the U.S. for 20 years and it's not just because people aren't smoking as much, though that's certainly part of it. It's also because new screening techniques that can detect pre-cancerous lesions in the colon and also because of the HPV vaccine which prevents the virus that causes cervical cancer.\n\nSmall Pox once killed millions of people per year, now it has been completely eradicated. It literally does not exist anymore.\n\nSince 1990, global poverty rates have decreased by more than 30%. And they're on-track to have decreased 40% by 2015.\n\nDivorce rates are much lower than people assume, and have consistently dropped since the 1970's in America. Only 20% of people who got married in the 1980s got divorced.\n\nViolent crime rates dropped 5% between 2007 and 2008. And violent crime rates have been dropping consistently every year since 1993\n\nThe Red Cross collects 15 million blood donations per year. No one is compensated for those donations, except with cookies and juice. People just like helping other people. \n\nIn 1970 there were only 400 breeding pairs of Bald Eagles left in America, but the Endangered Species Act effecively saved the species. There are now more than 10,000 breeding pairs. During the same time Whooping Cranes returned from a much more serious 50 birds total in the entire world. There are now over 500.\n\nWhat's red and smells like blue paint. \n\nRed paint.\n\nYOU LAUGHED!  When you're laughingyou burn 20% more calories than you do at a resting state.

    "description": "Amy KR's Positive Pranking: http://bit.ly/9NwPJ6 John builds upon an idea by the brilliant Amy Krouse Rosenthal to turn pranks into vehicles for worldsuck reduction. In this video, he TPs houses around his hometown of Indianapolis. (TP, in this instance, stands for Tootsie Pop.) Enjoy your tootsie pops, Indy.\n\nMy note: Hello! Your home has been TP'ed, which--for today, at least--means that it has been Tootsie Popped. These Tootsie Pops are your for the licking (and/or biting) not as a part of some marketing campaign but because of an initiative called Positive Pranking started by the author Amy Krouse Ronsethal with the help of the nerdfighters, an Internet-based community of people who seek to decrease the overall worldwide level of suck. Please enjoy, and if you're so inclined, start your own positive pranking adventure.

    "description": "Vlogbrothers shirts: http://dftba.com/vlogbros\n\nIn which John Green discusses his virulent hatred for pennies and nickels, two utterly irrelevant coins that inexplicably remain money in the United States of America. It costs more than 1.7 cents to make a 1 cent penny coin in the US; nickels are even more ridiculous, costing more than nine cents to produce.\n\nUPDATE: Those statistics are out of date. In 2009, it cost 1.6 cents to make a penny and 6.1 cents to make a nickel; the US Mint lost 22 million on penny and nickel production, not the 70 million they lost in 2008. (This is because the recession has made zinc and nickel cheaper.) Thank to youtuber http://www.youtube.com/sivartis for the correction.\n\nMy inflation calculations came from the CPI inflation calculator: http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl\n\nInformation about the opportunity cost implications of pennies and the calculations of lost productivity can be found here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/24/AR2006092400946.html and here: http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/07/penny_sense.html\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

Viacom wants YouTube to manually approve every video on the site, which would destroy YouTube\n\nIn my opinion, YouTube should pay some reparations to Viacom based on the amount of views on content owned by Viacom.

    "description": "In which John offers a summary of the health care reform bill that just passed the U.S. senate, discussing the insurance exchange market, pre-existing condition clauses, medicare taxes, and other fine points of the still-under-debate bill. Here's a good explanation of how the insurance exchanges will look like: http://bit.ly/eIwNE\n\nThanks to Alan Lastufka \n( http://youtube.com/fallofautumndistro ) for the Ben Nelson asshat photo.\n\nAbout abortion: The senate plan works like this: Policies covering abortion would be available in the exchange market (at least in some states), but those plans would have to collect two separate premiums--one covering everything other than abortion, and one for abortion coverage. The subsidy (available to all families making less than about $88,000 a year depending on number of kids) would only apply to the non-abortion policy.\n\nIf this seems like a hilariously stupid distinction, that's because it is. Ultimately, it of course doesn't matter which policy the subsidy goes toward. But then again, every federal program \"supports\" abortion in some way. For instance, without federally funded highways, it would be impossible for most women to get abortions. All government spending indirectly goes to support all activity in America, but it's ridiculous to say that, for instance, food stamps encourage meth use, even though sometimes people trade meth for food they bought with food stamps. It's equally disingenuous to say that this bill will allow federal funding of abortions, unless you're willing to argue that all government spending funds abortion.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",

    "description": "UPDATE: In the weeks since I have made this video, the evidence of electoral fraud has gone from anecdotal to irrefutable. The Iranian government itself has acknowledged that in 50 areas, more votes were counted than there are eligible voters. The government has acknowledged that 3 million ballots were stuffed, and lots of evidence indicates that it was in fact much more. The commenters saying otherwise in this video either don't have a handle on the situation or believe in broad conspiracies encompassing the entire western world.\n\nUPDATE: Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has declared the vote legitimate.\n\nIn which John discusses the Iranian presidential election. Incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reelected by a landslide over (quasi-) reformist Mir Hussein Moussavi, but I argue that there are at least five reasons to doubt the results. \n\nUPDATE: The twitter link has been shut down. Gchat and yahoo chat have also been shut down in Iran. I'm still getting good updates from http://www.twitter.com/persiankiwi and http://www.twitter.com/tehranbureau  Also worth following: http://www.twitter.com/y_shar and http://www.twitter.com/iran09\n\nUPDATE: Dozens of moderate clerics and reformist political leaders in Tehran and around Iran have been arrested. Mousavi himself is apparently not under house arrest, although he is \"being closely monitored by police,\" which sure SEEMS like house arrest. Ayatollah Khameni has restated his position that the election results were fair.\n\nUPDATE: There seems to be significant violence going on at universities around the country, as well as hundreds of arrests and reports of tear gas in the dorms.\n\n\nHERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS TO NERDFIGHTASTIC THINGS:\n\nShirts and Stuff: http://dftba.com/artist/30/Vlogbrothers\nHank's Music: http://dftba.com/artist/15/Hank-Green\nJohn's Books: http://amzn.to/j3LYqo\n\n======================\n\nHank's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/hankgreen\nHank's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/hankimon\nHank's tumblr: http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com\n\nJohn's Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/realjohngreen\nJohn's Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/johngreenfans\nJohn's tumblr: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com\n\n======================\n\nOther Channels\nCrash Course: http://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nSciShow: http://www.youtube.com/scishow\nGaming: http://www.youtube.com/hankgames\nVidCon: http://www.youtube.com/vidcon\nHank's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/hankschannel\nTruth or Fail: http://www.youtube.com/truthorfail\n\n======================\n\nNerdfighteria\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/\nhttp://effyeahnerdfighters.com/nftumblrs\nhttp://reddit.com/r/nerdfighters\nhttp://nerdfighteria.info/\n\nA Bunny\n(\\(\\\n( - -)\n((') (')",
