    "description": "Many Muslims grow up absolutely terrified of jinn. Like so many Muslim kids,  we heard chilling stories of innocent people getting haunted or possessed by jinn, stories meant to keep us obedient and afraid.\n\nIn this Halloween special, we revisit those tales of terror from our childhoods—the “true” stories that kept so many of us awake at night—and unpack them as Ex-Muslim adults. We’ll also share stories from other Ex-Muslims and from you in the live chat.\n\nThese jinn stories reveal how superstition and fear shaped many Muslims’ upbringing, and how absurd (and hilarious) they sound once the spell of belief is broken.\n\n🎃 Join us live for a creepy, cathartic and funny night of jinn horror stories—from the Ex-Muslims who survived them.\n\nFind out more about Apostate Aladdin here: https://linktr.ee/apostatealaddin \n\nFind out more about Secular Spirit below: \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Secular_Spirit \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thesecularspirit/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@secular.spirit",
