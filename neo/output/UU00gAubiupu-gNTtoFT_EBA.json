    "description": "Big thanks Dr. Muhammad Ittefaq @ScienceTalkOfficial for this interview.  Dr. Ittefaq consulted me on last week's coverage of South Asia's climate outlook- link below.  We recorded this interview on Monday, 12/15, and I have found myself thinking about what I learned from him all this week.  \n\nFor those of us working to grow our understanding, I think it is very important to understand not only our domestic outlook, but also global impacts and outlooks.  In South Asia, there is no debate.  1.5C impacts are unfolding as expected.  I deeply value the information and perspectives Dr. Ittefaq has shared in this recording both as an academic in public health, and as a person whose resilient community of origin and family are experiencing intense, repeated disaster.\n\nSouth Asia Outlook: https://youtu.be/J2KhLx-61fE\n\n~~~~~~~\nHere are some links if you'd like to stay in touch with or support AR:\n\nSign up for the Quarterly Newsletter: https://mailchi.mp/americanresiliency/subscribe-to-receive-news-from-american-resiliency\n\nTo Support Our Work:\nhttps://www.americanresiliency.org/donations",

In recent Earth Systems Updates, we've seen evidence that that whole system is looking pretty wobbly.   Many people are aware that without the warmth from the Gulf Stream, the UK would be looking at intense cold.  The question is, how cold are we talking?  \n\nIn this video we explore the risk spread for the UK and Ireland as we look to 2C of global warming in both AMOC up and AMOC down scenarios.  First we look at sea level rise, sea ice, then projected changes in temperature and precipitation.  Our exploration begins with a focus on Edinburgh and the northern Scottish coast, with additional detailing for London, Liverpool, and London.  \n\nI highly recommend using these global resources to check out the change spread for your home:\n\nhttps://coastal.climatecentral.org/\n\nhttps://amocscenarios.org/\n\nSign up for the Quarterly Newsletter- Next Issue Nov 30\nhttps://mailchi.mp/americanresiliency/subscribe-to-receive-news-from-american-resiliency\n\nTo Support Our Work:\nhttps://www.americanresiliency.org/donations",

Her sustainability curriculum for young children:\n\nhttps://www.earthfriends.us/\n\nHas foundational lessons that have been absent from many of our educations.  I encourage you to check them out.  Her prompts have led to great conversations in my circle.  In this video I also share what children have told me about climate- they do NOT feel protected by adult silence on this issue!",

In this video I talk about what it means to want to be alive through this tipping point, and I re-iterate how my work over the past year and a half has been focused on providing our community with what guideposts may be helpful in this time of fundamental uncertainty.

This region- as defined by the NCA5, our primary source material- includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. Whew!  So that's a lot to cram into twenty minutes. \n\nIf you want to skip the global update, go to about 3:30 to get right to the regional info.  \n\nIn this video we focus on factors of interest to people who love living things: the water outlook, and increases to nighttime lows.  Those factors help us understand where people will likely need to change what they grow, and help us find where the southeast is looking most stable- in east Kentucky, West Virginia, and parts of Virginia.  We also look at the twin major risks emerging in the southeast- deluge type rain, and shifting hurricane tracks.\n\nHere are a number of resources I reference in the video:\n\nhttps://www.americanresiliency.org/ \n-stable visualizations & support our work\n\nhttps://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-bulletins\n-short & clear background info\n\nhttps://nca2023.globalchange.gov/ \n-for figures & atlas\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/361134395_Interbasin_and_interhemispheric_impacts_of_a_collapsed_Atlantic_Overturning_Circulation/link/633621dc76e39959d6857360/download \n-for AMOC figures",

For our friends who grow in the Midwest, more and more states in our region are making grants available for small and mid-sized farms interested in fruit and vegetable production.

Folks have told me it helped them and I hope it helps you.\n\nFor me, a lot of the practical stuff-acquiring part of resilience building is about quality of life.  Being able to take care of my family and my community in an emergency, having more give in the system for when times get tough. \n\nBut being able to do those things isn't all about stuff.  An aircraft hanger full of freeze dried food will not help you comfort a crying child, make dried foods not taste gross, or properly put on a tourniquet. \n\nThis video talks about my approach to building resilience inside and out, focusing on skills and attitudes as well as basic physical needs.\n\n\nHere are a couple of links from in the video: \n\nFind a Stop the Bleed class:\nhttps://cms.bleedingcontrol.org/class/search\n\nFind a nutritious plant:\nhttps://www.farmersalmanac.com/spring-wild-edibles-vitamin-c",

If anyone wants to donate, @Derek-Snyder-13 on Venmo, with subject line “For NC”. \n\nFunds will go to fuel and food while we’re out there working, and the supplies we’ll bring. Anything beyond those costs will be passed directly to groups and individuals in effected areas (I’m 2 hours west of the effected area). \n\nI’ll publish receipts and records showing where all of it goes.\"\n\nI will vouch for Derek.  If you want to help get help into the mountains, without any administrative or overhead costs, I strongly encourage you to send him some cash.  My family will as well.\n\nIn terms of other resources included in this video, here's the drought monitor for North America:\nhttps://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/NADM/Home.aspx\n\nAnd for the US:\nhttps://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/\n\nAnd here's that commodities article you might find interesting:\nhttps://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mississippi-low-water-levels-third-year-barge-grain-shipping/727105/\n\nI also use figures from the 5th and the 4th National Climate Assessments:\nhttps://nca2023.globalchange.gov/\nhttps://nca2018.globalchange.gov/\n\nAnd bring up this article in Nature:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07878-z",

Southern California was released on July 25th.\n\nIn Northern California we find our \"best-shot\" area, the region of the state with the most potential for building long term resilience.  This region begins south of the Bay Area at about Half Moon Bay, extends to the eastern edge of about Napa, and returns to hug the coast all the way up to Eureka.\n\nAlongside this hopeful region, we also find a lot of serious emerging hazards.  The Central Valley looks very rough in these projections, although we do not see any additional deluge hot spots forming up north of Bakersfield in the valley.  The Sierras, my family's home, are also looking very bad.  Northeast California is also facing what looks like a terribly high rate of change.    \n\nNorthern California is also where we find the third tipping point of the west.

    "description": "In the NCA5 outlook for Oregon we issue our first battle cry, recognizing those who choose to fight for the soil of the Willamette Valley.  Their work will matter to us all, as the information we can gather from the NCA5 shows Oregon facing an extraordinary level of change.  Only the work we do on the ground can protect Oregon's precious soil.  If the soil of Oregon is allowed to be exposed and uncared for during the rapid landscape transformation ahead, we could see a terrible dust bowl emerge. \n\nThe dust bowl of the 1930's was a preventable disaster.  It hasn't happened again.  We could stop a new dust bowl from rising out of Oregon.\n\nIt's worth noting, there are gems in Oregon, too.

They love the burnet flowers and the burnet doesn't seem to mind.  Japanese beetles were a troublesome pest for me before the burnet began to thrive.  Last year especially, these two species appeared to be friends!",

Now I know better and I wanted to share this basic tip for ripening tomatoes after the frost.  Pick them before the frost and then just let them sit in a covered basket at room temperature.  I had ripe tomatoes from my garden until the second week of December last year using this technique.  They're not as good as summer tomatoes, but they're still pretty good!",

Everyone wants to see what everyone else is doing to build resilience.  It doesn’t need to be perfect- we can have fun here!  \n2. As we get ready for the next generation of state level forecasts, I want to make sure the forecasts have the types of info you need.  We had great insights for that work in this conversation, with a focus on including:\n-pollution and well information\n-information as to legal water rights and rainwater collection\n-state GIS and state Ag Extension connections when available\n-more info to help visualize climate analogs- what it will look and feel like in the state by 2050!\n3. We also talked about doing more to network, both online in the creator space and on the ground at the local government level.  I will be making some videos to help you get ready to talk with people on the ground, with communication tips to help build the kind of healthy connections and relationships that grow space for change.\n\nDo you have more ideas?

As you'll see, I'm in an area where NOAA has no advice, so we'll go out in my yard and look at what the plants are saying.  Feel free to make fun of these folk traditions if they prove wrong in the spring!  And if you have similar traditions in your area, I'd be very curious to hear about them.\n\nHere's a link to Zach Labe's wonderful climate visualizations:\nhttps://zacklabe.com/global-sea-ice-extent-conc/\n\nAnd to the NWS/NOAA seasonal page:\nhttps://www.weather.gov/hun/climateforecast",

Hurricane danger looks to be intensifying in the Caribbean and south Florida.  \n\nThere are some positives in the outlook- it appears dominant hurricane tracks will move a bit away from New Orleans and Mobile, and that much of Texas may also see some threat reduction.  Fingers crossed!\n\nDownload a copy here:\nhttps://nca2018.globalchange.gov/downloads/\nThis figure's on 1492 of the full report.

In every state-level video, you'll find useful links in the description.  \n\nHere's a tutorial to help you access the USDA climate hub tools:\nhttps://youtu.be/fEKL1mX_l3o\n\nDo you want to access that USGS archive with all the aquifer data?  Think twice and be nice!  That resource is fragile!  If you really want it, you can find it from the video, or you can email me and I'll give you the link.  But we're not gonna poke at that thing just for the heck of it.  \n\nA note on my place- which is my biggest resilience tip.  Take a chance.  There are still a lot of properties like mine in the northern plains that are abandoned and messed up and they need work to even be insurable, but it's work many people could do themselves.  And the communities, they want people in these homes.  The home is the basis of resilience.  And a home you can work on, a home you can understand all the guts, that is a home where you can dig in.",

There are some trouble spots in the state, particularly around Glacier National Park, where the spring floods will get really bad.  But the floods and other changes are likely to be more manageable than what we saw in Wyoming, with a smaller and less severe increase in summer heat, better timed changes in precipitation patterns, and plant hardiness zone shifts in agricultural areas that are likely to favor increased production.\n\nIn general, the outlook is better towards the eastern side of the state, and more challenging to the west.

    "description": "Illinois's current nasty climate puts the state ahead of the curve as we look towards 2050.  While other states gain deadly new threats, Illinois will retain much of its climate and character.\n\nThis video gives details on the different outlooks for the northern, middle, and southern thirds of the state.  Most of the news is pretty solid.  Chicago in particular has a great outlook, probably the best in the nation for a major urban center.  Central Illinois offers pretty good climate stability- better than either the northern or southern thirds of the state- while southern Illinois will be transitioning to a markedly different, much more traditionally Southern climate.  \n\nScript text is here: https://www.americanresiliency.org/learn-with-us/illinois-2050-forecast\n\nLooking for access to sources?
