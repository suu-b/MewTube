    "description": "Watch James White shockingly question a major early Christian figure existed, and see why virtually all scholars—including Protestants—say he's dead wrong.\n\nDirect Scholarly Quotes & Citations:\n\nCharles Gore (1900):\n“[W]e cannot but congratulate ourselves that now for the third time in the history of literary controversy their genuineness has been vindicated by an English scholar. It is perhaps too much to say that Dr. Lightfoot has now at last brought the controversy to an end.”\n(Charles Gore, The Church and the Ministry, 264-65, 1900)\n\nB. H. Streeter (1929):\n“The genuineness of the seven short letters written by Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, on his road to martyrdom in the Colosseum at Rome, was finally established by the monumental work of Lightfoot.”\n(B. H. Streeter, The Primitive Church, 279, 1929)\n\nStephen Neill & N. T. Wright (1988):\n“Every elementary textbook of church history today takes for granted the authenticity of … the seven letters of Ignatius, and uses them as primary source material for the historicity of the sub-apostolic age.”\n(Stephen Neill & N. T. Wright, The Interpretation of the New Testament 1861-1986, 61, 1988)\n\nMichael W. Holmes (2007):\n“So thorough and persuasive was the work especially of Zahn and Lightfoot that the great majority of scholars since their day have considered the matter of authenticity as settled once and for all.”\n(Michael W.

These self-proclaimed witches on the WITCHES VS PATRIARCHY SUBREDDIT are trying to figure out why their SPELLS AGAINST TRUMP keep failing, and some believe it's due to his SPIRITUAL PROTECTION. Is it because of PRAYERS TO ST. MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL, or is there something else at play? We'll take a deep dive into the WITCHCRAFT COMMUNITY ON REDDIT, read through their wild posts, and discuss the intersection of DEMONIC ACTIVITY, SPIRITUAL BATTLES, and PRAYER PROTECTION in today's political climate. Get ready for a blend of HUMOR and the SUPERNATURAL as we investigate whether SPELLS AGAINST POLITICIANS really hold any weight.\n\nBut that's not all! We'll also cover the comments from these witches about their FREEZER SPELLS and their belief that TRUMP IS PROTECTED by a mysterious MAGICAL SHIELD. We’ll even dive into their chants, MAGICAL RITUALS, and the power of PRAYER as a type of SPELLWORK. Is there something real about the SUPERNATURAL FORCES these witches are dealing with? How does CHRISTIANITY explain this? Watch as we tie in interviews with EXORCISTS and uncover how the EXISTENCE OF DEMONS and SPIRITUAL WARFARE could explain it all.

He specializes in the Quran, its relationship with the Bible, and the historical context of early Islam.

We dive into the QURAN'S GOSPEL problem—specifically the INJEEL—the book the Quran claims was given directly to JESUS, but for which there’s NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE. As Christians, this is a debate you NEED to understand, especially when discussing CHRISTIANITY VS ISLAM or engaging in debates with your MUSLIM FRIENDS. We also tackle hot-button topics like whether the BIBLE OR QURAN is more likely to be CORRUPTED, and the MYTH of the Quran's perfect preservation. Watch to see why this is one of the BIGGEST DILEMMAS for ISLAMIC SCHOLARS and how it relates to the TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY.\n\nThroughout the interview, we answer crucial questions like \"Did MUHAMMAD STRAW MAN the Christians in his time?\" and \"Were there actually DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE QURAN?\" If you’re interested in APOLOGETICS, CHRISTIANITY, or understanding the CHALLENGES IN ISLAMIC THEOLOGY, this video is for you. Stay tuned to learn why this issue keeps MUSLIM APOLOGISTS stuck and what it means for CHRISTIAN MUSLIM DEBATES. Don’t miss this eye-opening breakdown of ISLAM VS CHRISTIANITY and the QURAN'S HISTORICAL PROBLEMS.\n\n#Islam #Quran #Apologetics",

    "description": "There's a common objection to the Kalam Cosmological Argument that goes something like this: we never actually experience anything beginning to exist, we only ever experience new arrangements of pre-existing material. Hence, since we don't experience things really beginning to exist, the Kalam's causal principle is left unsupported.

    "description": "In this interview, I'm joined by Dr. Philip Goff, an agnostic professor, to discuss a particular fallacy of reasoning that occurs when physicists infer that a multiverse exists due to the fine-tuning of the cosmos.\n\nPhilip Goff is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Durham University, and co-host of the podcast Mind Chat. Goff’s main research focus is consciousness, but he is interested in many questions about the nature of reality. Goff is most known for defending panpsychism, the view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world. Goff has authored an academic book with Oxford University Press – Consciousness and Fundamental Reality – and a book aimed at a general audience – Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness. He is currently working on a book exploring the middle ground between God and atheism. Goff has published 45 academic articles as well as writing extensively for newspapers and magazines, including Scientific American, The Guardian, Aeon and the Times Literary Supplement. The interview with Goff by Pulitzer Prize winning author Gareth Cook was one of the most viewed of the most viewed articles in Scientific American of 2020. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Philip_Goff \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MindChat\nhttps://www.philipgoffphilosophy.com/ \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Galileos-Error-Foundations-Science-Consciousness/dp/0525564772\n\n\n---------------------------- FREE STUFF ----------------------------\n\n\n\"The Rationality of Christian Theism\" & \"The Ultimate List of Apologetics Terms for Beginners\" E-Books (completely free): https://tinyurl.com/CCFREESTUFF\n\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\n\nPatreon (monthly giving): https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\n\nBecome a CC Member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg/join\n\nOne-time Donations: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\n\nSpecial thanks to all our supporters for your continued support!

    "title": "Has @CosmicSkeptic Found Christianity's Biggest Problem? (Response)",
    "description": "In this video, I respond to Cosmic Skeptic's video \"Christianity's Biggest Problem.\"\n\nAlex's original video: https://youtu.be/5KDnnp0sDkI\n\nDESCRIPTION #1:\nThe example Grandin cites comes from a book on this, Antoinio R. Damasio \"Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain.\" And she also cites for the chapter as a whole  \"Freeman, W., and J.W. Watts. 1950. 'Psychosurgery in the Treatment of Mental Disorders and Intractable Pain.' Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publisher.\"\n\nAlso, just as a general rule, if you just google leucotomies and pain you'll find all kinds of stuff on this connection between leucotomy patients and people reporting reduced suffering. They did leucotomies in the 50s and 60s and they were way weird.\n\nDESCRIPTION #2:\n“A hypothesis h suffers from probabilistic tension if and only if h is logically equivalent to some conjunctive hypothesis, h1& h2, such that either P(h1| h2) is [greatly lesser than] 1 or P(h2| h1) is [greatly lesser than] 1: that is, one conjunct of the hypothesis is very unlikely, conditioned on the other conjunct. Among other things, a hypothesis h that suffers from probabilistic tension will be very unlikely: since P(h) = P(h1& h2) = P(h1| h2) x P(h2) = P(h2| h1) x P(h1), it follows that if P(h1| h2) is [greatly lesser than] 1 or P(h2| h1) is [greatly lesser than] 1, then P(h) is [greatly lesser than] 1.” In our case, atheism represents h. If h is really the conjunction of Atheism & Evolution, as Alex assumes, then we can represent Atheism as h1 and Evolution as h2. Since the probability of Evolution on Atheism is very unlikely, the probability of h2 given h1 is also very unlikely. Following Collins, this leads us to conclude that the intrinsic probability of h is very unlikely.\n\nDESCRIPTION #3:\nBOOKS:\n-Animal Suffering and the Darwinian Problem of Evil by John Schneider \n-God, Evolution and Animal Suffering by Bethany Sollereder\n-The Groaning of Creation: God, Evolution and the Problem of Evil by Christopher Southgate\n-Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil by Nicola Hoggard Creegan\n-Thomism and the Problem of Animal Suffering by Kyle Keltz\nDISSERTATIONS:\n-The Problem of Evil and Animal Suffering: A Case Study by Faith Pawl\n-All Creation Groans: A Theodicy for Suffering Animals by Matthew Douglass\nOTHER RESOURCES:\n-The Problem of Evil by Peter van Inwagen (has a chapter on animal pain)\n-A Random-Based Theodicy for Evolutionary Evils by Josh Rasmussen and J. Wesling\n-Certain global theodicies: e.g. skeptical theism, multiverse models, etc.\n\nDESCRIPTION #4:\nWhy Didn't God Just Create Everyone in Heaven?? - https://youtu.be/kOmOLre6CyM\n\nDESCRIPTION #5:\nhttp://dustincrummett.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/philosophy-of-religion-for-all-final-version-4-13-2019-1.pdf\n\nDESCRIPTION #6:\nThere aren't a lot of arguments for the conclusion that animals are essentially non-rational, and the ones that exist are not very good.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Wade Tisthammer (@Maverick Christian), Justin Mooney, Joe Schmid (@Majesty of Reason), Josh Rasmussen (@Worldview Design), Dustin Crummett, & Liz Jackson (@PhiLizophy) for providing helpful comments on earlier drafts of the script.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:47 4 Caveats\n07:08 Section 1 - Animal Suffering & Atheism\n16:34 Section 2 - Animal Suffering & Christianity\n36:08 Section 3 - My Current Verdict\n\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\n\nPatreon (monthly giving): https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\n\nBecome a CC Member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg/join\n\nOne-time Donations: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\n\n\n---------------------------------- LINKS ----------------------------------\n\n\nWebsite: http://capturingchristianity.com\n\n\n---------------------------------- SOCIAL ----------------------------------\n\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/capturingchristianity\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/capturingchrist\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/capturingchristianity\n\nSoundCloud: https://www.soundcloud.com/capturingchristianity\n\n\n--------------------------------- MY GEAR ----------------------------------\n\n\nI get a lot of questions about what gear I use, so here's a list of everything I have for streaming and recording.

Beall is also widely known for advocating a glut-theoretic account of logic (a non-classical approach).\n\nDr. James Anderson specializes in philosophical theology, religious epistemology, and Christian apologetics. His doctoral thesis at the University of Edinburgh explored the paradoxical nature of certain Christian doctrines and the implications for the rationality of Christian faith.\n\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\n\nPatreon (monthly giving): https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\n\nBecome a CC Member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg/join\n\nOne-time Donations: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\n\nSpecial thanks to all our supporters for your continued support!

    "title": "Strong Evidence for Reincarnation? // Seth Hart vs. Arjuna Gallagher",
    "description": "In this informal debate, Seth Hart (Christian) engages Arjuna Gallagher (non-Christian) on the strength of the evidence for reincarnation. In case you didn't know, LOTS of ink has been spilled in academia on this subject. In this debate, we focus in on a couple landmark studies.\n\nSeth Hart is a PhD student in science and theology at the University of Durham. He holds masters in theology from Oxford, Regent College, and Johnson University. His current research delves into whether the field of biology and its fundamental concepts are built upon theistic foundations, arguing that terms like “adaptation”, “organism”, and “fitness” all entail the existence of God. Seth is also a regular contributor on the Capturing Christianity blog.\n\nArjuna is a Hare Krishna, electrician and YouTuber. He runs the YouTube channel Theology Unleashed, which seeks to bring Hare Krishna (Caitanya Vaishnava) perspective to the philosophy of religion YouTube dialogue. He lives in New Zealand with his wife and 2 young boys.\n\nArjuna's YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/c/TheologyUnleashed\n\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\n\nPatreon (monthly giving): https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\n\nBecome a CC Member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg/join\n\nOne-time Donations: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\n\nSpecial thanks to all our supporters for your continued support!

    "description": "In this informal debate, Chris Date defends Annihilationism and Keith Giles defends Universalism.\n\nChris Date is a well-known evangelical Christian author, editor, blogger, podcaster, debater, and speaker. Representing a global movement known as Rethinking Hell, Chris has published three articles in academic journals and two books on the topic of hell, including Rethinking Hell: Readings in Evangelical Conditionalism, and A Consuming Passion: Essays on Hell and Immortality in Honor of Edward Fudge. Chris is also an Adjunct Professor of Bible and Theology at Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary.\n\nKeith Giles is a former pastor who abandoned the pulpit to follow Jesus and ended up founding a church where 100% of the offering is given away to help the poor in the community. He is the author of several best-selling books including \"Jesus Undefeated: Condemning The False Doctrine Of Eternal Torment\". He has appeared on CNN and was recently interviewed by USA Today, BuzzFeed, and John Fugelsang's \"Tell Me Everything.\" He also co-hosts the insanely popular Heretic Happy Hour podcast and the new Peace Catalyst Podcast.

Alex pressed on me the utter absurdity of some arrangements of activation times being okay while others weren't (when the only thing that's changing is how the clocks are set). Josh pressed the recombination principle route (see here: https://joshualrasmussen.blogspot.com/2021/02/how-to-break-grim-reaper-argument.html). Rob pointed out how Unsatisfiable Pair and Causal Finitism are not actually at odds (indeed, causal finitists have been pointing out the logical inconsistency of Benardette scenarios since the beginning). What I've produced here is a kind of synthesis of their views in a way that is both concise and convincing (to me).\n\n\n-------------------------------- GIVING --------------------------------\n\n\nPatreon (monthly giving): https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\n\nBecome a CC Member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCux-_Fze30tFuI_5CArwSmg/join\n\nOne-time Donations: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\n\nSpecial thanks to all of my supporters for your continued support as I transition into full-time ministry with Capturing Christianity!

The sequence of natural numbers is an actual infinite, like the set of all past years in an infinite past.

    "title": "Why the Puddle Analogy Against God Fails Miserably",
    "description": "In this video, I explain why the Puddle Analogy against the Fine-tuning Argument for God fails (on multiple levels).\n\n#1: The likelihood principle says that “if some evidence is more likely on Hypothesis 1 than Hypothesis 2, then that evidence confirms Hypothesis 1 over Hypothesis 2.” Here’s a quick example: suppose you’re playing Poker and the guy to your left has been dealt a Royal Flush the last 5 hands. Being dealt 5 Royal Flushes in a row is likely on the hypothesis that he’s cheating and unlikely on the hypothesis that he’s not cheating. This fact therefore provides evidence that he’s cheating over not cheating. And btw, anybody actually in that situation would (without a doubt) suspect that he’s cheating.\n\n#2: See number three at this website: http://home.messiah.edu/~rcollins/Fine-tuning/FT.HTM\n\n#3: https://youtu.be/58brbYwN0Q0\n\n#4: (Same link as #3) https://youtu.be/58brbYwN0Q0\n\n#5: Universes by John Leslie: https://amzn.to/2E4PrWP\n\n\n----------------------------- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -----------------------------\n\n\nSpecial thanks to the following people for providing insightful feedback and helpful comments to earlier versions of the script: Tomas Bogardus, Josh Rasmussen, Josh Parikh, Luke Barnes, Justin Mooney, Braxton Hunter, Brett Lunn, and Dustin Crummett.\n\n\n------------------------------------------ GIVING ------------------------------------------\n\n\nPatreon (monthly giving): https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\n\nOne-time Donations: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\n\nSpecial thanks to all of my supporters for your continued support as I transition into full-time ministry with Capturing Christianity!

    "description": "This is the remastered and repaired audio from an exchange between Dr. Alvin Plantinga and Dr. Daniel Dennett. The audio was really bad in every iteration I found online, so I had my sound producer Sawyer Hudson doctor it up. The doctored version is still pretty bad but you can at least make out about 98% of what's said.\n\nFor a little background on this exchange, Dr. Plantinga was presenting a paper he wrote entitled, \"Science and Religion, Where the Conflict Really Lies.\" Dr. Dennett was tasked with commenting on the paper. That's it. He was tasked with responding to the content. But unfortunately Dennett went way off topic and kind of went on a rant against religious belief. Because of this, to lay audiences it ended up sounding like a debate (even though it wasn't).\n\nHere's an interesting written review of their \"debate\" from someone that attended the event: https://epistleofdude.wordpress.com/2018/08/05/plantinga-vs-dennett-debate-prosblogion-review/?fbclid=IwAR3uyCaqp90qTKQhDi8hkCQTRHXO1YEy2wuQ4PQtNRZ4kWCGaVEtR8woQI0\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLINKS\nWebsite: http://capturingchristianity.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity\nOne-time Donation: https://donorbox.org/capturing-christianity\nFree Christian Apologetics Resources: https://capturingchristianity.com/free-christian-apologetics-resources/\nThe Ultimate List of Apologetics Terms for Beginners (with explanations): https://capturingchristianity.com/ultimate-list-apologetics-terms-for-beginners/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOCIAL\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/capturingchristianity\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/capturingchrist\nSoundCloud: http://www.soundcloud.com/capturingchristianity\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGET IN TOUCH\nEmail: http://capturingchristianity.com/contact/\n\n#Plantinga #Dennett #Debate",

I mean if you wanna talk about guys coming back from the dead after being buried for 3 days, or Adam and Eve being the only two people, and they have kids, and their kids start having sex with each other, and that makes most of the people in the world, or Moses parting the Red Sea, or Jesus walking on water, I mean, you’re looking at [censored] everywhere.

    "description": "From the Big Bang to Homosexuality to the Problem of Evil, in this interview, Dr. Jerry Walls and I answer some of the hottest objections to Christianity. We couldn't cover everything, so we limited the objections to 5 of the most common we see and hear from culture. They aren't difficult; however, they are the kind of questions that ordinary church people need to really reflect on and think about. Here they are for reference:\n\n1. Evolution/Big Bang proves that Christianity is false. (6:30)\n2. People believe in God because of wish fulfillment. (12:50)\n3. The Bible seems like it was written by a bunch of uninformed peasants with no scientific knowledge at all. Why should we think that it’s reliable? (17:29)\n4. Christianity is against gay people. (22:05)\n5. Why do bad things happen to good people? (28:34)\n\nWebsite: http://capturingchristianity.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/capturingchristianity",

    "description": "More info: http://capturingchristianity.com/discussion-positive-case-annihilationism/\n\nThis discussion features two Christian guests on the question of the doctrine and nature of hell. Does the Bible teach that hell is eternal separation from God, as is traditionally believed, or is hell something else altogether? Chris Date, an annihilationist, runs a website called Rethinking Hell where he defends a \"conditional immortality\" perspective. Jason Crowder is a traditionalist, he believes that hell is eternal.\n\nWe are discussing a positive case for Chris' view. He argues firstly that the Bible teaches we are not inherently immortal, immortality is a gift from God. And then secondly that the doctrine of the atonement (Christ's atoning work on the cross) makes better sense from an annihilationist point of view.\n\nRethinking Hell: http://www.rethinkinghell.com\n\nChris' books: http://www.rethinkinghellbooks.com\n\nChris' plenary presentation at last year's Rethinking Hell Conference in London: https://youtu.be/ogEoPr4Hupc\n\nRecent discussion between Chris Date and Bobby Conway, the One-Minute Apologist: https://www.youtube.com/user/oneminuteapologist/videos\n\nThe Eastern Region ETS Meeting in Lancaster, PA on March 31-April 1, Chris will be presenting a paper: http://www.wordmp3.com/ets",

All participants affirm the view that moral facts exist and are real, the disagreement is found over the grounding of these moral facts (natural vs supernatural).\n\nThe theists contend that God is required to ground moral facts, while the atheists contend the opposite: a satisfactory account of moral ontology can be given purely from a naturalistic perspective.\n\nFor more information: http://capturingchristianity.com/discussion-conditional-premiss-moral-argument/",

The argument roughly states that the probability our cognitive faculties are reliable given Naturalism & Evolution is low. Hence, the person that believes N&E has a defeater for all of their beliefs, including belief in N&E. Belief in N&E is therefore self-referentially incoherent and cannot rationally be accepted.\n\nStephen Law - http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/\nTyler McNabb - Currently teaches at HBU, has published several articles defending Plantinga's work",
