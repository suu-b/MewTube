We're putting their prophetic declarations to the test as we're commanded to do in 1 Thessalonians 5:20–21.\n\nAs we examine their messages, we'll walk you through the practical theology of prophetic accountability, exploring what Scripture says about holding prophets to their words, and discussing why this matters so much for the health of the charismatic church.\n\nWhether you're charismatic, cessationist, or somewhere in between, this conversation on Christian discernment is crucial for anyone navigating prophetic ministry, spiritual gifts, and biblical prophecy in the modern church.

    "title": "Spellbound: The Story of Charisma in America (with Molly Worthen)",
    "description": "What happens when the power of the Holy Spirit collides with the chaos of American politics? Join Joshua Lewis as he sits down with historian Molly Worthen to explore her book Spellbound, which traces the fascinating and often controversial story of charisma—both spiritual and political—from Puritan prophets to modern-day leaders like Donald Trump.\n\nWe explore the tension between institutional authority and personal revelation that has defined American Christianity and culture for centuries. Discover how figures like Anne Hutchinson challenged Puritan ministers by claiming direct assurance from the Holy Spirit, how George Whitefield revolutionized preaching with theatrical emotion, and how Joseph Smith blended enlightenment rationalism with spiritual experience to birth Mormonism.\n\nProfessor Worthen, a historian at UNC Chapel Hill, reveals how charismatic leaders aren't always the charming orators we imagine—instead, they're polarizing storytellers who invite followers into transcendent narratives that give suffering and struggle cosmic significance. We explore the dangerous line between prophetic truth and spiritual manipulation, examining everyone from radical Quaker Benjamin Lay to Martin Luther King Jr., and asking the crucial question: how do we test the spirits in an age of radical individualism?\n\nWhether you're fascinated by church history, concerned about discernment in charismatic movements, or trying to understand the spiritual undercurrents shaping our political moment, this episode offers essential insights into how divine power—or the claim to it—has shaped the American experiment.\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n0:46 – Molly's background and ministry\n4:49 – Defining charisma\n20:11 – Anne Hutchinson & Puritan Massachusetts\n30:00 – Donna Beatrice & the Congo rebellion\n36:25 – George Fox & the Quaker movement\n44:01 – George Whitefield & emotional preaching\n50:28 – Charisma & American individualism\n54:05 – Joseph Smith & the Mormon church\n1:00:14 – Closing thoughts on charisma & discernment\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n📖BOOK https://a.co/d/e9yLtGC\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "description": "Did the prophets get it right? We're putting prophetic words to the test! Join us as we review the major prophecies spoken over 2025 by Emma Stark, Kay Nash, and Tomi Arayomi—examining what hit, what missed, and what we can learn from the process. As Scripture commands us to test all things and weigh prophetic words carefully, we're diving deep into biblical discernment and accountability in the prophetic movement.\n\nIn this end-of-year episode, the Remnant Radio crew breaks down prophetic declarations given at the start of 2025, comparing them against real-world events and spiritual markers we've witnessed throughout the year. We'll discuss the hits, the misses, and the \"jury's still out\" moments with honesty and biblical integrity. Our goal is to uphold the standard Scripture gives us for testing prophecy and holding modern prophets accountable to God's Word.\n\nWe'll explore critical questions every believer should ask: How do we properly test prophetic words according to 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21? What separates genuine prophetic insight from wishful thinking or cultural commentary? How should the body of Christ respond when prophecies don't come to pass? And what does biblical discernment look like in an age of viral prophetic declarations?\n\nWhether you're navigating the prophetic movement, curious about spiritual gifts, or simply want to grow in biblical discernment, this episode offers practical wisdom rooted in Scripture. We're committed to honoring authentic moves of the Holy Spirit while maintaining the accountability that protects God's people from deception. As we close out 2025, join us for an honest conversation about prophecy, discernment, and what it means to test everything and hold fast to what is good.\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n3:26 – Theology of prophecy and why we review national words\n8:20 – Tomi Arayomi’s prophecy\n28:34 – Kay Nash prophecy\n45:59 – Emma Stark / Sam Robertson prophecy\n57:30 – Closing thoughts\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "title": "Transform Your Faith: Why Lent Matters for Every Believer with Elyse Fitzpatrick",
    "description": "Ever feel like your church calendar skips straight from Christmas cheer to Easter celebration—missing something crucial in between? You're not alone, and Lent might be the answer.\n\nJoin Joshua Lewis and author Elyse Fitzpatrick to understand why Lent matters for every believer—not just the high church crowd. Elyse shares her transformative Ash Wednesday experience during the pandemic and why spending 40 days reflecting on Christ's suffering changed everything about her faith.\n\nThis isn't about earning brownie points with God through religious rituals. It's about understanding that before glory comes suffering—and why Western Christianity desperately needs to recover this truth. Elyse unpacks how fasting reveals our weakness so we can rest in Christ's strength, and why biblical lament looks nothing like hopeless despair.\n\nThis conversation challenges our therapeutic, comfort-obsessed culture. Discover why the church calendar isn't just liturgical tradition—it's discipleship that keeps Christ's life and work constantly before our eyes. Learn how to practice godly lament, embrace voluntary weakness, and find hope in the wilderness seasons of life.\n\nIn This Episode:\n-Why low-church Christians should care about Lent and the church calendar\n-The difference between fasting for merit versus fasting for remembrance\n-How to practice biblical lament with resurrection hope\n-Why American Christianity avoids suffering and what we lose because of it\n-The hidden grief of Palm Sunday and burned palm branch symbolism\n-Balancing community service with personal solitude during Lent\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n3:07 – What is Lent and Why Does it Matter?\n8:54 – The Experience of Ash Wednesday\n15:12 – Jesus in the Wilderness and Voluntary Weakness\n27:13 – Why \"Friend of Sinners\"?\n34:42 – Understanding Healthy Christian Lament\n42:34 – Palm Sunday Triumph and Weeping\n51:03 – Closing Thoughts\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n📖 BOOK: https://a.co/d/52RzKOh\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@theremnantradio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "description": "Can theological debates destroy Christian unity? In this raw, unfiltered conversation, we sit down with Jon Moffitt @THEOCAST and Doug Van Dorn (@reformedfringe) to discuss one of the more controversial splits in the Reformed world—and what it reveals about how we handle disagreement in the body of Christ. \n\nJon and Doug open up about their journey exploring the spiritual realm, the divine council, and the angel of the Lord—topics that sparked fierce opposition within their own theological circles. What began as thoughtful biblical exploration turned into accusations of heresy, demands for public repentance, and ultimately, painful separation from longtime friends and ministry partners.\n\nThis isn't just another theology debate. It's a sobering look at how pride, fear, and miscommunication can fracture Christian unity, even among believers who share the same core convictions. Jon and Doug discuss the Grace Reformed Network controversy, the role of Michael Heiser's work in Reformed circles, and why talking about angels and spiritual warfare became so divisive.\n\nWe dive deep into questions that matter: How should Christians handle theological disagreements? When does doctrinal clarity become doctrinal gatekeeping? And how do we fight for truth without destroying the very unity Christ prayed for ?\n\nWhether you're Reformed, charismatic, or somewhere in between, this conversation offers crucial lessons about humility, spiritual warfare, and the cost of standing for what you believe. The real enemy isn't the brother who disagrees with you—it's the one who wants to see the church divided.\n\nJoin Joshua Lewis, Michael Miller, Jon Moffitt, and Doug Van Dorn for a conversation about Christian theology, biblical interpretation, spiritual warfare, church unity, and what happens when good men disagree.\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n7:12 – The (Reformed) Fringe podcast\n12:43 – Heiser, the Divine Council, & pushback \n20:11 – Online debates, slander, & controversy\n31:05 – Strawmanning & accusations of heresy\n43:06 – Internal concerns & pressure to shut down Fringe\n50:04 – Email ultimatum\n56:02 – Board letters, Jon & Doug’s clarifying response\n1:02:24 – Doug’s theology of the Angel of the Lord\n1:13:35 – How GRN handled Doug’s old paper & calls for due process\n1:19:23 – Reflections on unity, charity, & spiritual warfare\n1:23:28 – Closing\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "title": "The Untold History Of Women In The Assemblies Of God: Interview With Dr. Joy Qualls",
    "description": "Joshua Lewis sits down with Dr. Joy Qualls—Pentecostal scholar, Assemblies of God minister, and author to explore the history, theology, and lived experience of women in Pentecostal leadership. From early Scandinavian pietist revivals and Azusa Street to modern Assemblies of God policy, they trace how Pentecostal theology of Holy Spirit empowerment collided with institutional respectability, evangelical politics, and unspoken “invisible fences” around women’s roles in church leadership.\n\nAlong the way, they unpack stories of forgotten Pentecostal heroines like Rachel Sislo, Amanda Benedict, May Eleanor Fry, and Blanch Elizabeth Britton—women who planted churches, prayed in revival, confronted injustice, and literally died on the road preaching the gospel. They also explore how AG policy has officially affirmed women in ministry since 1935, even while local practice has often lagged behind, creating dissonance for called women in Pentecostal churches.\n\nThis episode will challenge both complementarian and egalitarian assumptions. It raises hard questions about ecclesiology, spiritual gifts vs. church offices, spiritual warfare over calling, and how movements lose their prophetic edge when they chase institutional respectability.\n\nThis conversation provides historical context, theological categories, and pastoral wisdom for navigating the debate of women in ministry without capitulating to cultural pressure on either side.\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n2:27 – Book overview\n4:59 – The rhetoric versus reality for women in AG\n8:39 – Assemblies of God policy\n13:31 – National leadership changes\n16:54 – Growth in women’s credentialing and leadership\n17:00 – Women’s role before Azusa\n22:19 – Early female leaders \n36:46 – Institutionalization challenges\n43:03 – Pendulum swings\n51:47 – Influence of respectability and evangelical integration\n57:12 – Recent decades: education, policy, and hope for the future\n1:03:44 – Final thoughts\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n📖BOOK https://a.co/d/ioTgWmb\nDr. Qualls is Associate Professor of Communication Studies and Associate Dean in the Division of Communication at Biola University\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "title": "Fully God, Fully Man: Understanding the Hypostatic Union",
    "description": "Jesus Christ, the Messiah: fully God and fully man. But how did he live as a human submitted to the Father, perform miracles by the Holy Spirit, and choose not to exercise divine prerogatives at will? \n\nIn this episode, we unpack the Chalcedonian Definition of the Hypostatic Union, exploring its historical significance and how it protects against heresy. We explore how this doctrine affects our understanding of Jesus’s miracles, the Spirit-Empowered Ministry, and the ongoing debate surrounding kenotic heresy. Learn how Jesus, as both God and Man, performed miracles and lived a life of Spirit-Empowered Ministry.\n\nThe Chalcedonian definition of hypostatic union states that Jesus Christ is one person in whom two distinct natures—divine and human—are united without confusion, change, division, or separation. Each nature retains its own properties, and both are unified in one \"person\" or \"subsistence\" (\\(hypostasis\\)), meaning Christ is both fully God and fully man, not a mixture of the two. \n\nOne person, two natures: Christ is one person (the eternal Son of God), who is both fully divine and fully human.\n\nWithout confusion or change: The divine and human natures are not merged into a single new nature. The incarnation did not diminish Christ's divinity; it was not a change from what he was.\n\nWithout division or separation: The two natures are not split into two separate individuals or persons. They are held together in one unique person, the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nPropriety of each nature is preserved: The unique attributes of each nature remain. For example, Christ's divinity is not bloodied, but as a human, he has a body and soul.\n\nOne subsistence: The two natures \"concur\" in a single person and subsistence, a concept that safeguarded against heresies that separated the natures or blended them together.\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

We’re exploring how prayer is often misunderstood as a performance rather than an honest encounter with God.

    "description": "Are you missing God’s voice, or are you overthinking it? Discover the radical middle of Christian decision-making and discerning God's will.\n\nChristians often fall into two ditches, either ignoring God’s voice entirely or freezing up waiting for a divine memo on every little choice. Join us as we explore how to live in the “radical middle”—that sweet spot of leaning not on your own understanding (Proverbs 3:5-6) while trusting God in all things.\n\nWe’ll help you discern when you need a clear word from the Holy Spirit, and when it’s time to step out in faith with the wisdom God’s given. Whether you’re navigating career moves, relationships, or daily spiritual growth, this conversation equips you to discern God’s will without extremes.\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n3:53 – Personal Story\n6:39 – Life of Jesus: Led by the Spirit\n10:54 – Wedding at Cana and Divine Timing\n21:18 – Gethsemane Prayer and Surrender\n27:06 – Teachings of Jesus on Holy Spirit Guidance\n34:55 – Life of Apostles: Guidance in Acts\n49:38 – Teachings of Apostles: Will of God in Epistles\n56:39 – Best Practices for Discerning God's Will\n1:00:00 – Closing Thoughts\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

In this episode of The Remnant Radio, we sit down with constitutional attorney turned pastor Joe Infranco to unpack the controversial “Telepathy Tapes” podcast and its claims of paranormal communication among autistic individuals.​\n\nJoe Infranco, a veteran defender of religious freedoms who litigated landmark Supreme Court cases for churches and now serves as Associate Pastor at Highlands Church in Scottsdale, AZ, brings his courtroom rigor to these extraordinary stories. Drawing from his book Decoding Cody: Secrets of the Spectrum from People with Autism Who See, Hear, and Smell in the Unseen Realm, Joe examines how these children’s revelations align with Christian theology on the spiritual realm, discerning between demonic deception and genuine prophetic insight.

    "description": "Did Kim Clement, Charlie Shamp, and Mark Driscoll hear from God about the shocking events surrounding Charlie Kirk's assassination and the spiritual awakening that's followed? Tune into The Remnant Radio as we analyze these prophecies through the lens of Scripture.\n\nIn this episode, we're diving into some intriguing prophecies surrounding Charlie's Kirk's death, examining them in light of biblical prophecy and solid Christian theology. We'll look at Kim's 2011 word about an \"Esther\" figure with \"big, beautiful eyes\" who steps up to bring healing and restoration to a hurting nation—a description many are now connecting to Erika Kirk's powerful call for forgiveness after her husband's tragic death.\n\nThen there's Charlie Shamp's July 23, 2023, prophecy (shared at Prepare the Way International Church in Phoenix and later on social media), where he talks about a \"shot heard around the world\" in Arizona that doesn't shut down the church but instead ignites deeper intercession, groaning prayers from the saints, and a fresh outpouring of revival with God's glory coming down like a cloud.\n\nAnd we'll hear from Mark Driscoll on the spiritual warfare side, with his message pointing out the demonic forces that could be at work and how martyrdom like this might spark real repentance and shine a light on hidden corruption.\n\nAs always, we're approaching this with careful scriptural reflection—testing everything against God's Word. Tune in as we call balls and strikes on these prophetic words. Are they balls or strikes?\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n0:30 – Charismatic Beliefs and Personal Healing Testimonies\n2:59 – Biblical Framework for Testing Prophecy\n10:04 – Review of Mark Driscoll's Prophetic Vision\n23:36 – Review of Kim Clement's Prophecy\n36:25 – Review of Charlie Shamp's Prophecy\n52:17 – Summary of Tests for Prophetic Ministry\n53:51 – Closing Remarks and Final Encouragement\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n🛒 SHOP MERCH https://theremnantradio.myshopify.com/\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

But is that really what Joel 2 teaches? In this episode of Remnant Radio, we put the Joel 2 Army teaching under the microscope. We’ll trace its origins in the Latter Rain movement, how it spread through the Kansas City Prophets, and why it never appears in church history.

    "description": "What if everything you knew about “worship” in church wasn’t biblical? Dr. Tom Wadsworth’s research offers a challenging new perspective on early church gatherings. Listen, consider the evidence, then decide for yourself.\n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis and Michael Rowntree interview Dr. Tom Wadsworth to explore a controversial question: Is our modern understanding of “worship” truly biblical? \n\nDr. Wadsworth, a New Testament scholar, argues that what we call “worship services” today is drastically different from the gatherings of the first-century church. Instead of a primarily vertical act of offering praise to God, he proposes that early Christian assemblies focused on mutual edification – building up one another through teaching, encouragement, and the practical application of the “one anothering” commands found throughout the New Testament. \n\nDr. Wadsworth traces the history of our modern “worship” concept, exploring its roots in the second century and onward, highlighting the influence of Roman Catholic traditions and the evolving understanding of the Lord’s Supper. He also unpacks the crucial distinction between preaching (proclamation to outsiders) and teaching (discipleship within the community), and challenges the assumption that the early church was simply a new version of the Old Testament temple. \n\n0:00 Introduction\n7:26 Origin of Worship Language\n12:54 Exploring Vertical Lines of Worship in Scripture\n18:50 Are We Over-examining the Differences?\n26:38 Redefining Worship\n33:06 What Did a New Testament Church Look Like?\n37:02 A Matter of Purpose?\n44:16 Teaching\n50:44 Modern Discipleship Practices\n53:58 Closing Thoughts\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\nDr. Wadsworth is a New Testament scholar with a PhD from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.\n@tomwadsworth \n📖RESEARCH https://www.tomwadsworth.com/the-christian-assembly\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

We’re exploring the uncomfortable truth about powerful, yet morally compromised, figures in the Bible and the modern charismatic movement.\n\nIn this challenging episode of Remnant Radio, we tackle a provocative topic crucial for Christian discernment: “Gifted but Unsanctified.” We’ll take a hard, biblical look at figures like Samson and Balaam – individuals who clearly operated in supernatural power and spiritual gifts, yet were deeply flawed and morally compromised. What do their powerful stories tell us about the intersection of spiritual gifts and personal holiness?\n\nWe’ll draw crucial lessons for today’s church, especially concerning Christian leaders and individuals in the charismatic movement who may display prophetic gifts, healing gifts, or other gifts of the Spirit but lack in Christian character. Join us for a candid discussion on discerning true spiritual authority and the imperative of sanctification alongside divine gifting. This episode is vital for anyone interested in charismatic theology, spiritual maturity, and avoiding charismatic excesses.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n3:10 Saved Yet Compromised\n10:33 Spiritual Gifts Don’t Equal God’s Approval\n18:34 Unsaved Yet Gifted\n23:07 Matthew 7\n30:04 Spiritual Gifts Vs.

We’ll tackle the nuances of indwelling vs. empowerment, the significance of Pentecost, and the Old Testament prophecies that foretold the New Covenant outpouring of the Holy Spirit. \n\nWe'll examine:\n\n✅ The core debate: Is the Baptism of the Holy Spirit a subsequent or simultaneous experience with conversion? \n✅ The classical Pentecostal position and their key proof texts from Acts, including the role of tongues and spiritual gifts. \n✅ The prophetic connection between baptism with fire and God’s judgment or purification. \n✅ A crucial dive into 1 Corinthians 12:13, clarifying the Baptism of the Holy Spirit as a salvific event that unites all believers into Christ’s body. \n✅ The historical context of Acts 2 and Acts 8 (Jews & Samaritans) versus Acts 10 (Gentiles) and why it matters for our understanding today. \n✅ The significance of the Day of Pentecost and its powerful parallels with Old Testament events, inaugurating the New Covenant. \n✅The crucial question: Is this just a semantic debate, or does it profoundly impact church unity, the gifts of the Spirit, and how we view fellow believers?

We’re exploring the essential question of prophetic submission and healthy church culture.\n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, Josh Lewis, Michael Miller, and Michael Rowntree tackle a pressing question facing many charismatic churches today: Can prophetic people submit to local church leadership? Or more provocatively — what happens when prophets refuse to be pastored?\n\nToo often, prophets are seen as untouchable figures who “hear directly from God” and use that perceived authority to bypass or even challenge pastoral leadership. We examine this cultural phenomenon in light of Scripture, offering pastoral insight, biblical parameters, and real-life stories from their own churches and ministries.\n\nWe explore:\n* The dangers of prophetic elitism and spiritual manipulation\n* Biblical models of submission to elders and church order\n* When prophecy becomes a platform for rebellion\n* Historic abuses from movements like Montanism\n* The necessity of protocols, testing, and known character\n* How churches can cultivate a healthy prophetic culture without quenching the Spirit\n\nIf your church operates in the gifts of the Spirit — especially prophecy — this is a must-watch conversation.

We fully respect Alisa’s heart for handling the Bible carefully, and we’re bringing that same energy to this conversation about generational curses and deliverance ministry.\n\nWe’re going to unpack some of the big questions that came up. Like, do people who need deliverance actually ask for it? Is this whole deliverance thing a new idea, or is it biblical? Did Jesus always make people repent before casting out demons? We’ll also dig into some classic Bible verses that get brought up, like Exodus 20 and Ezekiel 18, and figure out if they’re describing something or commanding something. Plus, we’ll look at what Neil Anderson and Sam Storms have to say about generational curses, and we’ll even touch on that tricky question: can a Christian actually have a generational curse? \n\nOur goal here is to help you think through these often-debated topics in a way that’s solid and biblical. We want you to feel confident in your discernment and have a balanced understanding of generational curses and deliverance ministry, all rooted in the truth of God’s Word. Come hang out with us as we dive in!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n3:38 Thoughts on Generational Curses\n7:10 Clip 1: Deliverance Ministry as a Modern Fad\n19:35 Clip 2: Neil Anderson and Generational Sins\n1:05:46 Clip 3: Generational Sins and Demonization\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "description": "What is Second Blessing Theology, and is it biblical? Joshua Lewis unpacks the classical Pentecostal belief that Spirit baptism is a distinct, subsequent event after salvation—often evidenced by speaking in tongues. While Josh is a continuationist who speaks in tongues and values the gifts of the Spirit, he challenges key elements of Second Blessing Theology and the doctrine of initial physical evidence.\n\n📖 We’ll examine the strongest scriptural arguments used to support this view—Acts 2, Acts 8, and Acts 19—and test whether they truly teach a second experience of the Spirit after conversion. We’ll also explore the deeper meaning of Pentecost as the inauguration of the New Covenant, not just a charismatic encounter.\n\nWhether you’re a committed Pentecostal, a curious continuationist, or a cautious skeptic, this episode will help you think theologically, engage Scripture deeply, and pursue the Spirit without dividing the body of Christ.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:34 Defining Terms\n4:50 Acts 2 is the Inauguration of the New Covenant\n11:16 Responding to the Strongest Second Blessing Proof Text\n\nINTRO TO THEOLOGY COURSE:\n💥GET $50 OFF: https://www.theremnantradio.com/intro-to-christian-theology-special-offer \n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992\n\n#SecondBlessing #BaptismInTheSpirit #RemnantRadio #PentecostalTheology #Tongues #Acts19 #HolySpirit #Continuationism #Charismatic #ChurchUnity",

    "description": "What happens when a crime novelist steeped in atheism starts asking hard questions about good, evil, and the meaning of life? In this episode of Remnant Radio, @AndrewKlavan —bestselling author, Daily Wire host, and former atheist—reveals how reading some of the darkest literature in Western history unexpectedly paved his road to Christ. From Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment to the disturbing philosophies of the Marquis de Sade, Klavan shares how the reality of evil pointed him toward objective moral truth—and ultimately, the beauty of the Gospel. This is not your typical testimony; it’s a mind-bending journey through murder, meaning, and redemption.\n\nWe also unpack Klavan’s latest book, The Kingdom of Cain: Finding God in the Literature of Darkness, where he argues that some of the most haunting stories in art and culture can become unlikely tools of grace. Can Christians engage deeply with stories of depravity without compromising their faith? Is modern Christian art too safe to be spiritually transformative? And why is beauty, even when born from evil, such a powerful witness to truth? This episode is a bold invitation to think more deeply about art, suffering, and the soul. Don’t miss it.\n\nNOTE: This show addresses darker topics in literature and art. We would not recommend it for children.\n\n00:00 – Intro: Why Talk About Murder and Faith?\n03:42 – Finding God in the Literature of Darkness\n07:38 – The Philosopher Who Drove Klavan Away from Atheism\n11:24 – Can Evil Stories Lead to Salvation?\n15:30 – Why Shallow Christian Art Fails the Church\n19:18 – What Makes Dark Stories Spiritually Powerful\n23:02 – How Crime and Punishment Changed Klavan’s Soul\n28:15 – The Crisis of Evangelical Storytelling\n33:10 – Rules vs. Stories: Why Jesus Taught in Parables\n38:06 – Drawing the Line: When Art Becomes Corrupt\n44:20 – From Hollywood to Holiness: Klavan's Turning Point\n51:00 – Final Thoughts: Why Christians Must Engage the Darkness\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n@AndrewKlavan \n📖BOOK https://a.co/d/3CPfLVG\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "title": "Is Your Church Becoming a Cult? 4 Red Flags You Can't Ignore",
    "description": "Is your church drifting into dangerous territory? In this episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis exposes four major red flags that signal when a church culture is becoming toxic, manipulative, and cult-like. From authoritarian leadership and elitist indoctrination to behavioral control and fear-based intimidation, these warning signs aren’t just unhealthy—they’re unbiblical. Many believers find themselves in high-control church environments without realizing it, often because of powerful experiences, spiritual language, and the promise of revival. But when the fruit is fear, silence, and control, it’s time to take a closer look.\n\nThis video isn’t just for those sitting in the pews—it’s for pastors and church leaders too. Even if you’ve never endorsed these patterns from the pulpit, they can still spread within your community through unchecked leaders, small groups, or rogue ministries. As shepherds, we’re called to protect the flock, not to dominate it. Join us as we explore what real, Christlike leadership looks like—and how to discern whether your church is cultivating spiritual health or harboring spiritual abuse.\n\n00:00 – Introduction: When Good Churches Go Bad\n01:14 – Red Flag #1: Authoritarian Leadership\n7:58 – Red Flag #2: Indoctrination, Isolation, and Elitism\n11:54 – Red Flag #3: Behavioral Control Masquerading as Discipleship\n15:51 – Red Flag #4: Fear, Intimidation, and Spiritual Abuse\n20:16 – Final Thoughts: Real Leadership Looks Like Jesus\n\nINTRO TO THEOLOGY COURSE:\n💥GET $50 OFF: https://www.theremnantradio.com/intro-to-christian-theology-special-offer \n\nDOCTRINE OF GOD:\n💥ONLY $27: https://www.theremnantradio.com/doctrine-of-god\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "title": "Before Genesis: The Eternal Covenant That Shapes Everything",
    "description": "What if the Bible’s story didn’t start in Genesis, but in eternity past? Discover the eternal covenant between Father and Son that shapes all of Scripture and salvation history. \n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis sits down with Dr. Ryan McGraw, professor of systematic theology at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, to unpack the powerful doctrine of Covenant Theology. \n\nBut this isn’t just about ancient agreements—it’s about the eternal plan of salvation crafted before time began. Dr. McGraw lays out the “covenant of redemption,” the intra-Trinitarian agreement between the Father and the Son to redeem a people through the perfect obedience and atoning death of Christ. This covenant provides the foundation for everything that unfolds in redemptive history—from Adam’s failure under the covenant of works, to the unfolding covenant of grace that culminates in Christ and continues through the Church.\n\nTogether, they trace the storyline of Scripture from Genesis to Revelation, showing how the theme of covenant brings coherence and clarity to God’s dealings with His people. You’ll hear how the law reveals not just commands, but the very character of God; how the gospel is embedded even in the earliest pages of the Old Testament; and how the biblical distinction between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent runs throughout all redemptive history. Whether you’re new to covenant theology or looking to deepen your theological roots, this episode will help you see that the Bible is not a disjointed anthology—but a breathtaking, unified narrative of God’s eternal purpose in Christ.\n\n00:00 – Introduction & Show Overview\n01:20 – Dr. McGraw's Background in Ministry & Academia\n02:30 – Covenant Theology: A Blessing You Didn’t Know You Needed\n04:45 – What Is a Covenant?\n07:15 – God’s Character in the Law & the Gospel\n10:00 – Covenant of Works, Grace, and Redemption Explained\n14:30 – The Unity of Scripture in Covenant Theology\n18:10 – Typology and the Shadows of Christ\n22:45 – Seed of the Woman vs. Seed of the Serpent\n27:00 – Distinguishing Covenant Members: External vs. Internal\n30:00 – Christ’s Obedience and the Covenant of Works\n34:20 – Covenant of Redemption vs. Covenant of Grace\n39:00 – Old Covenant vs. New Covenant\n43:15 – Assurance in Covenant Theology\n47:40 – Discipleship and Covenant Application\n52:30 – Is Covenant Theology Just for Presbyterians?\n58:15 – Growing in Grace Through the Covenant\n1:02:15 – Sacraments & Covenant Theology\n1:08:45 – Final Reflections & Book Info\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n📖BOOK: https://a.co/d/3pURRRB\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "description": "Where do we stand on the Dr. Michael Brown investigation & reinstatement? Michael Miller shares a heartfelt response on Remnant Radio.\n\nIn this episode, we address one of the more painful and controversial topics we’ve covered: the recent investigation into Dr. Michael Brown and his reinstatement by Mercy Culture Church in Fort Worth, Texas, under the leadership of Pastor Landon Schott. As one of the most visible figures in the charismatic and evangelical world, Dr. Brown’s influence has shaped thousands—including us. But recent findings in the independent FireFly report have brought serious allegations of spiritual and emotional misconduct into the light.\n\nIn this short but direct video, Michael Miller offers a heartfelt and honest response to the scandal, the investigation, and especially the decision by Mercy Culture Church to restore Dr. Brown to ministry with what many have called stunning speed and minimal accountability. What do we do when a leader we’ve admired is credibly accused? What does true mercy look like? And what should disqualify a pastor from ministry?\n\nWe’ll also examine the public statements made by both Landon Schott and the Line of Fire board, asking whether these responses reflect biblical integrity or institutional self-preservation. This episode is for anyone wrestling with the tension between grace and truth, restoration and responsibility.\n\nIf you’ve ever listened to Michael Brown on Remnant Radio and wondered where we now stand, this is our answer.\n\n👉 For more context, watch our full-length interview with Ron Cantor, who was among the first to raise whistleblower concerns. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/YwoLTysfNrE?si=6xhXB082M4qBC8DG\n\n00:00 – Intro: Why We’re Speaking Out\n00:51 – What the FireFly Report Revealed\n02:13 – The Problem with the Church’s Response\n04:14 – Mercy or Manipulation?\n05:46 – Final Thoughts: What Real Faith Requires\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "description": "What happens when two theological giants who love Jesus have a FIERY public fallout? 🔥 The forgotten conflict between Puritans John Owen and Richard Baxter holds a sobering lesson for today.\n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, we sit down with Dr. Tim Cooper, a leading scholar on 17th-century Puritanism, to unpack the intense disagreement between Owen and Baxter—two titans of the post-Reformation era. Despite their shared love for Christ, Scripture, and the Gospel, their clash over salvation, church structure, and Christian ethics led to a public split that fractured the Puritan movement. Their story shows us how pride, personality, and past wounds can tragically impact even important theological debates.\n\nBut this isn’t just fascinating history! This episode is a direct challenge to today’s church. As theological disputes rage online and in person, the Owen–Baxter conflict raises urgent questions for us:\n\n-How should believers navigate public disagreement biblically?\n-When does contending for truth accidentally lead to unnecessary division?\n-What kind of Christ-like character must accompany our doctrine?\n\nIf you’ve ever wrestled with how to hold strong convictions while still loving others and avoiding toxic conflict, this conversation is for you. \n\n00:00 Introduction\n3:34 Who Were John Owen and Richard Baxter?  \n6:08 Key Theological Disagreements  \n9:02 Baxter’s Fears vs Owen’s Concerns  \n12:05 Modern Parallels: John Piper and Assurance  \n19:01 How Personal Experience Shapes Theology  \n27:01 The Role of Experience in Interpretation  \n30:55 The Legacy of Western Theological Questions  \n35:01 Could Owen and Baxter Have Reconciled?  \n47:03 Public Disagreement in the Church Today  \n53:04 Final Reflections on Disagreement and Unity  \n59:35 Closing Thoughts and Where to Find the Book  \n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n📖BOOK: https://a.co/d/9yrvp4C\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

    "description": "Can getting a tattoo open the door to demonic oppression? Some deliverance ministers claim tattoos are a guaranteed gateway to demonization—but is that actually biblical?\n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis explores whether tattoos are inherently sinful, whether they can invite spiritual oppression, and what Scripture truly says about “open doors” and “legal rights” in spiritual warfare. Along the way, we look at Ephesians 4, Leviticus 19, Isaiah 44, and insights from scholars like Dr. Clint Arnold and Dr. Gordon Wenham. We also survey ancient Near Eastern practices, church history (including tattooed Coptic Christians), and examine real-life testimonies of deliverance linked to tattoos.\n\n⚠️ This isn’t a clickbait scare tactic—it’s a serious theological conversation aimed at clarity, not controversy.\n\n🔍 Topics Covered:\n- Do tattoos violate God’s moral law?\n- Are tattoos a form of idolatry or pagan worship?\n- What does “giving the devil a foothold” actually mean?\n- What kind of tattoos might invite demonic activity?\n- Are all tattoos off-limits, or does intent matter?\n\nWhether you have tattoos, are considering one, or are just curious about the deliverance debate, this video is for you.\n\n0:00 – Intro: Can Tattoos Really Invite Demons?\n1:19 – How Demonization Works in Scripture\n2:59 – What Is a “Foothold”?

    "description": "In this deeply transparent and candid episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis, Michael Rowntree, and Michael Miller respond to critiques from Chris Rosebrough, Steven Kozar, and Justin Peters. The conversation covers a wide range of topics, including the importance of discernment in the charismatic movement, addressing past platforming decisions, and offering public apologies for former guests such as Mike Bickle, Todd White, and David Diga Hernandez. The hosts openly examine their own failures in exercising discernment, explain the process behind certain ministry decisions, and reflect on how they’re seeking to grow in theological integrity and accountability.\n\nThe team also explores broader issues in charismatic Christianity, such as abuse, false prophecy, doctrinal confusion, and celebrity culture within church leadership. They discuss how the Lord may be bringing judgment beginning with His house, and the call for charismatic leaders to get low in humility and repentance. While disagreement with cessationist critics remains, the episode seeks common ground where possible and issues a heartfelt call for reform in the charismatic world—without abandoning the pursuit of spiritual gifts.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:25 Addressing Criticisms\n1:22 Michael Miller’s Apology and Explanation\n3:50 Joshua Lewis Addresses Criticisms\n5:47 Michael Rowntree’s Perspective\n10:33 Change in Ministry\n14:08 Clarifying “Platforming Wolves”\n16:42 Robert Liardon\n18:35 David Diga Hernandez\n21:46 Mike Bickle\n28:11 Todd White\n50:07 John MacArthur\n1:01:52 Chris Reed\n1:03:47 Disagreement and Commonality\n1:08:00 Heidi Baker\n1:12:30 Closing Remarks\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992",

Is Brand simply a confused seeker? A new believer wrestling through discipleship? Or a genuine Christian brother in process?\n\nNOTE: We speed up clips for time's sake.

    "description": "What happens when your healing prayer is an unanswered prayer? Today we’re tackling the tension between charismatic faith for miracles and embracing biblical suffering. Join us for an honest conversation about Spirit-filled Christianity that survives life’s deepest trials.\n\nIn this episode, we examine a charismatic perspective on Christian suffering, challenging common misconceptions and overly simplistic interpretations that often lead to spiritual harm. While many believers rightly highlight God's promises for healing, provision, and victory, an unbalanced focus can result in guilt, exhaustion, and disillusionment. We address the dangers of assuming suffering can always be avoided through sufficient faith or perfect confession, emphasizing how this mindset inadvertently shifts trust from God’s faithful character to our own spiritual performance.\n\nFurther, we explore the profound theological tension between God's goodness and the existence of suffering, engaging common questions like \"Is my suffering punishment from God?\" and \"Does God notice my pain?\" Through biblical examples and scriptural insights, we propose a robust theology of suffering that affirms pain’s reality without declaring it inherently good. Ultimately, we encourage believers to maintain hope in God's active compassion and supernatural intervention, anchored in the promise of ultimate redemption and comfort.

    "description": "What happens when someone dies on the operating table and reports seeing details of their surgery they couldn’t possibly have known? How do we explain medically documented recoveries that physicians can’t understand? What about countless reports of modern encounters with Jesus that transform hardened skeptics?\n\nThese are the kinds of supernatural claims that Lee Strobel, former atheist and legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, set out to investigate. The same investigative journalist who wrote “The Case for Christ” has now turned his analytical mind toward the supernatural, examining evidence for miraculous healings, angelic encounters, and near-death experiences.\n\nJoin us as Lee Strobel shares what he discovered when he applied his journalistic rigor to the supernatural realm. From a former atheist who demands evidence, this conversation promises to challenge both skeptics and believers alike.\n\nABOUT THE GUEST:\n📖BOOK: https://a.co/d/24lhqd8\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/@TheRemnantRadio \n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER https://www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES https://www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/c/TheRemnantRadio\n• Make a Donation: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6&ssrt=1686780016992\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:36 Lee Strobel’s New Book: Seeing the Supernatural\n3:52 Distinguishing Between Real and False Supernatural Encounters\n8:08 Arguments Against a Merely Physical World\n11:06 Deathbed Visions\n14:02 Skepticism and Cross Cultural Accounts\n25:32 Documented Healings\n30:40 Visual Acuity\n38:59 Purpose Behind the Miracles\n41:05 Spiritual Experiences\n51:59 The Hiddenness of God\n52:06 What is God’s will in all this?\n1:01:10 Angelic Encounters\n1:21:01 Closing Thoughts",

    "description": "Are you struggling with how to engage modern culture as a Christian? Feeling like a biblical worldview makes you an outsider in today’s society? You’re not alone. As the gap between Christian values and secular culture grows wider, many believers are wrestling with how to maintain their faith without becoming bitter, fearful, or compromising.\n\nIn this episode, we’re joined by Keith Simon, pastor, author and co-host of Ten Minute Bible Talks and @Not_Just_Sunday, to explore biblical responses to cultural Christianity, cancel culture, and the growing hostility toward traditional Christian values. His new book “Joyful Outsiders” provides a gospel-centered approach to navigating contemporary issues while maintaining both biblical truth and Christian joy.\n\nWe’re exploring topics from Keith's book, including: • Biblical cultural engagement vs. culture war Christianity • How to respond to secular culture as a Christian • Practical ways to share your faith in a post-Christian world • Finding your role in God’s kingdom as a culture-shaper • Christian living in hostile environments • Gospel-centered responses to cultural issues • Biblical wisdom for modern cultural challenges\n\nKeith identifies six biblical models for cultural engagement: the artist, the protestor, the builder, the advisor, the ambassador, and the trainer. Through these Scripture-based examples, we’ll discover how to maintain biblical faithfulness while effectively engaging our post-Christian culture.\n\nWhether you’re dealing with workplace hostility to Christianity, navigating social media as a believer, or seeking biblical answers to cultural issues, this conversation will equip you with practical wisdom for being a faithful Christian witness in an increasingly secular world.\n\nJoin us as we explore how to be culture-changing Christians who maintain both biblical conviction and Christ-like compassion in today’s challenging cultural landscape.\n\nBook: https://a.co/d/6Lrv5XP\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n0:00 - Welcome and Introduction \n2:58 - Keith Simon Introduction  \n4:39 - Book “Joyful Outsiders” \n6:53 - Christianity’s Position in Modern Culture \n15:24 - “Winsomeness” Debate \n21:35 - Six Ways to Engage Culture \n30:15 - Ambassador Role Explained \n32:30 - Trainer Role  \n34:45 - Advisor Role  \n38:20 - Protester Role  \n42:15 - Builder Role \n46:51 - Addressing Church Division \n54:04 - Biblical Examples of Cultural Engagement \n59:27 - Closing Thoughts",

    "description": "How do you develop a friendship with God? Discover how prayer evolves from religious duty to intimate relationship as we explore the biblical foundation for knowing God personally.\n\nJoin us as we unpack the profound transition from servant to friend of God, examining Jesus’s revolutionary words in John 15. We'll explore prayer life, spiritual growth, and supernatural encounters that naturally flow from intimate relationship with God. Through scripture-based teaching, learn how the Holy Spirit reveals God’s plans and purposes within the context of divine friendship.\n\nWe'll tackle essential questions about Christian prayer, spiritual intimacy, and experiencing God’s presence. Using key passages from James 4:8, Philippians 4:6-7, and Ephesians 1:17, we explore how believers can develop deeper communion with God. Whether you’re new to prayer or seeking to revitalize your spiritual life, this teaching provides practical insights for growing in friendship with God.\n\nSpecial attention is given to understanding prayer beyond petition, exploring how the peace of God surpasses understanding and how spiritual gifts flow from relationship.

How can we discern when we’re approaching these pitfalls? And how do we guard our hearts and tongues against falling into them?\n\nIn this episode, we turn to Scripture—our ultimate authority—to guide us in navigating these challenging situations.

We'll also discuss the implications for contemporary Christians, including practical guidance for standing firm against spiritual forces of evil.\n\nAs both a New Testament scholar and Dean of Talbot School of Theology, Dr. Arnold bridges the gap between academic research and practical application, helping us understand how to engage in spiritual warfare with biblical wisdom and historical insight.

Join us as we welcome Dr. Jordan Cooper (@DrJordanBCooper) to discuss his new book “Prolegomena: A Defense of the Scholastic Method.” Dr. Cooper challenges a common belief that there’s a big gap between what the early reformers taught and how later scholars organized these teachings.\n\nWe’ll explore: • How Luther’s ideas connect with later Protestant thinking • Why organized, systematic theology matters for modern Christians • How early Protestant scholars built on Reformation foundations • What this means for the church today • Common myths about Protestant scholarly traditions\n\nSome say there’s a conflict between the heart of the Reformation and the careful, organized way later Protestants studied theology.

Drawing from core teachings of Sozo—such as identifying lies, closing “doors” to negative influences, and cultivating a deeper relationship with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—we explore whether these practices align with the Bible’s approach to healing and spiritual growth. Is Sozo a fresh method of “renewing the mind” as the Apostle Paul describes, or does it rely on extra-biblical concepts? We’ll examine the key Sozo techniques like the “Father Ladder” and “Four Doors,” assessing them alongside scriptural principles of confession, repentance, and forgiveness. \n\nJoin us for an in-depth conversation as we ask, \"Is Sozo a biblically sound path to freedom, or does it stray from the teachings of Scripture?\" Whether you’re a skeptic or a supporter, this episode will benefit  you as we dig deep into the scriptural basis of Sozo’s approach to healing and sanctification.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n0:00 - Intro and welcome  \n3:04 - Introduction to Sozo ministry \n6:50 - Discussion of inner healing and deliverance ministry \n13:41 - Structure of a Sozo session \n17:19 - The Four Doors tool \n21:41 - Discussion of visualization and meditation \n29:03 - Biblical basis for renewing the mind \n34:23 - Positive aspects of Sozo ministry \n36:19 - Negative aspects of Sozo ministry\n42:55 - Concerns about Sozo's view of the Trinity \n47:35 - Discussion of Four Doors limitations \n51:24 - Inner healing vs deliverance ministry \n56:03 - Concerns for discerning how people view God \n1:04:00 - Closing remarks",

    "description": "In a culture that often equates emotional intensity with spiritual depth, how can we discern genuine faith and worship from mere emotional hype? This episode titled \"The Dangers of Emotionalism in Christianity\" we dives into the critical difference between emotions—the natural, God-given responses to life—and emotionalism, a worldview that places feelings above truth, sometimes to the detriment of our spiritual lives. We’ll discuss why emotions alone can’t be the foundation for spiritual truth, looking at common misconceptions like confusing a pastor’s passion with anointing or mistaking emotional peace as confirmation of answered prayer.\n\nDrawing insights from theological giants like Jonathan Edwards and exploring biblical counsel on sobriety and self-control, we’ll explore why emotions must be balanced by a sound mind and grounded in Scripture. We also touch on how music shapes our beliefs and how a focus on emotional intensity in worship can impact our understanding of God.\n\nJoin us for a thought-provoking conversation that aims to reclaim a balanced view of emotions in faith and worship, encouraging you to embrace both mind and heart in your walk with God.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n0:00 - Intro and welcome \n3:42 - Introduction to emotions vs emotionalism  \n7:42 - Personal background with emotionalism in church \n13:41 - Defining emotions vs emotionalism \n21:41 - Music and emotions in worship \n29:03 - Early church fathers’ views on music and emotion \n34:23 - Biblical commands for emotional expression in worship \n40:21 - Jonathan Edwards on religious affections \n44:03 - Difference between emotions and affections \n47:41 - Righteous anger and justice \n53:04 - Final thoughts on defining emotionalism \n55:00 - Closing remarks",

    "title": "The REAL History of Nicaea You Never Knew",
    "description": "In an era of doctrinal confusion and church scandals, many believers are questioning the very foundation of Christian faith. Can the Nicene Creed offer clarity and stability?\n\nIn this episode, we dive deep into the history and significance of the Nicene Creed, established at the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D., which has served as a cornerstone of Christian belief for centuries. We’ll unpack its core affirmations about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, exploring how it provides a resilient framework for faith amid modern challenges.\n\nBut why was the Council of Nicaea so pivotal? Is there biblical support for such councils, or do they risk adding human error to Scripture’s sufficiency? Together, we’ll examine biblical precedents, such as the early church gatherings in Acts 11 and 15, and look at how councils like Nicaea sought to safeguard Christian doctrine and address critical issues facing the church.\n\nFrom Constantine’s political influence to Arius's divisive teachings, we’ll trace how the debates and decisions of the Nicene bishops shaped the bedrock of Christian orthodoxy. Join us as we explore the timeless relevance of the Nicene Creed, discovering how it can strengthen and steady us through personal and collective crises of faith.\n\n✨Episode Sponsored by Logos Bible Software - The all new Logos is now easier to use and more accessible than ever with monthly plans starting at $9.99.

Could these creatures be the result of pre-flood genetic experiments? Were they spawned from divine-human mingling gone wrong? Or are they clever political metaphors from the prophets?

    "description": "Join us for an exciting conversation with renowned Christian theologian Dr. William Lane Craig, @ReasonableFaithOrg, as we explore his foundational book, Apologetics: An Introduction. Originally published in 1984, this work remains deeply relevant for Christians today. In a world filled with philosophies that challenge the Christian faith, Craig offers a clear, rational defense of two central pillars: the existence of God and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. We’ll dive into how these themes equip believers to stand firm in their faith and respond thoughtfully to critics. \n\nDr. William Lane Craig is known for his work in Christian apologetics, philosophy of religion, and his defense of the Kalam Cosmological Argument. He is a professor of philosophy and a leading voice in debates on the existence of God, the resurrection of Jesus, and philosophical atheism. His expertise and contributions make his book Apologetics: An Introduction especially valuable, as it provides historical context and philosophical rigor in defending Christianity, which remains crucial for believers today.

From questions about our identity and relationships in Heaven to what God is like and what we'll do for eternity, this conversation explores it all.\n\nBurke has spent decades researching the accounts of people from all walks of life—doctors, professors, and even the blind—who’ve had life-altering NDEs, including both heavenly and hellish experiences.

From the moral failures of once-trusted Christian leaders like Mike Bickle, Robert Morris, Ravi Zacharias, Jerry Falwell Jr., and Mark Driscoll, to the widespread misconduct uncovered within organizations such as Hillsong Church and the Southern Baptist Convention, the Christian community has faced a barrage of betrayals. These scandals cut deep, leaving behind a trail of hurt and a growing sense of apathy and distrust.\n\nAs Christians, we understand that leaders are human, fallible, and susceptible to sin. Yet, the repeated revelations of moral failures among those who should know better have left many struggling with a profound sense of betrayal. How do we cope with the emotional toll of these scandals? How can we overcome the fatigue that threatens to erode our faith and commitment?\n\nJoin us as we explore these questions, looking to Jesus—who Himself was betrayed by a trusted friend—for guidance. We'll discuss how to heal from church hurt, regain our focus on Christ, and continue being a light in a world overshadowed by the failures of those we once admired.

    "title": "Heiser Under Review: Exploring Doreen Virtue's Criticisms of Dr. Michael Heiser's Work",
    "description": "The late Dr. Michael Heiser was known for his groundbreaking perspectives on the supernatural realm, including the divine council, the Tower of Babel, Genesis 1:26, Psalm 82, the Book of Enoch, Nephilim, Theosis, demonology, and angelology. As the author of influential works like The Unseen Realm and Reversing Hermon, Heiser helped shape contemporary understanding of these complex topics.\n\nRecently, Doreen Virtue, alongside Hebrew scholar Dr. Wave Nunnally, Systematic Theology Professor Dr. Jordan Cooper, Pastor Gary Gilley, Pastor Samuel Farag, Marcia Montenegro, and Don Veinot, has raised concerns about some of Heiser's interpretations. You can watch their review of Dr. Heiser here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6ih2uBh0Is\n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, we'll dive deep into their critiques and explore whether these concerns hold weight. What are the implications for those who follow Heiser's teachings? Join us as we critically examine these viewpoints and discuss what this means for our understanding of the supernatural in Scripture.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

How does Balaam's story illustrate the clash between divine and demonic powers?\n\n-Simon the Sorcerer: Analyzing Acts 8, where Simon, a magician who astonished people with his sorcery, seeks to buy the Holy Spirit's power from the apostles. What can we learn from his misguided pursuit of spiritual power?\n\n-The Python Spirit in Acts 16: Discussing the account of the slave girl possessed by a spirit of divination and how Paul confronts this demonic presence. What does this encounter teach us about the real power and influence of demonic forces?\n\nThrough these biblical narratives, we'll highlight the reality of the supernatural realm and acknowledge that negative forces are indeed real and potent. We'll also explore the implications for Christians today, offering insights on how to recognize and respond to these spiritual threats.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Join us on the next episode of The Remnant Radio as we critically examine C. Peter Wagner's controversial teaching on \"Strategic Spiritual Warfare.\" Wagner claims that God has provided the church with a new \"Rhema module\" essential for these last days. But is it truly biblical? Wagner, a prominent figure in the New Apostolic Reformation, has been a leading advocate for this approach to spiritual warfare.

We'll delve into biblical texts and contexts to discern whether strategic spiritual warfare holds up under theological scrutiny.\n\n-Historical and Theological Perspectives: Comparing Wagner's teachings with traditional Christian doctrines and the historical understanding of spiritual warfare.\n\n-Practical Implications: What are the potential benefits and dangers of adopting Wagner's approach? How should Christians engage in spiritual warfare in a way that is grounded in biblical truth?\n\nWe'll also address questions such as:\n    -Does the Bible support the idea of engaging with territorial spirits?\n    - How did Jesus and the apostles approach spiritual warfare?\n    -What role should prayer and intercession play in our battle against spiritual forces of darkness?\n    - Is prayer walking, spiritual mapping, and \"binding the strong man\" the new \"Rhema module\" of spiritual warfare? \n \nTune in as we offer a balanced and thorough review of strategic spiritual warfare, helping you navigate this complex and often controversial topic.\n\n\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "The July 13 assassination attempt on former President Trump's life made headlines across the world. Did God forewarn of this event with a prophetic message? We'll take a closer look at a YouTube video from March 14 this year, where Brandon Biggs gave a prophecy that many believe foreshadowed this shocking event. We'll analyze Brandon's prophecy and discuss whether he hit the mark, exploring the implications for believers and the broader Christian community.\n\nIn this episode, we critically examine a prophecy by Brandon Biggs, who claimed an attempt on President Trump's life would be made. According to Biggs, the attempt would fail, but Trump would be struck near the ear, fall to his knees, and experience a profound spiritual awakening. This prophecy, given months before the incident, has sparked significant debate about Biggs' legitimacy as a prophet.\n\nWe discuss the importance of testing prophets and prophecies. As charismatics, we believe in the gift of prophecy but emphasize the biblical mandate to \"test everything; hold fast what is good\" (1 Thessalonians 5:21). We analyze Biggs' character, doctrine, and track record, scrutinizing his predictions in light of Scripture. Our goal is not to dismiss prophecy but to ensure it aligns with biblical truth and edifies the Church.\n\nIn this episode, we explore why rigorous testing of prophetic words is crucial. We reference key scriptures like Deuteronomy 13:1-5 and Matthew 7:15-23, which warn about false prophets who may deliver accurate predictions but lead people astray through false doctrines and unbiblical practices. We also emphasize the need to evaluate prophets based on their fruit, doctrine, and track record, as outlined in Matthew 7:15-20 and Deuteronomy 18:20-22.\n\nJoin us as we navigate the complex landscape of modern prophecy, seeking to uphold the integrity of the charismatic movement while guarding against deception. Whether you're a charismatic, cessationist, or somewhere in between, The Remnant Radio is committed to providing thoughtful, balanced, and biblically grounded discussions on the gifts of the Spirit and contemporary Christian issues.\n\nThe Remnant Radio is hosted by Joshua Lewis, pastor of King's Fellowship Church in Ada, Oklahoma, along with his co-hosts Michael Miller, pastor of Reclamation Church Denver, and Michael Rowntree, leader of Convergence OKC. Together, they explore the dynamic and often controversial world of charismatic Christianity.\n\nYou can watch a clip of Brandon Bigg's prophetic message here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCGfE9yMnXc\n\nFor the original video, forward to minute 11:00 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey0qVzG8_vU&t=660s\n\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:04:00 Why We Test Prophecy\n00:07:00 Why We Test Prophets\n00:09:00 Testing the Fruit of a Prophet\n00:14:00 Examples of False Prophets\n00:16:00 Testing Doctrine\n00:18:00 Testing Track Record\n00:27:00 Reviewing Brandon Biggs' Recent Word About Trump\n00:32:00 The Trump Prophecy\n00:34:00 Evaluating the Accuracy of the Trump Prophecy\n00:39:00 Who is Brandon Biggs?\n00:41:00 Brandon Biggs' Theology and Teachings\n00:47:00 Brandon Biggs' Track Record\n00:57:06 Big End Times Prophecy\n01:09:56 Fat Angel experience\n01:17:48 Josh Explains Brandons Belief About Healing\n01:21:00 Medior and Earthquake Prophecy\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

What is their ancestry, and why does it matter?\n-The resurgence of interest among Bible-believing scholars: Why is the ancient view of the Nephilim making a comeback, and what does it mean for our understanding of Scripture?\n-The invisible, supernatural storyline: How does understanding the giants and the Nephilim change our perspective on the ministry and work of Jesus Christ?\n\nDouglas Van Dorn (M.Div.

    "description": "Worship and praise are fundamental aspects of the Christian faith, but can worship and praise also serve as powerful weapons in spiritual battles? Join us as we explore the biblical foundations and theological perspectives on the role of praise and worship in spiritual warfare. \n\nWe'll examine key scriptural passages, such as 2 Chronicles 20:21-22, where King Jehoshaphat appointed singers to lead his army into battle, and Acts 16:25-26, where Paul and Silas's hymns in prison led to a miraculous earthquake and their subsequent release. These stories suggest that praise can indeed shift the spiritual atmosphere and bring about divine intervention.\n\nWe'll also discuss practical ways believers can incorporate praise into their daily spiritual practices to combat spiritual oppression and foster a deeper connection with God. Our conversation will address questions like: How does praise impact the spiritual realm? Can worship dismantle strongholds and bring about deliverance? What are the implications of viewing praise as a strategic element in spiritual warfare?\n\nTune in to uncover the spiritual power of praise and its potential to transform battles into victories through worship.

Wright, \"Jesus and the Powers: Christian Political Witness in an Age of Totalitarian Terror and Dysfunctional Democracies.\"\n\nIn their book, Wright and Bird explore the critical question of how Christians should engage with politics. Should we withdraw to maintain our prophetic voice, or should we actively participate to influence political systems? They call on Christians to discern their witness in today's fractured political environment, amidst the rise of autocracies, fear, and fragmentation.\n\nCombining political theology, biblical insights, and church history, \"Jesus and the Powers\" argues for a kingdom-oriented approach to politics. Wright and Bird emphasize confronting empire in all its forms and promoting democratic societies while opposing autocracy and nationalism. They delve into the relevance of this approach to current events, including the Russian-Ukraine conflict, China-Taiwan tensions, and political turmoil in the USA, UK, and Australia.\n\nTune in to learn how Christians can navigate and engage with politics in a way that aligns with Jesus's kingdom and contributes to the common good.\n\nMichael F.

    "description": "Is the Apostle Paul a \"covenant\" or an \"apocalyptic\" theologian? We sit down with Dr. Constantine Campbell to discuss Pauline eschatology in Campbell's latest book \"Paul and the Hope of Glory.\"\n\nWe'll explore the significance of eschatology (end times) in Pauline theology. Campbell asserts that while union with Christ serves as the webbing that connects the Apostle Paul's thought, eschatology shapes the contours of his teaching on justification, resurrection, ethics, and more. Campbell will share how Paul thought about the end times, unpacking phrases like \"the last day,\" \"inheritance,\" and \"hope,\" and showing us how they fit into the bigger picture of what Paul believed.\n\nWhy does Paul's perspective on the future matter for us today? Campbell will discuss how Pauline theology shapes our beliefs about salvation, resurrection, and how we live our lives right now. Tune in and equip yourself with a deeper understanding of Paul's eschatological vision and its implications for our hope of glory.\n\nBook - Paul and the Hope of Glory: https://a.co/d/aFI1Gr9\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

We're exploring the cult-like tactics and practices that some churches in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) use to maintain control and power.\n\nThe New Apostolic Reformation is a movement within certain charismatic Christian groups that emphasizes modern-day apostles and prophets. While it aims to bring revival and transformation, there are significant concerns about its methods and impact. In this episode, we'll explore some of the cult-like tendencies associated with the NAR, such as shunning members who leave the church and enforcing strict honor culture to control speech and maintain leadership power.\n\nWe'll discuss how these practices can create an environment where leaders remain in control and laypeople are kept ignorant and subservient. From manipulating followers through spiritual abuse to controlling narratives within the church, we'll uncover the strategies used to keep people in line.\n\nJoin us as we unpack these critical issues and shed light on the darker side of the New Apostolic Reformation. We'll examine the biblical perspective on these practices and offer insights on how to recognize and respond to cult-like behavior in any church setting.\n\nFor more episodes on the NAR, you can watch our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMsjeViSScFHJkZd7Oivj-CyblQ1xp5fK\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

We're exploring the chilling topics of haunted houses, desecrated spaces, and cursed regions.\n\nWe'll uncover the dark realities of Satanic practices and the spiritual impact they can have on places, geography, and entire regions. What does the Bible say about principalities and powers ruling over certain areas? Can a house, church or building be cursed because of past sexual immorality or witchcraft previously practiced in the location? What about entire regions plagued by specific sins, like a history of slavery or abortions? We're going to tackle these tough questions head-on.\n\nThe Bible has a lot to say about defiled land and buildings. Deuteronomy 18:9-12 warns against detestable practices that can defile the land, and Ephesians 6:12 speaks about our struggle against spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. We'll examine these scriptures and more to understand if and how physical locations can be tainted by immoral or Satanic activities.\n\nAnd here's the big question: Can a physical location be redeemed?

    "title": "Clergy Loyal to the Crown? Interview with Dr. Gregg Frazer",
    "description": "We're exploring a side of the American Revolution that often gets overlooked. In this episode, we sit down with Dr. Gregg Frazer to discuss his book God against the Revolution: The Loyalist Clergy's Case against the American Revolution.\n\nRomans 13:1 says, \"Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.\" This biblical principle of obeying authority is at the heart of Frazer's book. \n\nFrazer’s work offers the first comprehensive account of the political thought of the American Loyalists – the roughly one-third of the population who opposed independence. While we know much about the Patriots, what about those who loved their land but didn't support breaking away from Britain? Frazer digs into the biblical, philosophical, and legal arguments made by Loyalist ministers in their writings, pamphlets, and sermons. These clergymen were far from being mere apologists for British rule; they criticized its excesses while arguing for adherence to English law and authority.\n\nIn our interview, we'll explore how these Loyalist ministers' perspectives provide an interesting counterpoint to the Patriots' fight for liberty, equality, and representation. Frazer raises challenging questions about the rationality and legitimacy of the Patriots' actions and their impacts on freedom of religion, expression, and due process. \n\nSo how should we examine the Bible's command to submit to authority? This discussion is not only an interesting addition to our understanding of American political thought but also a timely reflection on the political dynamics of our own era.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this nuanced and often forgotten perspective on the American Revolution. \n\n***\nGregg L. Frazer is Dean, John P. Stead School of Humanities, and Professor of History & Political Studies at The Master’s University in Santa Clarita, California. He’s the author of The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, and Revolution (University Press of Kansas).

He explains how ancient cultures relied on diviners to interpret signs from nature, while court prophets served kings with their insights. In contrast, the Israelites transitioned from these practices as Yahweh’s prophets rose to prominence, delivering divine messages directly from God. Meanwhile, priests took on roles that involved interpreting God’s will through sacred objects such as the Urim and thummim, effectively replacing the diviners of surrounding nations.\n\nOur conversation examines the complexities of distinguishing true prophecy from false, the role of court prophets, and the fascinating interplay between prophetic and wisdom literature. Dr. Witherington also shares his perspective on how the Holy Spirit operates differently in the New Covenant era, emphasizing the importance of discernment in contemporary prophetic practice.\n\nDon't miss this thought-provoking discussion that not only enriches our understanding of biblical prophecy but also points us back to the central figure of our faith—Jesus Christ.

But here's the twist: When is the right time to introduce children to the gifts of the Spirit? Should we start them young, or is it better to wait until they're older and more mature?\n\nWe'll be exploring this question and more as we delve into why it's important to empower children to walk in their God-given gifts from an early age.

He'll shed light on how these commands to \"be holy\" and \"be perfect\" aren't just burdensome rules, but pathways to blessing.\n\nDr. Matt Ayars is the former President of Wesley Biblical Seminary and Assistant Professor of Old Testament.

    "description": "How do you hear God? Join us for a second interview with Rev Dr. Tania Harris, the founder of God Conversations and author of the book The Church That Hears God's Voice. With a passion for understanding how God speaks and the impact it has on the church, Dr. Harris embarked on a profound journey. Her exploration delves into questions that have intrigued theologians and Christians for centuries: Does God still speak to us today? How does God speak? How do we hear God's voice? And what significance does it hold for the church?\n\nDrawing from her extensive research and experiences, she offers a comprehensive theology and pastoral strategy to help all sectors of the Church connect with the Spirit's voice.\n\nHere is our 1st interview with her: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3KY3uXFrCg\n\nTania's Books: https://www.godconversations.com/product-category/books/\n\n#remnantradio #giftsofthespirit #godspeaks #holyspirit  \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "There's a rising trend of \"Christian yoga\" practiced by believers and even offered in churches. Christians are embracing Christian yoga workouts and Christian yoga music. But can we truly divorce the spiritual from the physical? Are we inadvertently embracing pagan practices by participating in yoga? Or can we transform the practices into a form of worship to Christ?\n\nOn Wednesday, we'll delve into the spiritual implications of yoga and Christian yoga flow - and whether renaming it to \"Christian yoga\" changes its essence.

In a world flooded with spiritualities promising personal transformation, Root sheds light on the differences between these mysticisms and authentic Christian transformation. We'll explore the dangers of following or adapting these reigning mysticisms and learn why the self has become so important yet so burdened with guilt--and how we should think about both. Root will present a better way--even a mysticism--centered on the theology of the cross that pastors and leaders can use to form their own imaginations and practices. \n\nFor secular mysticism explained and how a Christian should approach mysticism, tune in to this episode of The Remnant Radio!\n\nAndrew Root (PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary) is the Olson Baalson Professor of Youth and Family Ministry at at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, MN. \n\nBuy Book: https://a.co/d/bLH0EYJ\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #mysticism #christianmysticism",

    "description": "Ever heard of Ayahuasca? Ayahusaca is a sacred plant medicine used in ceremonies by indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest. And there are some crazy stories out there from people reporting spiritual experiences after taking Ayahuasca. You can find numerous testimonies of atheists and drug addicts experiencing God and coming to Christ after this experience - descriptions of another dimension that is 'more real than reality'. In recent years, Ayahuasca has gained popularity in Western cultures, leading to the rise of Ayahuasca tourism and retreats - and even churches promoting its spiritual benefits. But is this something Christians should be experiencing? If the substance is bringing people to Christ, should churches be exploring it? Or is this something we should mark and stay away?\n\nJoin us as we discuss the moral and biblical implications of Ayahuasca.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #ayahuascaceremony #ayahuascaretreat #ayahuascahealing\n\nhttps://sama.ac/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-teed-b5686342/",

    "description": "Did Jesus go to Hell? Did Jesus go to Sheol? The doctrine of Christ’s “descent” is confessed in the Apostles’s and Athanasian Creeds and celebrated by Eastern and Roman Catholic churches, but evangelical churches rarely give it much attention. Even where the Apostles’s Creed is recited many evangelicals leave out the clause, “he descended into hell/the dead.” So just what is the doctrine of Jesus descending to the dead? Did Jesus go to hell for 3 days?\n\nIn this episode, we'll interview Matt Emerson and discuss his book \"He Descended to the Dead\": An Evangelical Theology of Holy Saturday, winner of a 2019 TGC book award. From biblical foundations to historical context and pastoral implications, we'll discuss it all with Matt.\n\nBook: https://a.co/d/4UfqbYj\n\nMatt Emerson (Ph.D., Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary ) serves as Co-Provost and Dean of Theology, Arts, & Humanities at Oklahoma Baptist University. He also serves on the Board of Directors for the Center for Baptist Renewal.

    "description": "In this episode, we'll meet with theologian Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen and discuss his book \"An Introduction to Ecclesiology.\" \n\nWe'll chat with Kärkkäinen about the theological questions he poses about ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church). What is the church, and why are there so many diverse expressions of it? What are the major traditions and why do we have different traditions if we have one universal church? Kärkkäinen will share his thoughts about the major traditions, global perspectives, and key elements of the church's mission, governance, worship, and more.\n\nVeli-Matti Kärkkäinen (Dr.Theol.Habil., University of Helsinki) is professor of systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, and docent of ecumenics at the University of Helsinki. He is ordained by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and is also an expert on Pentecostal/charismatic movements. He has served as visiting professor in various schools around the world and has participated in numerous international theological, missiological, and interfaith consultations. His many books include The Trinity: Global Perspectives, An Introduction to the Theology of Religions, and the five-volume series A Constructive Christian Theology for the Pluralistic World.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #theology #theologydiscussion #theologypodcast",

    "description": "Join us as we examine the meaning behind Amos 9:11-12 particularly in relation to the restoration of the tabernacle of David and its connection to worship and intercession. What is the booth or tent of David? What does it mean to “possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations” called by the name of Yahweh? Do these verses imply the need for 24/7 prayer and worship to usher in the second coming of the Lord? Or, is that an over-literal interpretation of the text? We'll explore various theological interpretations and discuss how these verses should inform our understanding and application of Scripture.\n\n“In that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen and repair its breaches, and raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old, that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name,” declares the Lord who does this.

    "description": "Join us for an interview with Ken Fish (@KenFishEnglish) as we delve into the realms of Freemasonry. In Remnant Radio's most-watched video with more than half a million views, we exposed aspects of this secretive organization. We discussed the demonic oppression that Ken often encounters when ministering to freemasons or descendants of freemasons. We also discussed demonic curses, generational curses, and how to walk in biblical freedom from these cult practices. \n\nCatch the first episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePVAbKZWra8\n\nIn this show, we welcome Ken Fish back for further discussion. We'll unravel lesser-known forms of Freemasonry, examine the existence of founder spirits and master spirits—rarely discussed topics, as well as review the often-overlooked issue of sexual abuse, embedded within the rituals of higher-level masonic lodges.\n\n👉33 Degrees of Deception: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/33-Degrees-Deception-Expose-Freemasonry/dp/0882704389/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=580629504906&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9026716&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14557254102786690427&hvtargid=kwd-310963245589&hydadcr=8263_13500814&keywords=33+degrees+of+deception&qid=1706647790&sr=8-1\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #freemasons #freemasonry #deliveranceministry #deliverance #masonictemple #masoniclodge #masonic #secretsocieties\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

To evaluate his assertion, he conducted the King James Bible Study Project, a national phone survey of 100 pastors who preach and teach King James Bible only that ran from November 2022 through April 2023. \n\nWe'll talk with Mark and hear the results of his study project.\n\n#remnantradio #kingjames #kingjamesversion #kingjamesbibleonly #kingjamesbible #kjv #theology \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Debate the true nature of Hermas's experiences – were they genuine prophetic visions or satirical allegories?\n\nEarly Church Perspectives: Learn how early Church Fathers like Irenaeus, Clement, and Tertullian viewed this text, from its edifying qualities to its scriptural authority.\n\nScriptural Connections: Discover the intriguing ways the Shepherd of Hermas interweaves Biblical themes without direct quotations.\n\nChristian or Jewish Identity: Investigate the Christological aspects within the text and its alignment with early Christian beliefs.\n\nHermas's Spiritual Journey: Follow Hermas's evolution from a struggling believer to a mature Christian through the narrative's structure of Visions, Mandates, and Similitudes.\n\nVisionary Imagery & Symbolism: Delve into the vivid depictions of spiritual realms and their implications for understanding early Christian eschatology and ethics.\n\nDr. Svigel's comprehensive analysis illuminates the Shepherd of Hermas's role in early Christian thought, its distinctive literary style, and its enduring relevance in understanding the development of Christian doctrine and practice. Don't miss this engaging episode that brings new depth to our understanding of early Christian literature and its impact on the church's formation.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "We interviewed Ken Johnson with BibleFacts.org (@biblefactsorg). Talmud teaches that the ancient patriarchs were all prophets, and that each one of them left testaments for their descendants to read. These contain commands for their children, moral lessons, and prophecy. This legend is not only repeated among the Essene community, but fragments of twenty such records have been found in the Dead Sea scrolls.\n\nKen’s book, Ancient Testaments of the Patriarchs: Autobiographies from the Dead Sea Scrolls, shares the testaments of Enos (Adam’s grandson), Enoch, Lamech (Noah’s father), Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Levi, Judah, Naphtali, Joseph, Benjamin, Kohath (son of Levi, and father of Amram), Amram (father of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam), and Aaron. In addition, he addresses many extra-biblical prophecies of the Messiah, including Aaron’s warning about the Messiah's First Coming.\n\nWe'll wade into the Messianic prophecies debate and discuss Messianic prophecies fulfilled by Jesus. We'll also discuss Ancient patriarchs in the Bible, look at who are the ancient patriarchs and examine the testaments of the ancient patriarchs.\n\n#remnantradio #deadseascrolls #messianicjudaism #biblefacts #talmud \n__________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Our hearts are heavy, and our spirits are burdened with empathy and pain as we discuss the serious alleged claims of sexual abuse brought forth by former IHOP staff members Dwayne Roberts, Brian Kim, and Wes Martin. In the midst of this storm, we find it crucial to clarify our intent: we are not live streaming to declare \"guilty\" or \"not guilty.\" Our aim is to aid our listeners in processing these events with discernment and to remind our audience of the biblical standards that must be upheld, irrespective of the individuals involved.\n\nWith the gravity that such allegations command, we will review the public statement and the subsequent actions of the IHOP executive team, including their recent appointment of a law firm to conduct an independent investigation. As we navigate these challenging discussions, we do so with utmost respect for all parties, emphasizing the need for a fair and just process that honors the truth and the well-being of the victims. We invite you to join us in a time of reflection, prayer, and engagement with the Word, as we seek wisdom and guidance on how to uphold the honor and integrity of the Church in every circumstance.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "Responding to the \"Cessationist\" Documentary - Part #6 | Cessationist Movie Review\n\nIn this episode of The Remnant Radio, your theology podcast, we bring an insightful response to cessationist views and responding to the Cessationist film, while also exploring charismatic theology.\n\nSection One: Prophecy's Ambiguity\nIs prophecy always clear, exact, and infallible? We challenge this cessationist belief by examining biblical passages like Numbers 12, 1 Samuel 3, and Jeremiah 32. Discover why we argue that God's communication sometimes requires discernment and isn't always straightforward.\n\nSection Two: Modern Prophecy and Discernment\nWith the rise of false prophets on digital platforms, like YouTube, we'll discuss the importance of heightened discernment and self-regulation in the charismatic community. Key scriptures like Deuteronomy 13 and 18 will shed light on the ethical implications of false prophecy and the grace needed for well-intentioned prophets who make mistakes.\n\nSection Three: Democratization of Prophetic Roles\nWe'll explore the transformation of prophetic roles from the Old to the New Testament. Our hosts suggest that a democratization has occurred, opening the gift of prophecy to all believers. This inclusivity highlights the importance of discernment. While the prophetic function remains consistent, modern prophetic messages require distinct methods of discernment and testing.\n\nDon't miss this comprehensive episode where we dismantle cessationist arguments, unravel the complexities of charismatic theology, and find the balance between upholding the integrity of Scripture and valuing spiritual gifts. Join us today as theology meets real-world application! \n\nFor our Cessationist study guide, subscribe to our newsletter: www.TheRemnantRadio.com.\n\n#remnantradio #cessationist #cessationistdocumentary #cessationistfilm #cessationistfullmovie #cessationistmoviereview #cessationistvscontinuationist #cessationistvscharismatic\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Welcome back to The Remnant Radio, your go-to Theology Podcast for deep dives into Charismatic Theology. In this fourth installment of \"Responding To The Cessationist Documentary,\" we delve deeper into the layers of contradiction and the problematic historical understandings presented in the Cessationist film.\n\n🔍 Section 1: Here, we tackle the confusing narratives around the timeline of miracles. Bill Vandoodewaard's statements clash head-on with what Phill Johnson, Josh Boice, and Nathan Busenitz have claimed earlier in the Cessationist documentary. The constant contradictions among cessationist views leave us wondering: Do they even understand their own proposed timeline? Join us as Remnant Radio exposes these discrepancies, debunking cessationist theories one by one.\n\n🔥 Section 2: We address Chad Vegas's incendiary claims that hinge on a flawed understanding of Protestantism. Claiming that \"to believe in sola scriptura is to be a cessationist\" and associating charismatic beliefs with non-Protestant views are not just oversimplifications but fundamentally incorrect. With a deep dive into church history, Remnant Radio swiftly debunks these claims by shedding light on the rich history of prophetic, apostolic, and healing gifts that were evident among the Scottish Presbyterians such as George Wishart, John Davidson, John Knox, John Welsh, Robert Bruce, and Samuel Rutherford. And yes, we even bring Charles Spurgeon into the mix!\n\nEngage with us as we continue our series \"Responding to the Cessationist Documentary - Part 4\" and explore the intricate nuances of Charismatic Theology. If you've ever pondered cessationism explained or sought a response to cessationist claims, this is the place to be.

    "description": "The Rule of King Jesus Seen In Miracles #miracles #miraculous #cessationism #cessationist #remnant\n\n\"But, once again, the point Michael made earlier was that it wasn't just the apostles who were working miracles. You've got the 72 who were sent out to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons, and even raise the dead. I mean, you've got these reports coming back from the disciples saying, 'Hey, we did these things in your name.'\n\nThe other thing Michael was attaching to this is that it wasn't just the messenger being affirmed. Primarily, it was the message itself that was being affirmed. The message being that the kingdom of God is at hand, which simply means the rule or reign of King Jesus is at hand.\n\nSo, what does it look like for King Jesus to rule and reign? Well, it looks like demons getting cast out. It looks like the sick getting healed, lepers being cleansed, the blind regaining their sight, and even the dead being raised. These are all normative things when God expresses His rule and reign here on Earth.\"",

Faith is actually a big part of it. What if everyone in America started believing that God can do these things and passionately pursued Jesus? I bet we'd see more happening. I also think that in the third world, where people have to rely on God for miracles and don't have scholars telling them that God no longer gives these kinds of gifts, they're witnessing it happening like crazy, and it's well-documented. I would wager that faith is a significant component of that.\"",

My conversation and preaching were not filled with persuasive words of wisdom but rather with a demonstration of the Spirit. Get that – proclamation and demonstration. It's a demonstration of the Spirit and of power so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God. I don't know how to say it, but the idea that the gifts wouldn't be accompanied today implies, on some level, that you think you can preach the Gospel better than Paul the Apostle. You believe that you don't need the power of God to demonstrate the message of God. I would tell you that your methodology lags several steps behind that of the Apostle. If you refuse to demonstrate the works of God alongside the proclamation of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, these two things go hand in hand.\"",

    "title": "Responding To The Hebrews 2:2-4 Cessationist Argument",
    "description": "Responding To The Hebrews 2:2-4 Cessationist Argument\n\nOne of the frequently cited texts supporting cessationism is Hebrews 2:3–4, where the author emphasizes the significance of the gospel message being confirmed by three stages. First, Jesus declared it with divine authority. Second, eyewitnesses testified to its truth through their experiences with Jesus. Finally, God affirmed it with signs, wonders, and gifts of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHowever, some debate whether this passage implies the cessation of such manifestations after the apostolic era. John MacArthur contends that these miracles were primarily for validating the message of Christ and the apostles. He interprets the past tense in \"it was attested\" to mean that these gifts were for the first-generation apostles alone. Similarly, Pastor Tom Pennington suggests that Hebrews 2 indicates that miraculous manifestations were foundational and no longer the norm in the present day. John MacArthur believes that this passage “confirms that the validation of the prophets was the chief purpose for biblical miracles.” He argues yet again that “we see Scripture attesting that signs, wonders, miracles, and miraculous gifts were God’s confirmation of the message of Christ and His apostles (‘those who heard’).” In like manner, Pastor Tom Pennington of Countryside Bible Church speaks of Hebrews 2 and says, \"The writer of Hebrews, writing just before he says, the Lord spoke this gospel. It was confirmed to us by those who heard, meaning the Apostles, and the Apostles were allowed to work signs and miracles to confirm that message. And so even the writer of Hebrews, writing under the auspices of the Apostles, says, 'I'm not working miracles; that's not happening now. The writer of Hebrews is looking back and saying those things were foundational; that's not the norm anymore.\"\n\nIn response, we present seven counterarguments based on Dr. Sam Storm's book \"Understanding Spiritual Gifts.\"\n\n1) Conceding that validating prophets was a primary purpose of biblical miracles doesn't exclude other purposes documented in the New Testament. Therefore, miracles should be used to display God's compassion, God's glory, and should be used evangelistically.\n\n2) The author of Hebrews doesn't limit the text to apostles; the term \"apostle\" doesn't even appear. \"Those who heard\" can encompass more than the Twelve. There is no reason to assume Hebrews is only speaking of Apostles.\n\n3) The text doesn't specify what or whom God \"bore witness\" to through signs and wonders. The focus is probably \"the great salvation.\" God is not bearing witness to the Apostles' authority as worthy messengers because the text says nothing about the Apostles.\n\n4) The cessationist claims that God \"bore witness\" (past tense) meaning that the author of Hebrews no longer believed that God was \"bearing witness\" to miracles in his day. The word \"bore witness\" in Greek is in the present tense, suggesting ongoing confirmation. Therefore, it is likely that the miracles are still active.\n\n5) The passage doesn't rule out God attesting to the gospel through supernatural displays of power today; it only suggests that He did so at one time.\n\n6) Even if miraculous events ceased, spiritual gifts still benefit the body of Christ today.\n\n7) The term \"charisma\" doesn't appear in the text; it might refer to the Spirit Himself or a broader use of \"gifts.\"\n\n8) Finally, Hebrews 2 starts by speaking of \"the message declared by angels.\" The cessationist claims, \"Now that the message has been delivered, we no longer need miraculous demonstrations.\" If the cessationist is going to be consistent, wouldn't this mean that there would also no longer be a need for angels?\n\nIn light of these points, the argument that Hebrews 2:3–4 supports cessationism appears unconvincing.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Responding to the \"Cessationist\" Documentary - Part #3 | Cessationist Movie Review",
    "description": "Are the Charismatic gifts real? Speaking in tongues, prophesying, healing, and raising the dead – do these phenomena exist? Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians firmly believe in their authenticity, viewing them as miraculous occurrences. The new documentary \"Cessationist\" boldly asserts that they have ceased. Under the direction of Les Lanphere,  the \"Cessationist\" film attempts to dismiss modern practices of spiritual gifts using speculation, church tradition, and human reasoning. Fortunately, the Word of God directly contradicts their confident assertions. In this 3rd installment of our response to the cessationist documentary, we will tackle 3 arguments from the Cessationist movie.\n\nArgument #1: The Cessationist Hebrews 2:2-3 Argument\nTom Pennington, a respected figure from Countryside Bible Church, asserts that spiritual gifts ceased after the apostolic era. This assertion is based on Hebrews 2:2-3, where the writer seems to suggest that miracles were foundational but not the norm. Our response is a comprehensive 7-fold argument that peels back the layers of complexity within this passage. We will explore the multifaceted purposes of miracles beyond mere validation, examining the absence of exclusivity to the apostles, and meticulously analyzing the present tense of \"bore witness.\" Discover how these intricacies challenge the cessationist stance, and how the text itself suggests the possibility of God continuing to bear witness through signs, wonders, and spiritual gifts.\n\nArgument #2: \"The Wicked Generation That Seeks A Sign\" from Matthew 16\nThe documentary contends that Matthew 16:4 condemns seeking signs to validate faith. We will embark on a profound journey through the context of this verse, unveiling its true meaning. This passage was spoken by Jesus in response to the Pharisees and Sadducees who demanded a sign from heaven to test Him. Their motive was not genuine faith but a desire for on-demand miracles. We will demonstrate that Matthew 16:4 is not a rebuke against the use of spiritual gifts for evangelism, but rather a criticism of those who wanted God to prove Himself through signs. Explore how the apostles themselves sought signs and wonders as tools for God to reveal Himself to their enemies, illustrating the positive role of continuationism in opening doors for evangelism through miracles.\n\nArgument #3: Misrepresentations Of Church History\nNathan Busenitz, the Executive Vice President of The Master's Seminary, makes the sweeping claim that the early church fathers unanimously believed in the cessation of miraculous gifts. This assertion is a distortion of church history. To set the record straight, we will present an extensive list of church fathers who not only held beliefs in the continuation of spiritual gifts but also actively practiced and endorsed supernatural manifestations, including healing and prophecy. From Justin Martyr to Thomas Aquinas, from Irenaeus to Teresa of Ávila, discover the rich tapestry of Christian history that testifies to the ongoing presence of spiritual gifts throughout the ages.\n\nTune in to watch The Remnant Radio team respond to arguments put forth by cessationists such as Tom Pennington, Nathan Busenitz, and Scott Aniol. This live stream promises to be a thought-provoking experience for all who seek to understand the role of spiritual gifts in today's church and the true narrative of church history.\n\nFor our Cessationist study guide, subscribe to our newsletter at www.theremnantradio.com.\n\n0:00 - Introduction to the Hosts and the Purpose of the Show\n2:30 - 7 Fold Argumentation For Hebrews 2:2-4\n29:51 - Wicked & Adulterous Generation Seeking Signs 🙄\n58:13 - Gross Misrepresentations Of Church History\n1:13:26 - Conflating Charismatics With Montanists\n\n#remnantradio #cessationist #cessationistdocumentary #cessationistfilm #cessationistfullmovie #cessationistmoviereview #cessationistvscontinuationist #cessationistvscharismatic\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Join us on The Remnant Radio, as we dive into the world of Bible translations and the Tree of Life Version (TLV) with our special guest, Dr. Jeffrey Seif. Dr. Seif is a distinguished figure in the world of Messianic Judaism, renowned for his extensive contributions to biblical scholarship and his role as a key figure behind the TLV translation.\n\nThe Tree of Life Version (TLV) is a modern English translation of the Bible designed to reflect the Jewish roots and context of the Scriptures. While it aims to provide a clear and accurate representation of the original Hebrew and Greek texts, the TLV also preserves the Jewish cultural and linguistic elements found within the Bible. However, not everyone shares the same enthusiasm for this unique translation.\n\nMark Ward, a Bible scholar and TLV critic, has come on Remnant and expressed reservations about the TLV. He questions the extensive use of transliterated Hebrew terms in the translation and raises concerns about its intelligibility for a broader audience. Additionally, Mark Ward challenges the practice of replacing \"Lord\" in the New Testament with \"ADONAI\" and the use of Hebrew transliterations for certain terms. You can watch that episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEiKbrXgp1o&t=12s\n\nIn this episode, Dr. Jeffrey Seif will defend and elaborate on the Tree of Life Version's merits, addressing Mark Ward's concerns and providing insights into the translation's purpose and significance. We'll explore the TLV's focus on maintaining the Jewish essence of the Bible and its role in connecting readers with the rich heritage of their faith.\n\nDon't miss this episode as we delve into the world of Bible translations, examine the Tree of Life Version, and gain a deeper understanding of its place within the Messianic Jewish movement. \n\nTree of Life Bible: https://tlvbiblesociety.org/collections/bibles\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "The Cluster Argument: Responding to Cessationism",
    "description": "In this episode of The Remnant Radio,  we respond to Tom Pennington pastor of Countryside Bible Church, as he uses the Cluster argument to explain the cessation of spiritual gifts. Tom Pennington asserts that there are distinct periods in biblical history marked by a concentration of miracles, coinciding with significant stages in God's redemptive plan.\n\nCessationists claim that there are only three key periods of concentrated miracles in the Bible: the Moses and Joshua era, characterized by miracles during the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan; the Elijah and Elisha era, featuring supernatural acts confirming prophetic ministries in a spiritually declining Israel; and the Jesus and Apostles era, marked by miracles establishing the Christian church and confirming the authority of Jesus and the apostles as messengers of the New Covenant. Cessationists argue that during these periods, unique displays of divine power occurred, and therefore, miraculous gifts gradually diminished or ceased afterward. But is this argument rooted in biblical evidence, or is it a theological assertion imposed upon the text?\n\nWe contend that this argument is profoundly unbiblical and can be easily disproven with minimal effort. To start, Jeremiah 32:20-21 unequivocally states that God has performed signs and wonders from the time of Moses to the present day:\n\n“You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours. 21 You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.”\n\nAdditionally, the New Testament provides explicit time frames for when the gifts will cease, such as Acts 2, which mentions \"in the last days,\" referring to the eschatological period leading up to the \"day of the Lord\" that we currently live in. Or consider 1 Corinthians 1:7, which explicitly states that the church in Corinth would abound in every gift until Christ appears. Moreover, 1 Corinthians 13:8-12 tells us that the gifts will cease when Christ returns. The Cluster argument stands as one of the weakest arguments in the cessationist arsenal, and in this episode of The Remnant Radio, we address it head-on.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "In this episode of \"The Remnant Radio,\" we delve deep into one clip from the cessationist documentary. This clip tackles the cessationist argument regarding \"sign gifts\" and their purpose in the modern church. Cessationists claim that these supernatural manifestations were solely meant to authenticate messengers of God and have ceased since the completion of the Bible.\n\nIn this clip you will see Tom Pennington from Countryside Bible Church, Nathan Busenitz the Executive vice president of The Master’s Seminary, and Steven J. Lawson a Professor Of Preaching at The Master’s Seminary, using this argument to explain away any need for revelatory gifts of prophecy or healing. \n\nOur response, presented over 18 minutes, counters this argument with a multi-faceted approach. We explore the various purposes of miracles in Scripture, from displaying God's glory and defeating demonic strongholds to delivering the oppressed and expanding the gospel. We also examine New Testament examples of the ongoing use of these gifts for witness and ministry.\n\nJoin us as we provide a comprehensive analysis of the cessationist position and present a compelling case for the continuation of supernatural gifts in the church today.

    "title": "Can Christians Be Demonized? Exploring Charismatic Teachings Of Demon Possession & Demon Oppression",
    "description": "Join us as we delve into the widely held charismatic teachings that assert Christians cannot be demonized. We'll examine and challenge this belief by exploring two key quotes from prominent figures like Chuck Smith, as well as a comprehensive position paper from the Assemblies of God. With a balanced and respectful approach, we present counterarguments, drawing from biblical references and historical context to gently disagree and provide a compelling refutation of these charismatic notions.\n\nBut that's not all – we take our investigation a step further by delving into the writings of church fathers who hold an opposing perspective. Through quotes and thoughtful commentary, we highlight the historical continuity of the belief that Christians can indeed be subject to demonic influence. By juxtaposing these historical perspectives with the modern charismatic stance, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of this complex theological topic.\n\nJoin us for an exploration that encourages critical thinking and a nuanced understanding of charismatic teachings regarding demonization. Whether you're a believer seeking to deepen your faith or simply interested in theological discussions, this video offers a comprehensive analysis that invites viewers to consider different viewpoints and engage in meaningful dialogue.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Far from being abstract or irrelevant, the words of the Creed carefully express what God has done in Christ and through the Spirit. The Nicene Creed gives us the gospel. It gives biblical Christians the words for what we already believe.

Was he the result of still ongoing natural processes or a unique creation? In the original publication of Who Was Adam?

They proposed a new scientific testable model for human origins. This robust 10-year update provides rigorous testing of the evolution and creation scenarios. New discoveries in genetics and paleoanthropology, especially, provide helpful evidence. How has RTB's biblically aligned model for human origins fared? Can human evolution be declared a fact? Or does a creation model make more scientific sense? We’ll interview Fuz Rana and discuss his latest book on the show.

    "description": "The TLV or Tree of Life Version, is a Bible translation produced by the Messianic Jewish community. The TLV aims to restore Jewish names, themes, and cultures into an English Bible. Most Western Bible translations transliterate Hebrew words and themes into English in a way that would make sense to Western readers. However, many in the messianic movement believe these transliterations actually remove our historic connection to the Jewish people.\n\nToday, scholar Mark Ward (remember him from our episode on the KJV only controversy?) joins us to discuss translation and transliteration as it pertains to most modern translations, including (and especially) the TLV. You won’t want to miss!\n\nIn response, you can watch Dr. Jeffrey Seif's defense of the TLV Bible here: https://youtube.com/live/9Q4UGF7_O5A\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "John MacArthur and other cessationist claim that God only did miracles in three clustered periods of redemptive history:  the life of Moses & Joshua, the life of Elijah and Elisha, and the life of Jesus and the Apostles. Cessationists argue that the gifts have ceased today in the same way that they ceased in between these clustered periods. Could this be true? Did the supernatural and miraculous signs of God end between these various periods? We think not! All this and more will be covered in this episode of Remnant Radio!

    "title": "Are The Sign Gifts For Today? Responding to Ligonier Cessationist Arguments",
    "description": "Cessationism is the theological belief that some supernatural gifts of the Spirit have ceased to operate in the Church. Cessationists (those who hold the doctrine of cessationism) often categorize tongues, healing, and other revelatory gifts as \"sign gifts\". These \"sign gifts\", as they are often called by cessationists, are believed to have ceased at the end of the Apostolic age, the closing of the cannon, or progressively ceased during the life of the apostles.  So, Are Sign Gifts For Today? In this episode, we will be listening and responding to cessationist arguments articulated by the respected scholarship over at Ligonier ministries. Here at The Remnant Radio, we think that all spiritual gifts, even the sign gifts are for today. Though we respect Steven Lawson, Stephen Nichols, and Burk Parsons, we strongly disagree with them over spiritual gifts and do not believe that their arguments hold water when compared to the continuationist arguments of Dr. Criag Keener, Dr. Sam Storms, D.A. Carson and others. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Who is the Antichrist? Interview with Kim Riddlebarger",
    "description": "In this video, we interview Kim Riddlebarger about the identity of the Antichrist. What is the Antichrist? What does the Bible say about the Antichrist? The historic Christian faith holds to a conception of an \"Anti-Christ\" figure derived from the Christian scriptures, particularly The Book of Daniel, Thessalonians, and Revelation. This Antichrist is foretold as one who will “speak great words against the most-High and wear out the saints of the most-High, and think to change times and laws” (Daniel 7:25). He will also \"He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.\" (2 Thessalonians 2:4). \n\nBut are these figures in Daniel and 2 Thessalonians future apocalyptic figures? Or was Daniel referring to a contemporary Hellenistic ruler of Palestine, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who attempted to root out and destroy Judaism? Was Paul's \"man of lawlessness\" referring to Emperor Nero? The reformers were convinced the Antichrist was the Papecy or more specifically the Pope, while some modern scholars believe that all these historic men are an archetypal type of the future baddy we all know as THE ANTICHRIST! \n\nIs the Antichrist revealed in End Times Eschatology?\n\nAll this and more as we discuss \"Who is the Antichrist\" in this episode of The Remnant Radio!\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Are Sign Gifts For Today?: Remnant Radio Revisits Cessationist Arguments",
    "description": "Cessationism is the theological belief that some supernatural gifts of the Spirit have ceased to operate in the Church. Cessationists (those who hold the doctrine of cessationism) often categorize tongues, healing, and other revelatory gifts as \"sign gifts\". These \"sign gifts\", as they are often called by cessationists, are believed to have ceased at the end of the Apostolic age, the closing of the cannon, or progressively ceased during the life of the apostles.  So, Are Sign Gifts For Today? In this episode, we will be listening and responding to cessationist arguments articulated by the respected scholarship over at Ligonier ministries. Here at The Remnant Radio, we think that all spiritual gifts, even the sign gifts are for today. Though we respect Steven Lawson, Stephen Nichols, and Burk Parsons, we strongly disagree with them over spiritual gifts and do not believe that their arguments hold water when compared to the continuationist arguments of Dr. Criag Keener, Dr. Sam Storms, D.A. Carson and others. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Join us for a fascinating exploration of spiritual warfare through the lens of the Book of Job with Dr. Bob Chisholm, Senior Professor at Dallas Theological Seminary. After 42 years of scholarly work, Dr. Chisholm brings fresh insights into how Job’s suffering fits within a larger cosmic conflict.\n\nWe’ll explore the supernatural dimensions of Job’s story, including: • The Divine Council and Satan’s role • The true identity of Leviathan, Behemoth, and other creatures • How Job’s suffering relates to spiritual warfare • The relationship between righteousness and spiritual attack • Practical implications for believers facing trials today\n\nDrawing from ancient Near Eastern context and careful biblical analysis, Dr. Chisholm helps us understand that sometimes believers suffer not because of sin, but because of righteousness. This groundbreaking perspective challenges common assumptions about suffering while offering hope to those experiencing trials.\n\nJoin us as we discover how Job’s ancient story provides crucial insights into spiritual warfare and divine purposes in suffering.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "We welcomed Becket Cook (@BecketCook) to the show to share his powerful testimony! When Becket Cook moved from Dallas to Los Angeles after college, he discovered a socially progressive, liberal town that embraced not only his creative side but also his homosexuality. He devoted his time to growing his career as a successful set designer and to finding \"the one\" man who would fill his heart. As a gay man in the entertainment industry, Cook centered his life around celebrity-filled Hollywood parties and traveled to society hot-spots around the world--until a chance encounter with a pastor at an LA coffee shop one morning changed everything.\n\nIn A Change of Affection, Becket Cook shares his testimony as someone who was transformed by the power of the gospel. Cook's dramatic conversion to Christianity and subsequent seminary training inform his views on homosexuality--personally, biblically, theologically, and culturally--and in his new book he educates Christians on how to better understand this complex and controversial issue while revealing how to lovingly engage with those who disagree. A Change of Affection is a timely and indispensable resource for anyone who desires to understand more fully one of the most common and difficult stumbling blocks to faithfully following Christ today.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

It's a struggle to leave long-time friends and a community you have invested in. But, if there are unbiblical teachings and/or sinful behaviors, you may need to look for a different church home. When is it time to leave?

    "description": "Does God Cry: Discussions On Impassibility with Amos Winarto \n\nDoes God have emotions? Without much thought, many of us instinctually say “YES!” Maybe you think back to the passages of scripture where God’s anger is kindled. Or where men and women of the bible work to please God. Or maybe even scriptures on God’s compassion for the widows and orphans. Well, philosophers describe God’s emotions very differently than we do. They suggest, if we can do something to make God happy, make God angry, or make God cry, then we control the uncontrollable, and we can change the unchangeable? The theological position that states that God’s emotions are unchangeable is called impassability. Listen as Dr. Amos Winarto discusses this philosophical/theological doctrine regarding the emotions of God. \n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Bridgeway\nhttps://www.bridgewaychurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nRemnant News Letter\nhttp://eepurl.com/hSCQRv\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nFree Mini E-course\nhttps://remnant-university.teachable.com/p/free-mini-course",

    "title": "Weekly Communion - A Tradition or Command? Interview with Kenneth Wieting",
    "description": "What is Communion? What is Eucharist? Weekly Communion was the normative practice of the church for nearly three centuries. However, by the 4th-century reports began to emerge of congregants being unwilling or unable to take the Lord's Table. The balance of seeing God with both transcendence and immanence was lost and the church could not imagine fellowshipping with God in communion. Christians pictured God as too lofty - too different - too unapproachable. Eventually, the Lord's Table was reserved only for the priest, the \"holiest\" of which could partake monthly.  Nearly a millennium later the Protestant reformation brings communion back to center stage. This \"communion revival\" re-situated the Church around the table in faith and fellowship with Christ Jesus. In recent centuries the church has once again fallen off kilter with the commands of the Holy Eucharist. Many argue that the table is merely a symbol that should not be institutionalized, and others fear religious repetition will cause communion to lose its much-needed reverence. So what should we do concerning holy communion? Should believers practice the table monthly, weekly, or daily? Can Christians take communion on their own without a Church? Are all the rules about communion man-made traditions? \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "God Is Doing Something At The Asbury Revival #shorts \n\nRemnant's Thoughts On The Asbury Revival!\n\nHughes Auditorium has been hosting a chapel service since Wednesday, February 8th. Since then services have had public confessions, repentance, worship (of all kinds), proclamation (preaching and testimonies), prayer, and public scripture readings. These services are low-hype somber and worshipful. People come to kneel at the altar railing as the Holy Spirit prompts them without hyped-up altar calls. There are reports of healings and prophetic utterances. Hughes Auditorium has reached capacity multiple times over the past week, and Estes Chapel across the street at Asbury Theological Seminary has been opened for overflow. Yet there are still lines that stretch throughout the campus with hundreds maybe thousands of people waiting on a touch from God.\n\nI was so excited to see what God was doing that I flew out on Monday to experience the revival firsthand!

    "title": "The Asbury Revival: Our Thoughts On The Asbury Revival",
    "description": "Hughes Auditorium has been hosting a chapel service since Wednesday, February 8. Since then services have had public confessions, repentance, worship (of all kinds), proclamation (preaching and testimonies), prayer, and public scripture readings. These services are low-hype somber and worshipful. People come to kneel at the altar railing as the Holy Spirit prompts them without hyped-up altar calls. There are reports of healings and prophetic utterances. Hughes Auditorium has reached capacity multiple times over the past week, and Estes Chapel across the street at Asbury Theological Seminary has been opened for overflow. Yet there are still lines that stretch throughout the campus with hundreds maybe thousands of people waiting on a touch from God.\n\nI was so excited to see what God was doing that I flew out on Monday to experience the Asbury Awakening and Revival firsthand! Yesterday, we filmed updates on the revival and shared our thoughts about the mighty work that God is doing at Asbury Seminary. There are lots of opinions circling around the rival right now. We have critiques calling it \"emotionalism\" and many Charismatics saying it is \"the fulfillment of a Bob Jones Prophecy.\" We address all that and more in this episode.\n\n#remnantradio #asburyrevival #asburyrevival2023 \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "A major revival occurred in 1927-1935 called at that time the Shantung Revival (now often referred to as the Shandong Revival). While it involved Presbyterians, Pentecostals, and Baptists, I have focused on the Baptist story.  Baptist missionaries during the revival experienced or observed divine healings, speaking in tongues, visions etc... and other practices that were associated with Pentecostalism.  Baptists back in the USA became concerned and questioned the missionaries.  The story is a case of \"charismatic Baptists\" much earlier than the charismatic stories of the 1960s and following.  Baptists in recent decades like to cite the revival as a great evangelistic success but have difficulty admitting the charismatic practices (and often try to mute their existence)\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "I consider Allan Parr one of the best examples of a Christian YouTuber out there. The guy cranks out solid content every week with biblically sound teachings. He carefully and kindly identifies false teachings, while simultaneously showing us the historic Christian Faith seen in the scriptures. Suffice to say, he has been an inspiration to all of us here at Remnant Radio. \n\n\"As always all of us in the faith find areas of disagreement in non-essential doctrines and we want to lovingly challenge one another presenting the best arguments with kindness and generosity. While rare we have found one contention with Alan Parr's interpretation of Isaiah 53. On Apr 5, 2019, Allan published a video Titled \"Does God Promise us Divine Healing?\". In this video, Allan explains that the frequently quoted Isaiah 53:5 text is not about physical healing. This video pulled in over 119,000 Views, and like all of Allan's content, it was done with professionalism, Christian Charity, and careful Exegesis. That being said, we think he's wrong ;).\n\nIn this video, we will be responding to Allan Parr's claims that \"Isaiah 53:5 is not about healing\"\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Bridgeway\nhttps://www.bridgewaychurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks\n________________________________________________________________________\nDownload Free Ebook\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/free-ebook-download-2/\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nFree Mini E-course\nhttps://remnant-university.teachable.com/p/free-mini-course\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWord & Spirit School Of Ministry (117 Video Discipleship Course)\nhttps://remnant-university.teachable.com/p/remnant-university\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nConference\nhttps://onrealm.org/FaithChurchStatesville/PublicRegistrations/Event?linkString=OWNjMTI3ODYtMzg4NS00YjllLWFhM2EtYWVkNjAwZmU2Yjkx",

Dr. Wellum breaks down the differences between traditional Dispensationalism, Covenant Theology, and Progressive Covenantalism, explaining how biblical covenants serve as the backbone for understanding Scripture’s unity. The discussion delves into how each covenant from Adam to Christ progressively reveals God’s redemptive plan, challenging oversimplified interpretations of biblical law and offering a fresh perspective on how Christians should understand their relationship to Old Testament commands.

Investigating Andy Stanley's LGBT Views\n\n40,000 congregants and perhaps millions of people around the world look to Andy Stanley for spiritual guidance, but should they? Years ago Andy Stanley was thrust into controversy when he encouraged his congregation to \"unhitch from the Old Testament.\" \n\nMost recently, the controversy has been stirred by viral social media posts that have threatened to expose Andy Stanley as a heretic. \"Why?\" you may ask. Well, the claim is that Andy Stanley has become an LGBTQI+-affirming pastor. It appears Andy Stanley is now encouraging his church to \"unhitch\" morality from the Bible altogether. Join us as Josh, Michael, and Michael investigate the claims about Andy Stanley and discuss what Christians should do when pastors become LGBT-affirming. \n\n#remnantradio #theology #theologypodcast #theologydiscussion #biblepodcast #christianpodcast \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Joel Richardson is a Christian author and teacher who has written several books on biblical prophecy and the end times. He is also a critic of the pre-tribulation rapture doctrine, which is the belief that the church will be taken to heaven before the seven-year period of tribulation that precedes the second coming of Christ. He argues that this doctrine is not supported by the scriptures, the early church fathers, or the historical context of the book of Revelation. He believes that the church will go through the tribulation and be raptured at the end of it, when Christ returns in glory.\n\nJoin us as we wade into the pre trib vs post trib debate.\n\n#remnantradio #rapture #bookofrevelation #revelation #eschatology #endtimes \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Welcome to 2023 everyone!\n\nWith the new year comes new prophetic words, and with new prophetic words comes the testing of prophetic words. As charismatics ourselves, we believe we are required to obey all biblical requirements for the gift of prophecy, which includes testing prophecy (1 Thessalonians 5:19-22). So, in this video, we will be testing/judging the prophetic words released by Charisma News. \n\nFour days ago Charisma News published a YouTube video titled \"Compilation of 2023 PROPHETIC WORDS\". At the time of this post, their YouTube video has 89,000 views. Charisma's prophetic compilation video contains prophetic words from Chuck Pierce, Mike Signorelli, Alexander Pagani, Curt Landry, and Dr. Michael Brown! Should be an interesting program!\n\n#remnantradio #prophecy #propheticministry #theology #theologypodcast #theologydiscussion\n\nWebsite: https://www.TheRemnantRadio.com\nSubscribe to Newsletter: https://theremnantradio.beehiiv.com/subscribe",

It appears that God pours out plagues, sicknesses, and diseases on those who are in rebellion against him. Often times we even see God afflicting the seemingly \"innocent\" with sickness, disease, and death due to the sins of those in proximity to them. How should Christians interpret these passages?

    "description": "Is there Alien life out there? It is a question that is not going away any time soon. With the increasing regularity of UAP sightings by the US military, the explosion of science fiction movies, and the popularity of new-age mythology, the alien conversation is now unavoidable. Whether it's a casual conversation about entertainment or a serious conversation about religious experiences, these conversations about aliens pose a unique moment in Christian history that believers should not shrink back from. We should have apologetics to address many people's concerns and questions regarding the potentiality of extraterrestrial life. Today we hope to do just that with Dr. Jeff Zweerink, senior research scholar with Reasons to Believe. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

List one is found in Romans 12, List two can be found in 1 Corinthians 12, and list three can be found in Ephesians 4. But why are they different lists? Why does Paul leave out healing, tongues, and administration in Ephesians 4? or why isn't there a mention of evangelism in 1 Corinthians 12? It appears that each of these lists was not meant to be exhaustive. If that is true, then might there be other Spirit-empowered gifts that Christ has given his church, gifts unmentioned in scripture?

Others in charismatic space speak with so much nuance that makes healing sound infrequent and rare. In this episode, we explain how you can really believe it's always God's will to heal, without the typical hangups that come with that mentality. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Aimee Semple McPherson & The Complexities of Christian Celebrities\n\nStarting off the week by talking about the life and teachings of Aimee Semple McPherson. Aimee was a Canadian Pentecostal evangelist and media celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, famous for founding the Foursquare Church. McPherson pioneered the use of broadcast mass media, she used radio, popular entertainment techniques, and stage theatrics, in her weekly sermons that popularized her name in an unprecedented way. \nOur good buddy Anthony Scoma is joining us for the discussion. Anthony has been on the show twice before once covering the History of the Assemblies of God and the history of race in the AG.\n\nAnthony is a 4th generation member of the Assemblies of God on both sides of his family. He graduated from UT with a degree in history, he received a Master of Divinity from SAGU, then went to Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary for a master's in historical Theology. In Anthony’s words, he has been tried by Presbyterians, Pentecostals, and Pagans 🤣🤣🤣. \n\nAs you can imagine, someone with such a diverse education is absolutely fascinating to talk to. Tune in tomorrow at 4PM CST to catch this program. \n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Bridgeway\nhttps://www.bridgewaychurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks\n________________________________________________________________________\nDownload Free Ebook\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/free-ebook-download-2/\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nFree Mini E-course\nhttps://remnant-university.teachable.com/p/free-mini-course\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWord & Spirit School Of Ministry (117 Video Discipleship Course)\nhttps://remnant-university.teachable.com/p/remnant-university\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nConference\nhttps://onrealm.org/FaithChurchStatesville/PublicRegistrations/Event?linkString=OWNjMTI3ODYtMzg4NS00YjllLWFhM2EtYWVkNjAwZmU2Yjkx",

But is there really a biblical prohibition to confronting teaching we disagree with? Are there hoops we need to jump through before we disagree? Or maybe disagreement itself is quarrelsome and divisive. We will discuss all this and more today at 4PM CST!\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Our culture is starving for spiritual experiences while championing moral relativism. Neopaganism checks all the boxes for this cultural moment. Wicca, witchcraft, and neopaganism are growing at rapid rates in the west, and it feels like the church is two steps behind the culture. \n\nIn this episode, we'll have neopaganism explained, looking at neopagan rituals and neopaganism practices. If you want to learn how to connect the Gospel to those practicing Wicca, witchcraft, or other forms of neopaganism, you need to check out this episode of The Remnant Radio. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #neopagannovember #wicca #witchcraft #occult",

    "description": "In this episode of Remnant Radio about atonement theories, Josh Lewis and Michael Rowntree explore five major theories of atonement in Christian theology. They discuss the moral influence theory, recapitulation, ransom theory, Christus Victor, and penal substitutionary atonement, explaining how these different models help us understand what was accomplished through Christ’s death on the cross. Rather than pitting these theories against each other, we demonstrate how each model captures different aspects of Christ’s saving work, while addressing common misconceptions and contemporary debates surrounding atonement theology.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________",

    "title": "Responding To Culture Of Honor",
    "description": "Today we are taking a look at the popular charismatic book \"Culture of Honor\" By Danny Silk. In this book, Danny gives the \"secret sauce\" to Bethel's success. He claims that honoring individuals for who God has called them to be has been the foundation for the success of the movement. \nHowever, after reading \"culture of honor\" we found It to be more of a charismatic ecclesiological playbook. A playbook that frankly dishonors the gifts of the Spirit that God has established In his church. \n\nHonestly, a big part of me does not want to respond to this book. I think Danny Silk is trying to respond to an unhealthy imbalance of spiritual gifts, and he is trying to solve a real problem in the body of Christ. Unfortunately, he is overcorrecting and erroring in the opposite direction. I fear that videos like this make us look unnecessarily combative. Nevertheless, I have been told by multiple Charismatic leaders that this book is the epicenter of the toxic Charismatic culture we are seeing everywhere. So, in this video, we will be spending most of our time responding to the claims Danny made in Chapter 2. Hopefully, we can engage with Danny's teachings without mincing words or pulling punches while still Honoring the man who has made such positive Impacts In the body of Christ. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Well, Judaism is the historic epicenter of monotheism, which means all the other ancient near eastern cultures mentioned in the Old Testament lived in a mystical, polytheistic society, hell-bent on controlling their own destinies through sorcery. Turns out, if you understand the worldview of those in the \"dark arts,\" you actually have a decent grasp of the ancient near eastern worldview. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #neopagannovember #wicca #witchcraft #occult",

    "title": "Identifying Toxic Church Cultures: Interview With Scot McKnight",
    "description": "Tragically, in recent years, Christians have gotten used to revelations of abuses of many kinds in our most respected churches―from Willow Creek to Harvest, from Southern Baptist pastors to Sovereign Grace churches.\n\nOne of the best books I have read this year is \"A Church Called Tov\" by Scot McKnight, which addresses this very issue. The sad truth is that churches of all shapes and sizes are susceptible to abuses of power, sexual abuse, and spiritual abuse. Abuses occur most frequently when Christians neglect to create a culture that resists abuse and promotes healing, safety, and spiritual growth.\n\nHow do we keep these devastating events from repeating themselves? We need a map to get us from where we are today to where we ought to be as the body of Christ. Today Scott will be giving us steps to identify toxic cultures, but also how to build healthy church culture where the body of Christ can flourish. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "The Future Of The Charismatic Movement!",
    "description": "The Charismatic movement in the west has been marked by three distinct moves of God. Wave  #1 was the Pentecostal movement. Pentecostalism was the first wave of the Spirit which broke over the church In 1906 at Azusa. Wave #2 was the charismatic movement often dated to 1959 where mainline churches encountered, what they called, \"the baptism of the Spirit\". From this wave emerged Charismatic Anglicans, Charismatic Lutherans, Charismatic Presbyterians, Charismatic Roman Catholics, Charismatic Methodists, and more. Wave #3 was the Neo-Charismatic wave where the gifts of the Spirit began making their way into evangelical churches. These moves of God have marked the charismatic movement, but what's The Future Of The Charismatic Movement!? \n\nWe believe that there is a 4th wave of renewal coming to the Charismatic Movement, but what could it look like, and what should we be expecting?

A fire tunnel is two lines of people facing one another (like a cheer tunnel that you would see in a football game) and as people walk down the tunnel those lined up on both sides lay hands and pray for the individuals walking through the tunnel. \n\nWhy is this controversial? Well, there is a good bit of photage online of people shaking, convulsing, and even falling to the ground as they walk through this line for prayer. So is this practice biblical? Is it demonic? If it is permissible, is it even helpful? All this and more in this episode of Remnant Radio!\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

The conversation covers topics ranging from the age of the Earth and the creation of Adam and Eve to the Cambrian explosion and the scientific evidence for intelligent design. Dr. Ross provides compelling evidence for how modern scientific discoveries continue to affirm biblical truth and strengthen the case for a divine Creator.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________",

After reading his new book \"Prophetic Integrity\" I learned that he and Paul Cain used to do conferences together! What a wild duo Paul Cain and R.T.

    "description": "Was Christ truly forsaken on the cross? It’s a question that strikes at the heart of Christian theology. Join Joshua Lewis and Michael Rowntree as they wrestle with this complex issue, exploring the Trinity, the hypostatic union, and the weight of Jesus’s cry, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\n\nThis episode delves into the profound theological implications of Christ’s suffering, carefully examining the tension between Jesus’s divine nature and his human experience of abandonment. Michael and Joshua navigate the complexities of Psalm 22, typology, and the doctrine of penal substitutionary atonement, considering both sides of this difficult question.\n\nListeners will gain a deeper understanding of the Trinity, the nature of Christ’s sacrifice, and the power of God’s love, learning to articulate a nuanced and biblically sound perspective on the events of the crucifixion. Whether you’re a seasoned theologian or simply curious about the depths of Christian doctrine, this episode will challenge you to consider the true weight of Christ’s sacrifice.\n\nMichaels Psalm 22 Sermon\nhttps://youtu.be/D6rZORoNGq0?t=1366\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL @theremnantradio.com\n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio \n• Tax-Deductible Giving: paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6",

    "title": "God's Plan for Israel - Dispensationalism Explained: Interview With Dr. Darrell Bock",
    "description": "God's Plan for Israel - Dispensationalism Explained: Interview With Dr. Darrell Bock\n\nWhat the heck is dispensationalism? Dispensationalism, if you didn’t already know, is a theological system of interpretation that is wildly popular in evangelical churches. The doctrine of Christ’s eminent return, Israel being a prophetic time clock, and even Christian books and films such as Left Behind, are all inspired by dispensational theology.\n\nSince dispensationalism is hermeneutic, it impacts nearly every area of our Christian theology. It particularly affects the way that we view the nation of Israel, the land of Israel, and the nation of Israel's role in the end times.\n\nDispensationalism is such a broad topic! Fortunately for us, we have an expert coming on today to discuss the tenets of dispensationalism. Dr. Darrell Boch is the Executive Director of Cultural Engagement and Senior Research Professor of New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary, He is the author of over 40 books, and was one of the former presidents of the Evangelical Theological Society. We are excited to have Dr. Bock back on the show today, and we can't wait to dive Into some dispensational eschatology. \n\nSee you all at 4PM CST!\nhttps://youtu.be/gXRupVVw6TU\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Are Ephesians 4 Gifts Offices of the Church, Personalities types, or grace gifts?",
    "description": "Early on in my charismatic history, I understood that the Ephesians 4 gifts were offices that God instituted to govern the local church.  Later on In the journey, I stumbled upon Alan Hirsh’s work, suggesting that the Ephesians 4 gifts￼ were more like personality types￼ that motivated us and painted our interpretation processes. After that my reformed charismatic buddies tried to convince me that the Ephesians 4 gifts were graces given by God detached from our personalities or our participation within the local communities. 🤔🤔🤔￼￼\n\nIn this episode, we are presenting these three views and examining their biblical validity of them. \n\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Bridgeway\nhttps://www.bridgewaychurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nDownload Free Ebook\nhttp://eepurl.com/hSCQRv",

In the past, I have heard cultural apologetics being described as \"making the gospel relevant and palatable to culture\" and that sounds too much like compromising easy believeism. Other times I hear that we need to \"Christianize the worldview of the nations\" and that sounded too much like a theonomy. \n\nMy new Anglican buddy Dustin Messer comes on the show today to discuss the necessity to reach a post-Christian culture with the Gospel. Dustin gives us a palatable approach to cultural apologetics that is both biblical and achievable. It was a fascinating discussion, I hope you all enjoy. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

So this monotheistic, uncreated, eternal being is God. Then we explained that there are three persons in this one divine being, the father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. \n\nSimple enough, well today we will be taking a closer examination of the Son. Does the Son meet the three criteria necessary to be truly God? Additionally, we will examine Christ's humanity - is Jesus truly human as we are?\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n__________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________",

With the supreme courts overturn of Roe vs Wade the uncomfortable yet necessary conversation of abortion will be once again thrown back into the public square for discussion and debate. As a hot-button ethical and political issue, friends, families, and coworkers will be introducing this conversation with much passion and fiery fervor. Additionally, entire states will be deciding if they will condone, limit, or abolish abortions altogether.\n\nThis is not the time to kick back and relax. We need to be sharpened by the strongest biblical, theological, and philosophical arguments in order to make the case for the life of the unborn. In this episode, we will be making the biblical case for the life of the unborn while equipping you with arguments and responses for those who endorse and defend abortion.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

However, this kind of CEO leadership has found its way into the church and has caused moral failures, abusive leaders, and disorganized communities. The western church needs to go back, once again, to the Scriptures. This is exactly what Dave Harvey offers in his new book \"the plurality principle\". \n\nDave makes the case for a \"senior pastor\" while maintaining a plurality of elders. This module ensures that the senior pastor is allowed to lead the church, and care for his elder team appropriately while maintaining authentic accountability among his equals. Dave says it time and time again in his book \"The quality of your elder plurality determines the health of your church.\" \n\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

But is this Biblical? Does the Bible connect the habitation of the Spirit with the praise and worship of God by his people? \n\nIn this video, we will be looking at the Old Testament and the New Testament in search of biblical passages that support worship music as a means of God's grace to his people.

    "description": "Review Of Chris Reed's Boldest Prophetic Word Yet! - Chris Reed's May 13 2022 Prophetic word\n\nMost of the prophetic words we review on Remnant radio are crazy vague. That is not the case with this prophetic word by Chris Reed. He prophecies the \"ending\" of certain political leaders, the individuals that will replace them, wars, and maybe even the identity of the Anti-Christ. He claims this revelation came to him by a direct encounter with an angel! \n\nAs always, we want to look at the word and judge It as we are commanded to in 1 Corinthians 14:29 and 1 Thessalonians 5:19-22. We will test it against scripture, the prophetic track wrecked of the one giving the word, and the other criteria we often use to judge prophecy.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

But is that true? If you watch Remnant you will know that we are not Bethel fan boys. We have been rightfully critical of the \"physics of heaven\", the teachings they sell of Bob Jones traveling to heaven, and the frequent retractions. Yet I have not seen anything out of Bethel that would suggest they preach a \"different gospel\". That is a hefty claim we are unwilling to endorse. \n\nWell ,while we were at the send conference we bumped into this guy eating a philly cheesesteak sandwich. Turns out, he is the evangelist on staff at Bethel Redding. With literally no prep-time Tom swallows the rest of his philly cheesesteak and heads down to Kansas City Chiefs locker room to film a podcast with two guys he has never met and never heard of.

    "description": "Is There A Wrong Way To Read The Bible: With Mark Ward\n\nHave you ever sat in a bible study, Sunday school, or maybe even a sermon when a well-intentioned believer teaches the bible in a way that completely dishonors the text of scripture itself? We have all seen it, and we have all done it! It's embarrassing to do, our hearts break for those who are doing it, and worst of all we are fearful that the error might actually negatively affect those who are hearing the teaching. But how can we avoid making errors like this in our biblical studies? Well in this episode of The Remnant Radio we want to help you avoid those “exegetical fallacies”. And if that sounds complicated just know that’s a fancy way of saying “how to avoid mistakes when reading scripture”. Who better to help us tackle this idea than Mark Ward. Mark Ward holds a PhD in New Testament Interpretation from BJU Seminary, he is the academic editor at Lexam press, writes frequently on Bible study for Faithlife blogs and magazines, and is the host of the Bible Study Magazine Podcast. I am trying to say that he is overqualified!

    "description": "We live In a day where Identity Is under attack. You can't identify with political organizations without being demonized on both sides, religious organizations are viewed as bigoted If they stand for anything, even the vast majority of children's films portray children disobeying their families to pursue their dream as a  virtuous thing. \r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that personality tests have dominated the world of pop-phycology. If you can't look to your nation, your religious community, or your family for Identity, you must look inward. One of these vastly popular personality tests that have emerged during this season of \"Identity Crisis\" has been the Enneagram. In many ways, this simple test has soothed the anxious conscience￼ of many who are asking \"who am I\".\r\n\r\nHowever, there has been a recent uproar against the enneagram In some Christian communities. They claim \"the enneagram has demonic origins and should not be used by Christians\". Is this true, Is the enneagram Inherently demonic? Well In this episode of Remnant Radio we will be diving Into the origins, implications, and psychological￼ science behind the enneagram. \r\n\r\n\r🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "In this episode of The Remnant Radio, we are talking about the Greek Philosophy Plato! Plato had incalculable impact on western thought, but how much impact should he have on the Christian faith? Many claim that platonic philosophy was responsible for cult groups like the gnostics, because of these accusations many more have chosen to write off many of the early church fathers altogether. Why? Well, It appears that they too were infected with this platonic philosophy. But was platonic philosophy inherently evil and anti-christian, or was platonic philosophy one of the necessary preconditions that prepared for the appearance of Christ? \n\nIn this highly requested theology podcast, we will be interviewing Dr. Louis Markos who is quite the expert on all things Plato. Dr. Markos has published a book with IVP called \"From Plato to Christ: How Platonic Thought Shaped the Christian Faith\" which is quite insightful both for the negative and positive byproducts of platonic philosophy within the Christian faith. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________",

So in this episode, we want to reiterate where we agree with the New Perspective, clarify areas that may have been misunderstood about our position, and respond to some of the comments left in our past video.

    "description": "Charismatic Legalism: When We Confusing Convictions With Commandments\r\n\r\nIn this episode of The Remnant Radio Michael, Michael and Josh are covering the Charismatic convictions that exist within the charismatic movement. Is it wrong to watch Harry Potter or Pokemon? Are there hidden cultic images in the Toco Bell logo or the Monster Energy drink can? Can we, or should we give our money to organizations like Target, Disney, and Starbucks if they promote anti-Christian values? Can a Christian enjoy a beer? Some may think these convictions are silly, others may find the reasons for these convictions compelling, but what does the word of God say? Fortunately for us, there are both principles and commands in the Scriptures that can guide us through discerning if these convictions are personal or universal. \r\n\r\nWe need to realize that every single culture reads Scripture with its own cultural mores. Charismatics are no more guilty of confusing their own code of ethics with the ethics of the Bible, than any other denomination or movement with Christianity. That being said, we are a charismatic theology podcast, and it's probably a good thing for us to want to talk this stuff out. \r\n\r\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "What Is Critical Race Theory? And Is Critical Race Theory Biblical?",
    "description": "What is Critical Race Theory? Also popularly called CRT, Critical Race Theory posits a worldview that is daily used In civil discourse, being championed or demonized by media outlets, and is currently making Its way into the public school systems. You have youtube channels bent on hunting down all the \"woke pastors\" and you have leading evangelical denominations saying that CRT offers a helpful worldview for Christians to engage with. But what exactly does Critical Race Theory teach? And are the tenants of CRT biblical? In this episode, my buddy Ryan from Unsafe Media will be with us to discuss Critical Race Theory and help you understand this worldview with a biblical mindset. \n\nNow, we are primarily a theology podcast. As a theology podcast, I have avoided producing a bunch of content on Critical Race Theory, as I thought it was outside of our lane. However, the more I studied Critical Race Theory I realized that there are claims made by coming in the CRT movement that has radical theological implications. So without further ado, I hope you enjoy this episode of The Remnant Radio \n\nRyan Unsafe Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKIfmGqjdgS6UTQh8MrKuew\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Do We Interview False Teachers? Why Remnant Radio Interviews Controversial Leaders!\n\nWe are often asked, “why do you interview all these false teachers”. Questions, or rather, accusations like these are often lobbed at us because of the false binary pushed by many heretic hunting ministries. Either you are perfectly orthodox or you are a rank heretic. These binaries are further crystallized when we begin to interview those who are often Identified as NAR leaders. However, we think there is a lot more nuance, shades of gray if you will, between a heretic and a sound teacher. Many in the chat, and on our Facebook posts were calling for a public denouncement of Bill Johnson, Mike Bickle, and Todd White. Though we may disagree with these men on various issues, no one on our team is ready to cry “heretic”. So in this episode of The Remnant Radio, we explain where we stand theologically with guys like Bill Johnson, Mike Bickle, and Todd White. This is not a critique of their ministries, this isn't an attack on what they practice, this video is an attempt at an objective examination of their teachings and practices in order to explain why we think they fall under the banner of “orthodox”.\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Bridgeway\nhttps://www.bridgewaychurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nDownload Free Ebook\nhttp://eepurl.com/hSCQRv",

    "description": "As many of you know, we are charismatic. But we hold a position on the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) that is not held among many Charismatics. In fact, we probably hold a mediated position between theologians like Dr. Randy Clark and Dr. Michael Brown and those views held by Dr. Doug Geivett and Holly Pivec.\n\nWe think the New Apostolic Reformation is a helpful category when trying to identify especially harmful charismatic movements. On the other hand, \"NAR\" has become the new charismatic slur meant to insult and malign, and this is entirely unhelpful. As we see it, the category Is only helpful when it is applied to individuals and organizations that actually fit the pre-determined qualifications.\n\nLast year we hosted a wonderful conversation with Dr. Doug Geivett and Holly Pivec covering their book \"A New Apostolic Reformation? A Biblical Response to a Worldwide Movement.\" It was after this video that we were soon introduced to Dr. Randy Clark. Randy has been collecting data from Apostolic movements that he believes refutes many of the claims made by Doug and Holly. We anticipated having him on last year, but some of the surveys were not complete. In order to make a compelling case, we waited until all the data could be compiled.\n\nThat being said, THE WAIT IS OVER! Dr. Randy Clark Is making his debut appearance on the Remnant Radio Tomorrow at 4PM CST. Make sure to share the link around. It is promised to be an exciting program!\n\n@Globalawakening1 \n@globalawakeningbrazil3550 \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Can Healing Prayer Be Tested? Scientists Examining Miracle Claims!",
    "description": "Can Prayer Be Tested? Scientists Examine Miracle Claims!\n\nChristians often claim that God has healed them through some kind of drive intervention. In fact, it appears that a staggering 80% of church growth globally is a result of someone getting healed or someone they are close to getting healed as a result of prayer. But as a rational western naturalists, we know that this is a scientific impossibility right? Well in this episode of The Remnant Radio, Dr. Candy Brown and Dr. Josh Brown from the Global Research Medical Institute came on the show to discuss medically documented testimonies of those who have been healed through prayer. That's right, there are actual Scientists Examining Miracle Claims! Is there medical documentation of God healing the sick, are these healings some kind of psychological \"mind over matter event\" or, is the most reasonable conclusion that God is in fact healing the sick through the prayers of Christian ministers? As a theology podcast, we have a vested interest in following the data on this. If God is indeed healing the sick, what kind of apology does this offer the church when engaging the naturalist?

    "description": "Among continuationists, there are two primary views of prophecy. The more widely held position is the discontinuity view. This perspective teaches that the nature of prophecy shifted from the Old Testament to the New Testament. In the Old Testament, prophets spoke infallibly, while in the New Testament, prophets could speak with the possibility of partial—or even complete—error.\n\nThe second position is the continuity view. This view maintains that prophecy has always been fallible, both in the Old and New Testaments. However, when God’s words were recorded in Scripture—including prophetic writings—they were preserved infallibly.\n\nToday, we’ll be examining both of these positions.\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL @theremnantradio.com\n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio \n• Tax-Deductible Giving: paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6",

In this video, Michael McClymond will equip us with a strong orthodox apologetic for reaching those who embrace universal salvation. Specifically the branch of universalism that has snuck into modern evangelical churches \"Christian universalism\". Michael McClymond will give us the origins, theological errors, and erroneous philosophical assumptions found in Christian Universalism in order to rescue those who hold such a dangerous position. \n\nAs many of you know we find the doctrine of universal salvation to be reprehensible and heterodox to the Christian faith. Many leaders, even friends of ours, have moved closer and closer to completely eradicating the punitive wrath of God until the God they worship is an Idol of their own making and not the God of the Bible.

    "title": "Explaining The Dark Night Of The Soul: With Josh Hoffert",
    "description": "The dark night of the soul is mystical language that speaks to a specific stage in someone's spiritual journey where they undergo divinely inspired difficulty that forces them to grow into greater intimacy with Christ and subsequently have a more robust view of their own responsibility and role in the world. This Dark Night Of The Soul is an opportunity for individuals to find profound purpose and pursuit of God’s presence through their pain. This pain is an instrument of God's sovereignty used to carve away the dross of our careers, relationships, dreams, and personal identity. Job had his trials, David hid in caves from King Saul, Paul had his thorn in the flesh, these deep moments of trial and pain were all used to bring them to greater intimacy and dependency on God while revealing to them a greater awareness of their purpose in the world. Often in these moments of intense trial, it feels as if God has abandoned us, clearly, in the case of David, Job, and Paul this was not the case. In fact, for those who pushed through the trial, as they did, there was greater intimacy with God found on the other side. From Saint Ammonas in the 4th Century to Saint John of The Cross in the 16th-century, contemplatives have been writing about this \"dark night of the soul\" to help those weary pilgrims endure the trail in order that they may obtain a precious reward. In this episode, Josh Hoffert is coming on the program to unpack the biblical, historical, and practical applications that these teachings have for us today!\n\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Bridgeway\nhttps://www.bridgewaychurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nDownload Free Ebook\nhttp://eepurl.com/hSCQRv\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWind Ministries: https://www.windministries.ca/books/dark-nights-of-spiritual-struggle\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Hoffets Book: https://www.amazon.com/Nights-Spiritual-Struggle-Jo",

    "description": "It has never been more important to articulate the wonder and enchantment of the Christian message. Yet the traditional approaches of apologetics are often outmoded in an age of profound disenchantment and distraction, unable to meet this pressing need. Gavin makes the case that Christianity offers a compelling explanatory framework for making sense of our world. However, in that framework, we ought to appeal to the mind but also to the heart and the imagination as we articulate the beauty of the gospel. In this video, we will be giving the classical arguments that disprove naturalism while suggesting that deism makes better sense of beauty, the uniformity in the laws of nature, conscious thought, and more. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Word of Faith Vs Men of Faith: Alternatives to WOF Doctrine From Christian History With Paul King",
    "description": "Word of Faith Vs Men of Faith: Alternatives to WOF Doctrine From Christian History With Paul King\n\nAs Charismatics ourselves we are often labeled Word of Faith because we believe in the gifts. As Christians who call out some of the errors in the Word of Faith movement, there is a common assumption among those in the WOF that we are cessationists. However, we want to be men FULL OF FAITH! I want God to be Glorified in my life through healing, if God would have it I would love to see more healings than Amy Simple McPherson and John G Lake. If it would grow me in my faith toward God, and fruitfulness in ministry, I want to have crazier stories of provision than Kenneth Copeland and Jessie Duplantis. That being said, the testimonies do not justify the doctrines. Are there alternatives to WOF Doctrines from Christian History? Are there Men and Women who were marked by provision and miraculous power who were faithful in proclaiming orthodox doctrine? Well, In this video Paul King is with us to discuss the Word of Faith VS Men of Faith. We will be looking at three extremely Influential men George Muller, Hudson Taylor, and Charles Spurgeon. These men were marked by supernatural provision and the miraculous working of God's power while never compromising the orthodox Christian doctrine. Our goal is to compare and contrast the WOF with these historic Men of Faith so that we can point our WOF brothers to alternative examples in Christian history. Paul King has some great insights, can't wait for our talk. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "What Are Demonic Doctrines Today: Are there Modern Charismatic Examples?",
    "description": "In last week's Kundalini episode we decided that the manifestations alone were not sufficient to condemn the charismatic movement for \"entertaining false spirits\". However, we ended the episode by discussing aberrant doctrines that seem to have Infiltrated the charismatic spaces. We did not have enough time to unpack that idea last week, but this week we are going hard on the paint! Are there aberrant doctrines that place charismatics at risk of being demonized, and are all incorrect doctrines equally dangerous? In this episode, we will be revisiting the physics of heaven, courts of heaven, traveling to heaven, and maybe even prosperity gospel stuff. \n\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "KUNDALINI Spirits in the Church? 🐍  🧘  🐍",
    "description": "Today we are talking about the infamous Kundalini Spirit! Are there Kundalini Spirits in the Church? Well in this episode we will be discussing the Henduistic teachings on the Kundalini. \"Why\" you may ask. Well, it appears that some of the charismatic shakings, falling, and astatic speech seams to resemble what is called a Kundalini Awakening. Is it possible that there is a false spirit in these charismatic churches, or could there be an alternative explanation?\n\nWell, What is Kundalini Exactly?\nThe earliest record we have of Kundalini yoga comes from the Yoga-kundalini Upanishad from around 1100 AD. Breaking the name down will help you understand what Kundalini yoga is. Again, the word yoga means to unite or yoke oneself with Brahman (God). Kundalini is a type of psycho-spiritual energy. According to the Yoga-kundalini Upanishad, inside of every person is a type of life force energy called Kundalini also called Prana. The goal of a Kundalini yogi is to move the energy from the base of the spine up to a spot between the eyes, and in doing so one will yoke with God (Brahman). The prana (life force energy) is coiled around the spine, and through “the practice of the restraint of prāna, the coiled kuṇḍalinī becomes straight.”  \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Healing Evangelism Without Repentance?: Discussion with Will Hart.",
    "description": "My new Friend Will Hart is coming on today to address the concerns many have about the evangelistic ministry of those charismatics who emphasize healing. Some say that Charismatic leaders emphasize health, wealth, and prosperity while neglecting gospel preaching. Namely repentance of sin and faith in God. But is this true? Do charismatic leaders preach \"healing\" while neglecting a message of repentance? It certainly has happened, but IDK that it is fair to say that it's normative.  \n\nAnd Frankly, who better to discuss \"healing evangelism\" than Will Hart. If you Don't Know, In 2016, Heidi & Rolland Baker asked Will to take over as Iris Global's CEO. In addition to running a Global missions organization, Traveling, and speaking across the world, Will also finds time to pursue a master's degree in theology. So we have a theologically minded, evangelistically driven, charismatic guy, where else on the internet can you find conversations like this? \n\nSeriously though, Last year I had the privilege of going on Will's podcast. Since then it has been my privilege to get to know Will. Below are actual texts I received from Will in the last year.\n\n\"Things have exploded in northern Mozambique with war and some of the most brutal killings and tortures I have ever heard. Last week the city of Palma was overrun and internationals were killed as well.\" .....\"Just flying back from Mozambique, thanks for praying for my trip. It was the craziest shocking trip I have ever been on. Sat with pastors who have lost everything, their children tortured and beheaded.\".....\n\nWill is not a prosperity preacher who spouts \"give to get\" in countries of impoverished people. Will is on the front lines of actual martyrdom preaching the Gospel boldly as Jesus performs miracles through his servants. This episode is going to be Dope, Don't miss it!\n\n \nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Wellspring\nhttps://wellspringdfw.org/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nBlog on Repentance\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/uncategorized/towards-a-definition-of-repentance/\n\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/uncategorized/what-is-repentance-by-j-i-packer/\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nDownload Free Ebook\nhttp://eepurl.com/hSCQRv",

Isn't it inconsistent of Charismatics to claim that \"God can heal\" and not be able to perform healings on command? Actually, I don't think so. I am compelled that the Gift of healing operates in the same way that it did in the first century. The Apostles were able to heal some and not others.  As a charismatic myself I find it necessary to answer this question that I hear lobbed my way with great frequency. In this episode, I explain why charismatic Christians can't heal everyone, and why that is consistent with acts of the apostles in the first century. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "Do Christians become Gods? Explaining Theosis with Michael Reardon\n\nWhat does it mean to be a partaker of the divine nature? What does it mean to have the life of Jesus manifest in our bodies? What does it mean to grow up into mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ? Well, the ancient church called it Theosis. In short, theosis is the deification of the Church. But in what way and to what end is the church deified? As an evangelical protestant, hearing the phrase “deification” causes an involuntary Gag reflex deep within me. However, after a good bit of study, I don’t think the doctrine of “sanctification” is sufficient to express all that Christ has provided for us. There may be something in the doctrine of theosis that evangelical protestants may want to rediscover. \n\nIn this episode, my new friend Michael Reardon is with us to discuss the doctrine of Theosis, with a special emphasis on Ecclesiological Theosis. Michael is the Professor of Biblical Languages and Religious Thought at Canada Christian College in Ontario. I had the privilege of sitting in on Michael’s presentation at ETS this year and thought he would be great to have on the show. \n\n\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Wellspring\nhttps://wellspringdfw.org/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Gospel Of Mark Group Packets \nhttps://the-remnant-radio.creator-spring.com/listing/the-gospel-of-mark-workbooks",

Is this some kind of magical \"fountain of youth\" in biblical literature or is this somehow a symbol pointing us to Christ.

    "description": "In this episode we define church discipline as \"a form of punishment practiced publicly in the body of Christ aimed at the restoration of a church member that is in active rebellion against God’s word and commands. Church discipline is not the prohibition of an individual from attending meetings or church gatherings, rather it is a formal act of removing someone from church membership thus prohibiting them from partaking of the sacramental rights of believers for their own good and God’s Glory.\" We dive into the popular teachings of Matthew 18 where Jesus explicitly teaches church discipline and 1 Corinthians 5 where Paul explicitly practices church discipline. This is a much-needed show in the west, where our houses of worship have become social clubs due to a lack of church discipline.\n\nABOUT THE REMNANT RADIO:\n📺 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL @theremnantradio.com\n📧 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER www.theremnantradio.com\n📚 COURSES & CONFERENCES www.theremnantradio.com\n💝 SUPPORT OUR MINISTRY: \n• Become a Patron: patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio \n• Tax-Deductible Giving: paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6",

The Pursuit Conference is a pastors conference geared toward training pastors on how to train their churches in the gifts of the Spirit. This panel does not tackle the deep theological questions of the gifts, rather it was meant to dive into the practice outworkings of the gifts of the Spirt in a local church. We want to give pastors on-ramps on how they can encourage their churches to practice and train the gifts of the Spirit in their churches in safe and obtainable ways.  This was just a perfect collection of friends to accomplish that task. Sam Storms and Jack Deere are both spiritual gifts vets who have been training churches and establishing a healthy culture of gifts for decades, while Matt Chandler and Jeff Wells are comparatively, new at developing this culture in their local Churches. We were honored to host this panel. We look forward to doing it again!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes",

Regardless of its origins, Halloween has become a massively popular holiday, that idolizes sexuality, drunkenness, gore, and horror. Should Christians practice it today? If Halloween is indeed bad, can't we just replace it with “fall festivals” in church parking lots?

Well, you gnosticize that mug. \n\nLook, I believe God still speaks today outside of scripture. I don't think that it is impossible or even unlikely that God would speak to you as you read the Bible. However, there has been this novel form of preaching and Bible reading that has been circulating In the charismatic movement that looks a great deal like Gnosticism, and this kind of reading Is really hurting people. \n\nWe have no plans of bride bashing or bullying people who preach differently than we do. but we do hope to bring up some serious concerns and we hope that it can help those who are not even aware of the dangers. \n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Wellspring\nhttps://wellspringdfw.org/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nConference\nhttp://propheticreformationokc.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKairos Classroom: Use Promo Code Remnant for 10% off\nhttps://kairosclassroom.com/classes",

    "description": "Kenosis: What Did Christ Empty? - It just seemed too incredible for modern rational and ‘scientific’ people to believe that Jesus Christ could be truly human and fully, absolutely God at the same time. The kenosis theory began to sound more and more like an acceptable way to say that (in some sense) Jesus was God, but a kind of God who had for a time given up some of his Godlike qualities, those that were most difficult for people to accept in the modern world. Charismatic pastors and teachers have not made the conversation any easier. Guys like Todd White and Bill Johnson have used some pretty novel language when attempting to articulate kenosis theory, which has mucked up the conversation with every discernment ministry crying \"heresy\". Hopefully, this episode can shed some light on the kenosis debate and hopefully help level heads prevail.\n\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Wellspring\nhttps://wellspringdfw.org/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nConference\nhttp://propheticreformationokc.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nKenosis Study Guide\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kenosis-notes-.pdf",

Some are helpful, some are a spiritualized reading of Freud, and others are just nonsense. Whatever is a charismatic to do? \n\nWell turns out the early church fathers have writings on how we should discern VISIONS and DREAMS. So once again let us return Back To The Fathers, for some much need discernment. \n\nSo Father Ron Drummond, Matthew Esquivel, and Joshua Hoffert will be leading us, once again, through the charismatic writings of the Church Fathers. How do we interpret visions how do we interpret dreams? And is there a pattern in discerning dreams from the Lord and Dreams from Pizza? Is there a pattern in discerning visions from God or the visions from a devil? all this and more will be tackled in this episode of The Remnant Radio. \n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Wellspring\nhttps://wellspringdfw.org/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nConference\nhttp://propheticreformationokc.com/",

    "description": "NAR Vocabulary and Terminology\n\nThe New Apostolic Reformation is not a formal organization of clandestine churches but a category used by some to identify a specific sect of Charismatics. Unfortunately, the NAR is often used by heretic hunters as a derogatory catch-all for “dumb charismatics that we don't like”. \nHowever, as we have engaged with a lot of charismatic literature, we find that it is a helpful category for identifying a specific branch of hyper-charismatics. Not a group of people who are “not Christian” rather a group of Christians who hold certain extra-biblical charismatic beliefs that we believe are harmful and or a distraction for the mission of the Church. We have done episodes in the past dealing with specific NAR practices, teachings, and doctrine, but in this episode, we will specifically be tackling the NAR vocabulary. Alignment, Portals, Realms, Apostolic favor, Kingdom Finances, Strategic Spiritual Warfare, and more! \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "How the Church Fathers Balanced Liturgy & Spontaneity\n\nYou ever been in one of those services where the Spirit of God was so tangible that the staff canceled the sermon, the offering, and communion so that we could continue in worship? Well back in my pentecostal days, it wasn't all that uncommon for us to do just that. But is it a good thing to throughout the liturgy (order of service) for spontaneity? On the other hand, should we be so liturgical that there is never room for spontaneous expressions of worship? Oddly enough the Church fathers might have an answer for us. \n\nIn this episode Josh Hoffert, Matthew Esquivel, and Father Ron Drummond are doing a survey of the church fathers, looking for their balance of liturgy and spontaneity. Going to be a fun episode full of flag-waving, tambourine playing, and shofar blowing.

    "description": "The Nephilim and The Son's of God\n\nThe Bible has a whole host of characters who are hard to understand from the western mind. One of these characters are the \"sons of God\" another is the \"Nephilim\". In this episode we are answering the question \"who are the Nephilim and The Son's of God\". Mystery and debate surround the Sons of God in scripture. Are the Sons of God descendants of Seth, are the sons of God fallen angels, or are the Sons of God some kind of ancient kings. The questions spiral further out of control when you read Genesis 6 and see the Nephilim. Are the Nephilim the giants spoken of through mythology, did the Nephilim emerge from the relations of the sons of God and the daughters of men? Or were the Nephilim only landmarks for the reader to know when the events of the Son's of God happened. All this and more are covered in this episode of The Remnant Radio. Hope you enjoy it.\n\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Rowntree's Church Wellspring\nhttps://wellspringdfw.org/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nConference\nhttp://propheticreformationokc.com/",

In transitioning a church body from a cessationist to a continuationist church, they examine how pastors can build a healthy culture for exhibiting the gifts and what the Bible says about orderly use of the gifts of the Spirit. Jack Deere, formerly an associate professor of Old Testament at Dallas Theological Seminary, is a writer and lecturer who speaks on friendship with God and on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. He is the author of the bestselling book, Surprised by the Power of the Spirit.

    "description": "What Was Latter Rain Movement: With Jon Bunn\n\nThe Latter Rain Movement had its beginnings in the years following World War II and was contemporary with the evangelical awakening led by Billy Graham, as well as the Healing Revival of Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, and William Branham. In the fall of 1947, several leaders of the small Pentecostal, 'Sharon Orphanage and Schools in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, who were hungry for God were inspired to fast and pray and wait on God after visiting Rev. Branham's healing campaign that was held in the Exhibition Garden in Vancouver, Canada, where four to five thousand people packed inside to witness people being healed. They had never seen anything like it before and those at the Sharon Schools began to fast and pray for more outpourings of the Holy Spirit. Later that year, groups organized large revival events, and news quickly swept across Canada and the United States, influencing many Pentecostal believers.\n\nAs the revival died down after a few years, those who had been changed by the doctrine formed various groups which became known as \"The Latter Rain\" (Movement). The Latter Rain strongly emphasized relational networks over organizational structure. In addition, the term Latter Rain has become somewhat of a pejorative label; therefore, many ministers who were influenced by it are reluctant to make this well known. They often choose to emphasize only formal participation. Much of the movement, along with elements of the Healing Revival, slowly dissolved into parts of the larger Charismatic movement.\n\n\n\nDawsons Study Guide:\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remnant-Study-Guide-Latter-rain-2-1.pdf\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio",

    "title": "Are Christians Anti-Science? Or are Christians Anti-Naturalist?",
    "description": "Are Christians Anti-Science?\n\nDescription:\nJoin us on Remnant Radio for a riveting discussion with Ken Fish, a renowned speaker and theologian, as we delve into the crucial topics of anti-Scientism, Naturalism, Rationalism, and the profound depths of the Christian worldview. In this enlightening episode, we explore the intellectual shift in the West towards an anti-intellectualist stance, examining its detrimental impact on the Gospel's transmission and acceptance.\n\nKen Fish brings his vast knowledge and insightful perspectives to dissect how Enlightenment ideals, historical events like the Scopes Monkey Trial, and certain tendencies within Christian subculture have contributed to a growing rift between faith and reason. This conversation illuminates the often misunderstood relationship between Christianity and rational thought, challenging the prevailing naturalistic framework that seeks to explain away the supernatural.\n\n🤔 Discover the distinct differences between Rationalism and Naturalism, and understand why they are not the ultimate adversaries of Christian thought.\n🌍 Unpack the limitations of Naturalism, which insists on natural explanations for all phenomena, and see how it falls short in accounting for the full spectrum of human experience.\n🤝 Learn how Christianity and Rationalism can coexist, complementing rather than conflicting with each other.\n🙏 Witness the discussion on supernatural occurrences that defy naturalistic explanations, affirming the reality of the spiritual realm.\n🧠 Debate the reliance of Naturalism on sensory input for validation, and the implications for understanding reality beyond the physical.\n\nThis episode is not just an intellectual journey; it's a heartfelt exploration of how embracing a Christian worldview enriches our understanding of the world, challenges the status quo, and brings us closer to the truth. Ken's engaging discussion and our deep dive into these topics reveal the vibrancy of faith in dialogue with reason, offering fresh perspectives for believers and skeptics alike.\n\nWhether you're a long-time follower of Christ, a seeker of truth, or someone navigating the complexities of faith and intellect, this episode promises a compelling narrative that bridges divides and invites reflection.\n\nEnjoy this thought-provoking journey as we seek to reclaim the intellectual richness of the Christian faith, moving beyond the confines of scientism and naturalism. Blessings to you as you join us in this exploration.\n\n#RemnantRadio #KenFish #ChristianWorldview #AntiScientism #FaithAndReason #Enlightenment #Supernatural #RationalismVsNaturalism #TheologyPodcast\n\nRemember to like, share, and subscribe to Remnant Radio for more insightful discussions with pastors and teachers from diverse Christian traditions around the globe.

    "description": "An Interview With Francis Chan\n\nWhat do the POPE, TODD WHITE, AND HANK HANAGRAPH all have in common? They all know Francis Chan. Francis is a riddle wrapped in an enigma that has caught the attention of the conservative evangelical movement. As a graduate of Masters seminary and a pastor of a thriving megachurch, Francis Chan was a rising star in the conservative evangelical movement. He was a regular guest to the Passion conference, Desiring God, and IHOP's One thing, Francis was one of the most popular names on the conference circuit and amongst publishers. \n\nThat is until he started making decisions that were \"self-sabotaging\" in the eyes of western evangelicalism. Francis left his megachurch to start a network of house churches that were centered around authentic discipleship. Only to leave his now thriving home churches to do missions in China. All the while Francis begins to share stages with those on the evangelical blacklist. Who is Francis and what is driving his consciousness into the spotlight of controversy?\n\nIn this interview, we discuss everything with Francis Chan. We ask \"is Francis Chan Catholic? What does Francis believe about Justification, Are Benny Hinn and Francis Chan BFF's\" and more. Hope you all enjoy it. \n\n0:00​​ Intro\n#1 03:20​​ How did you go from Masters Seminary to IHOP?\n#2 07:31​​ Does Francis Chan Speak in tongues?\n#3 09:40​​ Why did Francis Chan Leave his Megachurch?\n#4 13:16​​ Francis Chan's experience with the Home Church Network\n#5 17:58​​ Francis Chan's experience with the Evangelical Black List\n#6 23:13​ What does Francis Chan believe about the Catholic Doctrine of Justification?\n#7 29:23 What is more important Unity or Truth?\n#8 33:13​​ When would Francis Chan separate himself from other Christians\n#9 34:51​​ Is Francis Chan willing to unify with other religions? \n#10 38:33​​ Does Francis Chan believe in transubstantiation?\n#11 41:20​ How can Francis Chan Learn and Grow from those he disagrees with?\n#12 47:14​ How Can we resist Christian Tribalism, while maintaining theological integrity?\n#13 50:13​ Why we need Discernment ministries but should be cautious of Scoffers.\n#14 51:56 Francis Chan Explains his relationship with Hank Hanegraaff\n#15 57:40 Does Francis Chan Believe in the \"little god's\" doctrine?\n#16 1:08:40 Francis Chan relationship with Benny Hinn\n#17 1:13:07 Advice John Macarthur gave Francis Chan\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "How Can I See More Miracles: Practical steps for being used by God\n\nMiraculous works of the Spirit are performed sovereignly by the Holy Spirit according to 1 Corinthians 12:11. However, it seems that some in the church are used more in manifesting these supernatural gifts. Is it possible that there is a reason some are used more than others when walking in the gifts of the Spirit? Does the Bible instruct us in ways we can be used in greater measures to display God's power? I think so. In this episode, Michael and I will be discussing Practical steps for being used by God in supernatural ways. \n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio",

We are dependent on God to lead and guide us, to speak to us, and to heal the sick among us.

    "description": "What is the New Perspective on Paul: With Matthew Bates\n\nIn this episode of Remnant Radio, Josh and Michael Rowntree interview Matthew Bates on the New Perspective on Paul.\n\nThe typical Protestant understanding of “justification by grace through faith alone” is founded on the Protestants interpretations of the Pauline letters of Galatians and Romans. Both juxtapose law and flesh against the faith and Spirit. The historic Protestant position suggests that Paul is attempting to correct a Jewish misunderstanding of justification, a justification merited by works. \n\nHowever, the “New Perspective on Paul” suggests that the issue is not about justification by works. Proponents of “the new perspective” such as E.P. Sanders suggests that first-century Palestinian Judaism was not a \"legalistic community,\" nor was it oriented to \"salvation by works.\" But that the issue Paul is addressing, is an issue of requiring gentiles to become Jewish converts before they can have access to the blessings of Christ. According to Sanders, Paul does not address good works in general but instead questions only observances such as circumcision, dietary laws, and Sabbath laws, which were the \"boundary markers\" that set the Jews apart from the other nations.\n\n\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nDawson's Study Guide\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/New-Perspective-on-Paul-.pdf\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nOur Favorite Books\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/theremnantradio",

    "description": "Testing the Prophets: Testing the Prophecies Given in 2020 - We believe in the gifts of the Spirit. But 2020 has proven that the prophets have been getting out of hand. Hundreds of prophetic words were given in 2020. And the Prophetic words given in 2020 were vague, wrong, and in some cases false. In this 8 Hour Marathon, some of the leading continuationist scholars review prophetic words given in 2020. We are not judging prophetic ministry or judging the prophets. Our goal is to test each prophetic word on its own and give our audience the tools to judge these prophetic words moving forward. Testing prophecies given in 2020 won't be easy, but it is necessary. Scripture commands us not to despise prophecy, but test it: cling to what is good, and reject that which is evil. We will be looking for good prophecies given in 2020, and we will be looking for bad prophecies given in 2020. \n\n0:00 What to expect, and our posture for the program\n#1 46:54 Dr. Brown: Why we should stop using Calendars for prophecy \n#2 1:07:24 Dr. Craig Keener Opening Statment\n#3 1:27:22 Dr. Keener reviews a word from David Herzog\n#4 1:38:40 Dr. Keener reviews Hakeem Collins' Word\n#5 1:53:42 Dr. Keener reviews James Goll's Word\n#6 2:05:14 Dr. Keener reviews Joan Hunter's Word\n#7 2:14:40 Dr. Storms reviews Chuck Pierce's Divine Interruption Word\n#8 2:23:55 Dr. Storms reviews Chuck Pierce's Coming Through the Swamp Word\n#9 2:32:39 Dr. Storms reviews Chuck Pierce's Death Toll Word\n#10 2:41:02 Dr. Storms reviews Chuck Pierce's Belt-Tightening Word\n#11 2:57:43 Ken Fish Reviews The Kim Clement Words\n#12 3:29:59 Ken Fish Addresses Why There Is So Much Prophetic Error \n#13 3:52:30 Josh & Michael Review Kenneth Copeland Words\n#14 4:21:34 Dr. Jack Deere Intro\n#15 4:25:00 Dr. Jack Deere Reviews Perry Stone Word\n#16 4:37:33 Dr. Jack Deere Reviews Kevin Zadai Word\n#17 4:55:32 Michael Miller Intro\n#18 5:15:39 Teaching on the Prophets in Jeremiah's Day\n#19 5:57:12 Joel Richardson Reviews Dana Coverstone Word\n#20 6:32:53 Mike Winger Reviews Word about the Supreme Court\n#21 7:00:42 Deut 13 & 18 Teaching\n#22 7:24:17 Call for Repentance\n\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "description": "In this episode, former New Age practitioner (now Christian believer) Steven Bancarz comes back on the show to discuss how the New age understands \"Christ Consciousness.\" \n\nChrist Consciousness is a New Age philosophy that suggests one can come to an awareness of the higher self as part of a universal system. Although it can be interpreted in a number of ways, a common understanding is that Christ Consciousness is the state of consciousness in which a person has found self-realization and unity with God or the Divine. But why do they call it \"Christ Consciousness\"? Well the New Age groups say Jesus became Christ when he came to an awareness of the Higher Self. They would say that we, like Jesus, can also become Christs when we become aware of our divinity.\n\nIn this Episode, Steven Bancarz demystifies the New Age Jesus, by comparing the new age claims of Jesus's Christ consciousness with the biblical text. \n\nHope you enjoy it. \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n#remnantradio #christconscious #christconsciousness",

A recent bit of controversy surrounds Todd due to the popularity of the American Gospel Documentary along with Todd's recent \"I Repent for not Preaching the Full Gospel\" sermon. As the spotlight turns to Todd, there is a great deal of confusion on what Todd really believes. Is he a prosperity preacher? Does he believe Jesus was only a Man? Does Todd White believe that Christians can suffer?\n\nWe had a three-hour interview with Todd White to get to the bottom of some of these serious accusations.

But did you know that God has been talking about the return of Jesus since the days of Moses? Joel Richardson, who joined us for an episode about the Islamic Antichrist, is a bestselling author who considers this his most recent book—Sinai to Zion—his best and most important work. In this episode, we’ll discuss the “lesser-known” prophecies about the return of Jesus, from the blessing of Moses to the song of Deborah to the prophecy of Enoch (quoted in the New Testament). Joel will help us see the eschatological vision that emerges from the very beginning to the very end of the Bible, where Jesus returns to lead us in a Second Exodus from the clutches of the Beast to the presence of the Lamb, and from the seduction of Babylon to the beauty of New Jerusalem.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nSinai To Zion Book\nhttps://store.joelstrumpet.com/collections/books/products/sinai-to-zion",

    "title": "Todd White: was Jesus fully God? (Does Todd White believe the Kenosis heresy?)",
    "description": "Todd White: was Jesus fully God? (the Kenosis debate)\n\nThe way we define Kenosis has such a massive impact on our Christology that it can determine whether you are ignorant, a heretic, or an orthodox Christian. For those who claim that Christ performed healings and exorcisms through his divinity come dangerously close to subordinationism (partial-Arianism). Because the bible says Christ was empowered by the Spirit to perform miracles, if these miracles were done through Christ divinity it would logically suggest that Christ divine nature was lacking and needed the empowerment of the Spirit. \n\nIf we error on the other side we come dangerously close to full-blown Arianism. because if we say Jesus stopped being God then you have a person of the trinity that does not share in the same essence (homoousios) as the Father and the Spirit. Furthermore if the Christ Jesus did everything as a man our salvation is in jeopardy, for only God can forgive sins, and only the infinite value of God's sacrificial death on the cross would be sufficient to atone for the sins of the World.\n\nHow we describe the hypostatic union (Christ being fully God and Fully Man) is an essential Christian doctrine that has been believed and practiced by every Christian for the past 2,000 Years.  If you would like to study this more I would encourage you to watch our episodes on the Chalcedonian definition, and the Nicene Creed. \n\nAlso for those having a hard time understanding the language between classical Pentecostals and reformed evangelicals on the Subject of Kenosis I would advise this clip from an interview between James White and Dr. Michael Brown. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuFhJm0v6-s&ab_channel=JoshParker\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "There is not a more Christian conversation that could be had than a conversation about the Trinity, and there is no person we would rather have that conversation with than Dr. Scott Horrell. If you are not familiar with the concept of \"eternal Subordination\" it basically boils down to how we are to understand scriptural teaching regarding the nature of the Son’s eternal relationship to the Father. Is the obedience of the Son to the Father limited merely to the incarnation, or does it also extend to the Son’s eternal relationship with the Father?\n\nIn this discussion, we will be talking about the economic Trinity alongside the economic Trinity at great lengths so that we can truly understand the relationship between the Father and the Son. So excited for this episode.

    "description": "1) What is the most common teaching of generational curses\n2) Is there any validity to sin temptations being transmitted through the family line\n3) Is there any validity to demonic bondage being transmitted through the family line\n\nOften times (not always) Generational curses are defined as \"a negative pattern manifesting in you, and or, your family due to demonic activity that was granted access by the unrepentant sins of your ancestors\". However, there is a major problem with this definition. There is no mention of demons in the \"typical generational curse\" proof texts. In Numbers 14:17-18 and Exodus 20:4-6 we find God is the one bringing the curse not demons. Why is God cursing man? Well, Scripture tells us that we are cursed if we do not abide by everything written in the Law. So by breaking God's law we are placed under a curse from God.\n\n\"But what about the Christian?\" you may ask. Well, Christ took our place and became a curse for us that the curse of the Lay may be removed from us. Praise God! But now we get into the nitty-gritty of it all. Is there a demonic activity that can be transmitted generationally? Can our habitual unrepented sins, somehow be transmitted to our children? Well if you want to know that you will have to watch the video. Hope you guys all enjoy it. \n\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

    "title": "Marcionism and Modern Marcionism",
    "description": "Marcionism and Modern Marcionism\n\nIf you are not familiar with Marcion, he is best known for his work on the text and canon of the Bible. He rejected the OT as a Christian book and collected the earliest known Christian canon, composed of an abbreviated version of Luke's Gospel and ten edited Pauline epistles (lacking the Pastorals). He presented his theological views in the Antitheses, in which he set out contradictions between the OT and the NT. His works do not survive, so his positions must be reconstructed from the refutations made by his opponents, the fullest of which is Tertullian's five books Against Marcion.\n\nMarcion was convinced that Paul was the only true apostle and that the original twelve, by ‘Judaizing', became false apostles. Galatians was placed first in his collection of Paul's letters. The opening words of the Antitheses, ‘O wealth of riches! rapture, power, amazement! seeing that there can be nothing to say about it, or to imagine about it, or to compare to it!' expresses his wonder before the Pauline gospel of grace. From Paul, Marcion deduced an exaggerated contrast between law and gospel. In agreement with his contemporary Aquila of Pontus, he practiced a literal interpretation of Scripture, rejecting all allegory. Marcion went far beyond Paul in concluding that there are two Gods: the God of the OT, the Creator, who is a God of law and justice and who predicted the Jewish Messiah; and the previously unknown God of the NT, the Father of Jesus Christ, who is a God of mercy and salvation.\n\nUnfortunately, these teachings live on in the body of Christ today. Sections of scripture, books of scripture, and at times entire testaments of scripture are looked at as inferior, uninspired, or in some extreme cases even considered fallible. So we discuss historic Marcionism so that we can have the discernment to detect the modern nuance of modern Marcionism. \n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nStudy Guide\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/marcion-Today-Study-.pdf\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nDonate (Paypal)\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nExclusive Content (Patreon)\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheRemnantRadio\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nWe're social! \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRemnantRadio\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theremnantradio/\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEven When: by StoneBridge Worship\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-rHSNgP-9E\n\nEven When Spotify Link\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/0V2UX6VBCMSHqYJpjxBJT7",

    "description": "Eastern Orthodox Theology\n\nAmericans tend to divide the Christian religion into two camps: Protestant and Catholic. But there's a third branch called \"Eastern Orthodox\" that consists of 260 million members worldwide. Many evangelicals have converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, including \"the Bible Answer Man,\" Hank Hanegraaf. CS Lewis found the church intriguing. Yet many evangelicals know hardly anything about it. And the mystery makes us skeptical.\n\nA few months ago, I read a book by Frederica Mathewes-Greene about Eastern Orthodoxy. It was beautiful. Her journey took her from Catholicism to Mainline Protestantism to Charismatic to Eastern Orthodox, where she has found her home. I don't think we should be skeptical of our differences; we should be inspired by them. I think you'll be inspired by her. We're interviewing her tonight on Remnant Radio, 8:30pm Live.\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/eastern-orthodox-theolody-.pdf\nHelp Support The Channel through a one time gift or a monthly contribution.\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEven When: by StoneBridge Worship\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-rHSNgP-9E\n\nEven When Spotify Link\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/0V2UX6VBCMSHqYJpjxBJT7\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nStudy Guide\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/eastern-orthodox-theolody-.pdf",

    "description": "is covid-19 an end times sign\n\nSome say that this global pandemic and economic collapse are not in any way related to the “end times” events as they are portrayed in the Bible, and specifically, in Jesus’ Olivet Discourse. Others say that these are two very significant signs, directly spelled out by our Lord Himself. In this episode, Pastor Brad Stroup will walk us through \"the twelve trends” or signs in Matthew 24, corroborating this text with other parts of Scripture as well.\n\nWe have recently been hosting a variety of End Times perspectives, and Brad Stroup brings a fresh one for our prayerful consideration. Pastor Brad is the overseer of The Prayer Room in Dallas-Fort Worth, which is connected to the global prayer movement spearheaded by Mike Bickle. The Prayer Room operates with live prayer and praise, 20 hours a day, 7 days a week. End Times teaching is a major dimension of his ministry because Pastor Brad believes that God is raising up a movement of prayer and worship to usher in the return of our Lord.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nHelp Support The Channel through a one time gift or a monthly contribution.\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEven When: by StoneBridge Worship\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-rHSNgP-9E\n\nEven When Spotify Link\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/0V2UX6VBCMSHqYJpjxBJT7\n____________________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "In this episode, Dr. Sam Storms discusses the Amillennial perspective of the end times. He begins by clarifying that “Amillennial” is a bit of a misnomer – since he does, in fact, believe in a Millennium. It just looks different than the “literalistic” view of Historic Premillennialism. On that note, he talks through the hermeneutic to employ when interpreting apocalyptic literature—how do we know when to understand things literally or figuratively? Dr. Storms responds to the major objections to Amillennialism, he explains in detail why he is not Premillennial, and he makes a biblical case for Amillennialism. All of this is couched in his own personal journey away from Premillennialism (which his seminary taught strongly) and toward Amillennialism. If you’re interested in the end times and want to understand the biblical teaching more, you won’t want to miss this episode. Even if you don’t agree with all of Dr. Storms’ points, you’ll certainly find that he goes to the Bible to support his beliefs.\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com",

Each guest will also need 4 cups of grape juice or wine.\n\n*Charoset is a mixture of apples, nuts, honey, raisins, and wine and represents and is the consistency of mortar.\n\n*The white napkin is used to wrap and hide what is called the \"afikomen.\" Later in the meal, the children search for it and return it the head of the table for a prize or treat of some kind (If you have children present, please also include something to reward them for finding the \"afikomen\").\n\n\nTHE MEAL OF YOUR CHOICE\nFeel free to make your family the dinner of your choice.

    "description": "In this episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis and Michael Rowntree will talk to Matthew Esquivel about “contemplative prayer”.  Matthew will explain contemplative prayer as understood by two spiritual heavyweights in church history; Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. Using scripture and the guidance from Teresa and John, Matthew seeks to distinguish between the New Age views of contemplative prayer and the kind contemplative prayer within the Christain tradition. While tying this ancient practice into the “soaking\" emphasis we see in the modern charismatic church. To do this, Matthew references the autobiography of Teresa and her first Spiritual Testimony while bringing in John’s teachings on the subject as they often complement one another. The guys will consider the practices of vocal prayer and silent prayer, looking at the different contemplatives understanding of each, while seeking to understand how we might find some balance between the two categories of prayer.\n\nThis episode will also discuss different types of \"prayer\" as taught by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. Such as the Prayer of recollection, the prayer of quiet, the prayer of rapture, And the prayer of union. As well as the different types of visions and locutions one may experience in these different types of prayer. Other topics touched on are on the role of visions, hearing God, and having supernatural encounters in one’s journey towards greater union with God.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHelp Support The Channel through a one time gift or a monthly contribution.\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nStudy Guide:\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Contemplative-prayer.pdf\n\nSelected Readings:\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Autobiography-and-Testimony-of-Teresa-of-Avila.pdf\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEncounter Jesus School: Storehouse Church\nhttps://www.storehousedallas.com/ejs",

    "description": "New Age and the Charismatic Movement: With Steven Bancarz\n\nIn this episode, my friend Steven Bancarz came on the show to discuss New Age beliefs that are masquerading as a Christian world view. We spoke new age practices such as astral projection, tarot cards, positive confession and more. \n\nTHIS IS NOT AN ANTI CHARISMATIC/PENTECOSTAL VIDEO.\nin this video, we only discuss the aberrant patterns of some popular but not normative views within the pentecostal-charismatic movement. Steven and I both believe the gifts of the Spirit are for today. Steven and I had a blast doing this episode and I plan to have him back soon to discuss more. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "Annihilationism: Rethinking Hell With Chris Date\n\nAnnihilationism is the belief that the wicked will cease to exist after the final judgment. Conditionalism goes an extra step beyond annihilationism to clarify why mankind can not survive eternally in the lake of fire. In this episode, Chris Date comes on the show to explain why the wicked will be annihilated at the final judgment because of the conditional state of eternal life. His uses the resurection of the dead, the nature of humanities mortality, and the atonement of Jesus Christ to articulate his possition of conditionalism.

    "title": "Gnosticism: Why History Repeats Itself",
    "description": "Gnosticism was an ancient cult that merged greek myth, biblical stories, and platonic philosophy into a religion that did not reflect Christianity in the slightest. However, this gnostic cult influenced much of the early church. Had it not been for Irenaus work on \"Against Heresies\" we would know little of Gnosticism. Fortunately, Irenaeus' work would allow us to identify the recently discovered Nag Hammadi text as gnostic literature. Books such as the gospel of Thomas, the gospel of Judas, or the secret gospel of John would have never been identified as gnostic had it not been for Irenaeus. \n\nNow that we know what gnosticism is, we find it shocking that we see proto (or early) gnosticism surounding us in mondern Chrisindom. In this episode we will discuss the gnostic myth, identify key theological distinctives such as dualism, antanomianism, and asseticism. Then we will conclude our episode talking about how we see these paterns in chrisindom today.

    "description": "Christians ought to submit to the authority given to us by Christ, Pastors, elders, teachers, etc. But what happens when those in authority teach things contrary to the Word of God? Is there a higher court to which we can appeal? The answer is yes. The appeal is the appeal of sola scriptura. \n\n\"Sola Scriptura\" is a phrase that sounds foreign to western ears. In Latin, the phrase  means \"only Scripture\" or \"Scripture alone.\" It was one of the five Solas articulated by the Protestant Reformation. \n\nBut what is the significance of this phrase? \n\nSola Scriptura is the idea that the Bible is the final authority on what Christians believe and how we live. In this video,  Dr. Jordan Cooper from the \"Just & Sinner\" podcast is coming on the show to help us understand the growing need for sola scriptura in our day. We will also give some biblical reasons to support Sola Scriptura and deal with some Catholic rebuttals to it.

    "description": "In this episode of The Remnant Radio my two buddies Josh Hoffert and Matthew Esquivel Join Micheal Roundtree and me to discuss the hermeneutical pattern of Origen of Alexandria. Tonight we will ask questions like \"How did Origen read the bible, was Origen's pattern of hermeneutics unique to the culture he lived in, and how was it that Origen's patter of hermeneutics was able to so greatly impact the early church. It is well known that Origen saw a \"spiritual meaning\" beyond the plain reading of the text. Is this something Christians should likewise strive for, or is this something we should avoid?\" We will discuss this and more tonight on Remnant Radio. \n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nHelp Support The Channel through a one time gift or a monthly contribution.\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSummery of Origen’s hermeneutical approach.\nDescription of Origen’s hermeneutical approach.\n“He thought that Scripture had three different, yet complementary, meanings; (1) a\nliteral or physical sense, (2) a moral or psychical sense, and (3) an allegorical or\nintellectual sense. The threefold sense was based upon his belief in a corresponding\nthreefold division of mankind” (1) the physical, (2) the emotional or psychical, and\n(3) the spiritual or intellectual.”\n\nDavid Dockery, Biblical Interpretation (Baker Grand Rapids, 2000) 88.\nOrigen’s threefold division was derived from his view of humanity:\n“Just as human beings consist of body, soul and spirit, so also do the Scriptures.\nThe bodily sense of a text was either the historical or literal meaning. The soulish\nmeaning of a text contained a figurative exhortation to avoid vice and grow in\nvirtue. It was the moral or ethical teaching. The third level was the spiritual\nmeaning of Scripture. It contained the allegorical sense which was the most\nprofound level appropriate to God and humanity. It reveals God’s plan of salvation\nthrough Christ’s incarnation. But it is known only to a mature group of elite\nbelievers...”\n\nBradley Nassif, “Origen,” Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters,\ned. Donald K. McKim, (Downers Grove: IVP Academic, 2007), 789\nNassif ’s full article in appendix A\n\nOrigen’s general interpretive principles:\n“First, every text is pregnant with profound mysteries and should be discovered\nthrough allegory. Second, nothing should be said of God which is unworthy of\nhim. Third, each text was to be interpreted in the light of the rest of Scripture.\nFinally, nothing contrary to the rule of faith was to be affirmed.”\n\nDockery, Biblical Interpretation, 89.\nDockery references church historian\nJusto L.

If you don't know what Apostolic succession is, basically its the idea that throughout history there is an uninterrupted transmission of spiritual authority from the Apostles through successive popes and bishops, often taught by Roman Catholics friends. In part one we established where the line of Apostles has come from, and how it operates in the Anglican tradition. Looking to pick up where this one left off. \n\nHowever, our brother Keith belongs to Anglican Church. Anglicans are a protestant denomination who also participates the ancient tradition of apostolic succession.

    "title": "The Second Blessing Debate: Two Views of Spirit Baptism",
    "description": "The Second Blessing Debate: Two Views of Spirit Baptism\n\nIn classical pentecostalism, the \"second blessing\" comes when the Baptism of the Spirit occurs. Within this framework this baptism is a subsequent experience following conversion, where the believer is endued with power from on high, evidenced by speaking in tongues. Pentecostals teach that All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Spirit and fire, according to the command of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n\nIn mainline denominations and across much of evangelicalism, the \"baptism of the Spirit\" is a baptism into Christ's body that occurs at the moment of salvation. Though many of the conservative evangelicals believe in the gifts of the Spirit, they do not believe that a secondary experience is necessary to be endued with power for on high. Rather Christ's salvation brought all thing necessary for a life of Godliness\n\nBoth of these positions are orthodox Christian beliefs, but only one of them is true. Representing the classical pentecostal position of \"the second blessing\" Pastor Todd  Barham will be giving a 15min presentation of why the classical pentecostal view is a biblical-theological view. \n\nFollowing Pastor Todd, our buddy Michael Miller will be giving a 15 min presentation on why the traditional evangelical view of \"baptism of the spirit\" is the correct biblical position. \n\nNo debates, no cross-examination, 30 min of presentation and then live Q&A from the audience.  I can't wait to see where this conversation takes us. Going to be a fun night Hope you enjoy it.\n\n#remnantradio #theologydiscussion #theologydebate \n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHow to use the Bible for all its worth\nhttps://amzn.to/2vM59VR",

What exactly does the millennium look like, is there going to be a pre-tribulation rapture, Who is the antichrist and where will he come from? Well, our friend Ken Fish is coming on the show to answer one of the more mysterious eschatological questions, What is the abomination of desolation? Ken thinks he has the answer.\n\nKen tracks the prophecy from Daniel all the way into church history. The discussion spans issues of the temple mount the religion of Islam the nature of the temple as well as the sacrificial system discussed in the prophecy.  Did the Knights Templar establish or did it happen when the Dome of the rock was established in the Middle Ages?\n \nDispelling the common idea that the first reference of the prophecy was about the Seleucid king Antiochus Epiphanes IV, who ruled Palestine from 175-64 B.C. When Antiochus l came to suppress a rebellion, his forces entered the temple, he stopped the regular sacrifices, set up an idol for Zeus, and offered swine there as a sacrifice. This is an abomination because it is idolatry, and it brings desolation because it defiles the holy place at the heart of Israel. But does it fit the time line? Is it an act that was an abomination “causing” desolation?

    "title": "False Conversions",
    "description": "False Conversions seems to be a topic of interest in the church. Some are concerned with the lack of faithfulness, others seem concerned with the lack of faith. There are groups whose sole purpose in life is to hunt down all the heretics in the world and assert their own superiority over them. Other groups don't care at all what you believe or how you live. If you say you are Christian they will give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nTrying to understand these matters can be difficult. It is not our job to determine who is saved and who is not. However, if someone is lost and they are convinced they are saved, shouldn't we know how to speak truth into that space? Do you have a hard time trying to figure out who is a real convert and who is not? \n\nIn this episode of remnant Radio, Evangelist Levi Luts will be with us. We are discussing unregenerate Christians, false conversions, and deceptive gospels that are leading people away from faith in Christ. This can be a divisive topic, but it does not need to be. Being able to identify \"fake Christians\" is not a means of painting a guilt target on their back. However, being able to discern who is not of the faith gives us a beautiful opportunity to speak gospel life into those spaces. This is going to be a great episode, hope you enjoy.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\n\nTrue and False Religion: John Owen\n23.98 https://amzn.to/37ZbHyu\n\nReligious Affections: Johnathan Edwards\n$19.80 https://amzn.to/37WrUV2\n\nSpiritual Refining: The Anatomy of True and False Conversion by Anthony Burgess\n46.95 https://amzn.to/37TCIDa\n\nKnowing the Heart: Jonathan Edwards on True and False Conversion\n$75.00 https://amzn.to/2NglqIw\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nHelp Support Remnant Radio\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nPrimer on Conversion\n\n9Marks The Underestimated Doctrine of Conversion FREE EBOOK\nhttps://bit.ly/39Zw00o\n\nBiblical Training: Doctrine of Conversion\nhttps://bit.ly/2QNgmOi\n\nBible Study Tools: Doctrine of Conversion\nhttps://bit.ly/2tc3I25\n\nSam Storms Blog: Jonathan Edwards & the Theology of Revival \nhttps://bit.ly/2R7fbbo\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "In this episode of The Remnant Radio, we are discussing conversionism. conversionism In religious terms, this refers to the sudden and dramatic experience with God, which brings about a profound change in a person's religious status. For example, in Protestant, evangelical Christianity, there is an emphasis on the personal and emotional experience of God, and thus on the importance of conversion. So we will be discussing Prayer of salvation, Altar Calls, and crusades and their place within Christianity. Looking forward to being with my buddy Jared Horton in the studio.

We dialogue about the most popular views of communion. such as The views of transubstantiation, consubstantiation, and the view of real presence. The view that the sacraments are simply symbolic is something that we briefly dispell. We, in fact, focus our discussion on the mystical reality of Christ's presence that is present in the sacraments of communion and baptism. \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "We are discussing Moral Therapeutic Deism, the dangers of MTD, and how you are witnessing it every day and don't even know it.\n\nWhat is your aim? Do you aspire to be a better spouse, father, mother, or coworker? Moral therapeutic deism can get you there. Just follow these 3 easy steps and it will change your whole life. Trust in yourself, work really hard, and surround yourself with others who trust themselves and who also work really hard. These self-help steps are at the core of moral therapeutic deism. \n\nSound a little fishy? Unfortunately, this \"do more Christianity\" is pervasive in pragmatic consumerism. Somehow it has found its way into our churches. Moral therapeutic deism is waging war on the gospel and most Christians can't even detect this silent killer. So in this episode of Remnant Radio Josh Lewis and Michael Miller will explain how we can read the bible in a way that removes us from the center of the Gospel and places Christ as its cornerstone. Debunking moral therapeutic deism isn't hard, but be warned, once you learn what it is you won't be able to stop seeing it!\n\nWe have all been guilty at times for practicing moral therapeutic deism at one time or another. However, most of us have been completely unaware of this deeply sinful practice due to our western world view. In this episode, we are going to give easy pointers to identify \"do more Christianity\" and the pervasive moral therapeutic deism. We will also hope to encourage you with practices that can help you identify christ-centered bible reading and preaching.\n\nFreedom from a works-based religion produces rest and assurance in Christ's finished work. I can't wait to talk with you all this Monday at 8:30PM CST.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHelp Support The Channel\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMoralistic Therapeutic Deism comes from sociologist Christian Smith\nIt is a combination of beliefs producing a General religious outlook in American teens. Five core beliefs make up what is believed.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMoralistic \nmoralistic because it “is about inculcating a moralistic approach to life. It teaches that central to living a good and happy life is being a good, moral person.”\n\nTherapeutic\n\nTherapeutic means it is “about providing therapeutic benefits to its adherent” Thus it is not about things like “repentance from sin, of keeping the Sabbath, of living as a servant of a sovereign divine, of steadfastly saying one's prayers, of faithfully observing high holy days, of building character through suffering ...”\n\nDeism \nDeism is the \"belief in a particular kind of God: one who exists, created the world and defines our general moral order, but not one who is particularly personally involved in one's affairs—especially affairs in which one would prefer not to have God involved.\"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMoral Therapeutic Deism promotes individualism, perpetuates materialism, and tolerates disengaged apathy. As a result of these factors, we are more willing to believe in peace than to live peacefully, to believe inequality more than to treat others equally, to believe in promises of abundance more than to work to create abundance for all, to believe in a friendly divine benefactor interested in our well-being more than to concern ourselves with justice for others.” \n\nA church inward focuses and not mission-focused.\nMoralistic Therapeutic Deism has little to do with God or a sense of divine mission in the world. It offers comfort, bolsters self-esteem, helps solve problems, and lubricates interpersonal relationships by encouraging people to do good, feel good, and keep God at arm’s length.\n\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Moral-Theraputic-Deism.pdf",

    "description": "Dr. Michael Heiser is back to discuss demons and the evil spirits found in Scripture. The storyline of the Bible presents a populated spiritual world, full of creatures who are in rebellion against their Creator, just like humans. For lots of fascinating reasons, our modern conceptions of these spiritual rebels are based on serious misunderstandings of the Bible. So let’s go back to the book of Genesis and start over as we learn about the powers of spiritual evil in the story of the Bible.\n\nWe will discuss what the scriptures say about Satan and demons. We will talk about the governmental structure of these rulers of darkness, and hopefully, we will have time to discuss demon possession and the spiritual warfare Christians are commanded to participate in. \n\n#remnantradio #michaelheiser #demonology #demons #genesis6 #bookofgenesis \n\n🌐📧 Visit our Website & Subscribe to our Newsletter: https://www.theremnantradio.com\n\nEarly Church fathers thoughts on angels and demons\nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Angels-Demon-in-Early-Church-Fathers.pdf",

Of course,\nChristian monotheism goes against any literal \"god making\" of believers. Rather, the NT\nspeaks of a transformation of mind, a metamorphosis of character, a redefinition of\nselfhood, and an imitation of God. Most of these passages are tantalizingly brief, and\nnone spells out the concept in detail.\n\nDeification was an important idea in the early church, though it took a long time for\n[theosis] to emerge as the standard label for the process. The term was coined by the\ngreat fourth-century theologian, Gregory of Nazianzus. Theologians now use theosis to\ndesignate all instances where any idea of taking on God's character or being\n\"divinized\" (made divine) occurs, even when the term [theosis] is not used. And of\ncourse, different Christian authors understood deification differently.\n It is difficult to define theosis, but not difficult to cite several biblical passages that\nstrongly suggest a process of heightened reflection of godly nature, which stimulated\nChristian deification discourse. The following grouping of biblical passages is meant to\nbring out the logical development of the idea:\n\nTo read more about the history and doctrine of theosis folow the link below. \nhttps://theremnantradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Theosis.pdf\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWebsite: https://www.TheRemnantRadio.com\nSubscribe to Newsletter: https://theremnantradio.beehiiv.com/subscribe\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

We will be focusing on the \"slain in the Spirit\" phenomenon in the pentecostal charismatic movement. Is being slain in the Spirit a biblical practice, is it a new age phenomenon that has crept into the church, or is it something new that God is doing in the church?\n\nIs being \"Slain in the Spirit\" a real experience? Is it supported by scripture? Is it possible for someone to lay hands on you and you fall backward uncontrollably into possibly a convulsion? What does the Bible have to say about this experience that is so prevalent in the charismatic community? Is being slain in the Spirit in the bible? In this theology podcast, we present a Biblical and robust examination for the slain in the spirit phenomenon. While some say it’s demonic, kundalini, or pure emotion, Remnant Radio gives a Biblical examination of this manifestation.\n\nSCRIPTURES YOU CAN CHECK OUT\n2 Chronicles 5:14\n2 Chronicles 7:2\n1 Kings 8:11\nEzekiel 1:28\nDaniel 8:17-18\nDaniel 10:9-12\nLuke 9:32\nJohn 18:6\nActs 26:13-14\nRevelation 1:17\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHelp Support The Channel\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GC2Z86XHHG4X6\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSHOW RESOURCES \n\nMike Bickle (CHURCH HISTORY)\nhttps://mikebickle.org/articles/pdfs/The_Manifestations_of_the_Spirit_in_Church_History.pdf",

    "description": "Why We Practice The Gifts Of The Spirit\n\nIn this video, we discuss the 5 reasons why we practice the gifts of the Spirit. Though this is not to be used as a rock-solid argument against cessationism, we hope this can encourage those who are looking for answers about the gifts of the Spirit. \n\nFirst, we discuss how the apostles and the early church used the gifts of the spirit, so we have a president set forth in scripture. Both those in leadership and those in membership have access to the spiritual gifts that God provides.\n\nNext, we discuss how the new testament church is encouraged to use the gifts for the edification of everyone. Paul tells us to earnestly desire spiritual gifts, especially that we would prophesy.\n\nThird, we talked about how Paul commands us not to forbid speaking in tongues, and also tells us not to despise prophecy. How can we follow the commands of scripture to desire spiritual gifts if the gifts have ceased? How are we supposed to obey the command to \"not forbid prophecy\" or \"do not forbid speaking in tongues\" if the gifts are not for the church today? \n\nForth, the gifts of the spirit are for the edification of the church. They are good for the body, the gifts edify, educate, supply the needs of the church, and build the faith of those who are being ministered to. \n\nFinally, we discussed how the gifts of the spirit have never ceased from the historical record. The gifts of the spirit have been used throughout history.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

These Complementarian vs Egalitarians conversations have been quite enlightening, all of us here at remnant radio thought we had heard all the arguments. However,  our guest are constantly bringing things to light that we have not yet considered.\n\nIn this episode, Dr. Craig Keener comes on the show as an egalitarian to discuss, why Women aught to preach to teach and hold offices of leadership in the church. He explains how the arguments of presupposition used in complementarianism is the same presuppositionalism that caused specific groups of slaveholders to condone slavery. Dr. Keener makes the case for women in ministry by looking at the historical context of the letters that seemingly condemn women in ministry.

BRIAN “HEAD” WELCH, was born June 19, 1970, and grew up in Bakersfield, California. He found his calling at age eleven when he picked up his first guitar. Voracious practicing and a steady diet of hard rock classics filled in the ensuing years, and shortly after high school, he co-founded a metal band named Korn. The band soon became a Grammy award-winning, multi-platinum force that shot to the top tier of the rock world and dominated the new metal movement of the late Nineties. Korn’s 1998 Follow the Leader album cemented the band as rock titans when they debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, fighting off new releases from mainstream heavyweights Dr. Dre and Celine Dion. For his efforts with Korn, Head received six Grammy nominations, winning two, while selling some 40 million records worldwide. \n\nAfter becoming a born again Christian, Welch left the band in 2005 to focus on life as a father and to pursue his own solo career. He released his debut Christian album, Save Me from Myself, in 2008. He reunited with Korn on-stage at the Carolina Rebellion on May 5, 2012 for the first time in seven years",

Gender does not merely represent a social construct but, instead, represents a reality present in every human from birth. Men and women are not interchangeable. From the opening pages of Scripture, we find that God, in His wisdom and providence, created two complementary sexes for our good and His glory. In light of His good created order, and the fact that men and women both share in divine image bearing, God intends for men and women to have different yet complementary roles and responsibilities in the church and home.\n\nThese role distinctions do not arise from cultural definitions of masculinity and femininity but are an integral part of God’s plan for humanity, as revealed in Scripture. We should recognize them as God’s grace to men and women, protecting, preserving and practicing them for His glory, our joy and for the sake of human flourishing. \nhttps://thevillagechurch.net/Content/ExternalSite/Documents/Beliefs/Institute%20-%202017%20-%20The%20Role%20of%20Women%20at%20The%20Village%20Church%20-%20Full%20Version.pdf\n\nEgalitarianism Definition:\nIs the theological view that not only are all people equal before God in their personhood, but there are no gender-based limitations of what functions or roles each can fulfill in the home, the church, and the society. It is sometimes referred to as biblical equality. Egalitarians understand the Bible as teaching the fundamental equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic groups, all economic classes, and all age groups, based on the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. It should not be confused with secular political, economic, social egalitarianism.",

    "description": "In this episode of The Remnant Radio, hosts Joshua Lewis and Michael Miller are joined by Dr. Sam Storms for an in-depth exploration of the gift of tongues, often referred to as heavenly languages. Dr. Storms, an acclaimed theologian and author, brings his scholarly insights and biblical expertise to the discussion, providing clarity on one of the most debated spiritual gifts.\n\nIn this episode, we tackle key questions, including:\n1) Are heavenly languages always known languages?\n2) Is it appropriate to speak in tongues publicly?\n3) Did Simon the Sorcerer witness the apostles imparting the gift of tongues to the Samaritans?\n4) Are heavenly languages the initial physical evidence of the Spirit's baptism?\n\nDr. Storms has recently released a book on heavenly languages, which stands out as one of the most thorough and thoughtful works on the subject. His commitment to biblical fidelity and practical guidance offers listeners a balanced perspective on the practice and theology of tongues.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Dr. Storms emphasizes the importance of pursuing a heavenly prayer language while maintaining unity within the body of Christ, avoiding the creation of two classes of Christians: the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots.\" His approach encourages believers to earnestly seek spiritual gifts while adhering to scriptural parameters.\n\nJoin us for an enlightening discussion that challenges misconceptions, deepens understanding, and inspires a renewed pursuit of spiritual gifts within the church.

    "title": "Does the Bible Have a Spiritual Meaning? Understanding the Dangers of Spiritualizing Scripture",
    "description": "We explore the controversial practice of spiritualizing Scripture, where revelatory interpretations, often called \"Rhema words\" or \"fresh bread,\" are derived from biblical texts. While common in some charismatic circles, this approach can lead to significant theological errors. By grounding their analysis in sound hermeneutics, they emphasize the importance of understanding Scripture within its original context to avoid these pitfalls.\n\nIn this episode, Joshua and Michael highlight the dangers of overemphasizing certain texts at the expense of their intended meaning. They illustrate this with examples such as interpreting David’s five stones as symbolic of the fivefold ministry or viewing Paul’s encounter with the snake in Acts as a metaphor for revival. While these interpretations can be creative, they often distort the true message of Scripture and mislead believers. Joshua and Michael stress the critical distinction between exegesis, which draws out the text's original meaning, and eisegesis, which imposes external ideas onto the text.\n\nJoshua and Michael also share personal reflections on their experiences with spiritualizing Scripture, explaining how they have come to appreciate the importance of context in biblical interpretation. They emphasize that while Scripture is spiritually discerned, teaching must align with the text's historical and literary context. Misusing Scripture in a revelatory manner can lead to false teachings, harm congregants' faith, and ultimately undermine the authority of God's Word.\n\nListeners are invited to engage with the content by calling in during the live show to share their own experiences and questions related to spiritualizing Scripture. This interactive segment provides a platform for community learning and support, allowing for a broader discussion on the real-life consequences of misinterpreting biblical texts.\n\nTo conclude the episode, Joshua and Michael underscore the need for pastors and teachers to distinguish between personal prophetic insights and authoritative scriptural teaching. They caution against using narrative texts as primary sources for spiritual lessons without acknowledging their historical and literary context. By advocating for sound exegesis, they aim to equip listeners with the tools to discern and apply Scripture correctly in their spiritual lives.\n\nDon't miss this essential episode of Remnant Radio, where deep theological discussions meet practical insights.

    "description": "In this episode of Remnant Radio, Joshua Lewis and Michael Miller engages in a thought-provoking conversation with Dr. Jack Deere about the profound topic of being filled with the Spirit. Contrary to common misconceptions, Dr. Deere offers a nuanced perspective on what it truly means to be filled with the Holy Spirit, drawing from extensive biblical scholarship and personal experience.\n\nDr. Jack Deere, a seasoned theologian, author, and former seminary professor, joins the discussion by sharing his journey from skepticism to belief in the gifts of the Spirit. He recounts his transformation from a cessationist viewpoint to a vibrant faith in the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit, highlighted by miraculous healings and profound spiritual experiences.\n\nThroughout the episode, Dr. Deere meticulously explores various scriptural references to being \"filled with the Spirit\", particularly in the writings of Luke and Acts. He clarifies the distinction between different terms such as \"filled with the Spirit,\" \"baptized with the Spirit,\" and \"full of the Spirit,\" and how they relate to empowering believers for evangelistic witness and prophetic testimony.\n\nDr. Deere also addresses the experiences of John the Baptist, Elizabeth, Zechariah, and the early apostles, emphasizing how their encounters with the Holy Spirit enabled them to boldly proclaim the gospel, often in the face of hostile audiences. He provides a compelling argument that being filled with the Spirit is not about general empowerment for Christian living but a specific, repeatable, temporary empowering for evangelistic testimony.\n\nThe conversation is rich with theological insights, practical examples, and personal stories, making it a must-watch for anyone interested in deepening their understanding of the Holy Spirit's work in the life of a believer.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this enlightening discussion, challenging traditional views and encouraging a more biblically grounded approach to the work of the Holy Spirit.",

    "description": "Classical Apologetics: With Dr. Ken Samples\n\nIn this theology podcast Kenneth R. Samples (a scholar from Reasons to Believe) joins Josh Lewis on The Remnant Radio to discuss the classical Apologetic arguments. We discuss the Cosmological Argument, the Teleological argument, the Ontological argument, the Moral Argument, the Transcendental Argument, and Presuppositional Arguments.\n\nCosmological argument – Argues that the existence of the universe demonstrates that God exists. Various primary arguments from cosmology and the nature of causation are often offered to support the cosmological argument.\n\nTeleological argument – Argues that there is a purposeful design in the world around us, and a design requires a designer.\n\nOntological argument – Argues that the very concept of God demands that there is an actual existent God.\n\nMoral Argument – Argues that there are objectively valid moral values, and therefore, there must be an absolute from which they are derived.\n\nTranscendental Argument – Argues that all our abilities to think and reason require the existence of God.\n\nPresuppositional Arguments – Argues that the basic beliefs of theists and non-theists require God as a necessary precondition.\n\nAs a Reasons to Believe scholar Ken has a great passion to help people understand and see the truth and relevance of Christianity's truth-claims. His writings and lectures at Reasons to Believe focus on showing how the great doctrinal truths of the faith (the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Atonement, creation ex nihilo, salvation by grace, etc.) are uniquely compatible with reason. This approach reflects the historic Christian apologetic statement - \"faith seeking understanding.\" To listen to more from Ken, visit his website at reasons.org\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

We discussed the hunger of discipleship, the necessity of discipleship, and how we can both disciple and be disciplined in the 21st century. \n\nFor those of you who need an introduction, Joel has been a prophetic voice to his generation for over a decade. God has used him to affect the lives of countless young people, mentor thousands of leaders, and ignite a passion for Jesus in the heart of a generation. He is best known for his leadership of the 220 youth movement (Bethany Church, BR, LA) where over 7000 kids were discipled weekly. He has served as a campus pastor, executive pastor, and now Joel Stockstill heads up the prophetic department at Gateway Church under the leadership of Pastor Robert Morris.\n\nLevi Lutz is no stranger to the show. Levi is a traveling evangelist with a true heart for souls. From the pulpit to the street corner I have personly witnessed Levi's unwavering commitment to souls.

Well, I'll give you a hint. His last name is \"Christ\" he has the power of flight, and he can heal leopards.\n\nNo, but seriously, in this episode of Lunchtime theologians, Josh Lewis, Jeff Gray, and Michael Mitchell talk about the heretical doctrines that surfaced during the early church, and how the early creeds of the church combated these heresies.

This Episode of The Remnant Radio we continue our discussion on Systematic Theology. \n\nWe were cut off last week and were unable to talk about God's imminence and his Transcendence. So we start the show off discussing Gods Trancendence and God's Imminence and we briefly discuss the creation. However, most of this episode is dedicated to the discussion of Trinitarian theology at great lengths.  \n\nWhat are the dangers of the Arianistic Heresy, Sabelianistic Heresy, and the modalistic heresy? Are the son and the spirit created by the father? Is God simply one being who manifests in three different ways? In this episode, we will discuss the Nicene Creed and the Caledonian creed and how they help us understand the Trinity through a confessional practice. \n\nWe hope you enjoy this Christian Theology Podcast.

We talk about open doors to demonic activity such as substance abuse and unrepentant sin, and we talk about ways to analyze the activity of people to help us determine whether they have a mental sickness or demon possession. The Pentecostal-charismatic denominations of Christianity have by in large been the only voices speaking to this issue of \"demon possession\". However, we perceive that many of these voices have neglected the reality of mental illness, we try and bridge the gap.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nJosh Lewis' Church Kings Fellowship Church\nhttps://kingsfellowshipchurch.com/\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nMichael Miller's Church Reclamation Church\nhttps://reclamationdenver.com/\n____________________________________________________________________________",

    "description": "Systematic Theologians: Theology Proper Part 1 \n\nIn this Christian Theology Podcast,  we discuss Systematic theology Part 1. Systematic theology is a discipline of Christian theology that formulates an orderly, rational, and coherent account of the doctrines of the Christian faith. Related disciplines are dogmatics, ethics, apologetics, and philosophy of religion.\n\nTheology proper is the sub-discipline of systematic theology which deals specifically with the being, attributes, and works of God. In a Christian and Trinitarian setting, this study includes pneumatology (the study of the Holy Spirit) and Christology (the study of Jesus Christ).\n\nIn our discussion, Michael Mitchel Joshua Lewis and Jeff Gray discuss the 5 classical arguments for theism. The ontological, teleological, cosmological, and moral arguments to answer the question, \"is there a God?\". This is part one in a systematic theology mini-series called \"lunchtime theologians\". We hope you enjoy this episode of The Remnant Radio.
