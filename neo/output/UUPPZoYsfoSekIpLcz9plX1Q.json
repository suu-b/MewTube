The point of the Japan example and the \"core-core competition\" section is to show how competition isn't allowed even between \"allies\". The reason I highlighted currency value manipulation instead of the usual unequal exchange/value transference is because I've covered that extensively in earlier videos. Had I had more time, I would've expanded the example to include examples from the periphery instead of just pointing you to another video of mine. I realized that this could cause confusion upon rewatching this so I'm leaving this addendum.",

    "description": "Support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ComradeHakim\n\nTwitter: @YaBoiHakim\nThe lack of understanding regarding unequal exchange and the consequences of high wages in the imperial core have severely hampered our movement. In this video, I aim to introduce these simple concepts and to help provide a guide to political context and action in light of this oft-neglected aspect of theory. So, here you have it. How rich countries rob the poor, and the failure of social democracy.",

I think I'm going to regret trying to make every title in this playlist rhyme with the number tbh. I mean, this time it worked out nicely but who knows in the future? Also, the last one didn't make sense. Electric boogaloo is supposed to be a meme placeholder till I got an idea but I just forgot. Man I had some great coffee today. You know, I'm not really a coffee person though. I prefer tea, but still, good coffee nonetheless. Why are you reading this?",
