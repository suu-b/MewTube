    "title": "Obsidian Book Note Taking 📝 Effortless & Practical Reading Workflow 📚",
    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I share my workflow on how to take effortless book notes in Obsidian 📚 Taking notes while reading can introduce friction (+ other blocks), stopping you from reading in the first place. This workflow aims to overcome these blocks so you can read & remember more ✨  \n\nReading can change your worldview, giving you perspectives across space & time. We often highlight or write down quotes that resonate with us... but for most people, that's where active reading ends. We've captured the what (quote) but not the why (note). By taking reading notes along with your quotes, you can remember WHY the quotes resonated, which helps you retain and remember the quote for longer. \n\nThe goal is to keep your quotes & notes contextualized, and Obsidian provides an excellent way to do so. Today's workflow shows you how to:\n1) set up templates for reading & highlighting notes\n2) connect your e-reader for automatic highlight imports\n3) linking your quotes & notes with an aim of long term learning & original thinking\n\nBe more intentional with your reading and stay in a flow for longer 📚\n\nThis system is also compatible with my Obsidian Books Base: https://youtu.be/Ww3uJCsFuSs You can use your Books Base to automatically organize your book notes, extract key quotes, and build your personal Obsidian Library.\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nIf you want a copy of the templates I share in this video (along with a few other views & features), consider joining my membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiU1vIpPD3lQltke_18m3A/join\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. Welcome to a complete overview of Mocha: AI-Powered App Building https://www.getmocha.com/?utm_source=Wanderloots ✨ In today's video, I demonstrate how to set up a full e-commerce platform with sign-in & payment integration.\n\nMocha is an no-code web app building tool that makes building websites and applications even easier than vibe coding. Rather than architecting everything yourself: the frontend, the UI, the backend, databases, payment integration, etc., you just chat with Mocha and let it build everything for you. \n\nYou become an architect, the orchestrator of what is being built, rather than having to research and implement everything yourself. \n\nIn this video, I show you how to build a full e-commerce web app (online shop) from scratch, walking you through step by step how to prompt Mocha's powerful AI coding agent to get the core features built, before layering more complex features like authentication & Stripe integration (aka sign in with Google to a monetizable app)\n\nMany of you have been asking for AI coding demonstrations of how to connect payment to your apps, so I also show you how to get your Stripe account connected to your Mocha app so you can monetize your app while maintaining security. \n\nThen, I take it one step further, illustrating how to turn on recurring payments to convert my web app into a membership platform, step by step using Stripe webhooks. \n\nI hope that you find this tool as powerful as I did. Let me know in the comments what you end up building, I love to hear how people's visions become a reality with tools like this ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots & welcome to Claude Code +Antigravity + Testsprite! (https://www.testsprite.com/?via=wanderloots) Google Antigravity takes AI Coding to the next level in a full IDE, letting you build apps & vibe code/AI-code assist on your desktop, Claude Code brings heavy coding power to keep you building & Testsprite makes sure the code actually works! ✨\n\nThis video walks through a practical example of adding an authentication system to an RSS reader app (that I built in this video: https://youtu.be/MAUpppfg9Go), using a hybrid workflow of:\n1) Gemini 3 Pro (for planning)\n2) Claude Code (for building)\n3) Testsprite (for testing)\n\nBy using three separate AI coding tools, usage limits in each can be conserved, letting each tool do what it does best so you can keep building.\n\nIf you want to check out Testsprite: https://www.testsprite.com/?via=wanderloots\nIf you have questions on how to use AI testing tools, check out their discord here:  https://discord.com/invite/QQB9tJ973e\n\nAntigravity has 3 major features I find sets it apart from other tools: \n1) Agent Manger & Editor Shared Workflows\n2) Agentic inbox for tracking parallel agent tasks\n3) Browser agent for automated testing & debugging\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 3 Pro is one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!). Combining the context & planning power of Gemini 3 with the coding power of Claude (Sonnet 4.5 & Opus 4.5) in Claude Code really does streamline your building process in Antigravity. \n\nAdding Testsprite helps ensure that what you're building with Gemini & Claude actually works, so you can keep building without worrying about your app breaking. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I give a complete tutorial & overview of TicNote Cloud ☁️ https://ticnote.com/?via=wanderloots TicNote is an AI tool (studio or Chrome extension) that transcribes live meetings & uploaded voice memos before converting the transcription into useful notes, so you can focus more on the meeting/conversation and less about capturing information.\n\nIn this video, I walkthrough all of the features of TicNote, including two live demonstrations: a meeting in Google Meet & an uploaded voice memo to myself on a new idea I had. \n\nI then show you how TicNote transcribes and translates the audio files into a transcript before converting the transcript into a series of different note types. \n\nThere are quite a few features in TicNote Cloud, so I recommend trying them out to see how it can help you!\n\nQuick overview of other Key Features & Benefits Of TicNote Using the demonstration data:\n1. Bot free recording (less awkward than seeing a blank square)\n2. Translation into 120+ languages\n3. You can chat with your knowledge (Shadow AI is like a librarian for your meeting notes)\n4. Deep research reports, based on your own transcripts, help you go deeper into the meeting topics\n5. Aha moments - predictive solutions to problems you didn't even know you had\n6.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots & welcome to Antigravity!  Google Antigravity takes AI Coding to the next level in a full IDE, letting you build apps & vibe code/AI-code assist on your desktop. Update: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMJcHcCbgi4 It's quickly becoming my favourite way to build apps & is the perfect level-up from Google AI Studio ✨\n\nThis video walks through Antigravity from start to finish, including a full app-building workflow to demonstrate my favourite features. I build a complete working RSS app to automatically fetch news articles and connect them to a local Ollama model that automatically tags & summarizes them for me (can't do that on Google AI Studio 👀)\n\nAntigravity has 3 major features I find sets it apart from other tools: \n1) Agent Manger & Editor Shared Workflows\n2) Agentic inbox for tracking parallel agent tasks\n3) Browser agent for automated testing & debugging\n\nFor the first time, it genuinely feels like an IDE (integrated development environment) has been custom-made for an agent-first workflow. It makes my brain feel good watching the agent move between tasks with much more transparency than I've had in other tools.\n\nPLUS you get a significant Gemini 3 Pro quote AND free Claude Sonnet 4.5 usage. You can toggle between both state of the art models and get much further in your app building, testing, and deploying. \n\nThis video is a first look at Antigravity, if you want me to go deeper into any features, let me know, and I'll make a full deep dive tutorial. \n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 3 Pro is one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nTo learn how to add an auth system to your app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMJcHcCbgi4\nTo learn about deploying apps, check out this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_JBFLs3vAk\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. Gemini 3 Pro is FINALLY here!  In today's video, I do a direct comparison between the NEW Gemini 3 Pro & Gemini 2.5 Pro so you can see how good this new tool is. NEW Antigravity + Gemini 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAUpppfg9Go\n\nThis video is a first look at Gemini 3 pro, if you want me to go deeper into any features, let me know, and I'll make a full deep dive tutorial. \n\nIn the meantime, I give a walkthrough of new features in Google AI studio along with the new power of Gemini 3, before comparing to an app I built previously (https://youtu.be/ztYXj4Ypy5o) so you can see the impact of the Gemini 3 upgrade. \n\nIn particular, I show you what I was able to do in one prompt with Gemini 3 compared to many, many prompts in Gemini 2.5 Pro. \n\nI use my idea inbox for Obsidian example, so you can get an idea on how to build practical, personal apps for yourself. \n\nIf you want to dive deeper into Google AI studio or app building in general, check out this Google AI studio playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ6G6-9bnO8_jeW-7aPemv-H\n\nGoogle AI Studio is an incredible powerful tool that has been helping me turn my ideas into reality. As a non-coder, I have been learning how to code using Gemini 2.5 Pro, enabled in Google AI Studio, while also using this same software to write code for me AND debug it.\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 3 Pro is one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nWith Obsidian being my favourite non-linear note-taking app, I thought it would be cool to build a custom, personal app for myself: an idea inbox. A dedicated mobile app that lets me drop thoughts & ideas in one place and have them appear in Obsidian for analysis later. \n\nTo learn about deploying apps, check out the next video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_JBFLs3vAk\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "title": "NEW NotebookLM Feature: Deep Research 📚 How & Why It Works Better 🔍",
    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through NotebookLM's NEW Feature: Deep Research (bye Discover Sources ✌️). This new feature enhances NotebookLM as a research tool, helping you save time & energy learning complex topics while preparing useful resources 📝💡\n\nNotebookLM just got a major update to its research capabilities. The previous \"Discover Sources\" is now considered \"Fast Research\", making room for the new Deep Research Feature. \n\nNotebookLM is the perfect tool for students (learning), educators (teaching), and knowledge workers (productivity). \n\nIn this video, I do a direct comparison between the old Discover Sources (Fast Search) and the new Deep Research so you can see exactly how good the new feature really is. \n\nDeep Research autonomously searches hundreds of websites, learning from its initial results to do deeper, more intelligent searching before synthesizing and creating a research report - complete with citations and links. \n\nThe best part? You can IMPORT all of the discovered sources in the Deep Research Report (along with the report itself) into your Notebook, creating a knowledge base for your results. \n\nThe ability to import the sources directly is a game-changer compared to the deep research feature in other platforms, where you have to manually go and find all of the sources in their reports. \n\nChatGPT, Perplexity, and even Gemini all stop with the report. With NotebookLM, the report is just the beginning.\n\nNew ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost the notes you're already taking✨ The updated NotebookLM takes this to the next level, helping you create more engaging resources for yourself and others. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about NotebookLM, check out my playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ60kbEyROWyTgm8hwLmHgXx\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an AI to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

The age of building your own personal app systems that leverage AI is here, and I'm excited to show you.\n\nAbacus AI desktop brings the best parts of the webapp to your computer, with four components that work together: \n1. Listener — Real-time assistant that watches your screen, listens to meetings, lectures, and videos, and understands the full context so you can chat with it\n2. Chat — Conversational layer for brainstorming, asking questions, processing information\n3. CLI — Terminal-native coding agent for developers \n4. Code Editor — with anAI agent built-in for visual coding workflows\n\nAlong with DeepAgent, an Abacus AI subscription also gives you ChatLLM & DeepAgent Desktop. \n\nChatLLM gives you access to all of the Pro versions of the major AI tools, including ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Gemini (Google).\n\nEven better, rather than having to pick which model you want to use for each task, RouteLLM operates as a kind of compass, pointing you to the best model for your specific needs. \n\nI walk through a complete overview of Abacus AI Desktop, giving tips & tricks on how to use the system, conserve credits, and make the most of these tools so you can focus more on your own productivity, less on the tools needed to accomplish it. \n\nI hope you enjoy this new tool as much as I do! ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I give a complete overview of FlowithOS https://try.flowith.io/?utm_source=wanderloots FlowithOS is a LOCAL agentic AI tool that lets you build automated workflows, research, and browsing all in one place!\n\nI walk through all of the major features of FlowithOS, including document creation, deep research, browser control, automated workflows, and even how to teach your agentic AI new skills & memories so it can continuously get better over time 🤯\n\nFlowithOS is currently in invite-only beta, so please let me know in the comments if you are interested in trying it out and I will give you an invite code. Please also let me know WHY you want to try this tool, so I can prioritize invite codes for people who truly want to test it 😊\n\nMajor Features of FlowithOS:\n1. Agentic AI browsing\n2. Teachable skills & memories (improving quality & consistency)\n3. Canvas based research (Flow mode)\n\nMy favourite part is the Teach Mode, where you can show the Agentic AI the task you want to automate, and it LEARNS from your actions so it can perform them again in the future. \n\nThe system is in Beta so there is a bit of tweaking needed to get the agentic workflows right, but the cool part is that each time you show it a task, it gets better and better at executing it for you. \n\nAt some point, any task you don't want to do can be delegated to your agent in FlowithOS, and that's pretty cool.\n\nI hope you enjoy this new tool as much as I do! ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through NotebookLM's Latest, Hidden Updates (behind the scenes). These new features enhance NotebookLM, helping you save time & energy learning complex topics while preparing useful resources 📝💡\n\nNotebookLM is the perfect tool for students (learning), educators (teaching), and knowledge workers (productivity). \n\nThe latest updates are a backend update, which means that all of the features in NotebookLM just got smarter. The context window (working memory, similar to AI RAM) has increased by 8x, which means you can have 6x longer conversations. \n\nThis increased context window can help with context engineering, prompt engineering, and generally reducing context rot. I explain these topics more in the video so you understand not just how NotebookLM update, but WHY it matters. \n\nGoogle's NotebookLM is a free & private AI tool that accepts up to 50 sources. Once you've discovered or uploaded sources, you can chat with them, prepare briefing docs/summaries, and generate an Audio Overview where two AIs create a podcast about your uploaded sources & notes 🤯\n\nThe new NotebookLM Studio lets you create multiple audio & video overviews per notebook, an interactive mindmap that can be used alongside the rest of NotebookLM, and much more!\n\nNew ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost the notes you're already taking✨ The updated NotebookLM takes this to the next level, helping you create more engaging resources for yourself and others. \n\nAnyone can benefit from this tool, including: students, researchers, knowledge workers, corporate workers, teams, content creators... really, anyone looking to learn anything!\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about NotebookLM, check out my playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ60kbEyROWyTgm8hwLmHgXx\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an AI to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how I use Firebase Studio To Build & Deploy A Full Stack App (for free) 🚀💡 This video gives my step-by-step process & strategy how to build a complete app from scratch with Firebase Studio, including backend & authentication with AI coding (vibe coding) Update: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAUpppfg9Go✨\n\nFirebase is a Google Developer tool that helps you add complex features to your apps, including backend with database, pricing, & authentication. Firebase Studio has a prototyping agent that helps you build the frontend and wire it all into your Firebase Projects. \n\nI walk through how you can set up Firebase Projects, Firebase Studio, and a suite of Google features that help you get your app from a basic prototype into a fully functioning application, along with some tips & strategy for prompting, context engineering, and security considerations. \n\nWhether you're a complete beginner or have experience coding with AI, this video will help you piece together your full stack application and prepare for adding a wide range of complex features. \n\nMy previous videos on app-building give more context on how to use AI to strategically build apps.\nBuild - https://youtu.be/ztYXj4Ypy5o\nDeploy - https://youtu.be/X_JBFLs3vAk\n\nIf you have any questions about Firebase, Firebase Studio, Google AI Studio, or vibe coding in general, please let me know in the comments!\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Pro as one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nWith Obsidian being my favourite non-linear note-taking app, I thought it would be cool to build a custom, personal app for myself: an idea inbox. A dedicated mobile app that lets me drop thoughts & ideas in one place and have them appear in Obsidian for analysis later. \n\nWhether you are interested in Obsidian or not, the concept of ideating, roadmapping, planning, and developing an MVP app for yourself remains the same. Prompt engineering & context engineering are becoming more important than ever as AI tools continue to improve. We need to consider how to scale our apps from MVP to production, leveraging AI for coding along the way. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how I use Google AI Studio To Deploy An App for me (for free) 📝💡  UPDATE:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAUpppfg9Go This video gives my step-by-step process & strategy on how to deploy the apps you build in Google AI Studio by coding with AI (vibe coding) ✨\n\nDeploying apps means to make them public. By deploying your app from Google AI studio, you can start sharing a public, live URL with others, or use the app yourself from your phone.\n\nTo see how I built the app in today's video, check out part 1: https://youtu.be/ztYXj4Ypy5o\n\nI also teach you how to use GitHub for version control. Effectively, you can use Gemini 2.5 Pro (and soon, Gemini 3.0 Pro) as an agentic AI to code for you, versioning with GitHub, and deploying with Google Cloud Run. It's a full stack!\n\nGoogle AI Studio has two main options for deploying your app: 1) Google Cloud Run 2) GitHub + deployment service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). Both offer great free tiers and version control so that you can not only make your app public, but can easily add more features and recalibrate your app as you go. \n\nGoogle AI Studio is an incredible powerful tool that has been helping me turn my ideas into reality. As a non-coder, I have been learning how to code using Gemini 2.5 Pro, enabled in Google AI Studio, while also using this same software to write code for me AND debug it.\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Pro as one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nWith Obsidian being my favourite non-linear note-taking app, I thought it would be cool to build a custom, personal app for myself: an idea inbox.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I give a complete overview of DeepAgent by Abacus AI https://deepagent.abacus.ai/cwl  DeepAgent is an agentic AI tool that lets you test out state of the art AI models for automated tasks (document creation, app building, & more!) UPDATE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhLkmlT--TM\n\nI walk through all of the major features of DeepAgent, including document creation, deep research, browser control, automated workflows, website building, and app building. \n\nAfter providing an overview of the features and an explanation of agentic AI, I build a complete app, from start to finish, showing you how to plan, code, debug, and deploy a full stack application. Frontend, backend, databases, auth layer, and payment integration were built by DeepAgent all in one go 🤯\n\nAlong with DeepAgent, an Abacus AI subscription also gives you ChatLLM & DeepAgent Desktop. \n\nChatLLM gives you access to all of the Pro versions of the major AI tools, including ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Gemini (Google). The models are always state of the art, which means you don't have to worry about switching between different tools to get the best option, they are always available with one subscription. Learn more here: https://chatllm.abacus.ai/cwl\n\nEven better, rather than having to pick which model you want to use for each task, RouteLLM operates as a kind of compass, pointing you to the best model for your specific needs. \n\nI walk through a complete overview of DeepAgent by Abacus AI, giving tips & tricks on how to use the system, conserve credits, and make the most of the tool so you can focus more on your own productivity, less on the tools needed to accomplish it. \n\nI hope you enjoy this new tool as much as I do! ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how I used Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to code an app for me. 📝💡 This video gives my step-by-step process & strategy on app-building and coding with AI (vibe coding), including prompt & context strategies for long term building ✨ UPDATE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_JBFLs3vAk\n\nGoogle AI Studio is an incredible powerful tool that has been helping me turn my ideas into reality. As a non-coder, I have been learning how to code using Gemini 2.5 Pro, enabled in Google AI Studio, while also using this same software to write code for me AND debug it.\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Pro as one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nWith Obsidian being my favourite non-linear note-taking app, I thought it would be cool to build a custom, personal app for myself: an idea inbox. A dedicated mobile app that lets me drop thoughts & ideas in one place and have them appear in Obsidian for analysis later. \n\nWhether you are interested in Obsidian or not, the concept of ideating, roadmapping, planning, and developing an MVP app for yourself remains the same. Prompt engineering & context engineering are becoming more important than ever as AI tools continue to improve. We need to consider how to scale our apps from MVP to production, leveraging AI for coding along the way. \n\nI also touch on how to use GitHub for version control and how to use Google Cloud Run to deploy your app for sharing. Effectively, you can use Gemini 2.5 Pro as an agentic AI to code for you, versioning with GitHub, and deploying with Google Cloud Run. It's a full stack!\n\nTo learn about deploying apps, check out the next video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_JBFLs3vAk\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

NEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhLkmlT--TM\n\nI walk through all of the major features of ChatLLM, including how to structure projects, run automated tasks, and switch between the various tools to solve your problems with practical, efficient workflows. \n\nHonestly, I was impressed with how many features are packed into this single tool, all for $10 a month - half the price of the leading Pro tiers of other LLMs. \n\nChatLLM gives you access to all of the Pro versions of the major AI tools, including ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Perplexity, Gemini (Google).

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots.  In the last year, I've gained 1.5 million views, +25,000 subscribers, and over $10,000 on YouTube ✨ In today's video, I give a 1 year review of my YouTube channel, what worked, what didn't, and the 5 lessons I've learned that have led to non-linear growth (and how you can do the same).\n\n2 years ago I quit my job as an intellectual property lawyer and patent agent to pursue my dream job in the creator economy. This journey has led to me experimenting and recalibrating many aspects of my life. \n\nI've taken the time to reflect on these experiments to outline 5 core principles of how to build on YouTube for sustainable & non-linear growth. These principles apply to any other business on the Internet, anything that involves taking your ideas and making them a reality by putting yourself out there. \n\n1 year ago, I posted a video that changed the trajectory of my life, enabling me to truly build out my dream job on YouTube. I hope that my experience can help anyone who is struggling to grow or get started with building the life of their dreams. \n\nGrowth in the creator economy, the Internet, YouTube, does not usually happen by accident.

    "title": "Obsidian Bases For Books 📚 How To Automatically Organize Book Notes 📝",
    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how to build a Books Base from scratch using the new Obsidian Bases Core Plugin 📚 You can use your Books Base to automatically organize your book notes, extract key quotes, and build your personal Obsidian Library ✨\n\nIn this video, I walk through all of the key elements of Obsidian Bases and how you can use the CODE method to capture, organize, distill, and express your book notes in Obsidian. That way, you can focus more on the capturing of notes in a usable way, without ever thinking about the organization again. \n\nOnce you have your Books Base built and your templates organized, your book notes will be automatically organized, forever. \n\nBases makes the properties of your notes FAR more powerful. You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata. There is also a card view, where you can add book covers to make your Obsidian Library much more aesthetic. \n\nConverting your notes into databases can help you surface insights and reduce information overload, as building inboxes and locating patterns becomes significantly easier.\n\nIf you've struggled with the Dataview plugin or Notion in the past, I think you'll really enjoy this update. You no longer need to learn to code in Dataview in order to build inboxes & indexes for your notes.\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nIf you want a copy of the Books Base Starter Kit I built in this video (along with a few other views & features), consider joining my membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiU1vIpPD3lQltke_18m3A/join\n\nTo go deeper into Bases, check out my Obsidian Bases playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ4NDvVhlZMki0a4Dv3iYO-S\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through my new favourite academic research tool: Consensus.app. Consensus focuses on finding quality information first before providing you with any answers, making it perfect for quality learning & academic research. I also show you how I integrate Consensus into my own academic workflow with my reference manager (Zotero) and my note-taking system (Obsidian). \n\nUse this link to get one month free with a year of Consensus Pro: https://get.consensus.app/Wanderloots\n\n@ConsensusNLP  significantly speeds up your research by searching literally thousands of papers at once before providing you with the top 50 papers that align with your question. \n\nThen, Consensus provides a series of snapshots that break down the information in those papers into easily digestible tables, meters, and summaries so that you can continue learning & researching without getting overwhelmed by information. \n\nThe Research Hub that lets you organize your research threads into folders AND upload your own papers. You can use Consensus AI to chat with your papers directly, significantly speeding up your ability to discover insights & validate or disprove claims. \n\nConsensus focuses on discovering quality information FIRST before using AI to provide answers, reducing hallucinations and boosting the quality of the information it provides you. It also analyzes yes & no questions to determine the community consensus so you get an instant idea on where concepts fit with the grand scheme of the academic community.\n\nYou can then integrate your research with your reference manager, like Zotero, and your note-taking systems, like Obsidian, so your workflow is augmented, not disrupted. All of the sources you discover and organize in Consensus can be exported to your reference manager so you can easily cite them in your work as you go. \n\nI hope you enjoy this new tool as much as I do! ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how to build a sources Base using the New Obsidian Bases Plugin + the Obsidian Web Clipper Browser Extension.\n\nCombining the organization of Bases with the capture element of the Web Clipper Extension creates the perfect hybrid for researching and learning, all in the place you are already taking your notes in. \n\nThe Web Clipper extension lets you customize templates for different websites to automatically organize the sources you're saving in a format that is perfectly compatible with Obsidian Bases. \n\nObsidian Bases effortlessly turns your notes into a database, without the need of plugins like Dataview or cloud-based apps like Notion. If you've been waiting to switch to Obsidian from Notion, now might be the time!\n\nBases makes the properties of your notes FAR more powerful. You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata. \n\nConverting your notes into databases can help you surface insights and reduce information overload, as building inboxes and locating patterns becomes significantly easier.\n\nIf you want to learn more about what Bases are and how to get started, check out the first video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWUQbK8KlOo\n\nNote: this feature is currently available in beta to Catalyst members (early access). I will let you know when the feature becomes available to everyone. In the meantime, this tutorial will still help you understand how you will be able to incorporate Bases into your note-taking workflow once you get access. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nConsensus 1 month free with 1 year premium: https://get.consensus.app/Wanderloots\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through the updated Smart Connections Obsidian Plugin ✨ The update includes improved Connections, Smart Chat & Smart Blocks. I also give a brief tutorial on the technology behind the tools so you can understand what's happening behind the scenes. \n\nThe Smart Connections Plugin is a free & private AI tool operates locally within Obsidian, with various features that leverage your existing note-taking through a local embeddings model. That means your data never leaves your computer. Smart Connections brings in \"Semantic Searching\" which is FAR more powerful than classic keyword searches. \n\nSmart Connections & Smart Chat are both powered by the Smart Environment, a data layer that automatically updates as you make changes in your vault. This data layer keeps the context of your vault fresh and personalizes your interactions with the AI. \n\nIn this video, I walk through how to get started with Smart Connections & Smart Chat, how to run a local model (Ollama & LM Studio), AND give a tutorial on how this technology works so you can understand how it all works (LLMs, embedding models, RAG, vector databases, & more).\n\nI use Smart Connections all the time to help me with my research and writing, surfacing insights and rediscovering notes I had forgotten about. \n\nWith Smart Connections, a huge vault of thousands of notes isn't a burden, but is instead a repository of valuable context & insights, surfaced effortlessly. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how to use AI Tools to help you build & manage projects with the NEW Obsidian Bases Core Plugin. You can use AI like NotebookLM or Google AI Studio to code new bases for you AND manage projects that are compatible with those Bases 🤯\n\nOne of the benefits of Obsidian Bases is its syntax (code/language). AI can understand this code perfectly, enabling you to prompt your bases into existence and then mange those new bases.\n\nI have been using AI tools like Google AI Studio & NotebookLM to help me organize, build, and manage my Bases and Projects. AI has effectively become a project manager for me, and I've never been more productive. \n\nI explain the theory behind agile project management & how you can practically organize your projects + tasks in Obsidian. By the end of this video, you'll  understand how you to streamline your Obsidian project organization, boosting your productivity & decreasing information overload.\n\nObsidian Bases effortlessly turns your notes into a database, without the need of plugins like Dataview or cloud-based apps like Notion. Bases makes the properties of your notes FAR more powerful. You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through a NEW AI Research & Knowledge Management Tool: Ponder (formerly Research Flow). \n✨ Early Access link: https://ponder.ing/s/12HPXA\n\nPonder brings your research, note-taking, and AI assistants all to one central knowledge hub so that you can spend more time thinking, and less time compiling research from various places. \n\nPonder lets you build a home base for your knowledge & research, making it easy to add new files, find new papers, and synthesize your learning in one place. My favourite part is that all of this research & note-taking happens in a \"tree of knowledge\", building out step by step, node by node, so that you never feel overwhelmed by information. \n\nThere is even a new AI Agent that has contextual understanding of your ponders (knowledge trees) and can help you make new connections between your ever growing, infinite canvas. \n\nThe free version lets you build bit by bit each day, while the Pro version gives unlimited AI access for deep research. \n\nPonder is currently in invite-only beta, but I got you an invite code AND a discount on the pro version: \n✨ Early Access link: https://ponder.ing/s/12HPXA\n✨ 25% Discount Code = WANDERLOOTS\n\nI hope you enjoy this new tool as much as I do! ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through how to build a project management system in Obsidian, using the NEW Obsidian Bases Core Plugin.\n\nI explain the theory behind agile project management & how you can practically organize your projects + tasks in Obsidian. By the end of this video, you'll  understand how you to streamline your Obsidian project organization, boosting your productivity & decreasing information overload.\n\nBases now lets you create a new note DIRECTLY within the table itself, which makes it easy to add new projects & tasks while dynamically tracking due dates & statuses.\n\nObsidian Bases effortlessly turns your notes into a database, without the need of plugins like Dataview or cloud-based apps like Notion. Bases makes the properties of your notes FAR more powerful. You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata.

There are two major updates I want to show you today: card view & automatic note templates.\n\nThis video covers the latest updates to the Obsidian Bases Core Plugin: 1.9.3 & 1.9.4, demonstrating a range of minor updates along with the two major ones. \n\nObsidian Bases effortlessly turns your notes into a database, without the need of plugins like Dataview or cloud-based apps like Notion.

You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata. \n\nConverting your notes into databases can help you surface insights and reduce information overload, as building inboxes and locating patterns becomes significantly easier.\n\nIf you've struggled with the Dataview plugin or Notion in the past, I think you'll really enjoy this update.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. Welcome to my channel! I quit my job as an intellectual property lawyer & patent agent to be a full-time educator and creator, using the skills I learned as a lawyer to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change without burning out or feeling overwhelmed by information. \n\nI started this Wanderloots YouTube channel to share my knowledge & learn in public, hopefully helping you learn alongside me.\n\nThis video is an overview of my channel, touching on the videos I've made and my favourite topics to discuss: personal knowledge management, artificial intelligence, and non-linear systems like digital gardens, using tools like Obsidian & NotebookLM.\n\nMy goal is to help you understand how to use modern tools to deal with modern information overload, reducing stress and leveraging creativity & non-linear thinking. The world is changing faster than ever, so it's important to structure your systems to be future-proof.\n\nObsidian is by far the best note-taking tool I've ever come across and forms a core of my knowledge management system. I talk about several videos that can help you get started learning obsidian without feeling overwhelmed. Many people have said it's the best series they've ever seen on Obsidian.\n\nNotebookLM & Google AI Studio are two AI tools I use every day, helping me learn faster and more effectively, while saving me time and energy. Responsible AI use, keeping in mind safety & privacy is an essential part of my knowledge system.\n\nAfter burning out, I am very focused on building sustainable creation & knowledge systems, which I talk more about in my Recalibrating Philosophy Playlist. \n\nI hope that this overview video helps you understand my philosophy and why I'm so passionate about building this channel. \n\nIf I've helped you in any way, please consider subscribing & leaving a comment/testimony; who knows, you might help someone else as well 🫡\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I take a first look at the NEW Obsidian Core Plugin: Bases. Obsidian Bases effortlessly turns your notes into a database, without the need of plugins like Dataview or cloud-based apps like Notion. If you've been waiting to switch to Obsidian from Notion, now might be the time! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ4NDvVhlZMki0a4Dv3iYO-S\n\nBases makes the properties of your notes FAR more powerful. You can now edit properties from within the table directly, simplifying batch editing of your note metadata. \n\nConverting your notes into databases can help you surface insights and reduce information overload, as building inboxes and locating patterns becomes significantly easier.\n\nIf you've struggled with the Dataview plugin or Notion in the past, I think you'll really enjoy this update. You no longer need to learn to code in Dataview in order to build inboxes & indexes for your notes.\n\nNote: this feature is currently available in beta to Catalyst members (early access). I will let you know when the feature becomes available to everyone. In the meantime, this tutorial will still help you understand how you will be able to incorporate Bases into your note-taking workflow once you get access. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video, I show you how I actually use Obsidian & NotebookLM to explore a topic: How To Systemize Flow States using Intuition & Neuroscience 🌊 I use the Feynman's Favourite Problem Framework to research these topics & develop my own mental model, a framework for finding finding flow on demand.\n\nFlow states are when you find effortless attention & optimal experience (peak performance). Flow states help you find focus in what you care most about, feeling more fulfilled with life & more productive.\n\nTo better understand how to trigger flow states, I researched the concepts of intuition & neuroscience (including the default mode network) to systemize finding flow. I use Obsidian, my note-taking software, to build out this model & track my research.\n\nI also show you how I use one of my favourite AI tools (NotebookLM) to discover relevant sources & build out mind maps to discover common threads & reduce information overload. \n\nThe first video in this series goes more in depth on the Feynman Technique: https://youtu.be/YiM2ZUGxowQ\n\nThe second video in this series walks through Feynman's Favorite Problems and how you can build an intuition filter for your note-taking system to find your own favourite problems: https://youtu.be/Mtw9zmK6RK8\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nNote: the map of content template created in this video is available for my YouTube members.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. Today's video is a practical tutorial on how I used Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to code an Automatic Open Graph Image Generator for my website to improve social sharing of my website links 📝💡\n\nAdding image previews to website links is a powerful way to improve clicks to your website. People like to know what they are clicking into, and this dynamic image generator workflow helps you build those website preview images automatically ✨\n\nThis video walks through my full process of understanding how open graph images work, why they're valuable & how you can build an automatic open graph image generator to improve the visuals of sharing your website links on social media or by texting.\n\nI use my Obsidian Digital Garden website (https://wanderloots.xyz) as an example, which automatically publishes selected Obsidian notes to my website.\n\nNote: this tutorial shows you how to build an Open Graph (OG) image generator for ANY website, illustrating how I use Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to generate code for me AND teach me how to code along the way. Even if you are not interested in digital gardening, this tutorial will still show you useful tips on how to Code with AI. \n\nIf you did use the digital garden plugin to create a website (like I did in this video: https://youtu.be/7f8e5IiUkeo), the process will be identical for you. I also share how to modify the code for different hosting providers like Vercel & Netlify.\n\nGoogle AI Studio is an incredible powerful tool that has been helping me turn my ideas into reality. As a non-coder, I have been learning how to code using Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also using it to write code for me & debug it.\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Pro as one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!)\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nHere is the written tutorial that accompanies this video; you can use it as context for an LLM to help you build your own image generator: https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/tutorials/how-to-make-a-dynamic-image-generator-for-your-website-obsidian-digital-garden-example/\n\nNote that the code for the automatic image generator is available for my paying YouTube members if you don't want to start from scratch: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiU1vIpPD3lQltke_18m3A/join\n\nTo learn more about the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I give a first look at NotebookLM's latest upgrade: the NotebookLM Mobile App 👀 This new app creates a simplified version of NotebookLM for your mobile device, giving you easier access to audio overviews (podcasts) & letting you share sources to NotebookLM directly from your phone. These features save you a ton of time and energy getting your notebook filled with useful sources📝💡\n\nNotebookLM is a free & private AI tool that accepts up to 50 sources. Once you've discovered or uploaded sources, you can chat with them, prepare briefing docs/summaries, and even generate an Audio Overview where two AIs create a podcast about your uploaded sources & notes 🤯\n\nThe NotebookLM Mobile App helps streamline this process by allowing you to share sources to new & old notebooks so you can research on the go. \n\nThe Mobile App is also now the best way to listen to audio overviews (AI podcast) since you can sync seamlessly between web & mobile. Getting the podcasts to my phone was always a problem for me, so I'm very glad they focused on improving this feature for the mobile app so I can listen & learn on the go.\n\nThat said, there are a few limitations to the Mobile App, certain features are only present on the web version. In this video, I walk through my strategy for using both the web & mobile versions effectively so you can get the most out of NotebookLM.\n\nAnyone can benefit from this tool, including: students, researchers, knowledge workers, corporate workers, teams, content creators... really, anyone looking to learn anything!\n\nNew ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost the notes you're already taking.\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about the features of NotebookLM & how I integrate AI into my workflows, checkout my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I give a practical tutorial on how I used Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to code a mini-app for me. 📝💡 This video walks through my full process of converting my Obsidian digital garden website into a Farcaster Mini-App using AI.\n\nNote: this tutorial shows you how to convert ANY website into a mini-app, illustrating how I use Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to generate code for me AND teach me how to code along the way. Even if you are not interested in digital gardening or farcaster, this tutorial will still show you useful tips on how to Code with AI. \n\nGoogle AI Studio is an incredible powerful tool that has been helping me turn my ideas into reality. As a non-coder, I have been learning how to code using Gemini 2.5 Pro, enabled in Google AI Studio, while also using this same software to write code for me AND debug it.\n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Pro as one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nHere is the Code I generated today, along with a text tutorial to accompany this video: https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/tutorials/how-to-convert-your-website-into-a-farcaster-mini-app-obsidian-digital-garden-example/\n\nHere is my farcaster profile: https://warpcast.com/wanderloots.eth\n\nTo learn more about how the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through How To Make Your Obsidian Vault Multiplayer with the Relay Plugin 🛰️ 🛰️ The Relay Plugin enables you to share specific folders in your Obsidian Vault so that you can collaboratively work on the same notes together in real time. A great (free) alternative to Obsidian Sync!\n\nThe Relay Plugin is perfect for teams, partners, companies, students, anyone looking to get into shared or collaborative note-taking. You can use this for projects, research, or even just having conversations with each other, in the place that you're already taking all of your notes. It's a great way to work on notes together, in real time.\n\nYou can think of The Relay Plugin as Google Docs, directly within your vault (though it's missing a few key features that Google Docs offers that I talk about in the video). This Shared Note-Taking Plugin is an alternative to Obsidian Sync. \n\nThe team behind the Relay Plugin (System 3) has a full roadmap of features that they're introducing to make this plugin more versatile, which I also share more information on throughout the video.\n\nWith so many of my friends now using Obsidian, this plugin is a great way for me to share my thoughts, ideas, and notes with them, without having to pay for a monthly service like Obsidian Sync. \n\nYou can even use this to sync folders between your computer & mobile device if you want to! A true Obsidian Sync Alternative.\n\nI'm excited to continue exploring new use cases for this plugin, truly making my vault multiplayer. I hope you find it as helpful as I do!\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I reflect on what it means to Turn Online Connections Into Real Life Friendships ✨ I just spent the week in New York City attending FarCon, a Farcaster social network meet up for an incredible community.\n\nFarCon was one of my favourite in real life events I've ever attended. I met so many incredible people in the wonderful NYC, so I thought I would share some of my key takeaways on what it means to connect URL (online) and IRL (in real life). Going from online to offline, from online to reality.\n\nIn particular, I share a lot of thoughts on flow states, value alignment, the creator economy, and what it means to build micro-communities. I think we are in an era of micro-communities (1000 True Fans) becoming more impactful than the macro networks of traditional social media. \n\nTo me, Farcaster feels like a social network, not social media. There are no ads, no dark patterned behaviours, and generally, I feel good about using it. It's kind of like a hybrid of Twitter (X) and Reddit. It has the short form posting style of Twitter, with the channel (subreddit) communities of Reddit. \n\nFarcaster is a decentralized social media app that is really more of a social networking app. By that, I mean that people are there to engage with each other, rather than with the media alone (like on Instagram, Facebook, etc). I personally have found this network to be the best community space online, as the people are incredibly genuine, creative, and knowledgeable. \n\nFarcaster is decentralized because it operates as a protocol, rather than a platform. I talk more about the benefits of decentralized social media and what it means to be a protocol in this newsletter if you would like more details: https://wanderloots.com/recalibrating-34. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

I think that Deep Research AI tools are one of the best uses of AI we've seen so far. \n\nRather than just showing you this new feature, I thought it would be more helpful to compare ChatGPT to Gemini, Perplexity, and NotebookLM, so you can get a better idea on how to use the free tiers of each tool in a deep research stack to save you time, energy, and money. \n\nNew ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost your research and help you learn far faster & more effectively. \n\nThe Deep Research feature automatically searches the web for you based on your prompt and curates hundreds of reviewed sources down to the best options AND synthesizes the research into a single report for you. \n\nAnyone can benefit from this tool, including: students, researchers, knowledge workers, corporate workers, teams, content creators... really, anyone looking to learn anything!\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault with an eye to AI-integration, check out my PKM & Digital Gardening Obsidian Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I give a tutorial of one of my favourite AI tools: Adobe Firefly, an AI image AND video generator 💡 This video walks through all of the major features on how to use this incredible tool, along with the massive upgrade with the new Image 4 Model & Image 4 ULTRA model. Also, Video Generation is now available to everyone!\n\nI've been using Adobe Firefly for years because it is the only model (that I know of) that trains its image and video generator models on intellectually property safe content. In other words, they only use images and videos that they have permission to use. These IP safe outputs are therefore commercially safe to use, so you can use them in your business & to monetize your content. \n\nI've been using Firefly to bring my ideas to life, to literally take my imagination and put it on the page. The best part, for me, is that it produces 4 images each time, which helps me combat analysis paralysis and decision fatigue, allowing my subconscious to help me understand what my imagination was looking for the entire time. \n\nIn this video, I walk through all of the updates, comparing various image models, & demonstrating how you can use the video generation model, along with practical, real-world examples.\n\nAnyone can benefit from this tool, including: students, artists, knowledge workers, corporate workers, teams, content creators... really, anyone looking to bring their ideas to life!\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo get generative AI credits with Adobe, you can use this link: https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3xbVS/pubref:wanderloots/ar:wanderloots\n\nTo learn more about how the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

I think you'll find it as helpful as I have!\n\nGoogle AI Studio is an incredible powerful tool that has been helping me turn my ideas into reality. As a non-coder, I have been learning how to code using Gemini 2.5 Pro, enabled in Google AI Studio, while also using this same software to write code for me AND debug it.\n\nI have already built two apps, customized my website, and build an image generator for my Obsidian Digital Garden, customizing the open graph preview images for social sharing. \n\nIt's honestly amazing how much I've learned and built in such a short time, leveraging Gemini 2.5 Pro as one of the most powerful LLMs out there, especially for coding (and it's free!).\n\nI also walk through how I use Google AI Studio alongside Gemini Canvas & NotebookLM, so you can see how apps go from idea to reality.\n\nAnyone can benefit from this tool, including: students, researchers, knowledge workers, corporate workers, teams, content creators... really, anyone looking to learn anything!\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nTo learn more about how the AI tools I use, check out my AI Learning Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7k0CCHAhCNGXH1BKKEo_we\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In today's video, I walk through How To Run Local AI (LLM & Text Embedding) In Obsidian with LM Studio (or Ollama).

I was surprised how they each work better in different ways!\n\nThe Copilot Plugin is a free & private AI tool that ~can~ operate locally within Obsidian, with various features that leverage your existing note-taking through a local embeddings model\n\nThe Smart Connections Plugin is also a free & private AI tool that operates 100% locally.\n\nNew ideas, surfacing insights, making connections, distilling complex information, there is no end to how AI can boost the notes you're already taking ✨\n\nOne of the main reasons I use Obsidian for my note-taking is that it operates in markdown, producing a future-proof intellectual property asset that can connect seamlessly with AI tools.\n\nIt's truly an incredible way to take your static notes in obsidian and turn them into dynamic knowledge, while retaining the authenticity of your own writing to work WITH AI, rather than replace your thinking/writing.\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨\n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. By popular request, in this video, I show you how I actually use Obsidian & note-taking to explore a topic: The Feynman Technique. The Feynman Technique is one of the best ways to learn and improve your learning, through teaching. \n\nI use the Feynman Technique in this video to explain the Feynman Technique (meta, I know), while walking through my Molecular Zettelkasten note-taking system in Obsidian. I use this system to create an outline for a newsletter, this YouTube video, & to publish to my digital garden. If you're interested in seeing how the newsletter turned out, consider subscribing to Recalibrating: https://paragraph.xyz/@wanderloots.eth?referrer=wanderloots.eth (publishing the newsletter soon 👀)\n\nI also touch on why Obsidian is the best app for my PKM system (personal knowledge management), one I've used for years to write over 200,000 words in my newsletter. As I use my Molecular Zettelkasten system, I show you how you can use the different settings, plugins, and templates to augment your note-taking, with a view to an AI-assisted future 👀\n\nI have a related video that goes through a complete overview of Molecular Zettelkasten and why it fits so well into knowledge theory 🧠: https://youtu.be/00LKsV8h6zY\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video I walkthrough How To Migrate To Obsidian from other note-taking apps using the Obsidian Importer Plugin. Here are a few Key reasons to move to Obsidian: \n1. Easy to create a small filed-sized backup of your notes;\n2. No cloud reliance/fees;\n3. Markdown format is the future of notes (allows you to connect to AI or other software effortlessly, if you want). \n\nI personally began my personal knowledge management (PKM), my second brain, using Apple Notes, then OneNote, then Notion. Apple Notes doesn't have the infrastructure to build out my ideas. I lost a bunch of notes in OneNote from cloud storage issues. Notion almost deleted all of my notes AND wanted me to pay to upgrade after using it only for one month. This is not the way. Since moving to Obsidian, I've never considered switching to another note-taking app.\n\nIn this video, I walk through specific examples on how you can use the Obsidian Importer to move from Apple Notes, OneNote, and Notion. This plugin and method can be also used for: Bear, Evernote, Google Keep, Roam Research, & Text Bundles.\n\nIn Part 1 of this video (https://youtu.be/DoC8Y2qWkyk), I touch on why Obsidian is the best app for your PKM system (personal knowledge management), how to get started with Obsidian, and how you can use the different settings, plugins, and templates to augment your note-taking, with a view to an AI-assisted future 👀\n\nI also explain how I use non-linear note taking in Obsidian to improve my notes, knowledge, and idea generation 📚\n\nI have a related video that goes through a complete overview of Obsidian, including all of the main settings to get you started with your second brain 🧠: https://youtu.be/d2BkvqbTPjk\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video, I walk through the Daily Note Feature in Obsidian, including the template I've created for inspiring my ideal writing workflow in Obsidian. \n\nI use Daily Notes almost every single day as my home base in Obsidian, the place where I can add any kind of note without worrying about the organization or placement. This reduces overthinking and helps me deal with information overload in the world. \n\nOne of the main reasons I started using Obsidian was to build a habit system for myself to write more regularly. The Daily Note Plugin, along with the other templates & plugins I talk about in this video, have helped me write more deeply & consistently than ever before.\n\nThis video is a full walkthrough of how to set up the Daily Notes plugin, along with my thinking behind every callout and feature I've added to my custom daily note template. \n\nI hope that this helps you understand a bit more how you can use a single note template to boost your creativity & productivity in Obsidian.\n\nA copy of this template is available for my paying YouTube members 🫡 ✨ Thank you so much for your support, you enable me to continue making the best videos I can. \n\nI use Daily Notes as my starting point whenever I have a new thought, idea, or project plan. If you're looking to expand your understanding of Obsidian to leverage Daily Notes even further, I recommend checking out my Obsidian For Beginners video: Non-Linear Note-Taking - https://youtu.be/d2BkvqbTPjk\n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video, I walk through how to use Zotero & connect it to Obsidian and the AI research tool Research Rabbit. This is the best workflow I've found to keep track of PDFs & websites for all kinds of research (casual & academic research). \n\nZotero is a reference manager that allows you to effortlessly save PDFs and other resources from the Internet and store them in the cloud as a library. Your library can be synced to Obsidian so you can annotate & highlight your documents in Zotero and seamlessly import them to Obsidian. \n\nThis same Zotero library can be synced with Research Rabbit, the \"Spotify\" for research papers, helping you make connections, find similar work, and generally speed up & deepen your academic workflow. Research Rabbit uses AI to find similar papers to help augment your research, finding connections for you in seconds.\n\nThis video is a complete tutorial on how to get started with Zotero, integrate it with Obsidian (including how to template specifically for importing files & metadata), and extend your research with Research Rabbit AI. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. This video is part 2 of Molecular Zettelkasten: Templating Zettelkasten in Obsidian 📝\n\nIn this video, I get into the practical steps of templating my Molecular Zettelkasten system in Obsidian so that you can see how the system is set up from scratch: Literature Notes, Source Notes, Permanent Notes, and my new note type of Publishable Notes. I also walk through a few examples on how to take information from source notes, distill them into the different Zettelkasten note types, and nest them into note sequences for publishing.\n\nIn Part 1, I talked about the theory of why Zettelkasten works as a note-taking system to help us reduce information overload while building a knowledge base: https://youtu.be/00LKsV8h6zY\n\nUsing this modified Zettelkasten - Molecular Zettelkasten - has helped me publish over 150,000 words, or ~3 non-fiction books' worth of published writing in the last year 🤯 In this video, I walk through how I approach building publishable notes out of my atoms (literature notes) and molecules (permanent notes).\n\nA zip folder of this templated system is available for my YouTube members 🫡 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiU1vIpPD3lQltke_18m3A/join\n\nMolecular Zettelkasten is an incredible way to keep external knowledge separate from internal ideas, helping augment my personal knowledge management system. \n\nIf you want to learn more about what Zettelkasten is and why it works, I recommend checking out Part 1, which was both an intro & deep dive to the Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method by Niklas Luhmann. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

This video aims to help simplify the process by breaking down Zettelkasten into two systems: Internal & External, and three major elements: READ, THINK, WRITE. \n\nI also go into depth on various knowledge theories, including:\n1. DIKW (data information knowledge wisdom)\n2. Bloom's Taxonomy\n3. Continuum of Understanding\n4. CODE System (Capture Organize Distill Express)\n\nThis video is part 1, the theory of why Zettelkasten works as a note-taking system to help us reduce information overload while building a knowledge base.

    "title": "How I Automatically Organize My Obsidian Vault 📥 (Smart Inbox & Index)",
    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this tutorial video, I explain how I Automatically Organize & Index my Obsidian Vault using four plugins:\n\n1. Auto Note Mover Plugin\n2. Dataview Plugin\n3. Templater Plugin\n4. Book Search Plugin\n\nThese plugins enable me to automatically create inboxes to receive notes and then index the inboxes so I can see what is in each inbox. In other words, automatic sorting of my Obsidian notes and automatic listing of the notes that have been sorted. \n\nI also go through four practical examples on how I personally use these plugins to keep my personal knowledge management system organized in Obsidian, and also to keep track of the selected notes that have been published to my digital garden:\n\n1. Topic Inboxes\n2. Digital Garden Update History\n3. Daily Notes Created & Updated\n4.

    "title": "What Is A Digital Garden? 🌱 Benefits & Philosophy - Obsidian PKM",
    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video, I talk about what a digital garden is 🌱 - along with the benefits and philosophy of using a digital garden compared to a traditional blog OR social media 👀\n\nThis video is part of a series where I teach people how to build their own digital gardens, for free, using Obsidian (a note-taking app). Digital gardens provide a great way for you to share your thoughts, ideas, knowledge, and art/content without the use of an algorithm. \n\nIt's a surprisingly relieving way to publish 😌\n\nYou can find the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8e5IiUkeo\n\nI use my digital garden as part of a public portion of my PKM - Personal Knowledge Management. I use Obsidian as my PKM system, taking private notes, and then use the digital garden plugin to selectively publish those notes to my website. \n\nI view a digital garden as a complementary publishing system to a blog or to social media. This is a place for you to plant your own idea seeds and cultivate them over time into trees that eventually can produce fruit, using the power of linked notes and web pages.\n\nThis digital gardening analogy is different from a blog, which is very linear and chronological, linked to time. In contrast, a digital garden is non-linear, which can enable a much more emergent and ever-growing form of sharing your thoughts, ideas, and knowledge online. \n\nIn this video, I'll touch on a few major perks of digital gardening: \n1. benefits of non-linear writing (the way our brains naturally operate)\n2. 3 fundamental elements of a digital garden\n3. low effort, low friction publishing\n4. where digital gardens fit into the rest of the internet\n\nIf you would like to read more, please check out my digital garden at https://wanderloots.xyz\n\nThe article I reference in the video is by @MaggieAppleton at: https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history. I highly recommend giving it a read!\n\nThanks for watching! If you build your own digital garden, please let me know in the comments, I'm building a list of people who are exploring this form of publishing 🌱 ✨\n\nWATCH NEXT \n🧭 Recalibrating (Main Storyline)    • Recalibrating  \n🎨The Creative Act (Art and Mindfulness) (coming soon)\n🖼️ NFT & Smart Contract Tutorials    • Manifold Smart Contract Tutorials  \n✨ Mindfully Calming Timelapses    • Calming Timelapses  \n🌱 Obsidian & Digital Gardens https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6\n\nLINKS (MY WORLD)\n🧭 [Recalibrating Newsletter Home](https://paragraph.xyz/@wanderloots.et...)\n🏔️To start reading from the beginning: [Recalibrating Newsletter Entry 1: What Recalibrating Means To Me](https://wanderloots.substack.com/p/1-...)\n🌍 My [Website](https://wanderloots.com/)\n📸 My [Print Shop](https://wanderloots.darkroom.com/) ✨ \n🧠 [What is Mindfulness](https://www.wanderloots.com/mindfulne... \n🔥 [What is Burnout](https://www.wanderloots.com/burnout) and How Can I Recover?\n\nSOCIALS\n🟣 [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/wanderloots.eth)\n📸  [Instagram](  / _wanderloots  )\n📰  [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/@_wanderloots)\n📍  [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.ca/wanderloots/)\n🐦  [X (Twitter)](  / _wanderloots  )\n🧵  [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@_wanderloots)\n🤖  [Reddit](  / _wanderloots  )\n\nMY FAVOURITE TOOLS\n😴 🤯 The [Waking Up App](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/guestpas...)

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this tutorial video, I share How I Published My Obsidian Notes Website For Free as a Digital Garden 🏡.\n\nI explain how you can selectively publish notes from your Obsidian vault to your own website using GitHub, Netlify, & the Digital Garden Plugin for Obsidian (all links below). Choosing which notes to publish is as easy as clicking a single button. Note, you can also use this same process for publishing a blog OR a digital garden; the choice is up to you.\n\nThis tutorial is no-code and **by far** the easiest way I've discovered to publish my notes for free, so I hope you find it helpful!\n\nI also explain how you can connect a custom domain to your new website for a small fee (mine cost $2/year) so that readers can find your website more easily (e.g., mine is https://wanderloots.xyz). Finally, I include a free way for you to secure your custom domain with encryption so that you can better protect your website (free if you use Netlify like I did). I include more details on the settings needed in the links section below.\n\nI also created a walkthrough guide at https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/tutorials/how-to-publish-obsidian-notes-website-for-free-digital-garden-or-blog/ if you're looking for more details 🫡\n\nLet me know if you have any questions in the comments below!\n\nThanks for watching, I hope you enjoy ✨\n\nP.S.

Many people believe that the needs should be more flexible, allowing for people to be at higher levels without meeting the needs of the lower levels.\n\n\nSome argue that the third level, social connectedness with other humans, is an essential part of survival and thus should be lower on the hierarchy, while others argue that social connectedness is at the core of human behaviour as a whole, permeating through the rest of the needs.\n\n\nLet's dive in ✨\n\n\nWelcome to the Recalibrating Podcast 🧭 ✨\n\n\nJoin me as I explore the depth of what the world has to offer.\n\n\nLearn to better life in every way possible, reflecting and recalibrating along the way to keep from getting too lost.\n\n\nThanks for sharing the journey with me ✨\n\n\nI hope that you enjoy this episode of Recalibrating, thanks for listening!

    "description": "#10: Automating Self-Regulation\n\n\nLearning to Solve Future Problems, Now\n\n\nBefore we consider what actions to automate, it is important to ask: what actions should we automate? It's very easy to get lost in the details of automation, trying to automate everything we can, without considering what is actually worth automating.\n\n\nThe best way (in my opinion) to determine which tasks are worth automating is to identify the actions in our lives that either (1) take the longest or (2) cause us the most stress (dysregulation).\n\n\nNext, apply the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) to see which of these actions are having the greatest impact on our time and stress. The 80/20 rule is that 80% of outputs are caused by 20% of inputs. Almost everything in life follows this principle...\n\n\nThe written version of this podcast can be read at https://www.wanderloots.com/recalibrating-10\n\n\nWelcome to the Recalibrating Podcast 🧭 ✨\n\n\nJoin me as I explore the depth of what the world has to offer.\n\n\nLearn to better life in every way possible, reflecting and recalibrating along the way to keep from getting too lost.\n\n\nThanks for sharing the journey with me ✨\n\n\nI hope that you enjoy this episode of Recalibrating, thanks for listening!

    "description": "#9: Mental Safety From AI-nxiety\n\n\nLearning to Live With AI\n\n\nContinuing on Maslow's Hierarchy Level 2 with Financial Security and Mental Safety from Entries 6-8, this week I am going to touch on artificial intelligence (AI). This topic is massive. It's hard to emphasize how much detail and research goes into truly understanding AI. I have been researching AI for many years, much more seriously since 2020. I still feel as though I am barely scratching the surface.\n\n\nBut that's okay. Understanding even some of the basics can provide a solid foundation for understanding the current and future impact of AI. Before we get to the stage of using AI to bolster Financial Security through future-proofing and automation, let's take a few minutes to address the Mental Safety component ✨\n\n\nThe goal of this entry is not to teach you everything about AI, that would be impossible. The goal is to identify a few concepts that will hopefully teach you about why AI is in the news so much lately and help alleviate the \"AI-nxiety\" that comes from public mass hysteria over change. Much of this anxiety arises from trying to deal with the uncertainty of AI.\n\n\nThe written version of this podcast can be read at www.wanderloots.com/recalibrating-9\n\n\nWelcome to the Recalibrating Podcast 🧭 ✨\n\n\nJoin me as I explore the depth of what the world has to offer.\n\n\nLearn to better life in every way possible, reflecting and recalibrating along the way to keep from getting too lost.\n\n\nThanks for sharing the journey with me ✨\n\n\nI hope that you enjoy this episode of Recalibrating, thanks for listening!

I explained how we can use data, information, and knowledge to direct the impact of our efforts when we share creations (including knowledge work) with others.\n\n\nIn particular, I discussed the concepts of Natural Self-Expression, Self-Reflection, the Creator Economy, and Sustainable Creation. This week, we will continue analyzing Goal #2 from Entry #6 (http://www.wanderloots.com/recalibrating-6) :\n\n\nStructure a habit and task system that enables me to consistently build income to a level that meets my needs without burning myself out.\n\n\nLet's make the framework from last week more concrete by touching on how we can create actual income while minimizing burnout.\n\n\nWelcome to the Recalibrating Podcast 🧭 ✨\n\n\nJoin me as I explore the depth of what the world has to offer.\n\n\nLearn to better life in every way possible, reflecting and recalibrating along the way to keep from getting too lost.\n\n\nThanks for sharing the journey with me ✨\n\n\nI hope that you enjoy this episode of Recalibrating, thanks for listening!

    "description": "Entry #3: Building Habits From The Ground Up\n\n\nTo not only reach self-actualization, but also to reach it consistently, I knew that I would need to start from the beginning. I needed to undergo a complete change in my daily approach to life. Based on my goals and personality, I knew I would benefit from adding structure to my days in a way that introduced continuous building. Each day, a new building block can be formed that can connect to the previous day to build towards the person I have always been meant to be.\n\n\nFor me, and I think most people, each step on the path to self-actualization can be stabilized by meeting the basic physical and mental needs (the bottom layer of Maslow's hierarchy). This foundation makes sense: I know that my ideal me is not someone who is unhealthy and unhappy. But what is my ideal me? That is a question for each of us to decide.\n\n\nWelcome to the Recalibrating Podcast 🧭 ✨\n\n\nJoin me as I explore the depth of what the world has to offer.\n\n\nLearn to better life in every way possible, reflecting and recalibrating along the way to keep from getting too lost.\n\n\nThanks for sharing the journey with me ✨\n\n\nI hope that you enjoy this episode of Recalibrating, thanks for listening!

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. Welcome to the Creator Economy! One of the fastest growing and most lucrative industries, all it takes to play the game is to create your character (digital identity) and connect to the Internet. \n\nThe Creator Economy and Metaverse (read: NOT facebook's metaverse) are estimated to be worth $5 Trillion by 2030. Only 6 years away 🤯\n\nEvery person in the world has the ability to build their own digital identity and generate value online by sharing story, knowledge, or art. \n\nIn this video, I talk about: \n(1) why you should care about digital identities;\n(2) what a digital identity is and how it relates to personal brands; and\n(3) how to start building your digital identity (personal brand) so that it has value.\n\nThis video series complements my Recalibrating newsletter, providing additional context to the world I am building here. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video, I discuss my thoughts on chapters 3 and 4 of The Creative Act by Rick Ruben, touching on awareness, mindfulness, and a little quantum physics. These skills allow you to see life as more than black and white: to see the state between ⛅️ to live in the grey zones 😌  andto pay attention to your own life ✨ (book link here: https://amzn.to/3O4E9Xb).\n\nOver the last 6 months (since I quit my job as a lawyer) I have been exploring creativity and what it means to live a good life through my newsletter: [Recalibrating](https://wanderloots.substack.com/).\n\nAs part of this exploration, I have been recalibrating my own creative act to  overcome burnout while maintaining mindful productivity. Many of my artist friends have said great things about The Creative Act so I decided to listen to the book and create a video journal of my thoughts. \n\nI hope my commentary can be valuable to you as the viewer (and future me when I am editing these videos and revisiting these concepts). \n\nNote, this is by no means a \"spoiler\" of the book, merely my additional thoughts that were sparked by listening to The Creative Act. I highly recommend reading this book. \n\nIn the previous video (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ4SLS2e6KiPmu9mku81B__Y) I introduce who I am, how I burnt out, and what I've been doing since I quit my job. \n\nAfter working for 5+ years at a corporate law firm as an intellectual property lawyer and patent agent, I quit my job to pursue a life of freedom and creativity. \n\nWhy?

    "description": "Hi Friends, my name is Callum aka wanderloots. In this video, I discuss my thoughts on the first two chapters of The Creative Act by Rick Ruben, including intuition, mindfulness, and a little quantum physics (https://amzn.to/3RECYia).\n\nOver the last 6 months (since I quit my job as a lawyer) I have been exploring creativity and what it means to live a good life through my newsletter: [Recalibrating](https://wanderloots.substack.com/).\n\nAs part of this exploration, I have been recalibrating my own creative act to  overcome burnout while maintaining mindful productivity. Many of my artist friends have said great things about The Creative Act so I decided to listen to the book and create a video journal of my thoughts. \n\nI hope my commentary can be valuable to you as the viewer (and future me when I am editing these videos and revisiting these concepts). \n\nNote, this is by no means a \"spoiler\" of the book, merely my additional thoughts that were sparked by listening to The Creative Act. I highly recommend reading this book. \n\nIn the previous video (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ4SLS2e6KiPmu9mku81B__Y) I introduce who I am, how I burnt out, and what I've been doing since I quit my job. \n\nAfter working for 5+ years at a corporate law firm as an intellectual property lawyer and patent agent, I quit my job to pursue a life of freedom and creativity. \n\nWhy? I was burnt out by my job and I knew that I needed to make a change. \n\nThe purpose of Recalibrating is to explore what it means to be human in a world that is increasingly being impacted by artificial intelligence (AI), while teaching you how to build your own creation system to tap into the digital economy (creator economy, knowledge economy, attention economy). \n\nThis video series complements my Recalibrating newsletter, providing additional context to the world I am building here. \n\nI hope you enjoy! ✨ \n\nP.S.

    "description": "What Is Adobe Firefly? An AI guide for beginners showing an introduction to prompting and where Adobe is taking this product in the future.\n\nAdobe recently announced their generative AI beta program: Adobe Firefly. This video explains how to get access to the beta and how to start AI prompting as a beginner. \n\nI also talk about some of the most interesting features that Adobe has provided, how they differ from existing generative AI programs, and what features Adobe will be introducing in the future. The beta waitlist may be found here: https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html\n\nWhat is prompting? Prompting is a way to create with AI generative models. You type in text (the prompt) and the AI will output the generated image. \n\nWhat is generative AI art? Generative AI art uses a diffusion model trained on other images to generate unique creation outputs. Diffusion models generate a new work every time, so you never know exactly what your creation is going to be. \n\nAdobe Firefly has one of the best user interfaces I have seen for generative AI art. Firefly has enabled a decoupling, a separation, of the text prompt and the style preferences. This decoupling means that it is easier than ever to iteratively modify the generated art output to fine tune the output image to more clearly show your imagination. \n\nFirefly has been trained on copyright free and licensed images, so there are no intellectual property issues with their training model. I know this will be a relief to many creators who are concerned about AI programs stealing their work online. \n\nI hope that you find this video helpful. I will be making more AI tutorial videos and would appreciate any feedback in the comment section below. Please also let me know if you have any questions so I know what videos to make in the future. \n\nHappy prompting!",

    "description": "Last Week’s Beaver Blood Moon 🌙 🦫, the last total lunar eclipse until 2025.\n\nA composite series of the Beaver Blood Moon from last week. An eclipse occurs when the sun moves behind the Earth, casting the Earth’s shadow on the surface of the moon. The red colour comes from light refracting through the Earth’s atmosphere and experiencing Rayleigh scattering. \n\nThis refraction and scattering is the cause of the bright red colour and also why sunrises and sunsets are colourful. You can think of the phenomenon as the sun casting infinite sunrises and sunsets onto the surface of the moon. \n\nWith this series, I tried to show the outline of the Earth’s shadow with the partially eclipsed moon to help visualize how eclipses occur. During this eclipse, the moon spent most of the time in totality (fully in the Earth’s shadow), so I tried to show how the last three moons are curved inwards from the partial eclipse and fully in the shadow. The last moon in the series was taken as the sun rose during the morning blue hour, which caused the purple/blue colour. \n\nIf you want to learn more about how I shot the eclipse, please check out my guide (https://wanderloots.com/how-to-photograph-the-lunar-eclipse/).\n\nI hope you like it and would love to hear your thoughts 🚀  \n\nSong by Yi Nantiro: Dream Bigger\n\nTechnique:\n1. Capture an HDR timelapse of the eclipse (almost 2000 photos)\n2. Select the best frames for the timelapse in Lightroom\n3. Process using LRTimelapse and Lightroom, editing for colour, contrast, haze, sharpness, and deflicker\n4. Import to Photoshop for aligning the images\n\nEXIF:\nEach moon is a single shot at f11, ISO 100, with shutter speeds ranging from 1/500 to 30s exposure. \n\nEquipment:\nSony a7iii, Sony 100-400 mm, Sony 1.4x teleconverter\nSkywatcher Star Adventurer Pro star tracker 2i",

    "description": "My first time shooting a total lunar eclipse (May 15, 2022)\n\nAfter shooting the partial lunar eclipse back in November 2021, I was pumped to have my first try at shooting the lunar eclipse at totality. Given my experience with the partial lunar eclipse, I knew I needed to up my equipment if I wanted to truly capture totality. \n\nI went out the day before to practice with my new star tracker and felt pretty confident going into the eclipse. That is, until I got out and started to set up and had the clouds roll in, completely blocking the sky. I used the PhotoPills app to estimate my polar alignment since the North Star was not visible. \n\nThankfully, I was able to get some very long exposures to expose the moon through the cloud and haze, leaving me with a result that I could work with. \n\nDid you know that the famous blood-red colour of a lunar eclipse is actually the result of the sun casting the colour of an infinite number of sunrises and sunsets onto the moon? When the moon moves into the earth’s shadow (the umbra) the only light that hits the moon is the light that refracts through the earth’s atmosphere and experiences Rayleigh scattering.\n\nThis refraction actually casts a full spectrum of colour onto the moon, we just find it hard to see the full range with the naked eye. However, my camera can pick up the colours. I managed to dehaze the clouds enough to bring out the natural rainbow of colours during the lunar eclipse. The red and orange colour comes from the earth’s atmosphere, while the blue colour comes from the ozone layer of the earth. \n\nThis is a composite of 5 different moon shots. Unfortunately, the clouds prevented me from capturing the entire lunar eclipse, so I re-used the first four photos for the bottom half of the image. The stars were present in the shots, but due to the extreme dehazing I had to do in order to pull the detail through the clouds, the stars were added as a separate series of images. \n\nIf you would like to see how I shot this, I created a guide that can be found here: https://wanderloots.com/how-to-photograph-the-lunar-eclipse/\n\nIf you would like to watch more timelapses, they may be found on my Insta (same username). \n\nTechnique:\n1. Capture an HDR timelapse of the eclipse (almost 4000 photos)\n2. Select the best frames for the timelapse in Lightroom\n3. Process using LRTimelapse and Lightroom, editing for colour, contrast, haze, sharpness, and deflicker\n4. Import to Photoshop for aligning the images\n\nEXIF:\nEach moon photo is a single shot, ranging from 0.6s to 30s exposure, f/11 ISO 100\n\nEquipment:\nSony a7iii, Sony 100-400 mm, Sony 1.4x teleconverter\nSkywatcher Star Adventurer Pro star tracker 2i",

I was pumped at the detail I could bring out, despite the clouds that came in partway through. \n\nI composited the photos to show the full series of the eclipse, using stars from the totality shots (when the sky is darkest) for the background. \n\nI hope that you like it! There’s another lunar eclipse next week (on November 8, 2022). If you’re interested in seeing how I shot this, I wrote a guide. I hope that it helps!",

    "description": "Last Night’s Strawberry Supermoon (June 14, 2022).\n\nThe supermoon occurs when the moon is larger than average, due to its annual orbital path around the Earth aligning with the full phase of the moon. Last night’s moon was 7.5% larger than average. That may not sound like much, but it’s actually quite a large difference, enough to notice with the naked eye; especially when the moon is at the horizon.\n\nI used the Photo Pills app to plan when and where the moon would rise. After being clouded out the night before, I was hoping that there would be clear skies for one of the largest moons of the year. To take the shots, I zoomed in on where Photo Pills told me, and hoped for the best. \n\nI got distracted talking about the moon with some people walking along the the Toronto Harbourfront, so I almost missed seeing the event begin. Suddenly, there was a little orange speck above the trees in my camera frame. It was hard to tell since I was shooting very underexposed, but then I saw it, the moon slowly climbing, silently through the trees and I knew that the supermoon had arrived. “Wow! It’s so much cooler than expected” my new friends exclaimed beside me. I shrugged, “I know.”\n\nIt was incredibly large on the horizon, moving at surprising speed to light up the lake with its reflection. I struggled between a few different focal lengths and settings, trying to expose both the water and the moon without crushing one and blowing out the other.  \n\nThe thumbnail is a composite of three shots capture during my telephoto timelapse of the progression of the strawberry full moon rise. I stacked the images in photoshop with the moons in their original positions. \n\nIf you like this video, please check out my other timelapse compilations. I am working on building a collection of calming glimpses of the macro movement of time, day to night and night to day, across the world.\n\nEXIF Data: \n\nISO 640 f/8.0 1/3 s 560 mm",

    "description": "Take a deep, long breath and enjoy the flowing movement of clouds over volcanoes in the Guanacaste Region of Costa Rica. This timelapse compilation spans two full days, going from sunset to night to sunrise each day. This region has three volcanoes within view from a helicopter pad viewpoint I hiked to at Rio Perdido.\n\nClouds are always interesting to watch move through the sky, but there is something almost magical about how they move over volcanoes. The volcanoes create their own wind patterns, holding the clouds to their hills instead of having them flow off into the distance. It's amazing watching the old clouds die and the new ones be born on the hills of such incredible elements of nature.\n\nI visited the Guanacaste region in Costa Rica specifically to try and capture the night sky as it is one of the darkest regions in the country. Thankfully, the clouds held off overnight, and I managed to capture two astro timelapses of the Milky Way moving into sunrise. \n\nI hope that you enjoy watching this compilation and can use it to meditate and relax, providing a few minutes of calm to your day.",
