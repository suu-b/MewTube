    "description": "Can atheists, who believe that God does not exist, have faith? Of course, atheists have certain kinds of faith: faith in their friends, faith in certain ideals, and faith in themselves. However, the question we’ll examine is whether atheists can have theistic faith: faith that God exists. Philosophers tend to fall on one of two extremes on this question: some, like Dan Howard-Snyder (2019), say unequivocally no; others, like Sam Lebens (forthcoming), say unequivocally yes. Spoiler: I take a middle position: I argue that atheists can have action-focused faith (faith in how they act) but not attitude-focused faith (faith in what attitudes they have).\n\nLink to handout: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JbjUlsbap8HZkd-59d-RUCMVuN9s5HJY/view?usp=drive_link\n\nPrevious video on atheism and religious practice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA3Ps39Qm-A\n\nMy IEP entry on faith: https://iep.utm.edu/faith-contemporary-perspectives/\n\nJoe Schmid on lack theism: https://youtu.be/ElYTNV8QSmk?feature=shared\n\nMy paper (about the \"hopeful atheist\"): https://philpapers.org/rec/JACBFA\n\nMy paper (about the \"wagering atheist\"): https://philpapers.org/rec/JACFTP-2\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: https://liz-jackson.com/public-philosophy/\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lizjackson111/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

    "title": "Why PERMISSIVISM is key for figuring out what to believe",
    "description": "Is evidentialism true? \n\nEvidentialism is the view that evidence alone determines rational belief. Recently, several rivals to evidentialism have been defended, including pragmatic and moral encroachment, epistemic partiality, and practical and moral reasons for belief. Call these rivals “impurist” views. While impurist views have both compelling cases and interesting arguments in their favor, they also face a number of serious challenges. In this paper, I explain three of the most important challenges to impurism. Then I argue that, by embracing epistemic permissivism, impurists can hold onto what’s central to their views while dealing with all three of these challenges. Finally, I suggest that the evidentialist should also embrace permissivism, as it helps them better respond to the most compelling considerations in favor of impurism. \n\nDownload my handout here: http://liz-jackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Handout.pdf\n\nFor an introductory video to evidentialism, see here: https://youtu.be/ZgJ3hDk0-V0\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philoso...\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lizjackson111/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

    "description": "Imagine you had an unlimited amount of time to ask an omniscient being anything you wanted. The potential epistemic benefits would be enormous, if not infinite: endless pieces of significant knowledge/true belief/justified belief. I argue that considerations like these point to an epistemic version of Pascal’s wager. More specifically, I show how, on an epistemic consequentialist framework, there is epistemic reason to believe in God. I compare and contrast the epistemic wager with the traditional wager, and argue that the epistemic version has several notable advantages.\n\nThis talk was given at Ryerson University in December 2019. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philoso...\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: @lizjackson111\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

    "description": "We call attention to certain cases of epistemic akrasia, arguing that they support belief-credence dualism. Belief-credence dualism is the view that belief and credence are irreducible, equally fundamental attitudes. Consider the case of an agent who believes p, has low credence in p, and thus believes that they shouldn’t believe p. We argue that dualists, as opposed to belief-firsters (who say credence reduces to belief) and credence-firsters (who say belief reduces to credence) can best explain features of akratic cases, including the observation that akratic beliefs seem to be held despite possessing a defeater for those beliefs, and that, in akratic cases, one can simultaneously believe and have low confidence in the very same proposition.\n\nThis talk was given with Peter Tan at the Pacific APA in April 2019, with comments by Andrew Moon.\n\nThis paper, coauthored with Peter Tan (https://sites.google.com/site/petertanphilosophy/) is forthcoming in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.

Shouldn't our beliefs be based on evidence, not on the potential benefits of believing? \n\nIn this talk, I argue that if a view in epistemology called epistemic permissivism is true, then taking Pascal's wager is both possible and rational. Epistemic permissivism is the thesis that the evidence can rationally permit more than one attitude toward a proposition. First, I argue that if permissivism is true, then permissivism is true about theistic belief. Then, I show how epistemic permissivism about theistic belief dispels two objections to Pascal’s wager: the objection that wagering is impossible, and the objection that wagering is epistemically impermissible.\n\nThis talk was given at the Evangelical Philosophical Society in November 2018. \n\nThis paper is now forthcoming in Erkenntnis.

    "title": "What Makes a Commitment Rational?",
    "description": "Completing grad school, picking up a new instrument, getting in shape, marriage, and religious commitment all require the ability to keep a commitment over time. What makes these kinds of commitments rational? When should we give them up? \n\nIn this talk, I examine three attitudes: belief, faith, and hope. I argue that all three attitudes can play the same role in rational commitment. First, I explain two models of rational action—the decision-theory model and the belief-desire model. Both models entail there are two components of rational action: an epistemic component and a conative component. Then, using this framework, I show how belief, faith, and hope that p can all make it rational to accept, or act as if, p. I conclude by showing how my picture can explain how action-oriented commitments can be rational over time, both in the face of counterevidence and in the face of waning affections.\n\nThis paper was presented at the World Congress of Philosophy in August 2018.\n\nThis paper was published in Mind.

    "title": "Believing with Low Confidence: Is it Possible? Rational?",
    "description": "We believe, withhold belief, and disbelief things. We also have various levels of credence (or confidence) in things. How do these attitudes related to each other? How tightly connected are they? \n\nMuch of the literature on the relationship between belief and credence has focused on the reduction question: that is, whether either belief or credence reduces to the other. This debate, while important, only scratches the surface of the belief-credence connection. Even on the anti-reductive dualist view, belief and credence could still be very tightly connected. Here, I explore questions about the belief-credence connection that go beyond reduction. This paper is dedicated to what I call the independence question: just how independent are belief and credence? I look at this question from two angles: a descriptive one (as a psychological matter, how much can belief and credence come apart?) and a normative one (for a rational agent, how closely connected are belief and credence?) Ultimately, I suggest that the two attitudes are more independent than one might think.\n\nThis talk was given at the Australian National University in October 2019. \n\nThis paper is now forthcoming in Philosophical Issues.

    "description": "Credences are subjective probabilities that measure one's confidence level in some proposition. For example, I have a 0.9 credence it will rain tomorrow, a 0.5 credence this coin will land heads, and a credence of 0 that 1+1=3. But what are credences? On the belief-first view, they are beliefs about probabilities.\n\nThis paper explains and defends a belief-first view of the relationship between belief and credence. On this view, credences are a species of beliefs, and the degree of credence is determined by the content of what is believed. We begin by developing what we take to be the most plausible belief-first view. Then, we offer several arguments for it. Finally, we show how it can resist objections that have been raised to belief-first views. We conclude that the belief-first view is more plausible than many have previously supposed.\n\nThis talk was given at the Degrees of Belief Conference at the University of Leeds with Andrew Moon (https://andrewymoon.wordpress.com/). \n\nThis paper, coauthored with Andrew Moon, is now published in the Canadian Journal of Philosophy.

    "description": "What is permissivism? Can you be a permissivist and an evidentialist? What does permissivism say about religious disagreement? \n\nPermissivism is the thesis that, for some body of evidence and a proposition p, there is more than one rational doxastic attitude any agent with that evidence can take toward p. Proponents of uniqueness deny permissivism, maintaining that every body of evidence always determines a single rational doxastic attitude. In this paper, we explore the debate between permissivism and uniqueness about evidence, outlining some of the major arguments on each side. We then consider how permissivism can be understood as an underdetermination thesis, and show how this moves the debate forward in fruitful ways: in distinguishing between different types of permissivism, in dispelling classic objections to permissivism, and in shedding light on the relationship between permissivism and evidentialism.\n\nThis paper was presented at the Openmindedness Conference in April 2018 with Margaret Turnbull (https://margaretturnbull.weebly.com/) \n\nThis paper, co-authored with with Margaret Turnbull, is forthcoming in the Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Evidence.

    "description": "Belief-credence dualism is the view that we have both beliefs and credences and neither attitude is reducible to the other. Pragmatic encroachment is the view that practical stakes can affect the epistemic rationality of states like knowledge or justified belief. In this paper, I argue that dualism offers a unique explanation of pragmatic encroachment cases, which vindicates evidentialism. \n\nFirst, I explain pragmatic encroachment and what motivates it. Then, I explain dualism and outline a particular argument for dualism. Finally, I show how dualism can explain the intuitions that underlie pragmatic encroachment. My basic proposal is that in high-stakes cases, it is not that one cannot rationally believe that p; instead, one ought not to rely on one's belief that p. One should rather rely on one's credence in p. I conclude that we need not commit ourselves to pragmatic encroachment in order to explain the intuitiveness of the cases that motivate it.\n\nThis talk was given at the Central APA in February 2019, with comments by Rima Basu.\n\nThis paper is now published in The Philosophical Quarterly.

    "description": "When it comes to theistic faith, philosophers of religion have mostly focused on the role of counterevidence: To what extent can faith co-exist with counterevidence? When does counterevidence render faith irrational? However, counterevidence isn’t the only threat to the rationality of faith. This paper focuses on a second component of faith, that faith involves desire. This has important connections to the axiology of theism—the question of whether God’s existence would be a good thing. Pro-theists say yes, and anti-theists say no. Bringing the rationality of faith and the axiology of theism into contact raises a host of interesting issues that merit further exploration, including whether faith entails desire, faith’s conative resilience, whether having faith requires one to take a stand on the axiology of theism, and ways that anti-theism may threaten the rationality of faith.\n\nHandout available here: http://liz-jackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Handout.pdf\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:55 The Axiology of Theism \n8:25 The Nature of Faith\n21:29 The Rationality of Faith\n27:46 Upshots and Conclusion\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philoso...\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: @lizjackson111\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

    "title": "Should we want God to exist?",
    "description": "Should we want God to exist? This is the central question in the axiology of theism. Pro-theists say that God’s existence would be a good thing, because if God exists, there is ultimate cosmic justice, human lives are meaningful, and no evil is gratuitous. Anti-theists say that God existence would be a bad thing, because if God’s exists, this invades our privacy, renders morality incoherent, and makes some lives meaningless and absurd. However, little work has been done on the epistemic axiology of theism. This paper seeks to fill that gap and answer the question: would God’s existence be an epistemically good thing? After a brief overview of the main theories of epistemic value, I explore considerations both in favor of epistemic pro-theism and epistemic anti-theism, and ultimately conclude in favor of epistemic pro-theism.\n\nI presented this paper at the Princeton Philosophy of Religion Incubator Conference (May 2021). \n\nHandout available here: http://liz-jackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Handout.pdf\n\n0:00 Talk\n24:01 Q&A\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philoso...\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: @lizjackson111\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

    "title": "Can Taking Pascal's Wager Demonstrate Faith?",
    "description": "Is taking Pascal's wager selfish? In this video, I argue that the answer is no—one can take Pascal's wager with good motives. Further, I argue that taking Pascal's wager can demonstrate either faith or hope. The person of faith and the wagerer have several things in common, including a commitment to God and positive cognitive and conative attitudes toward God’s existence. I also argue that if one’s credences in theism are too low to have faith, the wagerer can still hope that God exists, another commitment-justifying theological virtue. I consider two upshots of my argument, including how my picture provides responses to common objections to Pascal’s wager.\n\nI presented this paper in the Society of Christian Philosophers (SCP) session at the 2021 Pacific Meeting of the American Philosophical Association.

    "description": "What attitude should philosophers take toward their favorite philosophical theories? I argue that the answer is belief and middling to low credence. I begin by discussing why disagreement has motivated many to say philosophers cannot rationally believe their theories, and I explain why the argument from disagreement does not ultimately establish this. Then, I motivate my view in three ways: the first concerns roles for belief and credence, the second provides other cases of rational belief and middling to low credence, and the final explains why believing one’s philosophical theories is superior to endorsing them. I close by discussing implications my view has for the Lockean thesis, the view that there is an important connection between rational belief and rational credence. \n\nI presented this paper in the \"Belief and Credence\" session at the 2021 Eastern Meeting of the American Philosophical Association.\n\nHandout available here: http://liz-jackson.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/APA-handout.pdf\n\n0:00 Talk\n33:55 Q&A\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philosophy/\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: @lizjackson111\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

Finally, we discuss knowledge-first epistemology. \n\nFor some of the theories of knowledge that tried to solve the Gettier problem, see: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/VAt9h6PCnEg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3z8sDiaY65Y\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lyE0xiMjaoI\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philosophy/\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: @lizjackson111\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",

    "description": "In this video, I defend my view of disagreement: conciliationism about credence and steadfastness about belief. I present for about 10 minutes, then there is 5 minutes of Q&A. This was originally presented at the Social (Distance) Epistemology workshop on August 21, 2020. \n\nDownload paper here: https://philpapers.org/rec/JACDDA-2\n\nAbstract of paper: This paper introduces and motivates a solution to a dilemma from peer disagreement. Following Buchak (2021), I argue that peer disagreement puts us in an epistemic dilemma: there is reason to think that our opinions should both change and not change when we encounter disagreement with our epistemic peers. I argue that we can solve this dilemma by changing our credences, but not our beliefs in response to disagreement. I explain how my view solves the dilemma in question, and then offer two additional arguments for it: one related to contents and attitudes, and another related to epistemic peerhood.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my website: http://liz-jackson.com\nFor more on my research: http://liz-jackson.com/research/\nFor popular-level interviews, podcasts, and blog posts I’ve done: http://liz-jackson.com/public-philosophy/\n\nFollow me on social media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lizjackson111\nInstagram: @lizjackson111\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lizjackson111/",
