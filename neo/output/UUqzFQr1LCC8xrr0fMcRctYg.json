    "description": "In this end-of-year installment, we’re sharing a conversation originally released on LEPHT HAND as we take a rare and well-earned brief hiatus from regular publishing or episodes. This pause marks a moment of transition rather than retreat, as both LEPHT HAND and Acid Horizon continue to evolve beyond the podcast form! Closing out the episode is a reflection on Gianni Vattimo’s essay “Beyond the Subject,” engaging questions of weak thought, interpretation, and the limits of the sovereign self. As we close out the year, we’re also preparing a new slate of courses through the Acid Horizon Research Commons, and we look forward to returning soon, welcoming many of you into the classroom in the weeks ahead.\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Why does the figure of the devil keep returning in moments of political panic, social anxiety, and cultural decay? In this episode, we sit down with author Grafton Tanner about exorcism, possession, moral panic, and the strange new life of demonology in contemporary America. We trace how neoliberal collapse, social media, and ideological confusion reanimate the satanic imaginary across the political spectrum. The conversation also explores fear, fantasy, and why authoritarian movements rely on demons—literal or metaphorical—to justify themselves.\n\n\nBoycott Watkins on IG: https://www.instagram.com/boycottwatkins/\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

We discussed Idris' work on the nature of martyrdom, the relation of the insurgent to death, and the political meaning of duty, both to the dead and within the confines of an intolerable life. Reading from Idris latest book, The Revolt Eclipses Whatever the World has to Offer, out this November from Semiotext(e), we unpack the meaning of destituent or \"de-institutionalising\" power, and the prospects for a theory of uprisings which refuse the re-establishment of the very powers they aim to destroy.\n\n\nThe Revolt Eclipses Whatever the World Has to Offer: https://mitpress.mit.edu/9781635902433/the-revolt-eclipses-whatever-the-world-has-to-offer/\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Black Mask, and The Rat during the 60s and 70s in New York. We spoke about Ben’s life and work, from the “redistribution” of garbage to New York’s freshly gentrified Lincoln Centre, breaking into the Pentagon, and helping to inspire the current tactics of the black bloc. Further, we explore the practice of decommodified art against the commercialism of Andy Warhol, and what lessons the radicals of today can learn from the history of a militant, psychedelic surrealism. \n\n\nA new book of interviews with Ben, “Full Circle: A Life in Rebellion” is available now from Detritus Books: https://detritusbooks.com/products/full-circle-a-life-in-rebellion-ben-morea\n\n\nBen is currently making a living through selling his own original artworks, and you can purchase one or more yourselves by getting in contact via his Instragram @ben_morea.

    "description": "What if depression isn’t an illness to cure but a collective mood that reveals the soul of a broken world? In this episode, Mark Fisher meets James Hillman in a conversation that bridges depth psychology and cultural theory, asking how melancholy and mania shape life under late capitalism. Joined by Emma Stamm, we explore the intersections of acid communism and archetypal psychology—from Fisher’s politics of despair to Hillman’s vision of a polytheistic psyche. Together we ask what happens when sadness becomes privatized, and how imagination might restore the collective body of the soul. This is a dialogue on melancholy, manic culture, and the end of capitalist realism—a descent into the psychic undercurrents of our time.\n\nPatreon listeners get access to our extended conversation on ritual, weirding, and the rebirth of imagination in an age of digital exhaustion.\n\n\nEmma's Substack: https://elftheory.substack.com/ \n\n\nEmma's Website: https://www.o-culus.com/ \n\n\nLatest Acid Horizon updates at the time of this episode: https://splitinfinities.substack.com/p/acephalous-vintagia-and-new-thresholds\n\nCorrection: Durations Festival is in November (not October) of 2025\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "In this episode, we present the work of Wasim Said, a comrade from Gaza who has documented the atrocities they and their people have experienced during the ongoing intensification of Israel's genocidal war on Palestine in his first book \"Witness to the Hellfire of Genocide\". The logistics and safety of an interview being made near impossible amidst the horrors, we instead read out a text sent to us by Wasim, and talk to Louis Allday from Liberated Texts who helped bring the book to publication. We discuss the nature of Wasim's struggle as a Palestinian man and as an active practitioner of literature as resistance, the dehumanization of genocide, and the way in which Wasim explicitly uses the medium of writing to transform complicity into witness and responsibility in the consciousness of those who receive his testimony and that of the Palestinian people. \n\n\nYou can purchase the book at https://1804books.com/products/witness-to-the-hellfire-of-genocide?srsltid=AfmBOoq8Kb35jQDsI1l930cLEqugELM2hj9e7j_PZ_qDk7DJNgrAcFkw \n\n\nAnd donate to Wasim's fundraiser at https://chuffed.org/project/141731-hope-in-the-rubble-a-physics-students-journey-from-the-heart-of-gaza .

    "description": "What happens when Deleuze and Hegel are set in violent philosophical encounter over the ruins of Kantian representation? In this episode, we explore how both thinkers attempt to move beyond the categories of judgment and identity to recover the genesis of sense itself. Henry Somers-Hall joins us to trace Deleuze’s path through Kant, Sartre, and Bergson toward a field of pre-individual difference and immanent synthesis. What emerges is a portrait of thought that no longer begins with the subject, but with the forces that make thinking possible.\n\n\nExtended Conversation (Patrons Only)\n In the extended discussion, we turn to the politics of the practical in Kant, Fichte, and Hegel—and ask whether Deleuze’s constructivism truly escapes the metaphysical State.

    "description": "What does it mean to live in a world where relationships can vanish overnight, without explanation or closure? In this episode, Acid Horizon speaks with cultural theorist Dominic Pettman about his new book Ghosting: On Disappearance (Polity Press). Together we explore how ghosting unsettles intimacy, accountability, and narrative finality, reaching beyond dating apps into friendships, families, workplaces, and politics. Along the way we trace ghosting as both a form of psychic violence and a survival tactic, a symptom of our digitally mediated lives and a mirror of deeper patterns of absence in contemporary culture.\n\n\nGet the book: https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=ghosting-on-disappearance--9781509569946#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGhosting%3A%20On%20Disappearance%2C%20takes,tend%20to%20no%20longer%20believe.%E2%80%9D\n\n\nDiscount code: GHO20\n\n\nTickets for Durations Festival 2025: https://dice.fm/bundles/durations-2025-b5eo?dice_id=M7371ecc8865&_branch_match_id=1500447579897861230&utm_source=web&utm_campaign=visit_bundle&utm_medium=bundle&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz8nMy9ZLyUxO1UvL1fc1NzY3TE1OtrAwM7WvK0pNSy0qysxLj08qyi8vTi2ydc4oys9NBQDPsz4mOwAAAA%3D%3D\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "What if the very idea of Western Marxism has less to do with geography than with defeat? In this episode of Acid Horizon, we dive into Domenico Losurdo’s controversial use of the term and ask what’s at stake in his defense of actually existing socialism against its critics. With our guest Ross Wolfe, we explore the tangled afterlives of Western Marxism—from the Frankfurt School to structuralism, from Stalinism to contemporary China. Along the way we confront the uncomfortable question: do today’s neo-Stalinist revivals echo tendencies on the far right as much as they do Marxist traditions?

In this episode, we sit down with Professor Philip Bennett and David Silver, executive director of the Wilhelm Reich Museum, to explore Reich’s groundbreaking ideas on therapy, character armor, and the enduring relevance of The Mass Psychology of Fascism. Together we trace his path from psychoanalysis to Marxism to work democracy, and discuss the controversies surrounding his later scientific experiments at Orgonon in Rangeley, Maine. Along the way, we consider how Reich’s struggle against repression and authoritarianism continues to speak to our present moment.\n\nThe Wilhelm Reich Museum in Rangeley, Maine preserves Reich’s historic home, laboratory, and archives. Visitors can explore the striking stone observatory, original orgone accumulators, and breathtaking views of the lakes and mountains. The museum is located at 19 Orgonon Circle (Dodge Pond Road), PO Box 687, Rangeley, ME 04970, and you can find more details online at wilhelmreichmuseum.org.\n\nIf you’re nearby, consider visiting during the museum’s open season to experience Reich’s legacy in person.",

In this episode we speak with Joseph Albernaz, author of Common Measures: Romanticism and the Groundlessness of Community, about the radical lineage running from Blake and Hölderlin to Marx and Bataille. We explore how Romantic literature conceived “groundless community”—a poetic and ecological alternative to enclosure and collective identity—and how those ideas reverberate through scene-shaping thinkers like Bataille, Derrida, Nancy, and Moten.

    "description": "What happens when the dialectic between Sartre and Fanon is not one of influence, but of mutual transformation? Today we're live at Webster’s in State College with Tyrique Mack-Georges, who returns to the podcast to discuss his research on seriality, group infusion, and the possibility of a new humanity. Together, we explore how Sartre’s Critique of Dialectical Reason illuminates Fanon’s revolutionary project, and how Fanon, in turn, reorients Sartre’s ethics. This is a conversation about stretching Marxism, confronting racial capitalism, and recovering the lost art of collective praxis.\n\nTyrique: @tyorrique",

    "description": "What if the history of feminism wasn’t only a story of liberation—but also one of betrayal, reaction, and complicity? In this episode of Acid Horizon, we speak with Michael Richmond and Alex Charnley, authors of Fascism and the Women's Cause, about the forgotten histories of white feminist collaboration with the far right—from the suffrage movement to the Ku Klux Klan and the British Union of Fascists. Together we explore how transphobia, liberalism, and racial capitalism converge in today’s so-called “gender-critical” movements. This is a conversation about fractures on the left, the dangers of respectable reaction, and why we must fight for a feminism that refuses fascism.\n\n\nBuy the book: https://www.ebb-magazine.com/books/p/fascism-and-the-womens-cause\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

In this episode, we’re joined once again by Stuart Kendall to explore Georges Bataille’s On Nietzsche, a fragmented, intimate, and disorienting text written in the final years of World War II. We examine how Nietzsche becomes not just a philosophical reference but a companion for Bataille—a figure through whom Bataille grapples with sovereignty, death, and the limits of knowledge. From Sartre’s accusations of mysticism to the will to chance as a response to fascism and nuclear horror, we trace how On Nietzsche opens up an ethics of risk, uselessness, and survival.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

In this episode, Richard Gilman-Opalsky joins us to discuss the political force of utopian thinking, the ongoing tension between Marxism and anarchism, and the need to move beyond stale demands for “practical” revolution. Drawing from his two most recent books— Imaginary Power, Real Horizons: The Practicality of Utopianism—as well as Communist Ontologies (with Bruno Gullì) from Minor Compositions, we explore the imagination as a site of material struggle, the persistence of Cold War ideology, and the overlooked revolutionary power of small things.

    "description": "Buy the Book: https://www.versobooks.com/products/977-the-future-of-revolution?srsltid=AfmBOopbQABhI9H6efsVC8cJLfIxh2LNXMqxpppbp8xUVVnxNMtAyEPc \n\nHow might a twenty-first-century revolution against class society succeed?\n\n\nCommunism comes from the future, but its hopes haunt our past. Reading revolutionary history from the Paris Commune to the George Floyd Uprising by the light of communist theory, from Marx to C. L. R. James, The Future of Revolution illuminates the possibilities for overcoming class society in the twenty-first century.\n\nWhen Marx wrote that the Paris Commune of 1871 showed that “the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes,” he identified a principle that will remain true as long as capitalism and its class antagonism persist. Historical revolutions reveal essential features of our communist horizon, which would-be revolutionaries, then as now, must negotiate one way or another. In chapters that move from a critical history of the workers’ council to a reading of Marx’s theory of value as an inverted description of communism, Jasper Bernes synthesizes from a history of failure the key criteria for success. He defines for our present moment the urgent mission of the world proletariat.\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Follow Vintagia now: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/acidhorizon/vintagia-i-ching-oracle-for-psychogeographers-and-creatives\n\nWhat if capitalism isn’t just an economic system—but a transcendental structure that configures our very experience? In this episode, philosopher Henry Somers-Hall helps us unravel Deleuze and Guattari’s enigmatic claim that capitalism is an axiomatic system. Drawing from Kant, set theory, and the metaphysics of representation, we explore how capital binds and rebinds flows—subjects, territories, even revolt itself. Together we ask: what becomes of revolution when even resistance can be axiomatized?\n\nHenry's paper: https://henrysomershall.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/somers-hall-binding-and-axiomatics.pdf\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Laruelle proposes a mysticism stripped of transcendence and doctrine—one grounded in solitude, immanence, and the irreducibility of lived experience. Our guest, translator Jeremy R. Smith, helps unpack Laruelle’s challenge to Neoplatonism, dialectics, and the pedagogical authority of philosophy. Along the way, we consider how this \"unlearned knowing\" might offer tools for thinking mysticism on the left, beyond both theology and theory.\n\nVision-in-One or Unlearned Knowing: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n-i7-kfCt_ykSxrMrUIeNxLwLKcCzcl3LbSJCR_etVQ/edit?tab=t.0 \n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "What happens when the ego fails to form a symbol? In this episode of Acid Horizon, we're joined by Dr. Ben Morsa, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalytic thinker working at the intersection of queer theory, neurodiversity, and mental health. Together, we dive into Melanie Klein’s pivotal essay The Importance of Symbol Formation, examining how sadism, fantasy, and ego development shape our early psychic life. We explore Klein’s controversial case of “Dick” and how her analysis anticipates modern discussions of autism, while also considering the implications of her work through the lens of Deleuze and Guattari. Dr. Morsa offers critical insight into the enduring tensions between diagnosis, subjectivity, and the symbolic order—and asks whether the failure to symbolize might offer a form of resistance rather than pathology. This episode is a rich synthesis of psychoanalysis, philosophy, and the radical potentials of care.\n\nConnect with Ben's work: www.tidepools.org (http://www.tidepools.org/) \n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Together, we examine how ketamine—favored by Silicon Valley elites like Elon Musk—has become  the drug of the techno-fascist sacrament, fueling disassociation and delusions of divine-like Promethean capitalism. Drawing on personal encounters and haunting hallucinations, Taija explores how the drug mirrors and intensifies a chimerical ruling-class subjectivity in which power is sanctified through suffering and algorithmic detachment.

Together, we unpack how anarchism operates not merely as a political program, but as an ethical and temporal force—a heterotopia that resists monolingualism, sovereign authority, and the foreclosure of otherness. Nicholas discusses the right to opacity, indirect reciprocity, and an anarchist ethics of reading that dismantles institutional power while cultivating new forms of literacy and solidarity. Drawing on the work of Glissant, Levinas, Derrida, and others, this conversation maps a terrain where impossibility becomes the site of political and philosophical renewal. We also reflect on the prospects for anarchist institutions, public pedagogy, and the future of thought in an age of digital unthinking.\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

From Tommy Robinson’s fake D-Day fantasy to deepfake misogyny and the mutual aid ecosystem of right-wing tech barons, we explore how artificial intelligence has become the dark mirror of their political libidinal economy.\n\n\nArticle: https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/\n\nDEATH // SENTENCE: https://pod.link/1330059162\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

From PayPal to Palantir, his vision has shifted from decentralization to a fusion of state and corporate control, aligning himself with the rising forces of the new right. In this episode, we examine his 2009 essay The Education of a Libertarian, tracing the contradictions in his ideology and the deeper implications of his political influence today. Joined by Dr. Gregory Sadler, we explore Thiel’s evolution, his role in shaping contemporary conservatism, and what his vision means for the future of democracy and governance.\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

The conversation examines how Jung’s model of psychic energy may have influenced Deleuze and Guattari’s reconceptualization of desire in Anti-Oedipus, particularly in the shift from a repressed, Oedipal unconscious to a dynamic model of desiring-production. Jung’s tensions with Freud, his engagement with myth, and the role of archetypes as energetic processes rather than static typologies are central to the discussion, as is the way his work has been co-opted and misrepresented by figures like Jordan Peterson. The group also unpacks Jung’s connections to Spinoza, his late-career interest in synchronicity, and how his Red Book offers a more radical and experiential engagement with the unconscious than his later, more systematized theories suggest.

    "description": "Buy Hexen 2.0 Tarot and the forthcoming Hexen 5.0 Tarot: https://cosmogenesis.world\n\nPreview Hexen 5.0's: new images: https://www.suzannetreister.net/HEXEN_5/HEXEN5.html\n\nLars Bang Larson's Essay: https://www.suzannetreister.net/HEXEN2/HEXEN_2_LBLessay.html\n\nNote: if you were watching the tarot deck flip through on YouTube, you are seeing the Hexen 2.0 deck.\n\nAbout the new deck:\n\nHEXEN 5.0, an update of HEXEN 2.0 (2011), presents a critical, historical and mystical exploration of new global developments in terrestrial and interplanetary technologies, science and communications, corporate and governmental forces, the ecosystem and climate crisis, recent and traditional fields of knowledge and spirituality, new branches of bio/socio/political theory, contemporary countercultural and futuristic movements, new directions in science-fiction, and proposed possible solutions for an ethical survival of the human race.\n\nThe visual structure of the works is largely based on alchemical drawings of the 13th - 18th centuries, entwining these subjects into a holistic mystical space where they become differently animated and resonant. In alchemical drawings, science, art and religion/spirituality co-exist, echoing the recently converging fields illuminated in some of the cards, such as Spiritual Ecology, Nexus thinking and Earth System Science, fields which may lead to better solutions for the climate crisis and to returning the planet towards a self-regulating system.\n\nWhere HEXEN 2.0 analysed the legacy of cybernetics as embodied in Web 2.0 and systems of control, showing how Web 2.0 works as a societal controlling system, HEXEN 5.0 traces cybernetics' relevance to whole earth systems and how the cybernetic self-regulating feedback loops of the planetary ecosystem, which we have sent out of whack, need to be addressed through an understanding of the workings of the total global ecosystem. This is embodied in the aims of Earth System Science and potentially in an even more holistic system incorporating traditional knowledges and spirituality.\n\nThe published deck of tarot cards is intended to be used as a tool for groups to discuss and envision positive alternative futures and may be used in conjunction with HEXEN 2.0 Tarot deck.\n\nSupport the show\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

We discuss the male loneliness epidemic, stoic ideals, and the harmful influence of figures like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson. Chuck shares insights from his therapeutic work, integrating Deleuze and Guattari, Hillman, and Gendlin. We examine the historical provider archetype, the performativity of male friendships, and social media’s role in fostering disconnectedness. Chuck also introduces an active imagination exercise to help clients connect with their emotions.

While the spotlight often shines on the actions of charismatic leaders such as Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, the true peril lies elsewhere. Defeating these people will not stem the tide driving them forward. They are merely the embodiment of profound forces that are rarely understood. Propelled through the vast networks of social media and fueled by far-right influencers, enthralled by images of disaster and fantasies of doom, they have emerged from a reservoir of societal despair, fear, and isolation. Within this seething cauldron, we witness not only the surge of far-right political movements but also the sparks of individual and collective violence against perceived enemies, from ‘lone wolf’ killers to terrifying pogroms. Should a new fascism emerge, it will coalesce from these very elements. This is disaster nationalism.\n\nRichard Seymour delves deep into this alarming development in world politics, dissecting its roots, its influencers, and the threats it poses. With meticulous analysis and compelling storytelling, Seymour offers a stark warning. The battle against disaster nationalism is not just political; it is a struggle for our collective soul and the future of civilization itself. Unless we understand the deeper forces propelling the far-right resurgence, we have little chance of stopping it.\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Acid Horizon was proud to collaborate with this event, bringing together leading thinkers to interrogate the cultural, ethical, and political frameworks through which extinction is commonly understood.\n\n\nIn this talk, Claire challenges anthropocentric assumptions underlying ecological and ethical debates, urging a reconsideration of extinction beyond human survival and crisis narratives.

Launching on Kickstarter October 31, 2024!: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/acephalous/acephalous-the-erotic-tarot-of-georges-bataille\n\nStep into the serene quiet of Nietzsche-Haus with me as we take an ASMR walking tour through this storied space in Sils Maria, Switzerland. Here, at Via da Marias 67, where Nietzsche spent his summers from 1881 to 1888, we'll explore each room that sheltered the musings of a mind that forever changed philosophy. Through these walls, Nietzsche crafted some of his most profound works, and today, we'll walk the floors that once echoed with his thoughts.\n\nNietzsche-Haus is more than just a museum—it’s a preserved time capsule, featuring original pieces from his Basel home. The atmosphere here feels like a whisper from the past, an intimate link to Nietzsche’s world.\n\nJoin me as we meander through this quiet, contemplative space, with only the softest sounds to accompany us, revealing the inspiration that shaped an era.\n\n(Filmed on October 9th, 2024)\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Join the Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nIn this monologue, Sereptie explores the fascinating intersections of alchemy, psychoanalysis, and poststructuralist philosophy. The discussion centers around the concept of alchemical salt, its significance in Renaissance alchemical traditions, and its appropriation in 20th-century psychological theories. This episode connects these ideas with the works of Carl Jung, James Hillman, and Jacques Derrida, offering a unique perspective on the formation and function of subjectivity and how they challenge the polemics of Jordan Peterson.\n\n\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

In response to the idea that new technological devices expand our freedom, he argues that they lead to burnout and self-absorption and that we must redevelop contemplative practices which slow us down and open us up. He has brought to his thought forms of deep cosmopolitanism developed from both Zen Buddhism and a renewed Romanticism.\n\nThis book is the first critical introduction to Han’s body of work. Knepper, Stoneman, and Wyllie explore Han’s rich oeuvre to date and his incisive contributions to a range of disciplines, including critical theory, media studies, political philosophy, and aesthetics. They unpack his key terms and illustrate his concepts with a range of examples, revealing how the critiques of the “achievement society” and burnout, which have earned Han a global audience, build on his earlier accounts of power, violence, and mood. This broader view addresses the most frequent criticisms of Han and makes a compelling case that he is not only an insightful diagnostician of the present moment but one whose interpretation of both Western and Eastern traditions offers wisdom for navigating the now acute problems of modernity.\n\nThis lively book is essential reading for anyone getting to grips with Han’s extraordinary work.\n\nSupport the Show.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Purchase 'Biopolitics as a System of Thought' from Bloomsbury: https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/biopolitics-as-a-system-of-thought-9781350412095/\n\nOur contemporary mode of life is characterised by what Serene Richards in Biopolitics as a System of Thought calls: Smart Being. Smart Being believes in the solutions of techno-capital where living is always at stake and directed to survival. Armed with this concept, this book examines how we arrived at this mode of being and asks how it could be that, while the material conditions of our lives have increasingly worsened, our capacities for effective political action, understood as the capacity for transforming our existing social relations, appear to be diminishing.\n\nDrawing from jurists and philosophers such as Pierre Legendre, Yan Thomas, Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, Richards argues that biopolitics intervenes at the most minute level of our everyday lives. She argues that there are conceptual truths presupposed in the mode of biopolitics' functioning, for instance that life can be assigned a value for the purpose of intervention, abandonment, or death, which have implications for our politics. In exciting engagements with political movements such as the post-May 1968 Mouvement des travailleurs Arabes (MTA), Richards shows how demands to transform our system of social relations are undermined by institutional models that proffer to offer rights protection while simultaneously annihilating the living altogether. Through a reappraisal of law, governance and capital, Richards seeks to reconceptualise our collectivity of thought, arguing for a politics of destitution that could form the basis of a communism to come.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Buy 'Journey to Mexico: Revolutionary Messages & the Tarahumara' (Contra Mundum Press) with introduction by Stuart Kendall: https://www.contramundumpress.com/journey-to-mexico\n\n'Dionysus Speed' (Contra Mundum Press): https://www.contramundumpress.com/product-page/dionysos-speed\n\nAbout  'Journey to Mexico: Revolutionary Messages & the Tarahumara':\n\nOn 10 January 1936, the poet, actor, and dramatic theorist, Antonin Artaud departed Europe on a journey to Mexico that would take him from the streets, cafés, and lecture halls of Mexico City to the remote mountains of the Sierra Tarahumara. The journey would last only ten months, culminating in some six to eight weeks spent among the Tarahumara (Rarámuri), but it was a profound turning point in his life.\n\n   Artaud didn’t just leave Europe. He fled it. “I came to Mexico to escape European civilization … I hoped to find a vital form of culture.” The vital form of culture that he sought was one wherein individual and communal behaviors were rooted in the soil of a place, wherein the rituals of religion reinforced a connection in human lives between the earth and the sun.\n\n   But Artaud’s search for a vital form of culture would not be a simple one. His appeal to indigenous culture would first require an intense and intricate effort at aesthetic, religious, political, and philosophical decolonization. And this intellectual work would not be without a psychological cost.\n\n   Journey to Mexico collects very nearly all of Artaud’s writings related to his voyage to the land of the Tarahumara: the writings he prepared prior to this journey; the pieces he published in Mexico and the lectures he delivered there; the essays, letters, and poems that he wrote in the years after his journey, reflecting on and reframing his experiences. A selection of letters written before, during, and after the trip conveys the very personal — the physical, emotional, and financial — challenges of the journey. \n\n   Artaud’s Journey to Mexico takes us far from home to the limits of art and anthropology, myth and religion, to confront the legacies of colonial conquest and the possibility of decolonization in a desperate search for a “vital form of culture.”\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "title": "Who Made the Planet Sad? Dominic Pettman and Eugene Thacker's 'Sad Planets'",
    "description": "Buy the book from Polity: https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=sad-planets--9781509562350\n\nSad PlanetsDominic Pettman, Eugene Thacker“Everything is sad,” wrote the Ancient poets. But is this sadness merely a human experience, projected onto the world, or is there a gloom attributable to the world itself? Could the universe be forever weeping the “tears of things”?\n \nIn this series of meditations, Dominic Pettman and Eugene Thacker explore some of the key “negative affects” – both eternal and emergent – associated with climate change, environmental destruction, and cosmic solitude. In so doing they unearth something so obvious that it has gone largely unnoticed: the question of how we should feel about climate change. Between the information gathered by planetary sensors and the simple act of breathing the air, new unsettling moods are produced for which we currently lack an adequate language. Should we feel grief over the loss of our planet? Or is the strange feeling of witnessing mass extinction an indicator that the planet was never “ours” to begin with? Sad Planets explores this relationship between our all-too-human melancholia and a more impersonal sorrow, nestled in the heart of the cosmic elements.\n\nSpanning a wide range of topics – from the history of cosmology to the “existential threat” of climate change – this book is a reckoning with the limits of human existence and comprehension. As Pettman and Thacker observe, never before have we known so much about the planet and the cosmos, and yet never before have we felt so estranged from that same planet, to say nothing of the stars beyond.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "title": "Technic and Magic: Politics, Neoplatonism, and the Limits of Language with Federico Campagna",
    "description": "Federico's 'The Last Night' on Zer0 Books: https://www.collectiveinkbooks.com/zer0-books/our-books/last-night\n\nTechnic and Magic: https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/technic-and-magic-9781350044036/\n\nWe take for granted that only certain kind of things exist – electrons but not angels, passports but not nymphs. This is what we understand as 'reality'. But in fact, 'reality' varies with each era of the world, in turn shaping the field of what is possible to do, think and imagine. Our contemporary age has embraced a troubling and painful form of reality: Technic.\n\nUnder Technic, the foundations of reality begin to crumble, shrinking the field of the possible and freezing our lives in an anguished state of paralysis. Technic and Magic shows that the way out of the present deadlock lies much deeper than debates on politics or economics. By drawing from an array of Northern and Southern sources – spanning from Heidegger, Junger and Stirner's philosophies, through Pessoa's poetry, to Advaita Vedanta, Bhartrhari, Ibn Arabi, Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra's theosophies – Magic is presented as an alternative system of reality to Technic. While Technic attempts to capture the world through an 'absolute language', Magic centres its reconstruction of the world around the notion of the 'ineffable' that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nTechnic and Magic is an original philosophical work, and a timely cultural intervention. It disturbs our understanding of the structure of reality, while restoring it in a new form. This is possibly the most radical act: if we wish to change our world, first we have to change the idea of 'reality' that defines it.\n\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast) \n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nCurrent classes at Acid Horizon Research Commons (AHRC): https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/ahrc-main\n\nWebsite: https://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n \n\nBoycott Watkins Media: https://xenogothic.com/2025/03/17/boycott-watkins-statement/\n \n\nJoin The Schizoanalysis Project: https://discord.gg/4WtaXG3Qxn\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast: https://pod.link/1512615438\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform: https://pod.link/1512615438\n \n\nLEPHT HAND: https://www.patreon.com/LEPHTHAND\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Workers of the world unite, we have nothing to lose but our chains! But just who is this ‘we’? How do we identify the proletariat, the revolutionary subject, and how does the proletariat identify itself in the midst of an intensifying threat of economic precarity and capitalist immiseration. This ‘we’, to quote Wilhelm Weitling, is a tricky question. Today we’re taking a dive into Historical Materialism with the latest book in the series “The Poetry of Class: Romantic Anti-Capitalism and the Invention of the Proletariat”, with author Patrick Eiden-Offe and translator Jacob Blumenfeld. We discuss the work of Weitling, Marx, Engels, Hess, Tieck, and Lukacs in exploring re-evaluations of Romantic Anti-Capitalism, and the leftist literary scene today.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Awareness and diagnoses have exploded in recent years, but we are still missing a wider understanding of how we got here and why. Beyond simplistic narratives of normativity and difference, this groundbreaking book exposes the very myth of the 'normal' brain as a product of intensified capitalism.\n\nExploring the rich histories of the neurodiversity and disability movements, Robert Chapman shows how the rise of capitalism created an 'empire of normality' that transformed our understanding of the body into that of a productivity machine.\n\nNeurodivergent liberation is possible - but only by challenging the deepest logics of capitalism. Empire of Normality is an essential guide to understanding the systems that shape our bodies, minds and deepest selves - and how we can undo them.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nhttps://www.acidhorizonpodcast.com/\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Based on extensive original research including interview research with a range of practitioners involved in dealing with the phenomenon, the book outlines how hikikomori expresses itself, how it is treated and dealt with and how it has been perceived and regarded in Japan over time. The author, a clinical psychologist with extensive experience of practice, argues that the phenomenon although socially unacceptable is not homogenous, and can be viewed not as a mental disorder, but as an idiom of distress, a passive and effective way of resisting the many great pressures of Japanese schooling and of Japanese society more widely.\n\nAdditional links from Nicolas:\n\nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/402724/patients-thousands-of-times-more-likely-to-be-restrained-in-japanese-hospitals#:~:text=In%20Japan%2C%20the%20practice%20of,hospitals%20on%2030%20June%2C%202017.\n\nHikikomori Rehab\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4A110KqLdY&list=PLKOllzfW5Tlwv6AkpDZup4YiD1qfIpKgk&index=19 \n\nHikikomori demo\n\nhttps://www.shonen.info/hiku\n\nJapanalysis\n\nhttps://www.cairn-int.info/revue-research-in-psychoanalysis-2022-1-page-27.htm\n\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

Scott speaks of silence, often indirectly, in such ways as to create occasions in which people might become more aware of silence in their experiences of themselves and the world around them. The core question of the book is: how can people be aware of silence without turning it into a thing and losing it? Lack of awareness of silence is lack of awareness of a major dimension of lives, both human and nonhuman. Attunements with silence enable attunements with being alive in the fragility that invests even the strengths of living beings. Telling Silence performs this attunement in descriptive accounts and instances of non-reflective awareness, awareness that does not deliberate or ponder. In twenty-three \"fragments,\" poems, stories, and ways of thinking and speaking are brought together to intensify intimations of silence telling of itself.\n\nCharles E. Scott is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, Vanderbilt University and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, Pennsylvania State University. He is the author of numerous books including Living with Indifference, The Lives of Things, and The Time of Memory.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/anti-oculus-a-philosophy-of-escape/\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "In this series of videos, we will highlight key themes from Gilles Deleuze's 1962 text 'Nietzsche & Philosophy'. \n\nThis video covers the preface addressed to the translator, Hugh Tomlinson. In this section of the text, Deleuze outlines some of the key themes which preside over his interpretation: Deleuze's novel approach to Nietzsche's \"theory of forces\", the will to power, and the eternal return. Also, Deleuze cites Nietzsche as a key figure in overturning the traditional or dogmatic \"image of thought\" of Western philosophy.\n\nFrom August of 2023 until the end of the year, Acid Horizon is hosting reading group on 'Nietzsche & Philosophy'.

This series argues that Nietzsche’s most important ethical and political commitments are better realized through a form of radical egalitarianism rather than through the aristocratic figure imagined by Nietzsche himself. The concepts in focus are amor fati, the pathos of distance vs. the pathos of difference, and the will to power.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "title": "A Reading of Antonin Artaud's \"New Revelations of Being\"",
    "description": "From ' Artaud 1937 Apocalypse':\n\n\"Antonin Artaud’s journey to Ireland in 1937 marked an extraordinary—and apocalyptic—turning point in his life and career. After publishing the manifesto The New Revelations of Being about the “catastrophic immediate-future,” Artaud abruptly left Paris for Ireland, remaining there for six weeks without money. Traveling first to the isolated island of Inishmore off Ireland’s western coast, then to Galway, and finally to Dublin, Artaud was eventually arrested as an undesirable alien, beaten by the police, and summarily deported back to France. On his return, he spent nine years in asylums, remaining there through the entire span of World War II.\n\nDuring his fateful journey, Artaud wrote letters to friends in Paris which included several “magic spells,” intended to curse his enemies and protect his friends from the city’s forthcoming incineration and the Antichrist’s appearance. (To André Breton, he wrote: “It’s the Unbelievable—yes, the Unbelievable—it’s the Unbelievable which is the truth.”) This book collects all of Artaud’s surviving correspondence from his time in Ireland, as well as photographs of the locations he traveled through. Featuring an afterword and notes by the book’s translator, Stephen Barber, this edition marks the seventieth anniversary of Artaud’s death.\"\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

How are Sadism and Masochism problems not only of psychology, but logical problems of philosophy and the limits of reason? How does the economy of each relation to one's self and the other pose not only ethical, but political and ecological problems for thought today? Adam, Craig, and Noah are joined by researcher Tiger Liu, who recently finished a graduate dissertation on Masochism, psychoanalysis,  and General Economy to discuss the legacies of this conjecture, and the new lines of flight that can be revealed in light of Sacher-Masoch and his legacy.\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "title": "The Limit of the Useful: Bataille, War, and Fascism",
    "description": "In the decade prior to the publication of Inner Experience (L'expérience intérieure), the twentieth-century French philosopher Georges Bataille produced a nascent masterwork containing some of his most original and extensive reflections on a range of subjects. With thoughts on ritual sacrifice and military conquest, the nature of laughter, and the mechanisms of capitalism, The Limit of the Useful, as Bataille had planned to title the work, illuminates the philosopher's later corpus, yet it remained unfinished and unpublished in his lifetime, and untranslated until now. \n\nThis is the first English-language translation of what Cory Austin Knudson and Tomas Elliott argue is one of Bataille's most structurally consistent works. Paired with draft essays and plans for The Accursed Share, along with over a hundred pages of appendixes and notes, the volume distinctively elaborates Bataille's thought. The Limit of the Useful spans a decade of rich intellectual ferment in Bataille's life as he first formulated his challenge to capitalism, engaging with concepts and ideas in ways not seen in his other published works. The volume bridges the gap between Bataille's surrealist literary writings and later scientific pretensions, drawing attention to, and filling in, an overlooked lacuna in his oeuvre.\n\nThe book: https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047333/the-limit-of-the-useful/\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nZer0 Books and Repeater Media Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/zer0repeater\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Formed anonymously in the late 1990s, Tiqqun's two journals still remain fundamental to the insurrectionary counter-tradition. Today, we give you a small reading of one of their more enigmatic pieces from TIQQUN #1, \"The Great Game of Civil War\". Following in Foucauldian footsteps, Tiqqun provides an account of the political and the juridical mediated through the lens of a dispersed civil war across the social field. This brief provocation strikes at the core of all that biopolitical modernity attempts to render either mundane or merely historically necessary. \n\nLive Communism, Spread Anarchy.\n\nLove,\nAcid Horizon\n\nThe reading: https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/tiqqun-the-great-game-of-civil-war\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "title": "Dissemblage: an Interview with Gerald Raunig",
    "description": "Following Dividuum (2015), Gerald Raunig presents the second volume of “Machinic Capitalism and Molecular Revolution.” Dissemblage unfolds a wild abundance of material of unruliness, from the multilingual translation machines of Al-Andalus to the queer mysticism of the High Middle Ages, from the small voices of the falsetto in 20th century jazz and soul to today’s disjointures and subjunctures against the smooth city in machinic capitalism.\n\nIn this volume Gerald Raunig not only develops a conceptual ecology of concepts of joining and jointing, but also undertakes an experiment in theoretical form. Semi-fictional interweaves with meticulously researched historical sources, mystical writings with letters from friends, philosophical fragments with poetic ritornellos. More than a narrative about dissemblages from social surrounds, thing-worlds, and ghost-worlds, the book itself is a dividual multiplicity in form and content, out of joint, in the joints, dissemblage.\n\n'Dissemblage': https://autonomedia.org/product/dissemblage-machinic-capitalism-and-molecular-revolutiongerald-raunig/\n\nHere is a link to the audio we mention at the end: https://transversal.at/ungefuege43-en\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOrder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Author, blogger, and photographer Matt Colquhoun joins us (as promised) for a first look at a compilation of last lectures given by Mark Fisher at Goldsmiths in 2016.  The lecture series on postcapitalist desire intends to explore the seemingly unsurpassable milieu of global capitalism and its pervasive affectivity.  Through figures like Marcus, Lukacs, Lyotard, Marx, and Deleuze and Guattari, Fisher explores possibilities for our collective extrication from capital. In the interview, we reflect on Fisher's acumen as a teacher and mentor as we take on elements of the project he left behind.\n\nPostcapitalist Desire: The Final Lectures: https://repeaterbooks.com/product/postcapitalist-desire-the-final-lectures/\n\nSupport the podcast:\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/acidhorizon\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nPreorder 'The Philosopher's Tarot': https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-philosophers-tarot/\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "In this episode, Adam takes us through Mark Fisher's concept of Capitalist Realism, and how the concept developed across Fisher's theoretical writings. Adam focuses on how the notion is deployed in his 2009 book Capitalist Realism, and how it is reformulated in his Introduction to the unfinished Acid Communism text. Adam takes us through the aspects of melancholia and depressive psychology in Capitalist Realism, its psychological and social mechanisms, and how the question of the geopolitics of Capitalist Realism and neoliberalism shifted in Fisher's analysis from a Cold War East-West focus to one that centres the imperialist destruction of communism in Latin America. Reflecting on contemporary social movements such as anti-raids groups and school strikes, Fisher's optimism for a post-capitalist desire is illustrated through the reframing of Capitalist Realism in Acid Communism, a project which reaffirms that all consciousness is malleable and the site of an active struggle, a struggle haunted by the spectre of a world that could be free.\n\nTranscript: https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com/2022/07/17/transcript-from-capitalist-realism-to-acid-communism/\n\nAcid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nDestratified (Matt’s Blog): https://destratified.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

What does “capture” mean in the work of Deleuze and Guattari? How is the subject of capital captured? In what ways does the cybernetic present redefine the nature of our social subjection? How can we resist capture? This discussion ranges from pontifications about neoliberal theories of “human capital” to the function of Nielsen ratings at the advent of a society defined by its mechanisms of control.

    "description": "On this episode Craig, Will, Matt, and Adam take a close look at Gilles Deleuze's essay \"Immanence: A Life\", one of his final writings in which he describes immanence as a 'transcendental field'. Deleuze makes use of a lesser known work by Charles Dickens entitled “The Same Respected Friend in More Aspects Than One\", casting the events of the story as a paradigmatic example of  how singularities and their manners of expression are distinct from processes of individuation. This discussion approaches some of the ethical implications that might be drawn from Deleuze's work on immanence.\n\nLARB essay: https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-singular-and-yet-non-arbitrary-life/\n\nSubscribe to Acid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nDestratified (Matt’s Blog): https://destratified.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "On this episode we're going to be looking at the work of Aime Césaire, focusing on his 1950 work Discourse on Colonialism, Césaire was a Martinician poet and communist politician who was one of the leading figures in the emancipatory movements of the French-speaking colonial sphere, as well as a poetic voice central to the cultivation of contemporary forms of radical political blackness. In the discourse on Colonialism he poetically and powerfully exposes the hypocrisy and ideological brutality of European colonialism and its inherent dehumanizing violence, a violence which not only debases the colonized, but also dehumanizes the colonizer in its fascist becomings. Césaire questions the abstractness of the universality that European ideology pretends to embody, and encourages us to imagine new living universalities of fraternity and abundance, shaping the coming horizon of the decolonial future.\n\nSubscribe to Acid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nDestratified (Matt’s Blog): https://destratified.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/ and https://thecominginsurrection.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "On this episode, the gang takes a look at Antonio Negri’s and Felix Guattari’s 1985 cowritten essay, “Communists Like US”. Guattari and Negri take a look at the state of socialist governmentality and examine the causes of the failure of the worker movement in Italy in the late seventies. The outlook seems bleak, but in these developments Negri and Guattari identify various communist potentialities in various opposition movements. Through a new pluralist approach, one that affirms singularities and seeks newer registers of solidarity, they see a promising future. This episode also explores the various schisms, some of which manifest in the discussion itself, that exist within the autonomist movements themselves. Whether you want to affirm the multitude or spread anarchy, this episode has something for you.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nApple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nDestratified (Matt’s Blog): https://destratified.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/",

Chuck takes us through his influences from the Positive Psychologist Carl Rogers to Gilles Deleuze and Alfred North Whitehead, and explains the methods of an inclusive and empathetic therapeutic approach as well as how the pandemic has impacted how people receive and relate to their own therapeutic as well as everyday experiences. Later on in the episode, we talk to Chuck about his current project on the experience of grief. Together, we examine the structure of grief in the economy of loss, and its repression predominantly in male contexts, as we consider grieving in a variety of concepts; from the loss of a loved one to the loss of a sense of one’s world as well as the grief that comes from the loss of a political future.\n\nYou can listen to Chuck’s podcast, Couch to Couch, here: https://open.spotify.com/show/2KHIRPerXEenEKOTV5X22n?si=ba824abb7b0f4733\n\nIf you’re interested in contacting Chuck about any therapeutic services, you can check out his website here: https://chuckleblanccounselling.ca/\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\nApple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\nDestratified (Matt’s Blog): https://destratified.com/\n\nRevolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\nSplit Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\nMusic: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/",

    "description": "Today we’re joined by Dr Terry D. Thomson to discuss his work on Kant’s final, most esoteric, and most understudied philosophical work—his “chief achievement” as he called it—the Opus Postumum. This text is Kant’s attempt to radicalize his own philosophical process, rending the project of his three critiques from their ossifications as dogmas, and opening up a new space for the philosophy of experience—on the ontological, anthropological, and cosmological level, in the promise of an absolute system of ethereal forces. Terry joins us fresh from completing his doctoral thesis on the Opus Postumum And, using the work of Kant scholar Howard Caygill as a base, together we’re going to be pushing to the very limits of transcendental Idealism, in pursuit of the cosmic force of human experience. Other thinkers in the discussion include Deleuze, Hegel, Schelling, Lichtenberg, Spinoza.\n\nTerry's work: https://kingston.academia.edu/TerrenceThomson\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

    "description": "Subscribe to Acid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nIn this episode, Craig, Will, Matt, and Adam are joined by University of Vermont Professor Todd McGowan to discuss Hegel's concept of contradiction as he lays it out in his book, Emancipation After Hegel: Achieving a Contradictory Revolution. Throughout the latter part of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy came to bear the stigma of a totalizing system responsible for seeing an era of global atrocities. McGowan attempts to disabuse readers of this perception. Instead, he endeavors to demonstrate that Hegel's system of logic is, in fact, a system that opens itself up to new possibilities and forms of autonomous life in light of the emancipatory force of contradiction. Figures in the discussion include Marx, Freud, Kojeve, Žižek, Malabou, Comay, Foucault, Kant, Marx, Stirner, and many more.\n\nBuy the book Emancipation After Hegel: Achieving a Contradictory Revolution\n\nJoin Todd's seminar on Hegel with Incite Seminars\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

Central to our discussion is the question of how our historical understanding of human sociality and the manifestation of the state could be altered if we decentered the concept of primordial hostility. What if we approached these discussions with a framework of prosocial behavior? However, there is something for everyone here. This discussion covers ground ranging from Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of ideology to contemporary discourses on neuroscience.

    "description": "Subscribe to Acid Horizon\non Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nThis is your Inner Experience. On this episode we’re finally going through the text that inspired the origin of this show; George Bataille’s Torture, from his book ‘Inner Experience’. Craig, Will, and Adam sketch out the terminological landscape of Bataille’s project, tackling such concepts as ‘Salvation’ ‘Impossibility’, ‘Divinity’, ‘Sacrifice’, ‘Non-Knowledge’, ‘Ecstasy’, ‘Anguish’, and much more. We pick Bataille’s brain for his anxieties regarding the End of History and the completion of Rationalist Metaphysics, and by way of such an investigation we articulate his relationship to Hegel as the looming and all-consuming philosopher of the inescapable economy of meaning. Religious experience is shown as central to Inner Experience, as the visceral torment of the body and mind at the limit of its self-conception; as life experiences itself at its most meaningless and contradictory, akin to the agony of a dying God. Thinkers also in the discussion are William James, St. John of the Cross, Max Stirner, Deleuze, Kojeve, Hillman, amongst many others.\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast)",

As a result of this work, he articulates the Creative Nothing as a theory of nihilistic ontogenesis, the origin of Being from its relationship to nothingness, and describes the Unique as the fundamental moment of non-identity in every form of identification, as well as in every attempt in which dominant powers try to produced fixed and inescapable modes of subjectivation.

    "description": "Subscribe to Acid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/join/acidhorizonpodcast\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nOn this episode, we discuss the second essay of Friedrich Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morals and the question of the developmental origins of responsibility and conscience from the moral point of view. To bring responsibility under the knife, Nietzsche focuses on a paradigm case of morality playing itself out on the field of responsibility on the levels of both Being and Acting. This paradigm case is the promise. So, to account for the origins of the moral value of responsibility, Nietzsche asks us, what kind of animal can make promises? What are the conditions of possibility that make any promise reliable such that promising as a practice could survive? In answering these questions, we’ll take you through Nietzsche’s account of the origins of the promise in the faculties of memory and forgetfulness, and the motor of their growth which Nietzsche reveals as the primordial cruelties at the heart of human animal. With insights from Kant, Hegel, Hobbes, Foucault, and Deleuze & Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus guiding our way, we aim to deliver from Nietzsche’s text a notion of morality that could only ever be the promise of cruelty.\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

    "description": "Subscribe to Acid Horizon on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\nMerch: http://www.crit-drip.com\n\nWhat is a dispositif? Translated into English as “apparatus”, this term plays a crucial role in Foucault’s thought. In this episode, we explore Agamben’s genealogical treatment of this Foucauldian notion. His treatment takes him across Christian theology, Hegel, and more. Joining Craig, Adam, and Will is Yung Agamben from the D E C O D E podcast. Our goal is to understand how Agamben’s description of how apparatuses operate within Foucault’s work, and how they function strategically to direct the formation of particular subjectivities. How can one bring the “Ungovernable” to light?\n\nD E C O D E: https://soundcloud.com/cute-noumena\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

In today's episode, we are joined by Sean from 'Buddies Without Organs', a philosophy podcast which conducts close readings of the work of Deleuze and Guattari. Together, we examine the plateau entitled \"Year Zero: Faciality\" from Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus.  We discuss the emergence of the face as a historical object which functions as a component in the deployment and mediation of forms of political and social power.  In particular, we focus on the importance of the face of Jesus of Nazareth depicted as a 'White Christ', a visage which Deleuze and Guattari claim to be the face par excellence, one to which all other faces become subordinated. Moreover, the construction of the face entails serious implications for imperialism, racism, transphobia, and other political issues. Other figures discussed: Heidegger and Foucault.\n\nBuddies Without Organs: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_WdQzXkXPPL0Rq98bKuuLQ\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \n\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\n\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\n\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

In the interview, we use the introduction to Reiner Schürmann's work \"Heidegger on Being and Acting: From Principles to Anarchy\" as a jumping-off point to discuss the question of an activity without principles, a unity of theory and practice which supersedes all structures of obedience and commandment. We talk with Professor Malabou about the historic failure of Western Philosophy to realize the riskiness of its metaphysical anarchisms in political terms, and the pleasurable plasticity of the anarchic formation of new modes of living. We are left with the pertinent question; has anarchism ever been truly philosophized? Thinkers in the discussion include Schürmann, Ranciere, Foucault, Deleuze, Aristotle, Reich, Stirner, Heidegger, Hegel, Derrida, Agamben, Proudhon, Marx, and many, many more!\r\r\n\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\r\r\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi\n \n\r\rHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\n\r\r\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\n\r\r​\nRevolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\r\r​\n\nSplit Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\r\r​\n\nMusic: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\n\n\r\r​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

In this episode, Craig, Will, and Adam take a look at an essay in Wilhelm Reich’s Mass Psychology of Fascism, “Ideology as a Material Force.” Here, Reich pushes back against some of his Marxist contemporaries. To Reich, the purely economic explanation of the rise of fascism is insufficient. What are the limitations of the purely economic explanation of the success of reactionary politics? How is it that the fascist political project is able to alter mass psychological structure of the working populace? What can be gained from Reich’s reading of Freud and his notions of the sex-economy and sex politics? How does the family structure replicate and reaffirm the authoritarian state? And how does Reich’s work impact our readings of Herbert Marcuse, Deleuze, and Guattari.

How can we interpret the evidently moralistic language in Engels' work in light of the anti-moralism which characterizes his later writings with Marx, namely within \"The German Ideology\". In \"Outlines\", Engels offers a succinct but brilliant rendering of how the division of capital and labor precipitate other kinds of contradictions under the capitalist system.  Also, the cast identifies potentially problematic formulations within the text seem to fall outside Engels' intended methodology.  Other figures mentioned include Spinoza, Hegel, Smith, Stirner, Feuerbach, Ricardo, Malthus, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari.\r\n\r\nRadical Reprints: https://radicalreprints.neocities.org/\r\n\r\nHistory and Class Consciousness by Georg Lukács:\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2229555618/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\r\n\r\nContribute to Acid Horizon: https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\r\n\r\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi \r\n\r\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nNew Revolts (Matt’s Blog): https://newrevolts.com/\r\n\r\n​Revolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\r\n\r\n​Split Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\r\n\r\n​Music: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\r\n\r\n​Merch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

In this episode, we cover “Whom to Give to” from Jacques Derrida’s The Gift of Death. Why do we commit to one other instead of all others? Our discussion centers around the notions of the ethical, the universal, and the choices we make. This is a unique work of Derrida’s – one informed by a very focused reading of Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling. This conversation cuts through Derrida’s reading of the non-communicative, secret-withholding 'knight of faith'. Derrida’s interpretation of the paradox’s presented by Kierkegaard reveals a very unique position on the nature of commitment to another.\r\n\r\nContribute to Acid Horizon: www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\r\n\r\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/acid…on/id1512615438\r\n\r\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nHyperstition Arrays (Matt’s Blog): https://hyperstitionarrays.com\r\n\r\nRevolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\r\n\r\nSplit Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\r\n\r\nMusic: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\r\n\r\nMerch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com\r\n\r\nNEW Merch Store in progress: https://www.etsy.com/shop/critdrip?ref=seller-platform-mcnav",

Using texts such as Mark Fisher's \"Good for Nothing\" and Deleuze's \"Plato and the Simulacrum\" from his Logic of Sense, we consider what it means to feel a failure of identification in relation to how one is recognised in the order of things, what it means to internalise social forces that attempt to confine you within identity categories, and what forces and mechanisms there are that constantly call the self into question and demand it account for its authenticity (and often, do so for the sake of asserting power, and of enforcing essentialisms of race, gender, and class). Thinkers in this discussion include Mark Fisher, Deleuze, Wittgenstein, Plato, Freud, Stirner, Nietzsche, Marx, Hegel, and more!\r\nContribute to Acid Horizon: www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\r\n\r\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/acid…on/id1512615438\r\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nHyperstition Arrays (Matt’s Blog): https://hyperstitionarrays.com\r\n\r\nRevolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\r\n\r\nSplit Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com/\r\n\r\nMusic: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/\r\n\r\nMerch Store: http://www.crit-drip.com",

Go to: http://www.crit-drip.com\r\n\r\nWhy is there something rather than nothing? In this episode, Craig, Matt, Will, and Adam address Heidegger’s inaugural lecture “What is Metaphysics?”. For Heidegger, the central problem of metaphysics lies at the level of the “is” itself. His pursuit is to establish a fundamental understanding of Being, something he believes has been almost entirely overlooked since the split between Plato and Aristotle. This piece also touches on many central elements in Heidegger’s earlier work, ranging from the ontical nature of the physical sciences to Heidegger’s notion of the relationship between Dasein and nothingness that is “already given”. To Heidegger, the truth of metaphysics dwells upon a “groundless ground”. It is the entrance into that space—that going beyond—that this episode is particularly centered around. Sartre, Hegel, Zen Buddhism, and yes, even Deleuze fold into the discussion as well.

In this work, Deleuze’s crosses paths with Artaud, but Nietzsche, Lawrence, and Kafka are also at his disposal. Those familiar with Deleuze's work will be familiar with some of the machines operating here. How does judgement function? How exactly are we to escape conceptualizing through strict categorization? How does Deleuze’s conception of 'combat' inform how he describes the Nietzschean notion of forces?

Go to: http://www.crit-drip.com\r\n\r\nIn this episode, Craig, Matt, Will, and Adam are joined by critic, artist, cultural theorist, and assistant curator at Rhizome Aria Dean to discuss her 2017 essay \"Notes on Blacceleration.\" In this episode, the Acid Horizon crew discusses with Aria the paradox of the ontological constitution of the black subject that sits at the very beginning of capitalism. “The black” or “the figure of blackness” acts as the orignary reserve of energy that enables the process of exchange that theorists of accelerationism rely on for their analyses. What is articulated in blaccelerationism is the recognition of a fundamental absence in the first accelerationist discourses, particularly when it comes to the origin of capitalism in the extractive violence of slavery and the colonisation of the African continent. In response to this theoretical blind spot, we discuss with Aria the economy of blackness and its relation to notions of representation, exchange, expenditure, and most importantly, revolutionary collective action considering the George Floyd uprisings in the United States and across the world. Thinkers included in the discussion include Wilderson, Moten, Wynter, Mbembe, Land, Fisher, Deleuze, Bataille, Guattari, Williams, and more.\r\n \r\nLinks to Aria Dean’s work:\r\n\r\nThe text: https://www.e-flux.com/journal/87/169402/notes-on-blacceleration/\r\n\r\nNovember: https://novembermag.com/\r\n\r\nRhizome: https://rhizome.org/\r\n\r\nAcid Horizon Links: \r\n\r\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/acid…on/id1512615438\r\n\r\nHappy Hour at Hippel's (Adam’s blog): happyhourathippels.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nHyperstition Arrays (Matt’s Blog): hyperstitionarrays.com\r\n\r\nRevolting Bodies (Will's Blog): https://revoltingbodies.com\r\n\r\nSplit Infinities (Craig’s Substack): https://splitinfinities.substack.com\r\n\r\nMusic: https://sereptie.bandcamp.com\r\n\r\nContribute to Acid Horizon: www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpodcast\r\n\r\n Merch Store: crit-drip.com",

Are we living in a control society, or some kind of hybrid? This work is short, but dense. The gang reflects on just how prescient some of Deleuze’s descriptions of these new technologies are.

The primary contention is that it was most likely written by either Hölderlin, Hegel, or Schelling during their time together as essentially collage dorm-mates whilst at Tübinger Stift in Germany, although some analyses leave open the possibility of a fourth unknown author. That being said, the text itself was written in Hegel’s handwriting, and speaks with post-revolutionary vigour about the need to overthrow priestly control of the human mind and the heralding of a new dawn of reason; a reason that, despite the austerity imposed upon it by Kantianism, is not afraid of speculation, sensuousness, and poetics, but rather lets its own truth shine through them. This text is a agitation for universal emancipation, a liberatory declaration that holds self-consciousness and enlightenment at its core—the labour of not only becoming-mature, but also towards the hope of humanity’s next childhood.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the reader of the text here is that the text is a Hegelian one, although not for any reason that benefits Hegel. The text begins with a miscounting of Kant’s practical postulates, counting only two instead of three; and this aligns well with Pinkard’s biological note that of the three within the Stift that Hegel’s Kantianism was the least developed at the time.",

Go to: http://www.crit-drip.com\r\n\r\nWe talk with our buddy Gouff, whom we met at the beginning of the pandemic. Gouff writes for an online journal called Fǎn (反) on Medium. In this episode, we talk about the concept of fictitious science, a notion which challenges the allegation that a boundary exists between the literary and the literal. We also confront the (faulty) assertion that philosophy no longer plays a role in the domain of science. Furthermore, we attempt to apply some of the claims of fictitious science to a reading of Isaac Asimov's \"The Last Question\". Figures in the discussion include Deleuze, Quine, Putnam, Feyerabend, Richard Dawkins, and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

    "title": "Episode 2 - Deleuze, Foucault, and Prisons: Revisiting \"Intellectuals and Power\"",
    "description": "In this episode, we revisit the famous talk between Deleuze and Foucault entitled \"Intellectuals and Power\".  Our discussion of interview involves breaking down Deleuze's theory of theory and praxis and examining the development of Foucault's notion of power from this interview to his writing of Discipline and Punish. Also, Craig reflects upon his work as a prison educator vis-à-vis the concepts explored.\r\n\r\nFind us Patreon, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram!\r\n\r\nThe text of \"Intellectuals and Power\" can be found on libcom.org.\r\n\r\nReading: https://libcom.org/library/intellectuals-power-a-conversation-between-michel-foucault-and-gilles-deleuze\n\nAcid Horizon is a theory podcast which confronts global crisis and the specter of a world that could be free. One of the many goals of Acid Horizon is to enrich discourses of liberation through a non-sectarian approach to reading theory. In the spirit of thinkers like Deleuze and Guattari, we endeavor to provide a space which values theory as a creative force, not just as the topic of debate. We also connect theory to the pervasive political challenges faced by global citizens. On the podcast, we cover a variety of new, historic, and lesser-known texts of political philosophy. Grab our current syllabus and follow along.\n\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/acid-horizon/id1512615438\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/043axYb...\n\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/acid-horizon-9...\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/HorizonAcid\n\nBuzzsprout: https://acidhorizonpodcast.buzzsprout...\n\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/horizonacid...\n\nFB:  https://www.facebook.com/acidhorizonp...",
