    "title": "Deepest Dive into Roman Mithras on the Internet",
    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformantTV\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://x.com/Gnosisinformant\n\nThe Roman deity Mithras appears in the historical record in the late 1st century A.D., and disappears from it in the late 4th century A.D. Unlike the major mythological figures of Graeco-Roman religion, such as Jupiter and Hercules, no ancient source preserves the mythology of the god. All of our information is therefore derived from depictions on monuments, and the limited mentions of the cult in literary sources.\n\nThe temples of Mithras were always an underground cave, featuring a relief of Mithras killing the bull. This \"tauroctony\", as it is known today, appears in the same format everywhere, but with minor variations. Other standard themes appear in the iconography.\n\nThe cult was all male. There were seven degrees of initiation. Different ritual meals were associated with each stage.\n\nThe modern study of Mithras begins just before 1900 with Franz Cumont's Textes et Monuments. This two volume work collected all the ancient evidence. Cumont presumed that Mithras was merely the Roman form of the ancient Indo-Persian deity Mitra or Mithra. In the mid-50's Cumont's pupil Maarten Vermaseren published a new collection of monuments, which added the archaeological discoveries of the last 50 years, but also highlighted how poorly the archaeology supported the Cumontian theory. At the 1971 international conference on Mithraic studies, Cumont's theory was abandoned in favour of a Roman origin for the cult. Vermaseren himself rejected Cumont's theory in 1975.\n\nThe ancient writer Justin Martyr referred to one of the ritual meals of the cult as being a parody of Christianity. In some speculative passages Cumont sometimes tried to interpret some Mithraic ideas in Christian terms. Consequently various modern myths came into being. These appear as fact in older scholarly literature, and sometimes in non-specialist academic literature even today. For the most part these errors appear in non-scholarly literature.\n\nIn every Mithraeum the centrepiece was a representation of Mithras killing a sacred bull; the so-called tauroctony.\n\nThe image may be a relief, or free-standing, and side details may be present or omitted. The centre-piece is Mithras clothed in Anatolian costume and wearing a Phrygian cap; who is kneeling on the exhausted bull, holding it by the nostrils with his left hand, and stabbing it with his right. As he does so, he looks over his shoulder towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. The two torch-bearers are on either side, dressed like Mithras, Cautes with his torch pointing up and Cautopates with his torch pointing down.\n\nThe event takes place in a cavern, into which Mithras has carried the bull, after having hunted it, ridden it and overwhelmed its strength. Sometimes the cavern is surrounded by a circle, on which the twelve signs of the zodiac appear. Outside the cavern, top left, is Sol the sun, with his flaming crown, often driving a quadriga. A ray of light often reaches down from the sun to touch Mithras. Top right is Luna, with her crescent moon, who may be depicted driving a chariot.\n\nIn some depictions, the central tauroctony is framed by a series of subsidiary scenes to the left, top and right, illustrating events in the Mithras narrative; Mithras being born from the rock, the water miracle, the hunting and riding of the bull, meeting Sol who kneels to him, shaking hands with Sol and sharing a meal of bull-parts with him, and ascending to the heavens in a chariot.\n\nSometimes Cautes and Cautopates carry shepherds' crooks instead.\n\nIn antiquity, texts refer to \"the mysteries of Mithras\", and to its adherents, as \"the mysteries of the Persians.\"\n\nThe architecture of a temple of Mithras is very distinctive. Porphyry, quoting the lost handbook of Eubolus states that Mithras was worshipped in a rock cave. The Mithraeum reproduces this cave, in which Mithras killed the bull. The format of the room involved a central aisle, with a raised podium on either side.\n\nMithraic temples are common in the empire; with considerable numbers found in Rome, Ostia, Numidia, Dalmatia, Britain & along the Rhine/Danube frontier; while being much less common in Greece, Egypt, and Syria.\n\nMithraea are commonly located close to springs or streams; fresh water appears to have been required for some Mithraic rituals, and a basin is often incorporated into the structure. There is usually a narthex or ante-chamber at the entrance, and often other ancillary rooms for storage and the preparation of food. The term mithraeum is modern; in Italy inscriptions usually call it a spelaeum; outside Italy it is referred to as templum.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant  #religion  #mithras",

Rethinking Hornkohl’s Method—and What Comes Next\nhttps://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/isnt-it-time-break-linguistic-dating-rethinking-hornkohls-method-and-what-comes-next\nAaron Hornkohl’s Diachronic Diversity in Classical Biblical Hebrewmay be sparking renewed scholarly engagementover one of the thorniest problems in biblical scholarship: whether we can use the Hebrew Bible’s language to establish when different parts of it were written. Hornkohl’s answer is a confident yes. But for those of us more skeptical of linguistic dating, the confidence is more revealing than the data itself.\n\n         Hornkohl is a major figure in the scholarly tradition that seeks to chart the development of Biblical Hebrew (BH) over time, following in the footsteps of the late Avi Hurvitz, his mentor and a giant in the field. This book takes the core premise of that tradition—that there’s a meaningful linguistic divide between Classical Biblical Hebrew (CBH), typically associated with earlier/pre-exilic writings, and Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH), typically associated with later/post-exilic writings—and pushes it further. Hornkohl argues that even within CBH, he can detect distinctions. Most notably, he claims that the Hebrew of the Pentateuch differs in significant ways from that of other early books within the Prophets and Writings. Thus he proposes an internal division within CBH itself—between what he calls a pre-monarchic Pentateuchal linguistic tradition, CBH1 (1000–800 BCE), and a monarchic linguistic tradition in the Prophets and Writings, CBH2 (800–600 BCE).\n\n         On the surface, this sounds precise—perhaps even scientific. But is it justified?\n\n         While Hornkohl is upfront about the challenges of textual transmission—the texts are late, edited, and transmitted in ways that muddy linguistic signals—he remains “far more optimistic than many” (p. 207) about what can still be gleaned. Yet he underestimates how deeply editorial and scribal processes have shaped the linguistic profiles of the biblical writings. This, we believe, is the heart of the issue.\n\n         Some illustrative examples: Although Hornkohl addresses forms more common in the Pentateuch, he largely avoids other evidence—such as lev (לֵב) versus levav (לֵבָב) for “heart,” or the paragogic nun—that defy neat classification. Likewise, alternative interpretations of similar phenomena—like our in-depth studies of tsaʿaq (צעק) versus zaʿaq (זעק) for “to cry,” or abstract nouns ending in -ūt—receive scant attention.\n\n         This brings us to a deeper concern, one that goes beyond a few data points:\n\n         We argue that Hornkohl’s methodological assumptions and limited integration of literary and textual criticism into his linguistic dating enterprise significantly undermine the reliability of his conclusions. In our view, he overestimates the capacity of diachronic linguistic data to reflect original composition, failing to fully grapple with the complex compositional and transmissional history of the Hebrew Bible. Hornkohl treats editorial and textual developments as mere “complications” (p. 9) that diachronic (linguistic) analysis must overcome, rather than recognizing them as integral to any attempt at dating biblical writings. This privileging of linguistic evidence over literary and textual factors is, we believe, methodologically flawed. It underestimates the impact of editorial and scribal interventions, which can substantially distort the linguistic profile of a text. As a result, his interpretations of orthographic developments—even concerning the names “David” and “Jerusalem”—are, in our judgment, overly confident and insufficiently attentive to the broader textual landscape.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

    "description": "T.C. Schmidt received his PhD from Yale University and, in Fall 2025, will be Associate Professor at Fairfield University and a Visiting Fellow at Princeton University. His publications concern topics such as the historical Jesus, the formation of the New Testament, the history of Christianity in Eastern contexts, and the origin of Christmas. Notably, Schmidt has produced peer-reviewed translations from Latin, Greek, Syriac, and Arabic texts. His books have been published with Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and others.\n\nIn this video we discuss the Testimonium Flavianum written by Josephus in the late 1st century. Was it a forgery? Or did Josephus really write this? \n\nGet the book: \nT. C. Schmidt (Ph.D)\nJosephus and Jesus: New Evidence for the One Called Christ\nFree PDF:\nhttps://josephusandjesus.com/\nUK Book on Amazon\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Josephus-Jesus-Evidence-Called-Christ/dp/0192866788\nThis book brings to light an extraordinary connection between Jesus of Nazareth and the Jewish historian Josephus. Writing in 93/94 CE, Josephus composed an account of Jesus known as the Testimonium Flavianum. Despite this being the oldest description of Jesus by a non-Christian, scholars have long doubted its authenticity due to the alleged pro-Christian claims it contains. This book, however, authenticates Josephus' authorship of the Testimonium Flavianum and reveals a startling observation: Josephus was directly familiar with those who put Jesus on trial. Consequently, Josephus would have had access to highly reliable information about the man from Nazareth. The book concludes by describing what Josephus tells us about the Jesus of history, his miracles, and his resurrection.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help support my work.

    "description": "Get the Book:\nhttps://bit.ly/3Dj4kXT\nPromo code - GNOSTIC10\n\nJohn Myles Dillon is an Irish classicist and philosopher who was Regius Professor of Greek in Trinity College, Dublin between 1980 and 2006. Prior to that he taught at the University of California, Berkeley. He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Athens on 15 June 2010, and in July 2022 a corresponding member of the British Academy. Dillon's area of research lies in the history of Platonism from the Old Academy to the Renaissance, and also Early Christianity.\n\nAmong Dillon's most famous works are his translations of Iamblichus' On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, a definitive book on Middle Platonists and Neoplatonism, and his editorial work on Stephen McKenna's translation of Plotinus' Enneads. With the latter, he continued the same research as his predecessor A. H. Armstrong in the field of Neoplatonic philosophy.\n\nSpecial thanks to Adina Bezerita for facilitating this interview:\nhttps://numinousthreads.org\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adinabezerita/ \n\nDillon is also a member of the International Society for Neoplatonic Studies,and is in addition a member of the Editorial Advisory Council of Dionysius.

    "title": "Secret Mysteries passed down through Philosophy - Alexandros Lysios",
    "description": "Get The Book Here - https://bit.ly/3Dj4kXT\nPromo code - GNOSTIC10\nHungry minds is a creative group of artists, scientists, architects, designers and entrepreneurs\nfrom around the world.\n #thebook, #hungrymindsbooks, #howtorebuildcivilization\n#hungryminds / \nSubscribe to them on youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@HungryMindsArt\n\nCorrections:\n\n1.  At 2:26 the narrator says that Alexandros holds a Master's from the American College of Greece and the University of Reading. However, Alexandros holds a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from the American College of Greece and a Master of Arts in philosophy from the University of Reading.\n    \n   The Correction: Alexandros holds a B.A. in philosophy from the American College of Greece and an M.A. in philosophy from the University of Reading.\n   \n2. The Issue: At 2:29 the narrator pronounces University of Reading wrongly.\n   \n   The Correction: University of Reading is actually pronounced \"Redding\" despite being written as \"Reading\".\n   \n3. The Issue: The rectangle at 4:52 and 6:22 (and other times this appears) gives the impression that in addition to Philosophy Alexandros also studied Theurgy at the University of Reading which isn't true.\n   \n   The Correction: Alexandros only studied Philosophy at the University of Reading.\n   \n4. The Issue: At 3:16 Neal says the name of the website that Alexandros writes in as \"Numinious Quest\" when it is \"Numinous Quest\". \n   \n   The Correction: The proper name for the website of Alexandros Lysios is Numinous Quest, not Numinious Quest.\n   \n5. The Issue: At 8:48 the wrong quote is displayed. \n   \n   The Correction: The right quote is: \"The Stoic Epictetus reproached his students for using the explication of texts merely to show off: “When I’m asked to comment on Chryssipus, I do not brag; rather, I blush if I cannot display conduct which resembles his teachings and is in accord with them.\" and it is from Pierre Hadot's book What is Ancient Philosophy?  p. 153 where he also cites the ancient source he got it from. \n   \n6. The Issue: At 11:14 Alexandros says that at 396 CE Eleusis is closed down, the graphic says 395 CE Eleusis is destroyed. The truth is that both statements are wrong. The decrees by Theodosius that effectively make it illegal to run the Eleusinian Mysteries occur sometime between 391-392 CE, whereas the actual destruction of the site where they took place happened by Alaric I at 396 CE.\n   \n   The Correction: The decrees by Theodosius I that effectively make it illegal to run the Eleusinian Mysteries occur sometime between 391-392 CE, whereas the actual destruction of the site where they took place happened by Alaric I at 396 CE.\n   \n7. The Issue: At 34:59 Alexandros says the word ὄλβιος and not, as it is depicted, \"Orpheus\". \n   \n   The Correction: Alexandros said ὄλβιος/ólbios not Orpheus.\n   \n8. The Issue: At 36:25 the graphic gives just an erroneous etymology of Orpheus because it thinks that's what Alexandros is referring to, but he's just providing an etymology for ὄλβιος.\n   \n   The Correction: Alexandros is suggesting an etymological analysis of ὄλβιος from ὅλος + βίος → \"whole life\" → one who has a full, complete, and thus blessed life, because they have completed their cycle of births and rebirths.\n   \n9. The Issue: At 36:50 the goal of the mysteries is not to become an Orpheus as the graphic says but to become ὄλβιος.\n   \n   The Correction: Alexandros here is saying that the goal of the mysteries is to become ὄλβιος, in other words to become blessed by completing your cycle of deaths and rebirths.\n   \n10. The Issue: At 37:42 the graphic says that Persephone is the Bringer of Destruction. But Alexandros is referring to the ancient version of Persephone which Plato mentions in the Cratylus which was Φερσεφόνη (Phersephone) and which means \"she who brings and kills\". \n    \n   \n\nAlexandros Lysios (M.A.)\nLatest Article from Alexandros:\nFrom Zeus to Athena: An Interpretation\nThe Intellect’s Marriages for the Birth of Wisdom\nhttps://www.numinous.quest/p/from-zeus-to-athena-an-interpretation\nAlexandros Lysios is a philosopher and interdisciplinary experience designer. He holds degrees in Philosophy from the American College of Greece and the University of Reading. His current research explores how ancient Greek philosophy, as transmitted by the Neoplatonic Golden Chain and critically engaged through study and practice, can offer guidance to contemporary existential and political challenges.\nHe shares his reflections at: \nhttps://www.numinous.quest/\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

Livesey (Ph.D. SMU, Dallas, Texas) is professor emerita of religious studies at the OU College of Professional and Continuing Studies. Trained in biblical studies with a specialization in Pauline letters, Nina’s interest can be broadly characterized as the investigation into various aspects of Christian emergence. Her first monograph, Circumcision as a Malleable Symbol (Mohr Siebeck, 2010), explores interpretations of the Hebrew rite of circumcision across diverse ancient texts and challenges a common assumption of a unitary signification of this Judean practice. Her second monograph, Galatians, and the Rhetoric of Crisis: Demosthenes, Cicero, and Paul (Polebridge Press, 2016), is a comparative study of the rhetoric of urgency, encomium, emotive language, and disjuncture across the Philippic speeches of Demosthenes and Cicero and Paul’s Letter to the Galatians. Against traditional scholarship, the book provides evidence of a wide use of rhetoric in Galatians. Her current work involves an analysis of Pauline letters more generally, including their status. \n\nNina began teaching for PACS in 2006 with The Bible as Literature course, which she continues to teach. \n\nShe is a longtime scholar member of Westar Institute, a former co-editor of Forum, and, with Jason BeDuhn and Lillian Larsen, co-chairs Westar’s Christianity Seminar Phase II.\nhttps://www.ou.edu/pacs/about/deans-and-faculty/nina-livesey\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon.

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help support my work. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformantTV\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://x.com/Gnosisinformant\n\nClaudius, in the 40sAD is credited with instituting a significant festival dedicated to Attis, formalizing its inclusion in the Roman religious calendar. This event, called the Entry of the Tree (arbor intrat), began the holy week of Attis. \n\nOn March 15, another group, the Cannophori (reed-bearers), processed through the streets. They carried reeds from the Almo River, accompanied by a six-year-old bull that the high priest sacrificed to ensure the fertility of the fields. \n\nThe festival initiated nine days of penitence, likened to a form of Lent.\n\nParticipants abstained from eating bread, pomegranates, quinces, pork, fish, and wine. Only milk was consumed, reinforcing a sense of purity and restraint. \n\nOn March 22, the Dendrophori (woodcutters’ guild) carried a pine tree in a grand procession to the Palatine Temple. Attis was fastened to the pine tree and was buried 6 feet underground, followed by mourning for the death of Attis. A pine tree was cut down, and a ram was sacrificed, its blood poured onto the roots of the tree in a sacred wood dedicated to Cybele. This dramatic procession (pompa), resembling a funeral march, traversed the streets of Rome with solemn music, marking one of the most important rituals in Cybele’s worship. \n\nOn March 23, a day of mourning known as the Day of Violets (dies violae) took place. Worshippers paid homage to the god Attis, symbolized by a sacred pine tree adorned with violets, which were said to have grown from his spilled blood. \n\nThe next day, March 24, marked the Day of Blood (dies sanguinis), the emotional and ritual peak of the festival. The high priest, along with the galli (eunuch priests), initiated a frenzied dance around the sacred pine tree. During this intense ceremony, the high priest used a whip embedded with knucklebones to flagellate himself. The air was filled with the sound of clarinets, cymbals, and furious tambourines, creating a chaotic and intense atmosphere. \n\nOn the third day, the rituals shifted to honor the burial of the pine tree, representing Attis. This was a solemn event where the tree, decorated with cloth and flowers, was buried, reflecting Cybele's actions in the myth when she cared for the body of Attis. Prayers were offered by the high priest for the protection of the emperor and the Roman Empire. \n\nTertullian, a Christian writer, later mocked these rituals, criticizing the priests for their dramatic displays and equating the festival's emotional excesses with the practices of the Montanists, a sect known for ecstatic prophecy. Day of Blood remained one of the most vivid and impactful ceremonies within the cult of Cybele and Attis. \n \nAccording to ancient Christian sources like Firmicus Maternus, these ceremonies included prayers and mourning chants, performed in near darkness. At a pivotal moment, a light was revealed, symbolizing divine salvation. The priest would then anoint the chest of participants while reciting words of hope: \n\n\"Have faith, O believers: God is saved! And for us, salvation will emerge from his suffering.\" \n\nThe context of these rituals strongly connects them to the Egyptian god Osiris, who also symbolized rebirth. On March 25, the resurrection of Attis was celebrated. A carving from Ostia shows a small figure of Attis standing beside his own dead form under a pine tree, symbolizing his return to life. This day was called Hilaria or the day of rejoicing, marking the equinox when daylight becomes longer than night. \n\nThe striking thing about March 25 being the Day of Attis resurrection, is that it comes after 3 days from the Day of Attis Burial, showing a clear 3 day death and resurrection motif, PRE-DATING Christian influence on Roman religion by at least a century. March 25, the Roman Spring equinox date for the Julian Calendar, is also the day that Christians in the 3rd century calculated to be the exact day of Jesus Death, and his conception. One has to wonder if Roman Religion played a role in these calculations. \n\nFollowing the intense celebrations, March 26 was observed as a day of rest, called Requietio. The next day, March 27, featured the Bath Procession (Lavatio), a day added to the Holy Week by Marcus Aurelius, symbolizing cleansing and renewal. This ceremonial washing of sacred objects reinforced the themes of purification and rebirth that defined the Attis and Cybele cult.  \n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 - Great Mother Cybele\n00:04:40 - Spring Frenzy\n00:10:40 - Julio-Claudian Attians\n00:13:28 - Attis Holy Week (Hilaria) Resurrection of Attis\n00:24:25 - Megalesia Festival\n00:29:49 - Egyptian Hilaria (Osiris)\n00:32:25 - Serapia (April 25)\n00:53:25 - Salvation of Isis\n01:08:30 - Pompeii Mysteries\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #easter  #spring",

    "description": "Dr. Justin Sledge: @TheEsotericaChannel \n\nDr. Sledge’s work engages with Religious Studies specifically in the so-called “Western Esoteric Tradition” or Hermetic Tradition in religious and philosophical thought.  In this line of research he seeks to grasps the philosophical commitments which underpin the alleged workings of magic, esoteric influence, spirit possession, alchemy, etc.  This field of inquiry brings him primarily into contact with philosophers and intellectuals regrettably disregarded by the modern philosophic canon.\n\nHis work also intersection between metaphysics, ethics and radical political philosophy.  His dissertation reflects this interest through a careful analysis of the meta-ethics of Karl Marx.  There Dr. Sledge argues that Marx’s emerging materialist theory of history ultimately pins him as electing a kind of ethics of virtue with the ethical dialectic of this epoch being solidarity-reification.\n\nHe is currently preparing material on the Ancient Near Eastern Prophetic Tradition, spirit possession in the early modern Jewish world, and is slowly working through the Zohar (which he will be doing the rest of his life).\n\nOutside of his academic and YouTube work Justin is a calligrapher, home brewer, Go player, DM, HAM radio technician (KE8NAW) and habitual trouble-maker (see picture on right for long standing proof).  He lives in Detroit, Michigan with his amazing partner Rabbi Alana Alpert, two kiddos, and pup Mississippi.\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

His research has focused on the historical Jesus, the theology of noncanonical Gospels, and the application of postmodern hermeneutical approaches to the Bible. His work is controversial, portraying the Second Coming as a late corruption of Jesus' message and saying that Jesus' divinity is metaphorical.[1] In place of the eschatological message of the Gospels, Crossan emphasizes the historical context of Jesus and of his followers immediately after his death.[1] He describes Jesus' ministry as founded on free healing and communal meals, negating the social hierarchies of Jewish culture and the Roman Empire.[2]\n\nCrossan is a major scholar in contemporary historical Jesus research.[1][3] In particular, he and Burton Mack advocated for a non-eschatological view of Jesus, a view that contradicts the more common view that Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher.[3] While contemporary scholars see more value in noncanonical gospels than past scholars did, Crossan goes further and identifies a few noncanonical gospels as earlier than and superior to the canonical ones.[3] The very early dating of these non-canonical sources is not accepted by the majority of biblical scholars.[4]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dominic_Crossan\n\nWhy I left the Priesthood – John Dominic Crossan\nhttps://islamchristiandebate.wordpress.com/why-i-left-the-priesthood-john-dominic-crossan/\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

Following this luminary’s exceptional legacy, the conference and the book that is presented here are dedicated to the study of the touch-points between diverse Yahwistic communities throughout the Achaemenid empire and the Iranian attributes of the empire that ruled over them for about two centuries. This is arguably the most formative period in the development, redaction and composition of some of the most central texts within the Jewish (and, by extension, Christian) heritage. However, there has historically been too little dialogue between scholars of Achaemenid history and linguistics and those of Jewish history, Bible scholarship, archeology and Semitics. To respond to these lacunae, the conference’s approach was fundamentally interdisciplinary and collaborative. It brought together scholars from diverse disciplines, encouraged dialogue throughout the conference and invited them to contribute to the present volume from these interactions and their general research interests.\nFollow Gad on X:\nhttps://x.com/gbarnea\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nSubscribe to Derek Lambert:\n@MythVisionPodcast \n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GnosticInformantTV\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://x.com/Gnostisinformant\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis,  330 CE:\n\"Christ was born eight days before the Kalends of January, thirteen days after the winter solstice and the addition of light and day.' This day is celebrated by the Greeks, I mean the idolaters, on the eighth before the Kalends of January, which the Romans call Saturnalia, the Egyptians call Cronia, and the Alexandrians call Kikellia.. which is called Epiphany, from the beginning of the increase of light for a span of thirteen days; for this also had to become a type of our Lord Jesus Christ and his twelve disciples, fulfilling the number of the thirteen days of light's increase. First, in Alexandria in the so-called Koreum; there is a great temple, that is, the precinct of Kore. For staying awake the entire night with certain songs and flutes singing to the idol and spending the whole night, after the crowing of the roosters, they descend with torches into a certain underground shrine and bring out a certain wooden statue seated on a litter, naked, having a golden seal of a cross on the forehead and two other such seals on each hand and another two on the two knees, together the five seals made of gold, and they carry this statue around the middle temple seven times with flutes and drums and hymns and after celebrating they again bring it down into the underground place. Being asked what this mystery is, they reply and say that at this hour today the Kore (that is, the virgin) gave birth to Aion. This also happens in Petra, the city (metropolis of Arabia, Edom written in the scriptures) in the idol temple there, and they praise the virgin in Arabic dialect, calling her in Arabic Kabu, that is, Kore or the virgin, and the one born from her Dusares, that is, the only begotten of the lord. This also takes place in Elousa, the city, on that night, as there in Petra and in Alexandria.\" \n\nAccounts of the birth of Dionysus are generally agreed upon by the ancient writers; but rival claims are raised by not a few Greek cities to having been the place of his birth. The peoples of Elis and Naxos. The Teans advance as proof that the god was born among them the fact that, even to this day, at fixed times in their city a fountain of wine, of unusually sweet fragrance, flows of its own accord from the earth; and as for the peoples of the other cities, they in some cases point out a plot of land which is sacred to Dionysus, in other cases shrines and sacred precincts which have been consecrated to him from ancient times. Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca (50BCE) Book III.66\n\nEudoxus says that persons who drink the water of Lake Clitorius take a distaste for wine, and Theopompus asserts that the waters of the springs already named are productive of inebriety. According to Mucianus, there is a fountain at Andros, consecrated to Father Liber (Dionysus), from which wine flows during the seven days appointed for the yearly festival of that god, the taste of which becomes like that of water the moment it is taken out of sight of the temple. \n(Pliny the Elder, Natural History 31:13)\n\n  \"It is accredited by the Mucianus who was three times consul that the water flowing from a spring in the temple of Father Liber (Dionysus title in Latin) on the island of Andros always has the flavour of wine on Nones of Janus (January 5th-7th): the day is called God’s Gift Day (Theodosia).” (Pliny the Elder, Natural History Book II.231).\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:10:55 - Jan 6th Vs.

But Semele, being pregnant and unable to bear the magnitude of the situation, miscarried the child and perished from the fire. Then Zeus took up the child, entrusted him to Hermes, and ordered him to carry it to the cave on Mount Nysa, located between Phoenicia and the Nile. He instructed the nymphs to raise the child with great care and to provide the best nurture.\n\nThus, Dionysus was raised on Nysa and received his name from Zeus and Nysa. Homer also bears witness to this in his hymns, where he says:\n\n'There is a certain Nysa, the highest mountain, blooming with forest, far from Phoenicia, near the streams of Egypt.'\n\nThey say that, raised by the nymphs on Nysa, he became the discoverer of wine and taught humanity the cultivation of the vine. As he traveled nearly the entire inhabited world, he civilized many lands, and for this reason he won the highest honors from all.\"\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

The 3rd,  Prometheus Bound, written as a Play by Aeschylus in Athens in the classical period, but has its roots in ancient lore possibly going deep into copper or bronze age Black Sea Region, modern day Ukraine & Georgia, then, the 4th,  the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, possibly also a bronze age tradition from the Myceneans at Eleusis, also handed down to the classical Greeks. 5th  Works & Days by Hesiod from Iron Age Ionia, which is modern day Turkey, thought to have possible connections to earlier Hittite Theogonies from the region, handed down to the Ionians after the collapse of the Bronze Age. 6th  The Orphic Theogony from Ancient Greece’s Classical period, thought to be rooted in ancient bronze age Thracian tradition, according to Plato & later Strabo, the Hellenes owe most of their culture to imported Thracian rites, especially Orphic tradition, which Plato himself was initiated into.  And finally, 7th, the Book of Genesis from the Hebrew Bible, which in the form we have today, early Hellenistic Jewish creation epic, possibly borrows themes from all 6 mentioned, or at the very least, attempts to answer the questions that these texts propose to one another, having roots in some of the oldest literature and traditions in the world, and updated to keep with the trends of Monism & Hellenistic Cosmology, while keeping the core identity of Israel alive and in the forefront. In this video, I plan to demonstrate and explore how these 7 traditions are interrelated and how the previous 6 traditions influence the latter Genesis. I also plan to show how the major differences in these traditions reflect the vast changing of world views from time & place, but how these major themes of Sin & Mortality stay fixed, even if these traditions view these fixed moral axes in different ways.  These 7 ancient sources, from 7 different places, in 4 separate languages, and spanning from 2,500 BCE to 300 BCE, rise from a timeless quest for meaning. While separated by culture and geography, these stories share a profound exploration of two universal themes: Sin/Morality & Death/Mortality. Yet, how they navigate these themes reveals the distinct worldviews of these authors and audience. \n\nEnlil’s decision reflects the somewhat capricious nature of the gods in Mesopotamian mythology. The flood isn't portrayed as a moral judgment on human wickedness, as it is in the Book of Genesis. Instead, it’s more about the gods being inconvenienced and wanting to restore their own tranquility by reducing the noise of human activity. Enlil’s action is depicted as a divine overreaction rather than a calculated punishment for specific human sins. \n\nIn contrast to Enlil sending a flood because he was annoyed, In Genesis, Yahweh floods the world because of the sins of humans and plans to destroy and rebuild the world through his chosen servant Noah, as stated earlier, with his 7 family members. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 - Intro (0)\n00:01:47 - A Gift & a Curse (1)\n00:09:00 - 7 Ancient Texts (2)\n00:02:48 - Sin & Deluge (3)\n00:13:00 - Morality of the Gods (4)\n00:18:56 - Myth of Er (5)\n00:20:32 - Justice / δικαιοσύνη (6)\n00:22:56 - Death Passports / Totenpässe (7)\n00:25:05 - Osiris & Ma'at (8)\n00:27:30 - Holy Ichor of Prometheus (9)\n00:28:57 - Ambrosia & Nectar of the Gods (10)\n00:31:45 - Adam's Apple (11)\n00:33:16 - Holy Eua & the Pomengranate (12)\n00:35:09 - Holy Deo & Hospitality (13)\n00:40:30 - Bacchus IS THE Forbidden Fruit (14)\n00:45:35 - Orphic Original Sin (15)\n00:49:00 - Pythagorean Immortality of the Soul (16)\n00:51:07 - Pandora's Box & Eve (17)\n00:56:22 - Epimetheus & Adam (18)\n00:57:52 - Prometheus & Satan (19)\n00:59:32 - Original Sin (20)\n01:04:19 - Conclusion (21)\n\n\n#gnosticinformant  #mythology  #biblicalstudies",

In 2019–2020, he held the appointment of Horace W. Goldsmith Visiting Associate Professor in Judaic Studies at Yale University.\n\nAdler specializes in the origins of Judaism as a system of ritual practices, and in the evolution these practices over the long-term. His research in recent years has focused on ritual purity observance evidenced in the archaeological remains of chalk vessels and immersion pools. He has also researched and published extensively on ancient tefillin (phylacteries) from Qumran and elsewhere in the Judean Desert.\n\nHe has directed excavations at several sites throughout Israel, most recently at ‘Einot Amitai and at Reina, two sites in Galilee where Roman-era chalk vessel workshops have been unearthed.\n\nAdler was appointed in 2018 by the Minister of Culture to serve as a member of the Israeli Council for Archaeology.\n\nAdler's book, entitled: 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐎𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐉𝐮𝐝𝐚𝐢𝐬𝐦: 𝐀𝐧 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐞𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥-𝐇𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐥, published with Yale University Press in November, 2022.\n\nThroughout much of history, the Jewish way of life has been characterized by strict adherence to the practices and prohibitions legislated by the Torah: dietary laws, ritual purity, circumcision, Sabbath regulations, holidays, and more. But precisely when did this unique way of life first emerge, and why specifically at that time?\n \nIn this revolutionary new study, Yonatan Adler methodically engages ancient texts and archaeological discoveries to reveal the earliest evidence of Torah observance among ordinary Judeans. He examines the species of animal bones in ancient rubbish heaps, the prevalence of purification pools and chalk vessels in Judean settlements, the dating of figural representations in decorative and functional arts, evidence of such practices as tefillin and mezuzot, and much more to reconstruct when ancient Judean society first adopted the Torah as authoritative law.\n \nFocusing on the lived experience of the earliest Torah observers, this investigative study transforms much of what we thought we knew about the genesis and early development of Judaism.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nMost Christians don’t learn anything about the earliest Christian history.\nThose who do, typically learn a canned narrative telling you how the church of popes and martyrs won out against external enemies (called “pagans”) and internal enemies (called “heretics”).\n\nIt’s time to stop ignoring the creators of early Christianity. It’s time to stop\nmarginalizing figures whose life and thought is so helpful for developing an authentic and philosophically-informed spirituality today. It’s time to embrace the heretics as the true fathers and mothers of a spiritual assembly. If Jesus spoke to the poor and the outcast, he spoke to heretics.\n\nWhat united these figures? One simple thing: gnosis. Gnosis is not\ninformation, it is deep knowledge, redeeming knowledge, transformative\nlearning. Christians who preached secret knowledge were called gnostics. In some cases, they called themselves gnostics. In others, they were called gnostics by their enemies.\n\nA gnostic is a knower—a person who takes faith and transmutes it into spiritual knowledge. They stated reasons for their faith, and spoke in terms that transcended normal rationality. They were not afraid to speak against the majority, or to be countercultural.

    "description": "Professor Gad Barnea, Ph.D (Link for Book)\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/isbn/9783111018638/html\n(PRE-ORDER HERE)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AGad+Barnea&s=relevancerank&text=Gad+Barnea&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_2\nYahwism under the Achaemenid Empire\nProfessor Shaul Shaked in Memoriam\nEdited by: Gad Barnea and Reinhard G. Kratz\nLinks to academic articles from Dr. Barnea:\nhttps://haifa.academia.edu/gadbarnea\n\nDr. Barnea is a Lecturer at the department of Jewish history and biblical studies at the University of Haifa as well as a Research Fellow at “the Bible in its Traditions,” a research project of the École biblique et archéologique Française de Jérusalem - and a flagship in the field of Digital Humanities. Barnea’s scholarly focus is directed at researching and teaching the evolution and character of “Yahwism under the Iranian ‘Age of Empires’”—from the rise of the Achaemenid empire to the fall of the Sassanian empire. \n\nAlready during his academic studies, Barnea recognized that the scholarship of the ancient Near East, ancient Judaism and biblical studies is seriously crippled by a lack of awareness and engagement with the rich history, linguistics, cultic practices and writings of the Iranian empires who, in one way or another, ruled over the region and its peoples for well over a millennium. The Iranian “age of empires” was instrumental as the historical and ideological background for the composition, edition and redaction of the Hebrew Bible, the apocryphal texts, early-Christianity, the so-called “Gnostic” writings as well as rabbinic and early mystical Jewish works. \n\nSpecifically in the realm of cultic practices, Barnea’s scholarship examines the dialogue and symbiosis of early-Zoroastrianism and Yahwism (or early Judaism). On that front, Barnea has made several important contributions—in articles as well as lectures—to the study of interpretatio iudaica in the Achaemenid period as well as the early-Zoroastrian features found in the royal inscriptions (Xerxes’ “Daiva” inscription). He has recently designed a course, entitled “Seen from the East: Judaism under the Iranian ‘Age of Empires’” which he is currently teaching simultaneously at the universities of Haifa, Israel and Oldenburg, Germany. \n\nA significant portion of Barnea’s scholarship is devoted to epigraphic work. He has recently published a previously misread ostracon from Elephantine dating to the early Achaemenid period, which is the first and only direct witness we possess of a Jewish female temple officiant-a priestess-in charge of a cultic service at the temple of Yhw. it is also the earliest Jewish curse text known to us outside the bible and the only direct extra-biblical witness we have to a Jewish ritual of any kind prior to the Greco-Roman period. In addition, it is the oldest known example of this genre of “curses against thieves” which we know were very popular later in the Greco-Roman world and the only known specimen of such a curse text that survived in Aramaic. Furthermore, it is the unique witness of this genre of curse ritual in a Jewish context, and the sole record of any ritual performed at a temple to Yahweh.\n\nBarnea’s epigraphic work also led him to restore a remarkable Qumran scroll (4Q550) which recounts a previously unknown Achaemenid court tale and is forthcoming in Brill’s DSSE series. He has recently signed an agreement with Palgrave-Macmillian to write a comprehensive book covering the history and character of the Yahwistic community at Elephantine and is co-editor with Prof. Reinhard Kratz (Gõttingen) of the forthcoming book “Yahwism under the Achaemenid empire,” which is and edited volume inspired by the international conference under the same name (in honor of the late Prof. Shaul Shaked) that Barnea organized in Dec. 2022 at the university of haifa. \n\nInternational collaboration is a central feature of Barnea’s activities and his collaboration with Prof. Benedikt Hensel on a number of groundbreaking projects promises to rethink the epigraphy of Judaism in the Achaemenid period using innovative methodologies and technologies.\n\nFinally, Barnea brings several decades of experience in designing and managing complex technology projects into the field of Digital Humanities - as well as in the formulation and establishment of international technology standards (VRML 97). He has been a central member and a technology consultant of the Digital project “the bible in its traditions” and is currently developing, together with Prof. Hensel, a new standard approach to the elaboration of Digital Humanities projects. \n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

The Celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The story we are told is that Jesus of Nazareth, around the age of 33, went down to Jerusalem with his disciples during the Pesach Festival, also known as the Passover, which is a Jewish festival celebrated at the Spring Equinox, which according to tradition, occurs on the 14th of the Babylonian month of Nisan, which corresponds to the Athenian month of Elaphebolia, which also corresponds to the period of the Roman March 15th to April 15th, which means that the 14th of Nisan would fall on 28th of March to be exact, although since the Julian Calendar is Solar and the Babylonian and Attic Calendars are Lunar, the dates will vary from year to year. This is also why the dates of Easter and Passover are celebrated on different days of our modern Gregorian Calendars each year, and they mark the date of Easter & Pesach based on the Paschal Moon. \n\nThe Spring Equinox, also known as the Vernal Equinox, marks the moment in the year when the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north. This event occurs around March 20th or 21st in the Northern Hemisphere and around September 22nd or 23rd in the Southern Hemisphere, depending on the year. The term \"equinox\" comes from Latin words meaning \"equal night,\" reflecting the approximately equal length of day and night that occurs everywhere on Earth during the equinoxes. \n\nThe Spring Equinox signifies the beginning of spring, a time of renewal and growth when daylight begins to increase, leading to longer days than nights. It is a period celebrated in various cultures with festivals and rituals that often symbolize rebirth, fertility, and new beginnings. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Spring Equinox is associated with the warming weather, melting snow, budding plants, and the return of foliage and blooming flowers, embodying the cycle of life, rejuvenation, and the Earth's fertility. \n\nAncient spring equinox festivals were significant cultural and religious events in many ancient societies, marking the end of winter and the beginning of spring—a time of rebirth, renewal, and fertility. These festivals were often tied to agricultural cycles, reflecting the importance of planting seasons and the growth of new life.  \n\n\n“When, after three days and three nights, Inanna had not returned, Ninshubur set up a lament for her by the ruins. She beat the drum for her in the temple. She circled the houses of the gods. She tore at her eyes; she tore at her mouth; she tore at her thighs. She dressed herself in a single garment like a beggar. Alone, she set out for Nippur and the temple of Enlil” \n\nAsk her only for the corpse that hangs from the hook on the wall. One of you will sprinkle the food of life on it. The other will sprinkle the water of life. Inanna will arise.\" \n\nThe kurgarra and the galatur heeded Enki's words. They set out for the underworld. Like flies, they slipped through the cracks of the gates. They entered the throne room of the Queen of the Underworld. \n\nEreshkigal said: \"Speak then! What do you wish?\" They answered:  We wish only the corpse that hangs from the hook on the wall.\" Ereshkigal said: \"The corpse belongs to Inanna.\" They said: \"Whether it belongs to our queen, Whether it belongs to our king, That is what we wish.\" The corpse was given to them. The kurgarra sprinkled the food of life on the corpse. The galatur sprinkled the water of life on the corpse. Inanna arose. . \n\n(Descent of Inanna, Wolkstein and Kramer, 90) \n\nThe Hilaria of Attis was a “Holy Week” or the “Passion of Attis.” This was a Roman festival, celebrated in multiple cities in Rome during the same week, and in Egypt was celebrated for Osiris and Isis, without castration, and slightly celebrated differently, but still called Hilaria, which in latin means “Rejoicing”  \n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 - Start\n00:01:55 - Paschal Moon\n00:03:24 - Passover Lamb\n00:04:35 - Christ Crucified\n00:11:17 - Intro\n00:14:39 - Vernal Equinox\n00:17:10 - Akitu Festival\n00:18:58 - Baal & Marduk\n00:21:31 - Descent of Ishtar\n00:35:11 - Esther\n00:40:40 - Lent\n00:44:22 - Zukru Festival\n00:48:48 - Dagan of the Garden\n00:54:21 - Nowruz Festival\n00:56:40 - Ēostre\n01:01:19 - Sham al-Nassim\n01:05:58 - Osiris Resurrected\n01:13:32 - Eshmun\n01:23:14 - Theraputai\n01:30:55 - Orphic Incubation\n01:37:38 - Buddhist Monasticism\n01:40:36 - Eshmun-Melqart\n01:45:38 - Pyrgi Tablet & Adonis\n01:53:42 - Hilaria\n01:58:20 - Nasseene Hymn\n02:00:53 - Mysteries of Iasios\n02:02:13 - Dionysus\n02:05:49 - Hyacinthus\n02:08:47 - Orpheus' Descent\n02:11:46 - Orphic Piety\n02:15:14 - Katabasis & Anabasis\n02:22:00 - Eleusinian Mysteries\n02:25:17 - Earliest Apologists\n02:30:33 - Outro\n\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #easter #springequinox",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\n@gnosticinformantTV\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language & its spread across the world from the Stone Age through the Copper Age and into the Bronze Age represent a fascinating period of human history, revealing complex migrations, cultural transformations, and the dawn of linguistic diversity as we know it today. These narratives span thousands of years and cover vast expanses of Eurasia, marking the beginnings of many of the world's major language families. \n\nThe story of Proto-Indo-Europeans, also called Aryans and Eurasians, begins with the question of the homeland, a topic of scholarly debate. The most widely accepted theory places the Eurasian homeland in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, covering today's Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. From this region, during the late Neolithic period (around 4500-2500 BCE), just after the cultivation of the vine and making wine was discovered by people from that same eastern black sea region, known as the Caucasus, Colchis & Armenia, the Eurasian people began their expansive journey, in all directions, east, west and even north and south. They travel as far east as India and as far west as the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nWe know this due to several reasons. Culture, Religion, and Language are 3 of the biggest clues.  \n\n*Méh₂tēr \nMother in English, Mōdar in Gothic/Germanic, Mḗtēr μάτηρ in Ancient Greek, Mātar مادر in Persian, मातृ  Mā́tṛ in Sanksrit. \n\nCultic Religious terms *seh₂k-, which means Holy or Sanctified, like Latin Sānctus or Sanciō. The Greek word ἅγιος Hágios, which also means Sacred, cognate with Sankrit yájus यजुस्,  hence YajurVeda or “Worship Knowledge” coming from PIE H₁yaǵ-. \n\nAnd the Sankrit Word Soma सोम , cognate with Persian Haoma هاما, is a sacred drink that is in cognate with the Germanic word for GOD. GOTTA. Coming from the PIE word ǵʰew- \"to pour, libate, invoke\". \n\nThis also shows evidence that religion itself may come from Psychedelic potions in ritual use.   \n\nThe dispersal of Proto-Indo-European speakers is closely tied to their nomadic pastoralist lifestyle, which relied heavily on the domestication of horses and innovations such as the wheel. These technological advances facilitated mobility over great distances, allowing PIE tribes to spread their language and culture across the Eurasian steppes. \n\nAs we move into the Copper Age (also known as the Chalcolithic period, approximately 3500-2300 BCE), the spread of PIE speakers accelerated due to several factors. The development of copper metallurgy provided new tools and weapons, enhancing agricultural productivity and warfare capabilities. These advancements supported population growth and encouraged PIE tribes to explore new territories. \n\nDuring this time, PIE communities fragmented and migrated in various directions, leading to the differentiation of the language into distinct but related dialects. These migrations can be traced through archaeological evidence, such as the spread of Corded Ware culture in northern Europe and the Yamnaya culture in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, both of which are associated with early PIE speakers.\n\nThe transition to the Bronze Age (around 3300-1200 BCE) marked a significant turning point in the dissemination of PIE languages and cultures. The increased use of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, further revolutionized tools, weapons, and artifacts. This period saw the emergence of more complex social structures, including chiefdoms and early states, which facilitated larger-scale migrations and conquests. \nEurope's Stone Age, spanning from the Paleolithic through the Neolithic periods, has yielded a wealth of artifacts that provide insight into the spiritual life, artistic expression, and daily practices of its ancient inhabitants. Among these, some of the most remarkable and ancient artifacts include the Lion Man, Venus figurines.\n\nHindus worship the Daevas (daemons) and reject the Asuras (titans). This is why they have a pantheon similar to the Greeks and Romans with a Tyrannical Sky Father at the Helm, who was called Dyas Pitar, which is cognate with Zeus Pater and Ju-Piter. This god is later known as Indra in vedic texts and then finally assumes the form as Vishnu and comes as a human form as Krishna. \n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:03:16 - Stone Age\n00:06:07 - Anatolia & Göbekli Tepe\n00:11:07 - Stonehenge\n00:11:50 - Stone Age Art\n00:13:01 - Great Mother\n00:16:17 - Yamnaya & Corded Ware\n00:20:42 - Linguistics (Indo-European)\n00:21:43 - Religion (Vedic & Hellenic)\n00:31:39 - Pelasgians\n00:35:52 - Indo-European Gods\n00:40:08 - Rituals\n00:41:39 - Cosmology\n00:42:38 - Priesthood\n00:44:36 - Thracians\n00:48:56 - Scythians\n00:55:33 - Slavic\n01:01:20 - Celts\n01:14:28 - Norse Germanic\n01:22:42 - Conclusion\n\n#gnosticinformant #oldest #religion",

But not just any of the sons of God, these two are the only two that are chosen to be the heir of the Kingdom of Heaven itself. They are THE Son of God. I will show why Dionysus stands above all other sons of Zeus later in the video. But in short, in the Dionysaica, as well as older legends and fragments concerning Dionysus, Zeus, in the form of a dragon impregnated the Perpetual Virgin, or Kore, aka Persephone, and chose the child to wield the thunderbolt and become the Prince of Olympus, and the heir to Zeus’s throne, a status that no son of Zeus had ever been promised before. Like Jesus, who is the Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Logos, who was one with God. In the same sense, Dionysus, called Sabazius by the Phrygians, was “In the Bosom of the Father Zeus”. (Clement) \n\nDionysus & Jesus both have a mortal human mother and are miraculously born. Unlike Jesus, Dionysus has 2 mothers, one divine, one mortal. But one of them, Persephone, had the epithet of Kore, which can mean Virgin or Young Maiden. Similar to Hebrew word עלמה   Almah, used in the famous “Virgin Birth Prophecy” by Isaiah, cited by Christians and used for Mary and Jesus. Persephone’s name was so sacred that it was not permitted to be spoken aloud by mortal lips, so the Virgin, or Kore, is who gave birth to the first Dionysus, called Zagreus. And the Dionysaica, reports that Dionysus, called Zagreus, was conceived during the time when “the Full Moon was seen in Virgo”. And two times the author Nonnus reports that Virgo was present during his conception. \n\nThere is also the Sabazius, who Diodorus calls the oldest Dionysus, who according to multiple inscriptions and passages from Diodorus and Cicero, is the Son of the Great Mother Cybele, who like Mary holds the title for Mother of God. I will argue that the Veneration & Worship of Mother Mary has some of its roots of influence in Phrygian Cybele. More on this to come later.  \n\nAfter Dionysus’ death and resurrection, he was born again by the other mortal mother, Semele, was reported to be a virgin according to commentary about the wedding between her and Zeus, but no virgin-birth in a miracle sense. The text clearly says she had intercourse with Zeus, and that Zeus loved her more than anyone before her and the love was real love. Regardless of the details, a mortal-virgin-miracle birth scene is present in both the Gospels and in the Dionysaica legends and fragments. \n\nJesus and Dionysus died in violent ways but were reported to have been bodily resurrected within a matter of days.  \n\nJesus and Dionysus both want one thing, and one thing only from their followers. Devotion. At the end of the Bacchae, Dionysus tells Agave, that the wages of sin is death, and she is told that it is too late to repent, for she did not believe in him before the hour was too late. This is the very attitude that Jesus has for people who do not believe in him and will be cast into hell when it is too late for repenting. \n\nBy about 150 years after Jesus lived, people started to really notice these similarities, and they talked about them a lot. Early 2nd century Christian Preachers compared Jesus with Bacchus, and later Nonnus, a Pagan Poet who wrote the famous Dionysaica, the most extensive mythology of Dionysus, in the form of Homeric Prose,  was reported by Church tradition to have converted to Christ, and wrote extensively on the Gospel of John, comparing the life of the Johannine Jesus to the life of Dionysus. \n\n\n So, when Greek people who believed in many gods heard about Jesus turning water into wine, they would have thought it was very much like what Dionysus could do. Later in the Gospel of John, Jesus says, \"I am the true vine,\" another phrase that would readers of John’s Gospel would hear and think of Dionysus, the Vine God, but could arguably be interpreted as Jesus' supplanting of Dionysus, as the TRUE Vine God. By this, Jesus was like a new version of Dionysus but even more important. \n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:45 - Main Arguments (Dionysian Roots of Christianity)\n00:12:10 - John's Bacchae\n00:14:08 - Greek Tragedy Mimesis\n00:23:55 - Inverted Mysteries\n00:28:24 - Syncretism & Competition\n00:34:58 - Last Pagan Generation\n00:40:40 - 'Lamb of God' Vs.

In Rome there had been the minor holiday of Bruma on November 24, which turned into large scale end of the year festivities in Constantinople and Christianity. The festival included night-time feasting, drinking, and merriment. Cato reports that cutting down trees for vine props was custom for this Holiday. During this time, prophetic indications were taken as predictions for the remainder of the winter. Despite the 6th century emperor Justinian's official repression of paganism,  the holiday was celebrated at least until the 11th century, as recorded by Christopher of Mytilene. No references exist after the 1204 sacking of the capital by the Fourth Crusade.\n\n“Yalda Night”, a Winter Solstice Holiday, was one of the holy nights in ancient Iran, included in the official calendar of the ancient Iranians from 502 BC during the time of Darius I. The festivities that take place on this night are an ancient tradition.\n\nThe Saturnalia was an enduring Roman festival dedicated to the agricultural god Saturn which was held between the 17th and 23rd of December each year during the winter solstice. Originating from archaic agricultural rituals the Roman festivities came to include a general round of gift-giving, merrymaking, and role-reversals so that it became one of the most popular celebrations in the calendar and certainly the jolliest. The similarities of some of its features and the timing - pushed later into December over time - suggest a strong influence on the Christian celebration of Christmas.\n\nStarting off as a one-day holiday the Saturnalia eventually expanded to cover a week by the Late Republic. Augustus reduced the festivities to a more modest three days, but his successor Caligula increased it to five days, and it seems that, in practice, ordinary people celebrated for the full seven days anyway, despite the official decrees.\n\nThe Saturnalia was presided over by a king, chosen especially for the occasion, known as the Saturnalicius princeps or 'leader of the Saturnalia.' Sometimes he is referred to as the 'Lord of Misrule' as he was selected from the lowliest members of a household and given the right to conduct light-hearted mischief. It was a festive period when people gave gifts to one another. Slaves had the freedoms enjoyed by ordinary citizens and were now able to gamble, get drunk in public, and throw aside the cloak of decorum they were meant to present at any other time of the year. More informal clothes (synthesis) were worn by citizens instead of the usual toga, and there was a general round of feasts, partying, game playing, and merrymaking for all. These events made it the jolliest Roman festival in the calendar; a fact which led Catullus to famously describe it as 'the best of times.'\n\nYule, festival observed historically by Germanic peoples and in modern times primarily by Neo-Pagans, coinciding with the winter solstice (December 21–22 in the Northern Hemisphere; June 20–21 in the Southern Hemisphere). The pre-Christian festival originated in Scandinavia and was later subsumed, along with other pagan celebrations, into the Christian holiday of Christmas. Some modern celebrations of Yule attempt to re-create ancient traditions, while others have been adapted or reimagined to suit contemporary personal and religious practices.\nThe Dionysia was originally a rural festival in Eleutherae, Attica (Διονύσια τὰ κατ' ἀγρούς – Dionysia ta kat' agrous), probably celebrating the cultivation of vines. It was probably a very ancient festival, perhaps not originally associated with Dionysus. This \"rural Dionysia\" was held during the winter, in the month of Poseideon (the month straddling the winter solstice, i.e., Dec.-Jan.). \n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:08:38 - Ancient Solstice Veneration\n00:11:25 - Virgin Born Dusares\n00:15:20 - Justin Martyr Apology\n00:19:08 - Out of Egypt, I have called my Son\n00:24:09 - Virgin Born Aion\n00:29:50 - Winter Solstice Festivals\n00:31:00 - Yalda Night\n00:36:22 - Gift Giving & Merry Making\n00:38:34 - Haloa & Rural Dionysia\n00:46:32 - Macrobius' Saturnalia\n00:53:24 - Brumalia\n00:59:26 - Pine Tres\n01:08:03 - Christmas Spirit\n01:10:59 - Its Pagan Bruh\n01:18:26 - Puritans\n01:21:54 - Jolly Ol' Saint Nick\n01:28:05 - Infernal Father\n01:36:24 - Severan Dynasty Religion\n01:53:25 - Elagabalus\n02:01:53 - Mithras\n02:25:05 - Sol Invictus\n02:32:10 - Aurelian's Feast Date\n02:33:55 - Calculation Theory\n02:39:59 - January 6th\n02:43:00 - Cultural Milieu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#brumalia #christmas #saturnalia",

It argues that the idea of a monotheistic cosmic god was first introduced in Genesis 1 under the influence of Plato’s philosophy, and that this cosmic Creator was originally distinct from the lesser terrestrial gods, including Yahweh, who appear elsewhere in Genesis. It shows the use of Plato’s Critias, the sequel to Timaeus, in the stories about the Garden of Eden, the intermarriage of \"the sons of God\" and the daughters of men, and the biblical flood. This book confirms the late date and Hellenistic background of Genesis 1-11, drawing on Plato’s writings and other Greek sources found at the Great Library of Alexandria.\n\n\nBerossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus proposes a provocative new theory regarding the date and circumstances of the composition of the Pentateuch. We argue that the Hebrew Pentateuch was composed in its entirety about 273-272 BCE by Jewish scholars at Alexandria that later traditions credited with the Septuagint translation of the Pentateuch into Greek. The primary evidence is literary dependence of Gen. 1-11 on Berossus' Babyloniaca (278 BCE) and of the Exodus story on Manetho's Aegyptiaca (c. 285-280 BCE), and the geo-political data contained in the Table of Nations. A number of indications point to a provenance of Alexandria, Egypt for at least some portions of the Pentateuch. That the Pentateuch, drawing on literary sources found at the Great Library of Alexandria, was composed at almost the same date as the Septuagint translation, provides compelling evidence for some level of communication and collaboration between the authors of the Pentateuch and the Septuagint scholars at Alexandria's Museum. The late date of the Pentateuch, as demonstrated by literary dependence on Berossus and Manetho, has two important consequences: the definitive overthrow of the chronological framework of the Documentary Hypothesis, and a late, 3rd century BCE date for major portions of the Hebrew Bible which show literary dependence on the Pentateuch.\n\nAll this evidence points to direct influence from Greek writings, especially Plato's Laws, on the biblical legal tradition. Finally, it is argued that the creation of the Hebrew Bible took place according to the program found in Plato's Laws for creating a legally authorized national ethical literature, reinforcing the importance of this specific Greek text to the authors of the Torah and Hebrew Bible in the early Hellenistic Era. This study offers a fascinating analysis of the background to the Pentateuch, and will be of interest not only to biblical scholars, but also to students of Plato, ancient law, and Hellenistic literary traditions.\n\n#gnosticinformant #mythvision #oldtestament",

What we know for sure, compared to what we are told by traditional accounts is wide ranging and extremely problematic. The earliest Christian documents we have are letters from Paul, dating to the 40s-50s and early 60s. Only 7 of them are considered to by authentic and written by one author.These letters from Paul contain the most important details about Jesus being crucified. We have letters from John and Peter, which may not be authentic, but are nevertheless, late 1st century and early 2nd century texts written by Christians. Most scholars date the 3 Synoptic Gospels to the late 1st and early 2nd century, starting with Mark around 70, then Matthew between 85-95, and Luke-Acts in the early to middle of the 2nd century. The Gospel of John also is dated by most scholars between the 90s and 140s. All four of these gospels did not have names of authors attached to them until the end of the 2nd century. So we don't even know if they really were written by Mark, Matthew, Luke or John. These titles were given by later Church fathers. The earliest physical fragments of these texts that we have are from the late 2nd and 3rd century. And the oldest full copy of the bible in existence is Codex Sinaiticus from 325 AD. The Gospel of Thomas, which was once an important early christian text, is dated between late 1st and early 2nd century (some even arguing that it could be the oldest) but was not selected among the Biblical Canon by the Church fathers in the 4th century. Although it's impact on early Christianity was massive. Outside of that, there is a plethora of gospels and texts produced by early christians in the 2nd century that will be discussed later in the video. \nIn the 4th century, Eusibius provides a detailed list of the early Church Bishops in Antioch, Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Corinth, Smyrna and others. These lists show a direct continuation from the apostles like Andrew, consecrating the father of the Heretic Marcion, Philologus, the first bishop of Sinope as well as consecrating the first bishop of Corinth, named Apollos, who is mentioned in Paul's letters. And Mark being the first bishop of Alexandria consecrated by Peter, with Peter being the first bishop of both Antioch and Rome, consecrating both Linus and Evodius. And of course, they list James as the leader and first bishop of the Church of Jerusalem. And from them are the 70 apostles listed in Acts, with names that look familiar to people mentioned in Paul's letters. These elaborate lists of succesion show what appears to be a United Church that has a direct line of Orthodoxy from Jesus down to Constantine.\nHowever, the primary sources show this to be not only problematic, but impossible in some cases. Many of the sources conflicting lists with each other and people considered to be alive in certain times are somehow alive in times when they should be dead. And the survinving texts we have are so few and far between, that it becomes a nightmare to try to peice it all together. \nThe truth is, early Chrisitianity was far from united. It was so diverse that I would argue Christians in the first two centuries were farther apart than a Moorman is today with a Catholic. \n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:03:39 - (Ch.1) Apostolic Succesion\n00:05:44 - (Ch.2) Early Chrisitan Sects.\n00:08:42 - (Ch.3) Historical Jesus\n00:11:33 - (Ch.4) Great Assembly\n00:13:42 - (Ch.5) Sibylline Oracles\n00:29:12 - (Ch.6) Early Roman Sources\n00:32:31 - (Ch.7) The Mandaeans\n00:35:30 - (Ch.8) Pagan Baptists\n00:39:34 - (Ch.9) Who was Paul writing to?\n00:41:17 - (Ch.10) Cult of Theos-Hypsistos & Early Christ Assemblies\n00:52:07 - (Ch.11) Carpocrations & Marcellina\n01:05:20 - (Ch.12) Apotheosis of Epiphanes & Simon Magus\n01:15:15 - (Ch.13) Simon Magus, Father of Heresy\n01:24:18 - (Ch.14) Gnostic & Catholic Schizm\n01:26:04 - (Ch.15) Basilides & Abraxas\n01:29:06 - (Ch.16) Pre-Christian Gnosticism\n01:33:54 - (Ch.17) Gnosis Vs.

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nDionysus, alternatively named Bacchus, Iacchus, Zagreus, Sabazius, or Liber Pater (as well as dozens of Titles in the traditions of Greco-Roman mythology, is a deity representing the natural elements of fertility and plant life, but is most renowned as the god of wine and revelry. The presence of his name on a Linear B tablet dating back to the 13th century BCE provides evidence that his worship was present during the Bronze age Mycenaean period, yet the exact origins of his cult remain unkown. He could be even older than that. Throughout various legends associated with his cult, Dionysus is consistently portrayed as having exotic beginnings.\n\nTo even begin to guess how old Dionysus is, you first have to understand that he is older than the invention of the alphabet. So dating him is tricky. Linear B represents a system of writing that utilized syllabic script to transcribe Mycenaean Greek, recognized as the most ancient form of the Greek language on record. This system of writing was in existence several centuries before the emergence of the Phoenican and Greek alphabet. The earliest instances of Mycenaean inscription trace back to approximately 1500 BCE, but the use of Linear B ceased following the end of the Bronze Age around 1200 BCE. Dionysus shows up in this period. \n\nsixth century BC, Pherecydes of Syros had suggested nũsa as an ancient word for \"tree,\" it could possibly have ties to Mount Nysa, the mythological birthplace in Greek lore of the god, where he was cared for by nymphs known as the Nysiads. ANd it's possible that it could be related to both \"tree\" and Mt. Nysa. \n\nAs Homer describes \"‘There is a certain Nysa, mountain high, with forests thick of Cedar, in Phoinike afar, close to Aigyptos' (Egypt's) streams.’ . \n\nA vase created by Sophilos ascribes names to these Nysiads (nusae). Some ancient propositions situated Nysa within Boeotia, the dwelling place of Dionysus' mother, Semele. Helicon Mountain and the hamlet of Eleutherae were believed to be plausible locations. Thrace was another potential location, possibly due to the early reverence of the god in that region. The Caucasus was another speculated site, situated at the known world's eastern boundary, since Dionysus was presumed to have entered Greece from the east.\n\nIn the fifth century BCE, Herodotus of Halicarnassus was aware of a mountain by the name of Nysa located in Aethiopia, possibly referring to Djebel Barkal, a place where ancient Nubians offered sacrifices to Amon. Antimachus of Colophon, who lived around the same time as Herodotus, seems to have adopted this idea, relocating Nysa to Arabia, possibly correlating it with the Arab deity referred to by Greeks as Orotalt. Diodorus of Sicily cites Antimachus, but he also documents a tradition locating Nysa in Libya. This relocation may be influenced by the worship of Shadrapa in Phoenician colonies along the Libyan coast. Furthermore, Diodorus chronicles ancient traditions situating the god’s birth in various places including Elis, Eleutherae, Naxos, or Teos.\"\n\nRegardless of his origins, This means that Dionyus can be dated no sooner than the 13th century BCE but also possibly even older, possibly even in the copper age. Knossos crete is arguably the oldest city in the world, having archaeological evidence dating back to 7,000 BCE, in the late stone age. The Island is rich in copper and is one of the leading possible locations for the beginning of the copper age which began around 4,000-3,500 BCE. The minoans Thrived during this period. Linear B, which Dionysus name is found in, is generally thought to have evolved from LINEAR A, the Heiroglyphic writing that the Minoans used and one of the oldest forms of writing on earth. In Minoan Crete, specifically at Knossos, the name 'Pentheus,' a term from subsequent Dionysian mythology meaning 'suffering,' was commonly bestowed upon men. It was a common name for the common class. Hungarian Philologist Kerényi posited that assigning such a name to a child likely implies a substantial spiritual linkage—perhaps as a descriptor for Dionysus himself, who, according to his mythology, is a deity destined to endure and then overcome suffering. In narratives that follow, Pentheus endures agony at the behest of Dionysus' acolytes, hinting at a profound spiritual intertwining, as per Kerényi’s analysis. He further hypothesizes that the term 'man who suffers' originally pertained to the deity before being attributed to specific persons as the narrative evolved. \n\n2nd Channel:\n@gnosticinformantTV\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\n#gnosticinformant #dionysus #greekmythology",

Moss is an English public intellectual, journalist,  New Testament scholar and historian of Christianity, and as of 2017, the Edward Cadbury Professor of Theology in the Department of Theology and Religion at the University of Birmingham. A graduate of Oxford and Yale universities, Moss specialises in the study of the New Testament, with a focus on the subject of martyrdom in early Christianity, as well as other topics from the New Testament and early Church History. She is the winner of a number of awards relating to her research and writing.\n\nMoss has specialized in the study of martyrdom, ancient medicine and the New Testament, early Christian ideas about the resurrection of Jesus's physical body, and enslaved literate workers in the ancient world. \n\nMoss has written three books on martyrdom. Her writing has been praised for its \"readability, clarity...creativity, thoughtfulness, and wit.\"  She was the recipient of The John Templeton Award of Theological Promise in 2011, which cited her 2010 OUP book, The Other Christs: Imitating Jesus in Ancient Christian Ideologies of Martyrdom. Her 2012 book, Ancient Christian Martyrdom, argued that post-Enlightenment bias against martyrdom had led scholars to think of martyrdom as a phenomenon that spread from one region of the Roman empire to another; against this, Moss argues that martyrdom developed differently in different contexts.  Her controversial 2013 book, The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom, argues that the stories of early Christian martyrdom \"have been altered ... edited and shaped by later generations of Christians\" and none of them are \"completely historically accurate\";  she additionally maintains that the Roman authorities did not actively seek out or target Christians and that in the first three centuries of Christian history, Christians were only prosecuted by order of a Roman emperor for a brief period (no more than twelve years).  In a review published in 2013 focusing on her first two books, Edinburgh classicist Lucy Grig wrote that \"Candida Moss has swiftly established herself as one of the most interesting and original scholars working on early Christian martyrdom.\"\n\nGet the Book:\nThe Myth of Persecution, Candida Moss (Ph.D)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/MYTH-PERSECUTION-Candida-Moss/dp/0062104551\n\nThe Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom is a 2013 book by Candida Moss, a professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. In her book, Moss advances a thesis that:\n\nThe traditional idea of the \"Age of Martyrdom\", when Christians suffered persecution from the Roman authorities and lived in fear of being thrown to the lions, is largely fictional. Here she follows the work of G. E. M. de Ste. Croix.\nThere was never sustained, targeted persecution of Christians by Imperial Roman authorities. Official persecution of Christians by order of the Roman Emperor lasted for at most twelve years of the first three hundred of the Church's history. Moss writes: \"This does not mean, however, that there were no martyrs at all or that Christians never died. It is clear that some people were cruelly tortured and brutally executed for reasons that strike us as profoundly unjust.\" \nMost of the stories of individual martyrs amassed by the early modern period are pure inventions. She agrees with Bollandist scholar Hippolyte Delehaye that most martyrdom literature developed in the fourth century and beyond. \nEven the oldest and most historically accurate stories of martyrs and their sufferings have been altered and re-written by later editors, so that it is impossible to know for sure what any of the martyrs actually thought, did or said.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nFeaturing Derek Lambert from:\n@MythVisionPodcast \n(Reading verses from sources) \n\nThe religious beliefs of Israel were rooted in the shared culture of Canaan. Although it had unique attributes that differed from the Canaanites, it still found expression in shared practices and language. Some traditional practices couldn't be merged with Yahwism, but others like sacred poetry, music, and architecture were adopted and became integral to Israelite religion. The Old Testament's embrace or rejection of these elements means that Canaanite religious influences still affect us today through biblical narratives.\nBefore the findings at Ugarit-Ras Shamra, our knowledge of Canaanite religion was minimal and largely from indirect sources. The Old Testament did mention Canaanite deities and rituals, but these were often in a negative light, making interpretations challenging. Mentions of Canaanite gods and rituals were also found in Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Phoenician writings, including the Karatepe inscriptions from 1946. However, these weren't enough to form a complete understanding. Greek historians provided accounts of Canaanite beliefs, but it was hard to distinguish authentic traditions from later additions. Excavations at places like Byblos and Megiddo gave us glimpses, but only a fragmentary picture.\nNow, thanks to discoveries at Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) in North Syria, the Canaanites tell their own story. Hundreds of clay tablets found there, written in a dialect close to Biblical Hebrew, offer rich insights. These tablets feature extensive mythological poems, records related to temple services, lists of deities and sacrifices, and details about temple workers and rituals. Additionally, artifacts linked to gods like Baal and Dagon, including temple remains and stelae, have been uncovered.\nIt's crucial to understand that while there was a core Canaanite religious belief, local variations existed. Not every Canaanite city would have worshiped all the gods we know from the texts. Canaanite religion was more of a public affair than a personal one. Its rituals, mostly centered on ensuring fertility, were community events. Though there were individual acts of devotion, as seen in Phoenician inscriptions, the religion was mainly a communal way to connect with nature's forces. This involved practices believed to ensure continued creation and rejuvenation. \nThe prominence of some deities in mythological writings doesn't always reflect their actual popularity among Canaanite devotees. Conversely, some gods, like Dagon, had a minimal role in myths—merely acknowledged as Baal's father—but seemed quite revered, as evidenced by a dedicated temple and two stelae in Ugarit.\nEL, the hebrew word for GOD, is the Supreme God and creator, and shows up as ALLAH in arabic.\nYHWH’s revelation is always at a mountain, whether called Sinai or Horeb, pictures the event is  a volcanic eruption. As these texts show, volcanism seems to be an essential attribute typically associated with YHWH, linking him to the Craftsman Metalurgy gods I mentioned before. The account of the Sinai revelation, with its volcanic imagery, is meant to show that YHWH himself, and not simply a divine emissary, but a Demiurgic Crafstman.\nSome believe Mount Sinai might be one of these Arabian volcanoes, which the Israelites approached after departing Egypt. \nThe Kenites seem to have been skilled metalworkers. Genesis 4 discusses Cain's descendant, Tubal-Cain, as a craftsman skilled in molding copper and iron. Semitic cognates of Cain hint that metallurgical activities were integral to its meaning. Hence, Cain might originally have represented the pioneering figure in metallurgy, with the Kenites—both metalworkers and smelters—as his successors. Their association with a volcanic deity like YHWH becomes clearer in this context.\n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:02:21 - Chapter 1: Canaanite Religion\n00:05:33 - Chapter 2: the God EL\n00:07:14 - Chapter 3: Divine Craftsman\n00:10:38 - Chapter 4: PTAH, Demiruge\n00:12:48 - Chapter 5: Elephantine Jews\n00:17:27 - Chapter 6: Yahweh, Midianite Metallurgy God\n00:24:59 - Chapter 7: YHWH vs. Ba'al\n00:32:18 - Chapter 8: Dionysian IAO\n00:37:54 - Chapter 9: Dionysus of the Desert\n00:39:57 - Chapter 10: Yahweh Inscriptions\n00:42:50 - Chapter 11: EL, King of the North\n00:45:45 - Chapter 12: Saturn, King of ELOHIM\n00:53:57 - Chapter 13: Old Gods - BAD\n00:58:00 - Chapter 14: Breasts of Gaia (2 Mountains)\n01:01:27 - Chapter 15: Jewish Polythesim\n01:03:22 - Chapter 16: Rise of Monotheism\n01:19:25 - Chapter 17: Demetrius Phalerius\n01:26:16 - OUTRO: Plutarch on 'AMEN'\n\n#gnosticinformant #judaism #documentary",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nThank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe Etruscans, who lived primarily in the region now \nknown as Tuscany, emerged around the 8th century BCE. They had a \nsignificant impact on the early Roman civilization and were eventually \nabsorbed by the Romans.\nThere were also various Italic tribes, including the \nLatins, Sabines, and Samnites, who lived in the Italian peninsula from around \nthe 2nd millennium BCE. The Latins were the tribe from which the Romans \nemerged.\nStarting from the 8th century BCE, the Greeks established \ncolonies in southern Italy and Sicily, an area that was often referred to as \nMagna Graecia.\n\nAeneas, a legendary figure of both Trojan and Roman mythology, is renowned as \nthe son of the divine Aphrodite and mortal Anchises. A part of Troy's royal lineage \nand a kin of Hector, Aeneas was a distinguished defender of his city during the \nTrojan War, demonstrating martial prowess second only to Hector himself. Homer's \nwork subtly hints at Aeneas' discontent with his secondary role, thereby giving rise \nto a later narrative that posits Aeneas as a conspirator in Troy's betrayal to the \nGreeks. However, a more prevalent version of his story portrays Aeneas as the \nhelm of the Trojan survivors following the Greek conquest of Troy. Regardless of \nthese divergent accounts, the common thread in all the narratives is the survival of \nAeneas, enabling him to be woven into the fabric of Roman mythology.\nThe connection of Homeric heroes to Italy and Sicily can be traced back to the 8th \ncentury BCE, coinciding with the era when Homer's epics are believed to have \ntransitioned into written form. Greek colonies, established in Italy and Sicily during \nthis period and the ensuing century, often claimed lineage from figures central to \nthe Trojan War. Aeneas, in particular, was associated with various locales and \ndynasties, notably within the region of Latium. As the Roman Empire expanded \nthroughout Italy and across the Mediterranean, Roman authors imbued with a \nsense of patriotism sought to craft a mythological tradition that would \nsimultaneously infuse their land with historical grandeur and subdue an underlying \nresentment towards Greek cultural hegemony. Aeneas, in his role as a Trojan \nadversary of the Greeks, and with a post-war narrative open to interpretation, was \nuniquely suited to embody the mythical precursor to the inception of Roman \nsupremacy.\nComposed circa 29-19 BCE, Virgil's Aeneid narrates across 12 books the mythic \nestablishment of Lavinium, the precursor to Alba Longa and Rome, by the Trojan \nhero Aeneas. As Virgil recounts, when the Greeks seized Troy, a resilient Aeneas \nwas instructed by the apparition of Hector to escape and initiate a significant city \nabroad. Mustering his family and followers, Aeneas secured the penates—\nhousehold deities—of Troy. However, amidst the chaos of evacuation from the \nburning city, his wife vanished. Her spirit later appeared to him, revealing his \ndestiny to venture to a land in the west where the Tiber River coursed.\nThus began Aeneas's epic journey, with stops in Thrace, Crete, and Sicily, and \nfraught with a plethora of trials culminating in a shipwreck near Carthage on the \nAfrican coast. Here, he was hospitably received by Dido, the bereaved queen. As \nhe narrated his tale, they fell in love and he delayed his journey until a stern \nreminder from the god Mercury refocused him on his ultimate objective: Rome. \nWracked with guilt, he immediately deserted Dido, who subsequently ended her \nown life. Resuming his voyage, Aeneas eventually reached the mouth of the Tiber.\nUpon his arrival, he was warmly greeted by Latinus, the regional king. \nNevertheless, several Italians, particularly Latinus's wife and Turnus, the Rutuli's \nleader, contested the Trojan settlers and the prospective marriage alliance \nbetween Aeneas and Latinus's daughter, Lavinia. War ensued, with the Trojans \nemerging victorious and Turnus meeting his end. Subsequently, Aeneas wed \nLavinia and established Lavinium.\nThe legendary founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, are depicted in Virgil's \nAeneid as the direct descendants of Aeneas, the Trojan hero whose destiny-led \nescapades in discovering Italy form the crux of the epic. The lineage connecting \nRomulus and Remus to Aeneas is through their maternal grandfather, Numitor. \nNumitor, a former king of Alba Longa—an ancient city in Latium, central Italy—was \nthe father of Rhea Silvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus.\nPrior to the twins' conception, Numitor's sovereignty was overthrown by his \nyounger brother, Amulius, who exploited the wealth of Alba Longa's treasury to \nseize power. To preclude potential conflicts of succession, Amulius murdered \nNumitor's male offspring and forced Rhea Silvia into the vestal order, thus obliging \nher to maintain the sacred flame of Vesta, the hearth's patron goddess, and \nuphold vows of chastity.\n\n#gnosticinformant #ancientrome #documentary #4k #rome #religion",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nDr. Joshua Bowen (Ph.d) & Megan Lewis (M.A)\nAssyriology\nwww.youtube.com/digitalhammurabi\nLearn to Read Sumerian:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Learn-Read-Ancient-Sumerian-Introduction/dp/1734358602\n\nDespite their ancient origins, the Anunnaki have been subject to many\ncontemporary reinterpretations, notably in various fringe theories and works of pseudo-history. These often involve extraterrestrial influences and other speculative concepts, but these ideas are not supported by mainstream scholarship or historical evidence. But more on that later as well. The mythology of the Anunnaki is complex and spans several ancient cultures, with the earliest accounts coming from the Sumerians. Their stories, like many ancient mythologies, attempt to explain the origin of the world, the nature of gods and humanity, and the laws that govern existence.\nIn Sumerian mythology, the Anunnaki were initially viewed as celestial deities associated with various aspects of life and nature. However, the term Anunnaki gradually came to be associated more specifically with chthonic (underworld)\ndeities. In Mesopotamian mythology, the term \"Anunnaki\" was used to refer to deities in general, but it was often specifically associated with the deities of the underworld, the realm of the dead. However, this does not necessarily imply a negative or punitive association. In many ancient cultures, the world was perceived as a multitiered structure, often divided into heavens, earth, and underworld. Gods and goddesses were assigned to different realms based on their roles and functions.\nThe Anunnaki are depicted in various myths as judges in the underworld, ruling over the fate of the dead. For instance, the goddess Ereshkigal, the queen of the underworld, and Nergal, the god of death and plague, were both considered part of the Anunnaki. The reason why many of the Anunnaki were associated with the underworld is likely related to the Sumerians' beliefs about life, death, and the afterlife. The underworld, known as Kur or Irkalla, was considered a dreary, dark place where the\nspirits of the dead existed in a shadowy version of their earthly life, sustained by libations and offerings from the living. \nThe Nephilim, as depicted in biblical traditions, are the offspring of the sons of gods (or fallen angels) and are described as giants.\nIn general, the Anunnaki and the fallen angels, who give birth to giants, or Nephilim, are separate entities from distinct cultural and religious contexts: Mesopotamian mythology and Hebrew religion, respectively.\nBoth undergo the wrath of God and try to teach humans knowledge.\nBoth the Anunnaki and the fallen angels are seen as powerful\nbeings with the ability to influence humanity. \nThe Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish religious work, ascribes the origins of sin and corruption on earth to a group of angels known as the \"Watchers,\" who fell from grace by mating with human women and teaching humanity forbidden knowledge. But rather than the Anunnaki, This story shares more elements with the myth of the apkallu, seven wise\nmen or demigods in Mesopotamian mythology who were created by the god Enki (a member of the Anunnaki) to establish culture and give civilization to mankind.\n\nZecharia Sitchin refers to various Sumerian cuneiform texts to support his idea of the planet Nibiru. One key text he often cites is the \"Enuma Elish,\" the Babylonian creation epic. Sitchin suggests that references to a celestial body called Marduk in this epic actually refer to Nibiru.\nIn the Enuma Elish, Marduk is portrayed as a \"wandering planet\" that collides with and splits Tiamat, a primordial goddess associated with the sea, in two. Sitchin interprets Tiamat as a pre-existing planet located between Mars and Jupiter. He suggests that one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt, and the other half was struck by another of Marduk's moons and was pushed into a new orbit, becoming Earth.\nHowever, Sitchin's interpretation of the Enuma Elish and his association of Marduk with Nibiru is heavily criticized by scholars. Mainstream interpretation reads the Enuma Elish as mythology and not a literal astronomical account. Furthermore, Sitchin's identification of Nibiru with Marduk is not supported by any extant cuneiform text. In fact, the term \"Nibiru\" in the extant texts is used to denote a point of crossing, and sometimes is associated with certain celestial bodies depending on their position in the sky, but it's never described as the home of the Anunnaki, nor as an additional planet in our solar system with an unusual orbit, as\nSitchin claims.\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #nephilim #anunnaki",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nCyprus has a long history, with evidence of human habitation dating back as far as\nthe 10th millennium BC. These earliest inhabitants are believed to have been\nhunter-gatherers who crossed over to the island from the nearby regions of the\nMiddle East.\nThe first major wave of civilization in Cyprus was during the Neolithic period,\naround 7000-6000 BC, when farming communities began to develop. The Bronze\nAge, which started around 2500 BC, brought significant advancements in\nmetallurgy and commerce.\nCyprus has since been occupied by a series of different civilizations including the\nMycenaean Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Arab caliphates, French\nLusignan, Venetians, Ottoman Turks, and British.\nThe Neolithic period on Cyprus, also known as the New Stone Age, is\ncharacterized by significant advancements in human technology and culture. It's\nbelieved to have started around 8200-7000 BC and lasted until about 3900 BC,\nspanning the Aceramic (without pottery) and Ceramic (with pottery) Neolithic\nperiods.\nIn the Aceramic Neolithic period (8200-5200 BC), Cyprus saw its first permanent\nhuman settlements. The inhabitants lived in round houses and survived mainly by\nhunting, gathering, and fishing. The Khirokitia culture is a well-known example of\nthis period, with a well-preserved archaeological site that has provided a great\ndeal of information about the early settlers' way of life. The Khirokitia people are\nknown for their innovative architecture, including stone round houses, which were\noften partially buried in the ground for insulation.\nThe Ceramic Neolithic period (ca. 4500-3900 BC) marked the introduction of\npottery, more sophisticated tools, and the beginnings of agriculture. The Sotira\nculture is a significant group from this period. During this time, Cyprus had\nsignificant interactions with the surrounding regions, especially the Levantine\ncoast, as evidenced by the commonality in certain types of pottery and other\nartifacts.\nDespite being an island, Cyprus had a rich Neolithic culture that closely mirrored\nthe major developments happening on the mainland at the same time. The\nevidence of these ancient cultures provides invaluable insights into the human\njourney from hunter-gatherers to settled farming communities.\nThe Copper Age, also known as the Chalcolithic Age, in Cyprus is believed to have\nbegun around 3900 BC and continued until the advent of the Bronze Age around\n2500 BC. This period is characterized by the development and use of copper, in\naddition to stone, for tools and other items.\nWhile farming continued to be the primary source of sustenance during the\nCopper Age, the inhabitants of Cyprus began to master the smelting and working\nof copper, which was abundant on the island. This allowed for the production of\nmore durable tools, weapons, and other objects, facilitating a significant\nadvancement in technology.\nThe Cypriot Chalcolithic period is also noted for the production of distinctively\ndecorated pottery, and for the beginning of trade relations with the surrounding\nregions. Artifacts from this period, such as cruciform figurines, plank-shaped\nfigurines, and pottery with complex incised decoration, show a sophistication in\ntheir craftsmanship. These artifacts indicate that society was becoming more\ncomplex, with the development of new rituals and social norms.\nIn terms of settlement, people during this period tended to live in small villages,\nusually built on hills, which allowed them to easily defend themselves. The\narchitecture was simple, generally featuring round or rectangular houses.\nBurial practices also became more elaborate during the Copper Age, with the dead\noften buried under the floors of homes or in designated cemeteries. Grave goods\nbecame more common, suggesting a belief in an afterlife.\nThis was an important period in Cyprus's history, as the technological\nadvancements and cultural developments set the stage for the Bronze Age, during\nwhich the island became a significant player in the eastern Mediterranean region.\nThe Bronze Age of Cyprus, also known as the Cypriot Bronze Age, extended from\napproximately 2300 BC to 1050 BC. This period saw the development of more\ncomplex political and economic systems, and the emergence of new religious\npractices.\n\n#gnosticinformant #documentary #4k",

It is thought to have been composed c. 700 BCE (give or take a generation either side of that date). Little is known of Hesiod's life. His father emigrated from Cyme in Asia Minor and settled in Boeotia, a small state in central Greece. It is assumed that the poet was a farmer; a fact garnered from the early verses of the Theogony. He may also have been a rhapsodist, a reciter of poetry, where he learned the technique and vocabulary of heroic songs.\n\nAlthough there are some who question whether or not Hesiod actually wrote the Theogony, most classicists believe he did. However, parts of the work may have been added by later poets and there is a definite similarity in some aspects to earlier Mesopotamian literature.\nThe Enuma Elish (also known as The Seven Tablets of Creation) is the Babylonian creation myth whose title is derived from the opening lines of the piece, \"When on High\". The myth tells the story of the great god Marduk's victory over the forces of chaos and his establishment of order at the creation of the world.\nAll of the tablets containing the myth (also known as Enuma Elis), found at Ashur, Kish, Ashurbanipal's library at Nineveh, Sultantepe, and other excavated sites, date to c. 1200 BCE. Their colophons, however, indicate that these are all copies of a much older version of the myth dating from long before the reign of Hammurabi of Babylon (1792-1750 BCE), the king who elevated the god Marduk to patron deity of Babylon. The poem in its present form, with Marduk as champion, is thought to be a revision of an even older Sumerian work.\n the Sumerian Ea/Enki or Enlil is thought to have played the major role in the original version of the story, which is dated to the 3,500 BCE\n\nHesiod's \"Theogony\" and the Enuma Elish are both ancient epic poems that\nexplore the creation of the universe and the origins of the gods in different\nmythological traditions. While they come from different cultures and time periods,\nthere are several similarities between the two works:\n\nCreation of the universe: Both \"Theogony\" and the Enuma Elish\ndescribe the process of creation and the establishment of order in the\ncosmos. They present elaborate cosmogonies that explain how the world\ncame into existence and how the gods emerged.\n\nPrimordial deities: Both poems feature primordial deities who\nprecede the main pantheon of gods. These primordial beings represent\nabstract concepts and forces of nature. For example, in \"Theogony,\" Chaos\n(the void) is the initial entity from which everything else originates, while in the\nEnuma Elish, Tiamat represents the primeval sea.\n\nGenealogy of gods: Both works provide genealogies of the gods,\ntracing their lineage and relationships. They present a hierarchy of gods and\ngoddesses, with different generations of deities and their interactions shaping\nthe world and its divine order.\n\nDivine conflicts: Both poems depict conflicts among the gods that\nlead to the establishment of order. In \"Theogony,\" the Titans rebel against\ntheir father Uranus, and later the Olympian gods overthrow the Titans. In the\nEnuma Elish, the younger gods, led by Marduk, battle against the primordial\ngoddess Tiamat and her forces.\n\nDivine succession: Both poems address the succession of power\namong the gods. They portray a shift in leadership and authority from older\ngenerations to younger ones. In \"Theogony,\" Zeus emerges as the supreme\nruler of the gods, while in the Enuma Elish, Marduk becomes the chief god\nafter defeating Tiamat.\nSuccession of power: Both traditions address the theme of\nsuccession in divine power. They portray a transfer of authority from older\ngenerations to younger ones. In \"Theogony,\" Zeus emerges as the supreme\nruler of the gods, while in Hittite mythology, Teshub becomes the chief deity\nafter overcoming Kumarbi and assuming kingship in heaven.\nDivine creation and cosmic order: Both traditions provide\nexplanations for the creation of the world and the establishment of cosmic\norder. They describe how the gods shape the universe, assign roles and\ndomains to different deities, and bring order out of chaos.\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #genesis #bible",

Some ancient sources believe they were an indigenous people of Greece, while others suggest they might have migrated from different regions, including the Black Sea Regions, Anatolia or the Balkans. Their precise ethnicity and language remain unresolved, though a combination of Proto-Indo European and Native Mediterannean is the most likely.\n\nThe earliest references to the Pelasgians can\nbe found in ancient Greek literature, particularly in the works of Homer,\nHerodotus, and Thucydides. \n\nIn the Iliad, there were Pelasgians on both sides of the Trojan War. WHen Homer explains who the Ancient Trojans were, Pelasgians are mentioned between the Hellespontine cities and Thrace. Homer calls their town or district \"Larisa\" and characterises it as fertile, and its inhabitants as celebrated for their spearsmanship. He records their chiefs as Hippothous and Pylaeus, sons of Lethus, son of Teutamides. The Iliad also refers to the camp at Greece, specifically at \"Argos Pelasgikon\", which is most likely to be the plain of Thessaly,  and to \"Pelasgic Zeus\", living in and ruling over Dodona. According to Homer, Pelasgians were camping out on the shore together with the following tribes:\n\n\"Towards the sea lie the Carians and the Paeonians, with curved bows, and the Leleges and Caucones, and the goodly Pelasgi.\"\nIn the Odyssey, they appear among the inhabitants of Crete. Which would possibly equate them with the Minoans themselves, who invented Purple Dye and migrated east towards coastal Levant and conquered Egypt. \n\n Odysseus, affecting to be Cretan himself, instances Pelasgians among the tribes in the ninety cities of Crete, \"language mixing with language side by side\".Last on his list, Homer distinguishes them from other ethnicities on the island: \"Cretans proper\", Achaeans, Cydonians, Dorians, and \"noble Pelasgians\".\n\nA fragment from Hesiod, calls Dodona, identified by reference to \"the oak\", the \"seat of Pelasgians\", thus explaining why Homer, in referring to Zeus as he ruled over Dodona, did not style him \"Dodonic\" but Pelasgic Zeus. He mentions also that Pelasgus was the father of King Lycaon of Arcadia.\nAsius of Samos claimed that Pelasgus as the first man, born of the earth.This account features centrally in the construction of an enduring autochthonous Arcadian identity into the Classical period. In a fragment by Pausanias,  he cites Asius who describes the foundational hero of the Greek ethnic groups as \"godlike Pelasgus [whom the] black earth gave up\".\nSophocles, in one of his famous plays, presents  Inachus, as the elder in the lands of Argos, the Heran hills and among the Tyrsenoi Pelasgoi, an unusual hyphenated noun construction, \"Tyrsenians-Pelasgians\". Interpretation is open, even though translators typically make a decision, but Tyrsenians may well be the ethnonym Tyrrhenoi. A possible connection to the city of Tyre, a possible location where many Minoan Migrants moved to.\n\nAll of this comes into context when we examine the writings of Pherecydes of Syros, the famous Pre-Socratic, who claims to have in his posession, the Pelasgian Creation myth, who he says was given to him by Phoenican Scholars.\n\nThe sequence of Pherecydes' creation myth is as follows. First, there are the eternal gods Zas (Zeus), Chthoniê (Gaia) and Chronos (Kronos). Then Chronos creates elements in niches in the earth with his seed, from which other gods arise. This is followed by the three-day wedding of Zas and Chthonie. On the third day Zas makes the robe of the world, which he hangs from a winged oak and then presents as a wedding gift to Chthonie, and wraps around her. Before the world is ordered, a cosmic battle takes place, with Cronus as the head of one side and Ophion as the leader of the other. Ophion then attacks Kronos, who defeats him and throws him in Ogenos. Sometime after his battle with Ophion, Kronos is succeeded by Zas. Kronos is given control of the Underwold as the King of Elysium, the grea province of Hades where the gods dwell. These three primordial gods are eternal, equal and wholly responsible for the world order. Plato seems to borrw from this cosmology in his Timaeus, and echoes of a Trinity sprinkle down into later Christian Theology. Pherecydes and Thales, who are both of the 7 Sages of Greece are both known to have influenced Monotheism, as they both believed the gods to be servents and messanger (daemons and Angels), under the One, or Monad. The source of all Light, Creation and Wisdom.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #4k #documentary",

In his own day, although he was a major figure within the very small Christian movement, he also had many enemies and detractors, and his contemporaries probably did not accord him as much respect as they gave Peter and James. Paul was compelled to struggle, therefore, to establish his own worth and authority. His surviving letters, however, have had enormous influence on subsequent Christianity and secure his place as one of the greatest religious leaders of all time.\n\nOf the 27 books in the New Testament, 13 are attributed to Paul, and approximately half of another, Acts of the Apostles, deals with Paul’s life and works. Thus, about half of the New Testament stems from Paul and the people whom he influenced. Only 7 of the 13 letters, however, can be accepted as being entirely authentic (dictated by Paul himself). The others come from followers writing in his name, who often used material from his surviving letters and who may have had access to letters written by Paul that no longer survive. Although frequently useful, the information in Acts is secondhand, and it is sometimes in direct conflict with the letters. The seven undoubted letters constitute the best source of information on Paul’s life and especially his thought; in the order in which they appear in the New Testament, they are Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon. The probable chronological order (leaving aside Philemon, which cannot be dated) is 1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, and Romans. Letters considered “Deutero-Pauline” (probably written by Paul’s followers after his death) are Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians; 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus are “Trito-Pauline” (probably written by members of the Pauline school a generation after his death).\nUntil about the midpoint of his life, Paul was a member of the Pharisees, a religious party that emerged during the later Second Temple period. What little is known about Paul the Pharisee reflects the character of the Pharisaic movement. Pharisees believed in life after death, which was one of Paul’s deepest convictions. They accepted nonbiblical “traditions” as being about as important as the written Bible; Paul refers to his expertise in “traditions” (Galatians 1:14). Pharisees were very careful students of the Hebrew Bible, and Paul was able to quote extensively from the Greek translation. (It was fairly easy for a bright, ambitious young boy to memorize the Bible, and it would have been very difficult and expensive for Paul as an adult to carry around dozens of bulky scrolls.) \n\nPaul was a Greek-speaking Jew from Asia Minor. His birthplace, Tarsus, was a major city in eastern Cilicia, a region that had been made part of the Roman province of Syria by the time of Paul’s adulthood. Two of the main cities of Syria, Damascus and Antioch, played a prominent part in his life and letters. Although the exact date of his birth is unknown, he was active as a missionary in the 40s and 50s of the 1st century CE. From this it may be inferred that he was born about the same time as Jesus (c. 4 BCE) or a little later. He was converted to faith in Jesus Christ about 33 CE, and he died, probably in Rome, circa 62–64 CE.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #paul",

They unearthed an almost complete fossil skeleton belonging to an early\nhuman ancestor of our species, whom they affectionately named Lucy after the\nBeatles' song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\"\n\nThe oldest known religion in Ethiopia is a traditional belief system called \"Ethiopian\nTraditional Religion\" or \"Ethiopian indigenous faith.\" This religious practice\npredates the arrival of Christianity and Islam in the region by thousands of years. It encompasses a wide\nrange of spiritual beliefs and practices that have been passed down through\ngenerations and are deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture and heritage.\nEthiopian Religion is characterized by its strong connection to nature,\nancestral worship, and the belief in supernatural forces and spirits. It incorporates\nelements of animism, where various aspects of the natural world, such as rivers,\nmountains, and trees, are considered to possess spiritual essence and are revered\naccordingly.\nThe practice of Ethiopian Traditional Religion involves rituals, ceremonies, and\nofferings to appease and seek blessings from ancestral spirits and deities. These\nrituals often take place in sacred sites, such as forests, mountains, or ancient\nstone structures known as \"mazgabas.\"\n\nThe Aksumite religion, also known as the Aksumite Polytheism, refers to the\nreligious practices and beliefs of the Aksumite Empire, an ancient kingdom located\nin present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nThe primary deity of the Aksumite religion was the god Mahrem, also known as\nAstar, who was considered the supreme god and the protector of the Aksumite\nkingdom. Mahrem was associated with the sky, rain, and fertility. The Aksumite\nkings, who held significant religious and political authority, were believed to be\ndirect descendants of Mahrem, solidifying their divine status and legitimacy.\nIn addition to Mahrem, the Aksumite pantheon included other gods and\n\ngoddesses, such as Astar, Beher, Meder, and Waraqa. Each deity had specific\ndomains and was worshipped for various purposes, including fertility, protection,\nagriculture, and prosperity.\nThe Aksumites also practiced ancestor worship, believing that deceased ancestors\nplayed a role in the spiritual well-being and guidance of the living. They would\nhonor and venerate their ancestors through rituals and offerings, seeking their\nblessings and assistance.\nThe Aksumite religion was closely intertwined with the political and cultural\naspects of the empire. Temples and religious structures, such as the famous\nStelae of Aksum, were erected to honor the gods and commemorate the rulers.\nRitual ceremonies, sacrifices, and festivals were held to celebrate important\nevents, agricultural cycles, and religious observances.\nWith the spread of Christianity in the 4th century CE, the Aksumite religion began\nto decline. Christianity eventually became the dominant religion in the region and\nplayed a significant role in shaping Ethiopian culture and identity.\nToday, remnants of the Aksumite religion can still be found in Ethiopian Orthodox\nChristianity, which incorporates some elements and practices from the ancient\nAksumite belief system. However, the original Aksumite religion, as a distinct and\nseparate faith, ceased to exist as Christianity took root in the region. And by the 7th and 8th centuries, Islam would take over as the dominant religion of Africa. Which continues today.\n\nThe history of Africa begins with the emergence of hominids, archaic humans and — around 300,000–250,000 years ago — anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens), in East Africa, and continues unbroken into the present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states. The earliest known recorded history arose in Ancient Egypt, and later in Nubia, the Sahel, the Maghreb, and the Horn of Africa. \nFollowing the desertification of the Sahara, North African history became entwined with the Middle East and Southern Europe while the Bantu expansion swept from modern day Cameroon (Central West Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 1 AD, creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\n#gnosticinformant #documentary #africa",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nThe oldest known god in written history is typically considered to be Anu, the sky god, worshiped by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) around 4,000 BCE. Anu was part of the Sumerian\npantheon and was later incorporated into the pantheon of other civilizations in the\nregion, such as the Akkadians and Babylonians. Anu was believed to be the father\nof the gods and the ruler of the heavens.\nIt's important to note that there may have been older gods or deities worshiped by\nprehistoric cultures that did not have written records. Archaeological evidence\nsuggests that religious beliefs and practices existed long before the invention of\nwriting. However, without written records, it is Anu & his daughter Ishtar, the morning star, who show up in the beginning.\nThe oldest known tablet or inscription mentioning the god Anu comes from the\nancient Sumerian city of Uruk and dates back to around 2500 BCE. This tablet,\nknown as the Uruk King List, is a historical document that lists the kings of Uruk in\nchronological order. Among the names of the kings, there is a reference to Anu,\nindicating his prominence as a deity in that period.\nAdditionally, Anu is mentioned in several other ancient Sumerian texts, such as\nhymns, prayers, and myths, which provide further insights into the role and\nsignificance of this god in Sumerian religious beliefs. These texts were written on\nclay tablets and have been discovered at various archaeological sites in\nMesopotamia, including the cities of Nippur, Ur, and Eridu.\nIt's worth noting that these inscriptions and tablets are the oldest known\nreferences to Anu specifically, but it is likely that the worship of Anu predates\nthese written records, possibly by several centuries or more.\nAnu is considered the god of the heavens, and his name\nis often translated as \"sky\" or \"firmament.\" Although the word AN is interchangable with the word logogram for the word GOD \"diĝir\", and it is theorized that the word AN, is cognate with the proto indo european root for the word ONE, which also is AN or EIN, showing ANU as a possible proto-Monad concept of \"the ONE\".\n  Anu is the son of Anshar and Kishar, who are\nprimordial deities associated with the horizon and the earth. Anu is depicted as a\nmighty and wise god who resides in the highest heaven, ruling over the other\ngods. He is often portrayed as the father or progenitor of other deities, including\nEnlil and Ea (also known as Enki). Anu's role as the supreme deity is sometimes\novershadowed by other gods such as Enlil or Marduk, who gained more\nprominence in later periods. Nevertheless, Anu retains his status as the head of\nthe pantheon and the ultimate authority.\nAnu's role in the divine hierarchy is also reflected in the Mesopotamian cosmology,\nwhere he occupies the highest level of the universe, separated from the earth and\nits inhabitants. He is associated with the celestial realm, divine laws, and the\nordering of the cosmos. In the Akkadian mythology of Babylon, Anu is considered the chief god and the father of all other gods. He plays a crucial role in the creation story known as the\nEnuma Elish, where he gives birth to the god Ea and grants him authority over the\nearth.\nThe god OURANOS in Greek mythology seems to have a similar role as \"the firmament, or Heavens\" god.\nOr Sky Father: Both Anu and Ouranos are considered the personifications of the sky and are regarded as sky kings. They are associated with the heavens and are seen as the rulers of the celestial realm. Both Anu and Ouranos are considered primordial\ndeities, existing at the beginning of creation. They are among the earliest\ndivine beings in their respective mythologies. Anu and Ouranos are depicted as fathers of major deities in their pantheons. Anu is the father of Enlil and Ea, while Ouranos is\nthe father of the Titans, including Cronus (Saturn) and Rhea.  Both gods hold significant authority and power\nwithin their pantheons. They are often depicted as the leaders of the gods,\noverseeing and governing the other deities.\nBoth Anu and Ouranos are physically\nseparated from the earth and its inhabitants. Anu resides in the highest\nheaven, while Ouranos is depicted as an entity that covers and separates the\nearth from the heavens.\nThese parallels suggest a common theme of a sky god figure with a paternal role\nand authority in the early mythologies of these civilizations. \nAnu is associated with the concept of divine\nkingship, which was a prominent aspect of Sumerian society. He is seen as the\nultimate authority and the one who bestows kingship upon earthly rulers. The\nking of Sumer was believed to derive his authority from Anu.\n\n#gnosticinformant #sumerian #history",

The Babylonians also had a similar concept of the Underworld, which they called Irkalla.\nAccording to Sumerian mythology, the Underworld was a dark and gloomy place where the souls of the dead went after they passed away. The journey to the Underworld was perilous, and the souls had to navigate through seven gates, each guarded by a different deity.\nOnce in the Underworld, the souls were judged by Ereshkigal and her consort, Nergal. The souls were then assigned to different levels of the Underworld based on their deeds in life. The worst offenders were sent to the lowest level, where they were subjected to eternal torment.\nThe Babylonians had a similar concept of the Underworld, but their version was more complex. According to Babylonian mythology, the Underworld was divided into several levels, each with its own ruler. The souls of the dead had to pass through each level, facing different challenges and obstacles along the way.\nOne of the most famous stories from Babylonian mythology is the tale of Ishtar's descent into the Underworld. Ishtar was the goddess of love and fertility, and she decided to visit the Underworld to rescue her lover, Tammuz. However, she was unable to pass through the gates of the Underworld, and she was forced to remove her clothing and jewelry as payment to the gatekeepers.\nThe seven deities that guard each of the seven gates in the Underworld are named: 1) Neti, 2) Gedu, 3) Ennugi, 4) Ninkasi, 5) Ninimma, 6) Enbilulu, and 7) Dumuzid/SISTER. These deities were believed to have the power to judge the souls of the deceased and determine their fate in the afterlife. It was believed that those who were deemed worthy would be granted access to the afterlife, while those who were deemed unworthy would be condemned to eternal suffering.\nThe purpose of each of the seven gates in the Underworld is to prevent the dead from escaping and to ensure that they are judged fairly before being allowed to enter the afterlife. Each gate is guarded by a different deity, and each deity has a specific role in the judgment process. The first gate is guarded by the god Neti, who checks the name of the deceased against a list of those who are allowed to enter. The second gate is guarded by the god Gedu, who weighs the heart of the deceased against a feather to determine if they have lived a good life. The third gate is guarded by the goddess Lahamu, who judges the deceased based on their deeds in life. The fourth gate is guarded by the god Shala, who determines if the deceased has been faithful to their spouse. The fifth gate is guarded by the goddess Ninlil, who judges the deceased based on their knowledge and wisdom. The sixth gate is guarded by the god Nergal, who determines if the deceased has been a good ruler or leader. The seventh and final gate is guarded by the goddess Ereshkigal, who judges the deceased based on their overall worthiness to enter the afterlife.\nEreshkigal is a prominent figure in Sumerian and Babylonian mythology, known as the goddess of the Underworld. She is the sister of the god of the sky, Anu, and the god of the earth, Enlil. Ereshkigal is often depicted as a fearsome and powerful goddess, ruling over the dead and the spirits of the Underworld.\nEreshkigal held a senior status among the underworld deities, ruling over the category of so-called \"transtigridian snake gods\"\nTwo Minoan snake goddess figurines were excavated in 1903 in the Minoan palace at Knossos in the Greek island of Crete.\nThe combination of elaborate clothes that leave the breasts completely bare, and \"snake-wrangling\", remains a popular icon for Minoan art and religion, now also generally referred to as a \"Snake Goddess\". It is quite possible that this Goddess could ve connected to ERESHKIGAL.\nEreshkigal is often compared to other goddesses of death and the Underworld, such as the Greek goddess Hades and the Egyptian goddess Isis. Like Ereshkigal, these goddesses are often depicted as powerful and fearsome figures, ruling over the dead and the spirits of the Underworld.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Ereshkigal's mythology is her relationship with the god of fertility and vegetation, Dumuzid. According to legend, Dumuzid was Ereshkigal's lover, but he was also a symbol of life and fertility. This relationship between life and death is a common theme in many mythologies, and it is often used to explore the cyclical nature of existence.\n\n#gnosticinformant #documentary #mythology",

British Museum.\nOthers have suggested that the Sumerians were a North African people who migrated from the Green Sahara into the Middle East and were responsible for the spread of farming in the Middle East.  However, with evidence strongly suggesting the first farmers originated from the Fertile Crescent, this suggestion is often discarded. Although not specifically discussing Sumerians, Lazaridis et al. 2016 have suggested a partial North African origin for some pre-Semitic cultures of the Middle East, particularly Natufians, after testing the genomes of Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture-bearers. \n\nAlternatively, a recent (2013) genetic analysis of four ancient Mesopotamian skeletal DNA samples suggests an association of the Sumerians with Indus Valley Civilisation, possibly as a result of ancient Indus–Mesopotamia relations. According to some data, the Sumerians are associated with the Hurrians and Urartians, and the Caucasus is considered their homeland. \n\nA prehistoric people who lived in the region before the Sumerians have been termed the \"Proto-Euphrateans\" or \"Ubaidians\", and are theorized to have evolved from the Samarra culture of northern Mesopotamia.  The Ubaidians, though never mentioned by the Sumerians themselves, are assumed by modern-day scholars to have been the first civilizing force in Sumer. They drained the marshes for agriculture, developed trade, and established industries, including weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery. \n\n\nEnthroned Sumerian king of Ur, possibly Ur-Pabilsag, with attendants. Standard of Ur, c. 2600 BC.\nSome scholars contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language; they think the Sumerian language may originally have been that of the hunting and fishing peoples who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture.  Reliable historical records begin much later; there are none in Sumer of any kind that have been dated before Enmebaragesi (Early Dynastic I). Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians lived along the coast of Eastern Arabia, today's Persian Gulf region, before it was flooded at the end of the Ice Age. \n\nSumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC), continuing into the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. The Sumerians progressively lost control to Semitic states from the northwest. Sumer was conquered by the Semitic-speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC (short chronology), but Sumerian continued as a sacred language. Native Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the Third Dynasty of Ur at approximately 2100–2000 BC, but the Akkadian language also remained in use for some time. \n\nThe Sumerian city of Eridu, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, is considered to have been one of the oldest cities, where three separate cultures may have fused: that of peasant Ubaidian farmers, living in mud-brick huts and practicing irrigation; that of mobile nomadic Semitic pastoralists living in black tents and following herds of sheep and goats; and that of fisher folk, living in reed huts in the marshlands, who may have been the ancestors of the Sumerians.\nEpic of Gilgamesh, ancient Mesopotamian odyssey recorded in the Akkadian language about Gilgamesh, the king of the Mesopotamian city-state Uruk (Erech).\n\nThe fullest extant text of the Gilgamesh epic is on 12 incomplete Akkadian-language tablets found in the mid-19th century by the Turkish Assyriologist Hormuzd Rassam at Nineveh in the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (reigned 668–627 BCE). The gaps that occur in the tablets have been partly filled by various fragments found elsewhere in Mesopotamia and Anatolia. In addition, five short poems in the Sumerian language are known from tablets that were written during the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE; the poems have been entitled “Gilgamesh and Huwawa,” “Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven,” “Gilgamesh and Agga of Kish,” “Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld,” and “The Death of Gilgamesh.”\n#gnosticinformant #bible #documentary",

Although the mythological motifs are not directly attested – since Proto-Indo-European speakers lived in preliterate societies – scholars of comparative mythology have reconstructed details from inherited similarities found among Indo-European languages, based on the assumption that parts of the Proto-Indo-Europeans' original belief systems survived in the daughter traditions.\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes a number of securely reconstructed deities, since they are both cognates – linguistic siblings from a common origin – and associated with similar attributes and body of myths: such as *Dyḗws Ph₂tḗr, the daylight-sky god; his consort *Dʰéǵʰōm, the earth mother; his daughter *H₂éwsōs, the dawn goddess; his sons the Divine Twins; and *Seh₂ul, a solar goddess. Some deities, like the weather god *Perkʷunos or the herding-god *Péh₂usōn, are only attested in a limited number of traditions – Western (European) and Graeco-Aryan, respectively – and could therefore represent late additions that did not spread throughout the various Indo-European dialects.\n\nSome myths are also securely dated to Proto-Indo-European times, since they feature both linguistic and thematic evidence of an inherited motif: a story portraying a mythical figure associated with thunder and slaying a multi-headed serpent to release torrents of water that had previously been pent up; a creation myth involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other in order to create the world; and probably the belief that the Otherworld was guarded by a watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river.\n\nVarious schools of thought exist regarding possible interpretations of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European mythology. The main mythologies used in comparative reconstruction are Indo-Iranian, Baltic, Roman, and Norse, often supported with evidence from the Celtic, Greek, Slavic, Hittite, Armenian, Illyrian, and Albanian traditions as well.\n\nOne of the earliest attested and thus one of the most important of all Indo-European mythologies is Vedic mythology, especially the mythology of the Rigveda, the oldest of the Vedas. Early scholars of comparative mythology such as Friedrich Max Müller stressed the importance of Vedic mythology to such an extent that they practically equated it with Proto-Indo-European myths.  Modern researchers have been much more cautious, recognizing that, although Vedic mythology is still central, other mythologies must also be taken into account. \n\nAnother of the most important source mythologies for comparative research is Roman mythology. The Romans possessed a very complex mythological system, parts of which have been preserved through the characteristic Roman tendency to rationalize their myths into historical accounts.  Despite its relatively late attestation, Norse mythology is still considered one of the three most important of the Indo-European mythologies for comparative research, due to the vast bulk of surviving Icelandic material.\n\nBaltic mythology has also received a great deal of scholarly attention, as it is linguistically the most conservative and archaic of all surviving branches, but has so far remained frustrating to researchers because the sources are so comparatively late. Nonetheless, Latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing Proto-Indo-European myth. Despite the popularity of Greek mythology in western culture,Greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of Pre-Greek and Near Eastern cultures, which overwhelms what little Indo-European material can be extracted from it.  Consequently, Greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the first decade of the 21st century. \n\nAlthough Scythians are considered relatively conservative in regards to Proto-Indo-European cultures, retaining a similar lifestyle and culture, their mythology has very rarely been examined in an Indo-European context and infrequently discussed in regards to the nature of the ancestral Indo-European mythology. At least three deities, Tabiti, Papaios and Api, are generally interpreted as having Indo-European origins, while the remaining have seen more disparate interpretations. Influence from Siberian, Turkic and even Near Eastern beliefs, on the other hand, are more widely discussed in literature.\n\n#4k #religion #documentary",

He also served for six years as faculty librarian of Scholarly\nCommunications at Cal State Fullerton, where he led the successful passage of two resolutions\nrelated to open access in the statewide academic senate of the CSU. Mark has published one scholarly monograph with the University of Strasbourg and edited two scholarly book compilations, one with Claremont Press and one with Abingdon. He has published peer-reviewed articles in Harvard Theological Review, the Journal of Ecclesiastical History, the de Gruyter Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception, and the Brill Encyclopedia of Early Christianity.

Marcion preached that God had sent Jesus Christ who was an entirely new, alien god, distinct from the \"vengeful\" God who had created the world. He considered himself a follower of Paul the Apostle, whom he believed to have been the only true apostle of Jesus Christ; his doctrine is called Marcionism. Marcion published the earliest record of a canon of New Testament books. \n\nEarly Church Fathers such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian denounced Marcion as a heretic, and he was excommunicated by the church of Rome around 144. He published his own canon of Christian sacred scriptures, which contained ten Pauline epistles (the Pastoral epistles were not included) and the Gospel of Marcion which historically is claimed to be an edited version of the Gospel of Luke. Several modern scholars have theorized that Marcion's Gospel was the oldest, although this has received strong criticism as it seems to rest on special pleading.\n\nThis made Marcionism a catalyst in the process of the development of the New Testament canon by forcing the proto-orthodox Church to respond to his canon.\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #marcion",

It is a mythological tale that recounts the final moments and the subsequent events after the death of the great Greek hero, Heracles (or Hercules in Roman mythology).\nIn Greek mythology, Heracles was renowned for his incredible strength and numerous heroic feats. However, his life was not without tragedy. After completing his twelve labors, Heracles faced a series of misfortunes, including the accidental murder of his wife Megara and their children, which was caused by a fit of madness sent by the goddess Hera, who harbored a deep resentment towards him.\nAs a form of penance and purification for the crime he had committed, Heracles sought guidance from the Oracle of Delphi. The oracle instructed him to serve his cousin Eurystheus, the king who had imposed the twelve labors upon him, for a period of twelve years as recompense for the murders. After fulfilling this requirement, Heracles would be rewarded with immortality and a place among the gods.\nFollowing the completion of his servitude, Heracles was eager to ascend to Mount Olympus and join the gods. However, he faced a final challenge orchestrated by Hera. The goddess sent a vengeful centaur named Nessus to wreak havoc on Heracles and his wife Deianeira. During their encounter, Heracles slew Nessus with arrows dipped in the venomous blood of the Hydra.\nHowever, the story takes an unusual turn regarding the fate of Heracles' body. As the flames continued to burn, his close friend Philoctetes and his son Hyllus (also known as Hyllas) were present at the pyre. Stricken with grief, they debated the appropriate course of action. Some versions of the myth claim that the gods themselves ordered the disciples to eat the remains of Heracles as a means of absorbing his divine essence and allowing his soul to ascend to Olympus.\nThis act of consuming Heracles' flesh is known as the immolation or autochthonous banquet. It was believed to symbolize the assimilation of Heracles' divine power by his followers, thus allowing his spirit to be released and join the realm of the gods.\nThe story of the death of Heracles and the subsequent consumption of his body by his disciples is a lesser-known aspect of his myth. It emphasizes the hero's transition from mortality to immortality and the continuation of his divine legacy through his devoted followers. Hyllus was said to become the new heracles, and continue to Avenge and fufill the  Will of the Father in Heaven.\nIn Egyptian mythology, the story of how Horus avenged his father Osiris varies in different versions but generally involves a series of conflicts with his uncle Set (also known as Seth). The tale is part of the larger Osiris myth, which centers around the death and resurrection of Osiris, the god of the dead and ruler of the underworld.\nThe deification of Julius Caesar and Augustus served both political and religious purposes. It bolstered the legitimacy and authority of Octavian/Augustus as the rightful heir and successor to Caesar. By presenting the emperors as gods, their rule was elevated above mortal affairs, and dissent or opposition could be construed as sacrilegious.\nThe cults of Julius Caesar and Augustus continued to thrive long after their deaths, even beyond the time of the Roman Empire. Their influence extended to the early centuries of Christianity, as the refusal of Christians to partake in the Imperial Cults became a defining characteristic of their faith. The story of the deification of Julius Caesar and Augustus stands as a testament to the intricate interplay between politics, religion, and the cult of personality in ancient Rome.\nThe Figures known as \"Son of God\" are wide ranging and vastly differnet in their own respected ways, but it is clear that these heroes and gods have much overlap with each other, and the themes of Being begotten by a father god,  avenging that father god, suffering for mankind, dying at the hands of evil, being ritually eaten by disciples, and ascending to the sit next to god the father is what we see among these myths of Heralces, Caesar, Horus, Dionysus, Dumuzi, Orpheus and Jesus Christ. \n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #documentary",

Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, and distributed across much of Eurasia.\n\nMost date from the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago). However, findings are not limited to this period; for example, the Venus of Hohle Fels dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian era, and the Venus of Monruz dates back about 11,000 years to the Magdalenian. Such figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known to historians. In total, over 200 such figurines are known;  virtually all of modest size, between about 3 and 40 cm (1.2 and 15.7 in) in height.  These figurines are recognised as some of the earliest works of prehistoric art.\n\nMost have wide hips and legs that taper to a point. Arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many found examples do not reflect these typical characteristics. Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and especially in Siberian examples, clothing or tattoos may be indicated. \n\nThe original cultural meaning and purpose of these artefacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function. There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures,  an expression of health and fertility, grandmother goddesses, or as self-depictions by female artists.\n\nThe Venus of Tan-Tan (supposedly, 500,000-300,000 BP) is an alleged artifact found in Morocco. It and its contemporary, the Venus of Berekhat Ram, have been claimed as the earliest representations of the human form.\n\nThe Venus of Berekhat Ram (280,000-250,000 BP) is a pebble found at Berekhat Ram on the Golan Heights. The pebble was modified by early humans and is suggested to represent a female human figure.\nThe object was excavated and first described by Naama Goren-Inbar from the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  The artifact is a scoria pebble, 35 mm long, 25 mm wide, and 21 mm thick. It weighs approximately 10 g. It was excavated in 1981 at the Acheulian site of Berekhat Ram, Golan Heights. The object is dated 280,000-250,000 BP.\n\nGoren-Inbar reported several artificial grooves on the object: one is a transversal groove in the upper third, others are longitudinal grooves on the sides below the traversal groove.  Alexander Marshack performed a microscopic study of the object in 1997.  He also reported artificial modifications including the transversal and longitudinal grooves found by Goren-Inbar. Finally, Francesco d'Errico and April Nowell re-examined the object using a comparative approach. They partly confirmed, partly corrected the findings of Marshack. d'Errico and Nowell also reported the above grooves (with some corrections) and, additionally, reported areas of possible abrasion on the front, back and bottom of the object.\n\nThe Lion Man is a masterpiece. Sculpted with great originality, virtuosity and technical skill from mammoth ivory, this 40,000-year-old image is 31 centimetres tall. It has the head of a cave lion with a partly human body. He stands upright, perhaps on tiptoes, legs apart and arms to the sides of a slender, cat-like body with strong shoulders like the hips and thighs of a lion. His gaze, like his stance, is powerful and directed at the viewer. The details of his face show he is attentive, he is watching and he is listening. He is powerful, mysterious and from a world beyond ordinary nature. He is the oldest known representation of a being that does not exist in physical form but symbolises ideas about the supernatural.\n\nFound in a cave in what is now southern Germany in 1939, the Lion Man makes sense as part of a story that might now be called a myth. The wear on his body caused by handling suggests that he was passed around and rubbed as part of a narrative or ritual that would explain his appearance and meaning. It is impossible to know what that story was about or whether he was deity, an avatar to the spirit world, part of a creation story or a human whose experiences on a journey through the cosmos to communicate with spirits caused this transformation.\n\n#gnosticinformant #lionman #documentary",

The category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to have been largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts.\n\nAs applied in the scholarly literature, \"dying and rising gods\" is a generic appellation for a group of male deities found in agrarian Mediterranean societies who serve as the focus of myths and rituals that allegedly narrate and annually represent their death and resurrection.\n\nBeyond this sufficient criterion, dying and rising deities were often held by scholars to have a number of cultic associations, sometimes thought to form a \"pattern.\" They were young male figures of fertility; the drama of their lives was often associated with mother or virgin goddesses; in some areas, they were related to the institution of sacred kingship, often expressed through rituals of sacred marriage; there were dramatic reenactments of their life, death, and putative resurrection, often accompanied by a ritual identification of either the society or given individuals with their fate.\n\nThe category of dying and rising gods, as well as the pattern of its mythic and ritual associations, received its earliest full formulation in the influential work of James G. Frazer The Golden Bough, especially in its two central volumes, The Dying God and Adonis, Attis, Osiris. Frazer offered two interpretations, one euhemerist, the other naturist. In the former, which focused on the figure of the dying god, it was held that a (sacred) king would be slain when his fertility waned. This practice, it was suggested, would be later mythologized, giving rise to a dying god. The naturist explanation, which covered the full cycle of dying and rising, held the deities to be personifications of the seasonal cycle of vegetation. The two interpretations were linked by the notion that death followed upon a loss of fertility, with a period of sterility being followed by one of rejuvenation, either in the transfer of the kingship to a successor or by the rebirth or resurrection of the deity.\n\nESHMUN was a Phoenician healer god, later identified with Asklepios, the patron of medicine, by the Greeks and the Romans. He seems to be attested since the third millennium bce in Syria, though his physiognomy becomes clear only in the first millennium bce. The etymology of Eshmun clearly connects him with \"oil,\" which had therapeutic and ritual functions (in relationship with the kingship ritual) in the ancient Near East. In the Ebla archives (middle of the third millennium bce), the theophoric element sí-mi-nu/a is found in some personal names, written dì-giš in Sumerian, meaning \"oil.\" In the ritual texts of Ugarit and Ras Ibn Hani, in the late Bronze Age (eighteenth century bce), the god Šmn is also mentioned as a beneficiary of offerings (Keilalphabetischen Texte aus Ugarit 1.164:9, 1.41:[45], 1.87:50). Unfortunately nothing is known about the functions or the role of this god in the Syrian pantheons, but his connection with oil must indicate that he was \"the one who oils,\" and thus \"the one who heals.\" This is surely the main reason why Eshmun was later assimilated to Asklepios/Aesculapius. His occasional interpretatio as Apollo (for example, in Carthage) is also based on the same background, because Apollo was also a salvific god. According to Philo of Byblos (Eus., Praeparation Evangelica I, 10, 38), Eshmun was Sydyk's son (Sydyk was the personification of Justice), while Damascius (Vita Is. ß 302) knows his father as Sadykos, who had first seven sons, the Dioscouri or Kabeiri, then an eighth son, Eshmun (Esmounos; the number 8 was a sign of election, of a special destiny). According to Pausanias (VII, 23,7–8), who refers a Sidonian testimony, Eshmun's father was Apollo, while the god himself was the Air, which brings health. According to Cicero (Nat. deor. III, 22, 57) and Lydus (De mens. IV, 142), Arsippos was the name of the third Aesculapius, that is, Rashap (Reshef), the semitic Apollo.\n\nEshmun and the Baal Tradition\nFrom a typological and historical point of view, Eshmun, though he is not a storm god, seems to be near to the Syrian Baal tradition, which emphasizes the salvific functions of the god, documented in Ugarit through Baal's connection with the Rapiu/Refaim (\"the healers\"=the dead). Eshmun's cult is documented not only in the sphere of public religion, but also on the level of private or popular beliefs, where the questions of health, wealth, and salvation were essential.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #documentary",

Mesha tells how Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been angry with his people and had allowed them to be subjugated to the Kingdom of Israel, but at length, Chemosh returned and assisted Mesha to throw off the yoke of Israel and restore the lands of Moab. Mesha also describes his many building projects.  It is written in a variant of the Phoenician alphabet, closely related to the Paleo-Hebrew script. \n\nThe stone was discovered intact by Frederick Augustus Klein, an Anglican missionary, at the site of ancient Dibon (now Dhiban, Jordan), in August 1868. A \"squeeze\" (a papier-mâché impression) had been obtained by a local Arab on behalf of Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, an archaeologist based in the French consulate in Jerusalem. The next year, the stele was smashed into several fragments by the Bani Hamida tribe, seen as an act of defiance against the Ottoman authorities who had pressured the Bedouins to hand over the stele so that it could be given to Germany. Clermont-Ganneau later managed to acquire the fragments and piece them together thanks to the impression made before the stele's destruction. \n\nThe Mesha Stele, the first major epigraphic Canaanite inscription found in the region of Palestine,  the longest Iron Age inscription ever found in the region, constitutes the major evidence for the Moabite language, and is a \"corner-stone of Semitic epigraphy\", and history.[7] The stele, whose story parallels, with some differences, an episode in the Bible's Books of Kings (2 Kings 3:4–28), provides invaluable information on the Moabite language and the political relationship between Moab and Israel at one moment in the 9th century BCE.  It is the most extensive inscription ever recovered that refers to the kingdom of Israel (the \"House of Omri\"); it bears the earliest certain extrabiblical reference to the Israelite god Yahweh.  It is also one of four known contemporary inscriptions containing the name of Israel, the others being the Merneptah Stele, the Tel Dan Stele, and one of the Kurkh Monoliths.  Its authenticity has been disputed over the years, and some biblical minimalists suggest the text was not historical, but a biblical allegory. The stele itself is regarded as genuine and historical by the vast majority of biblical archaeologists today. \n\n#gnosticinformant #moabitestone #meshastele",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe ancient Pelasgians mentioned by the Greek poet Homer were a mysterious and enigmatic people who played a significant role in early Greek mythology and history. Homer described them as a prehistoric civilization, often associated with the region of Thessaly and the city of Argos. However, the exact origins and characteristics of the Pelasgians remain a subject of debate among historians and scholars.\n\nAccording to Homer, the Pelasgians were a people who lived in the time before the Trojan War and were associated with the construction of massive structures, such as the walls of Mycenae. They were considered skilled builders and were often depicted as a semi-divine or legendary group. Some ancient Greek writers even suggested that the Pelasgians were the original inhabitants of Greece, predating other Greek-speaking tribes.\n\nThe historical reality of the Pelasgians is complex and elusive, as they appear in various ancient Greek texts with different interpretations. Some scholars argue that they were a distinct ethnic group, while others propose that the term \"Pelasgians\" was used to refer to various indigenous populations of the Aegean region.\n\nUltimately, the true identity and nature of the Pelasgians remain shrouded in the mists of antiquity, leaving us with fragments of mythology and historical accounts that continue to intrigue and fascinate to this day.\n\n\nThe proto-Indo-European ancestors of the Greeks in and around the Black Sea region are generally believed to be the people known as the Proto-Greeks or the Mycenaean Greeks. The Mycenaean civilization, which flourished from around the 16th to the 12th century BCE, is considered an important precursor to classical Greek civilization.\n\nThe Mycenaeans were part of a broader group of Indo-European speakers who migrated into the Balkans and Anatolia during the Bronze Age. These migrations are often associated with the expansion of the Indo-European language family, which includes Greek as one of its branches. The exact origins of the Proto-Greeks are still a subject of ongoing research and debate among historians and linguists.\n\nThe Mycenaeans established a powerful civilization centered around the southern part of mainland Greece, with major centers such as Mycenae, Pylos, and Tiryns. They were skilled warriors, traders, and builders, known for their impressive palaces and fortifications. Their culture and language laid the foundation for the later development of ancient Greek civilization.\n\nIt's important to note that while the Mycenaeans and their language are considered a significant part of the proto-Indo-European ancestry of the Greeks, the complex history of ancient migrations and cultural interactions in the region makes it difficult to attribute the Greek population exclusively to a single ancestral group.\n\n\nCivilization around the Black Sea region has a long and rich history, dating back thousands of years. The area has been inhabited by various cultures and civilizations since ancient times. The earliest evidence of human habitation in the region can be traced back to the Paleolithic era, around 45,000 to 12,000 years ago.\n\nIn terms of more complex civilizations, one of the notable early cultures in the region was the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, which flourished from approximately 5500 to 2750 BCE. This Neolithic culture was known for its advanced agriculture, pottery, and sizable settlements.\n\nMoving forward in time, the Black Sea region saw the rise and fall of various ancient civilizations. The ancient Greeks established numerous colonies along the coast of the Black Sea from the 8th century BCE onward, fostering trade and cultural exchange in the region.\n\nIn the classical period, the region became a melting pot of cultures, with the influence of Greek, Persian, Scythian, Thracian, and later Roman civilizations shaping its history. The Bosporan Kingdom, centered in present-day Crimea, emerged as a Hellenistic state in the 5th century BCE, lasting until the 4th century CE.\n\nDuring the medieval era, the Black Sea region witnessed the presence of Byzantine, Bulgarian, and Khazar empires, among others. The rise of the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century brought significant changes to the region, with the Ottoman dominance lasting until the early 20th century.\n\nGiven this rich and diverse historical backdrop, civilization in the Black Sea region spans several millennia, with different cultures and civilizations leaving their mark on the region's heritage.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\n#gnosticinformant #oldest #documentary",

The non-Jews of Alexandria and Rome alleged that the cult of Dionysus was widespread among Jews. Plutarch tarch gives a Bacchanalian interpretation to the Feast of Tabernacles:\n\n\"After the festival called 'the fast' [the Day of Atonement], during the vintage, the Jews place tables laden with different fruits in booths of thickets woven from vines and ivy. Their first festival is called by them Sukkah (σκηνή). A few days later, the Jews celebrate another festival, which one may simply call a Bacchanalian festival. For this is a festival on which the Jews carry fig branches and sticks adorned with ivy and carry them into the Temple. One does not know\" – adds Plutarch – \"what they do in the Temple. It seems reasonable to suppose that they practice rites in honor of Bacchus. For they blow small horns as the people of Argos do during the festival of Dionysus, and call upon their god. Others, who are called Levites, walk in front, either in allusion to Lysios (λύσιος) – perhaps 'the god who attenuatescurses' – or because they call out 'Euius,' i.e., Bacchus.\"\n\nAccording to Plutarch the subject of the connection between the Dionysian and Jewish cults was raised during a symposium held at Aidepsos in Euboea, with a certain Moiragenes linking the Jewish Sabbath with the cult of Bacchus, because \"even now many people call the Bacchi 'Sabboi' and call out that word when they perform the orgies of Bacchus.\" Tacitus too thought that Jews served the god Liber, i.e., Bacchus-Dionysus, but \"whereas the festival of Liber is joyful, the Jewish festival of Liber is sordid and absurd.\" According to Pliny, *Beth-Shean was founded by Dionysus after he had buried his wet nurse Nysa in its soil. His intention was to enlarge the area of the grave, which he surrounded with a city wall although there were as yet no inhabitants. Then the god chose the Scythians from among his companions, and in order to encourage them, honored them by calling the new city Scythopolis after them (Pliny, Natural History 5:18, 74). An inscription found at Beth-Shean dating from the time of Marcus Aurelius mentions that Dionysus was honored there as ktistes. Stephen of Byzantium reports a legend that connects the founding of the city of Rafa also with Dionysus (for the Dionysian foundation legends of cities in the region, see Lichtenberger's study). It is wrong to assume as some do that Plutarch took his account of the festival of Tabernacles from an antisemitic source, for despite all the woeful ignorance in his account it contains no accusation against, or abuse of, the Jews. It is more likely that Plutarch described the festival of Tabernacles from observation, interpreting it in accordance with his own philosophical outlook, which does not prevent him, however, from introducing into it features of the cult of the famous Temple of Jerusalem gleaned by him in his wide reading. The description as a whole, however, is of Tabernacles as it was celebrated in the Greek diaspora at the end of the first and the beginning of the second century C.E., and not as it was celebrated in the Temple, which had already been destroyed for more than a generation. The festival undoubtedly absorbed influences from the environment, so that Plutarch could indeed have witnessed what he recognized as customs of the Dionysian feast.\n\nThe first Jews who settled in Rome were expelled in 139 BCE, along with Chaldaean astrologers by Cornelius Hispalus under a law which proscribed the propagation of the \"corrupting\" cult of \"Jupiter Sabazius\", according to the epitome of a lost book of Valerius Maximus:\n\nGnaeus Cornelius Hispalus, praetor peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Popilius Laenas and Lucius Calpurnius, ordered the astrologers by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within ten days, since by a fallacious interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their lies. The same praetor compelled the Jews, who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius, to return to their homes. \n\nBy this it is conjectured that the Romans identified the Jewish YHVH Tzevaot (\"sa-ba-oth\", \"of the Hosts\") as Jove Sabazius.\n\nThis mistaken connection of Sabazios and Sabaot was often repeated. In a similar vein, Plutarch maintained that the Jews worshipped Dionysus, and that the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius. Plutarch also discusses the identification of the Jewish God with the \"Egyptian\" Typhon, an identification which he later rejects, however. The monotheistic Hypsistarians worshipped the Most High under this name, which may have been a form of the Jewish God.\n\n#gnosticinformant #documentary #judaism",

In her latest book, she admits that her fascination with ancient Egypt has soured — so much so that she now describes herself as a “recovering Egyptologist.” The uncritical admiration of the pharaohs that has continued to the present day, she writes, is a legacy of the ancient rulers’ efforts to manipulate how they were perceived, and has even served as a narrative and cultural foundation propping up modern authoritarianism.\n\n“How many of us have had deep obsessions with the ancient world — I just love Egyptian temples! I adore Greek mythology! — that are really symptoms of an ongoing addiction to male power that we just can’t kick?” Cooney writes.\n\n“The Good Kings: Absolute Power in Ancient Egypt and the Modern World,” published by National Geographic, draws direct parallels between the rulers of 3,000 years ago and modern tyrants. In it, Cooney describes how the pharaohs created a compelling moral argument for power that continues to mislead people today, and which is linked directly to the current rise of authoritarianism.\n\nCooney explores the pitfalls of patriarchal systems that harm women and men alike, and she convincingly argues that society is duplicating the historical patterns that have repeatedly led to power collapses. Only this time, she notes, climate change has altered the rules of recovery.\n\nCooney is chair of UCLA’s Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures. In an interview with UCLA Newsroom, she talks about what lessons ancient Egyptian narratives might offer in light of the societal and social challenges the world faces in 2021.\n\nWhy are the pharaohs of ancient Egypt still so relevant thousands of years later?\n\nPharaohs open themselves up to social justice discussions. The hard thing is that the pharaohs were arguably the best ever at presenting an authoritarian regime as good and pure and moral. That’s the underlying idea that needs to be popped first, because we still buy into it today. Concepts of patriarchal society, extraction of natural resources for profit, exploitation, overwork, misogyny and more all came pouring out of the Egyptian narrative.\n\nOsiris (/oʊˈsaɪrɪs/, from Egyptian wsjr, Coptic: ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ ousire, Late Coptic [uˈsiræ]; Phoenician: 𐤀𐤎𐤓,  romanized: ʾsr)  is the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation in ancient Egyptian religion. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef crown, and holding a symbolic crook and flail.  He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy wrap. When his brother Set cut him up into pieces after killing him, Osiris' wife Isis found all the pieces and wrapped his body up, enabling him to return to life. Osiris was widely worshipped until the decline of ancient Egyptian religion during the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire. \n\nOsiris was at times considered the eldest son of the earth god Geb  and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis, and brother of Set, Nephthys, and Horus the Elder, with Horus the Younger being considered his posthumously begotten son. Through syncretism with Iah, he was also a god of the Moon. \n\n\nThrough the hope of new life after death, Osiris began to be associated with the cycles in nature, in particular the sprouting of vegetation and the annual flooding of the Nile River, as well as the heliacal rising of Orion and Sirius at the start of the new year. He became the sovereign that granted all life, \"He Who is Permanently Benign and Youthful\". \n\nThe first evidence of the worship of Osiris is from the middle of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt (25th century BC), although it is likely that he was worshiped much earlier; the Khenti-Amentiu epithet dates to at least the First Dynasty, and was also used as a pharaonic title. Most information available on the Osiris myth is derived from allusions in the Pyramid Texts at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, later New Kingdom source documents such as the Shabaka Stone and \"The Contendings of Horus and Seth\", and much later, in the narratives of Greek authors including Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus. \n\n\n#gnosticinformant #osiris #christianity",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nSABAZIOS , a god of the Thracians and the Phrygians, is also known from Greek and Latin sources as Sabadios, Sauazios, Saazios, Sabos, Sebazios, Sabadius, and Sebadius. His name is related to the Macedonian word sauâdai, or saûdoi, meaning \"satyrs\" (Detschew, 1957, p. 427). According to some scholars (e.g., Lozovan, 1968), he was a Thracian mountain god whose cult was carried by Phrygian emigrants from Thrace to Anatolia.\n\nGreek sources from the fifth century bce onward mention Sabazios as a Thracian or Phrygian god. In Athens, his cult's initiation ceremonies took place by night, and the adepts were purified by being rubbed with mud. A sacramental drink was also involved. The identification of Sabazios with Dionysos, which occurs regularly in Hellenistic sources, is unquestionable. However, Phrygian inscriptions relate him to Zeus, and in North Africa, where his cult is attested as early as the fourth century bce, he might have had the features of a heavenly god; hence he was later identified with the Semitic god Baal, both of them receiving the Greek epithet hupsistos (\"highest, supreme\"). He was probably worshiped in Thrace under other local names, such as Athyparenos, Arsilenos, Batalde Ouenos, Eleneites, Mytorgenos, Ouerzel(enos), and Tasibastenus.\n\nSabazios's name has been connected with the Indo-European *swo-, meaning \"[his] own,\" and with the idea of freedom, which occurs frequently among the epithets of Dionysos. Franz Cumont has suggested a relationship with the Illyrian sabaia, or sabaium, identifying a beer extracted from cereals (see Russu, 1969, p. 241). More recently, Gheorghe Muşu has translated Sabazios as \"sap god,\" from the Indo-European roots *sap- (\"taste, perceive\") and *sab- (\"juice, fluid\"). This translation corresponds well to the pattern of Dionysos/Sabazios, who was the divinity of humidity and as such was connected with both vegetation and intoxication (see Muşu, in Vulpe, 1980, pp. 333–336).\n\nThe Jews of Syria and Anatolia identified Sabazios with Sabaoth. Under the Roman rulers Sabazios was worshiped in Thrace, where he was more often known as Sebazios or, in Latin, Sabazius, Sabadius, or Sebadius and where he received such epithets as epekoos (\"benevolent\"), kurios (\"lord\"), megistos (\"greatest\"), and so forth. In Crimea, probably under Jewish-Anatolian influence, he was called hupsistos. He was constantly identified with both Zeus and the sun. Motifs of hands making the votive gesture of benedictio Latina are among the distinctive features of his cult. According to several Christian writers (Clement of Alexandria, Arnobius, and Firmicus Maternus), the most impressive rite of initiation into the mysteries of Sabazios consisted of the adept's contact with a snake (aureus coluber ) that was first put over his breast (per sinum ducunt ) and then pulled down to his genitals.\n\nNo less enigmatic than Zalmoxis, Sabazios was worshiped as early as the fourth century bce both as a chthonic and as a heavenly god. Scholars have too often tried to solve this riddle by supposing a borrowing from Jewish religion, but Jewish influence was not relevant in Anatolia before the third century bce. One should rather consider that chthonic features determined the character of the Thracian Sabazios, whereas the Phrygian Sabazios was probably connected with the sky.\n\nThe ecstatic Eastern rites practiced largely by women in Athens were thrown together for rhetorical purposes by Demosthenes in undermining his opponent Aeschines for participating in his mother's cultic associations:\n\nOn attaining manhood you abetted your mother in her initiations and the other rituals, and read aloud from the cultic writings ... You rubbed the fat-cheeked snakes and swung them above your head, crying Euoi saboi and hues attes, attes hues.\n\nByzantine Greek encyclopedia, Suda (10th century?), flatly states\n\nSabazios ... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry \"sabazein\". Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry \"sabasmos\"; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call \"saboi\" those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes ... Demosthenes [in the speech] \"On Behalf of Ktesiphon\" [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.\n\n#gnosticinformant #documentary #christianity",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nThe origins of Judaism lie in the Bronze Age amidst polytheistic ancient Semitic religions, specifically evolving out of the polytheistic ancient Canaanite religion, then co-existing with Babylonian religion, and syncretizing elements of Babylonian belief into the worship of Yahweh as reflected in the early prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nDuring the Iron Age I, the Israelite religion became distinct from the Canaanite polytheism out of which it evolved. This process began with the development of Yahwism, the monolatristic worship of Yahweh, one of the Canaanite gods, that gave acknowledgment to the existence of the other Canaanite gods, but suppressed their worship. Later, this monolatristic belief cemented into a strict monotheistic belief and worship of Yahweh alone, with the rejection of the existence of all other gods, whether Canaanite or foreign.\n\nThe Iron Age kingdoms of Israel (or Samaria) and Judah first appear in the 9th century BCE.  The two kingdoms shared Yahweh as the national god of their respective kingdom, for which reason their religion is commonly called Yahwism. \n\nIn Ugaritic texts, Asherah appears as ʾAṯirat (Ugaritic: 𐎀𐎘𐎗𐎚), anglicised Athirat. Sources from before 1200 BC almost always credit Athirat with her full title rbt ʾṯrt ym (or rbt ʾṯrt).[b] The phrase occurs 12 times in the Baʿal Epic alone.[14] The title rbt is most often vocalised as rabītu,[15] although rabat and rabīti are sometimes used by scholars.  Apparently of Akkadian origin, rabītu means \"lady\" (literally \"female great one\"). She appears to champion her son, Yam, god of the sea, in his struggle against Baʾal. Yam's ascription as god of the sea in the English translation is somewhat misleading, however, as yām (Hebrew: יָם) is a common western Semitic root that literally means \"sea\". Consequently, one should understand Yam to be the deified sea itself rather than a deity who holds dominion over it. Athirat's title can therefore been translated as \"Lady ʾAṯirat of the Sea\",  alternatively, \"she who walks on the sea\", or even \"the Great Lady-who-tramples-Yam\".\n\nOther neighbouring Canaanite kingdoms of the time each also had their own national god from the Canaanite pantheon of gods: Chemosh was the god of Moab, Milcom the god of the Ammonites, Qaus the god of the Edomites, and so on. In each kingdom, the king was his national god's viceroy on Earth. \n\nThe various national gods were more or less equal, reflecting the fact that kingdoms themselves were more or less equal, and within each kingdom a divine couple, made up of the national god and his consort – Yahweh and the goddess Asherah in Israel and Judah – headed a pantheon of lesser gods. \n\nBy the late 8th century, both Judah and Israel had become vassals of Assyria, bound by treaties of loyalty on one side and protection on the other. Israel rebelled and was destroyed c. 722 BCE, and refugees from the former kingdom fled to Judah, bringing with them the tradition that Yahweh, already known in Judah, was not merely the most important of the gods, but the only god who should be served. This outlook was taken up by the Judahite landowning elite, who became extremely powerful in court circles in the next century when they placed the eight-year-old Josiah (reigned 641–609 BC) on the throne. During Josiah's reign, Assyrian power suddenly collapsed, and a pro-independence movement took power promoting both the independence of Judah from foreign overlords and loyalty to Yahweh as the sole god of Israel. With Josiah's support, the \"Yahweh-alone\" movement launched a full-scale reform of worship, including a covenant (i.e., treaty) between Judah and Yahweh, replacing that between Judah and Assyria. \n\nBy the time this occurred, Yahweh had already been absorbing or superseding the positive characteristics of the other gods and goddesses of the pantheon, a process of appropriation that was an essential step in the subsequent emergence of one of Judaism's most notable features: its uncompromising monotheism.  The people of ancient Israel and Judah, however, were not followers of Judaism; they were practitioners of a polytheistic culture worshiping multiple gods, concerned with fertility and local shrines and legends, and not with a written Torah, elaborate laws governing ritual purity, or an exclusive covenant and national god. \n\n#gnosticinformant #polytheism #ancienthistory",

Composed by John Stafford Smith, the tune was later used by several writers as a setting for their patriotic lyrics. These included two songs by Francis Scott Key, most famously his poem \"Defence of Fort McHenry\". The combination of Key's poem and Smith's composition became known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", which was adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America in 1931.\n\nLyrics to the Anacreontic Song:\n\nTo Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full Glee,\nA few Sons of Harmony sent a Petition,\nThat he their Inspirer and Patron would be;\nWhen this answer arriv'd from the Jolly Old Grecian\n\"Voice, Fiddle, and Flute,\n\"no longer be mute,\n\"I'll lend you my Name and inspire you to boot,\n\"And, besides I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine\n\"The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n2\nThe news through Olympus immediately flew;\nWhen Old Thunder pretended to give himself Airs.\n\"If these Mortals are suffer'd their Scheme to persue,\n\"The Devil a Goddess will stay above Stairs.\n\"Hark! already they cry,\n\"In transports of Joy,\n\"Away to the Sons of Anacreon we'll fly,[28]\n\"And there, with good Fellows, we'll learn to intwine\n\"The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\n3\n\"The Yellow-Hair'd God and his nine fusty Maids,\n\"From Helicon's banks will incontinent flee,[29]\n\"Idalia will boast but of tenantless Shades,\n\"And the bi-forked Hill a mere Desart will be\n\"My Thunder no fear on't,\n\"Shall soon do it's Errand,\n\"And dam'me! I'll swinge the Ringleaders, I warrant.\n\"I'll trim the young Dogs, for thus daring to twine\n\"The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n4\nApollo rose up, and said, \"Pry'thee ne'er quarrel,\n\"Good King of the Gods, with my Vot'ries below:\n\"Your Thunder is useless\"—then shewing his Laurel,\nCry'd \"Sic evitabile fulmen,[30] you know!\n\"Then over each head\n\"My Laurels I'll spread;\n\"So my Sons from your Crackers no Mischief shall dread,\n\"Whilst snug in their Club-Room, they jovially twine\n\"The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n5\nNext Momus got up with his risible Phiz,\nAnd swore with Apollo he'd chearfully join—\n\"The full Tide of Harmony still shall be his,\n\"But the Song, and the Catch, and the Laugh shall be mine.\n\"Then, Jove, be not jealous\n\"Of these honest fellows.\"\nCry'd Jove, \"We relent, since the Truth you now tell us;\n\"And swear by Old Styx, that they long shall intwine\n\"The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n6\nYe Sons of Anacreon, then join Hand in Hand;\nPreserve Unanimity, Friendship, and Love!\n'Tis your's to support what's so happily plann'd;\nYou've the sanction of Gods, and the Fiat of Jove.\nWhile thus we agree,\nOur Toast let it be.\nMay our Club flourish happy, united, and free!\nAnd long may the Sons of Anacreon intwine\nThe Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\n\nn January 6th, 2021, insurrectionists stormed the U.S. Capitol in order to “Stop the Steal” and delay the certification of President-elect Biden’s electoral college victory. Christian flags, crosses on t-shirts, “Jesus Saves” signs, and prayers for victory in Jesus’ name were now-famously conspicuous among the mob.\n\nBy early April, the Brennan Center for Justice reported that lawmakers in 47 states proposed over 350 bills that claim to address voter fraud by limiting mail, early in-person, and Election Day voting through stricter ID requirements, limiting eligibility to vote absentee, or fewer voting hours. The recent bills signed into law by Governors Brian Kemp in Georgia and Ron DeSantis in Florida are just two examples. A similar bill is currently making its way through the Texas State Legislature.\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #foundingfathers",

    "description": "Kyle Smith (Ph.D)\nKyle Smith is associate professor and director of the History of Religions program at the University of Toronto. An award-winning teacher, he is the author or co-author of five books about Christian saints and martyrs. His most recent book, Cult of the Dead: A Brief History of Christianity, tells the fascinating story of how the world's most widespread religion is steeped in the memory of its martyrs. \nLinks:\nTwitter, Instagram & TikTok:\n@kylesmithTO\nhttps://www.kylesmithto.com/\nThe Book \"Cult of the Dead: A brief history of Christianity \nhttps://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520345164/cult-of-the-dead\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThough it promises eternal life, Christianity was forged in death. Christianity is built upon the legacies of the apostles and martyrs who chose to die rather than renounce the name of their lord. In this innovative cultural history, Kyle Smith shows how a devotion to death has shaped Christianity for two thousand years. For centuries, Christians have cared for their saints, curating their deaths as examples of holiness. Martyrs’ stories, lurid legends of torture, have been told and retold, translated and rewritten. Martyrs’ bones are alive in the world, relics pulsing with wonder. Martyrs’ shrines are still visited by pilgrims, many in search of a miracle. Martyrs have even shaped the Christian conception of time, with each day of the year celebrating the death of a saint. From Roman antiquity to the present, by way of medieval England and the Protestant Reformation, Cult of the Dead tells the fascinating story of how the world’s most widespread religion is steeped in the memory of its martyrs.\n\nReviews\n“With sly wit, subtle humour, agile prose and empathetic imagination, Kyle Smith narrates the growth of one of Christianity’s defining traditions.” —Times Literary Supplement\n\n“Cult of the Dead is the rare academic book that shows empathy; for the martyrs themselves [and] for those with devotion to them … Smith does our dearly departed the ultimate favor: He allows the dead to speak once more.” — National Catholic Reporter\n\n“Sheer erudition.” — Commonweal\n\n“For a topic that encompasses millennia of fascinating history, Smith’s digestible book offers a compelling and comprehensive introduction to the role of the lives and afterlives of Christianity’s martyrs in Western society from late antiquity to the present day.” — The New Criterion\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n“A brilliant, entertaining, and accessible account of the history of martyrdom. Invaluable for anyone interested in understanding the Christian faith.” —Bart D. Ehrman, author of Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why\n\n“An elegant and enlightening book.” —Elizabeth A. Castelli, author of Martyrdom and Memory: Early Christian Culture Making\n\n“A sweeping tour through the history of Christianity that makes the familiar seem fresh and dramatically brings to life the remarkable connections across time and space that constitute the Christian story.” —Kyle Harper, author of The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire\n\n“Cult of the Dead is vivid, readable, and often witty. Taking the reader on a journey from the time of Christ to the seventeenth century, it shows the intimate engagement with death at the heart of Christianity.” —Mary Wellesley, author of The Gilded Page: The Secret Lives of Medieval Manuscripts\n\n“Masterfully presented. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the significance of pain, torture, and death in the construction of Christian communities from the time of the apostles to the Protestant Reformation.” —Kristina Sessa, author of Daily Life in Late Antiquity\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #cultofthedead",

The history of the term’s usage indicates that it referred to a body of esoteric writings that were at first prized, later tolerated, and finally excluded. In its broadest sense apocrypha has come to mean any writings of dubious authority. A brief treatment of apocrypha follows. For full treatment, see biblical literature: Apocryphal writings.\n\nThere are several levels of dubiety within the general concept of apocryphal works in Judeo-Christian biblical writings. Apocrypha per se are outside the canon, not considered divinely inspired but regarded as worthy of study by the faithful. Pseudepigrapha are spurious works ostensibly written by a biblical figure. Deuterocanonical works are those that are accepted in one canon but not in all.\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nAll the New Testament apocrypha are pseudepigraphal, and most of them fall into the categories of acts, gospels, and epistles, though there are a number of apocalypses and some can be characterized as wisdom books. The apocryphal acts purport to relate the lives or careers of various biblical figures, including most of the apostles; the epistles, gospels, and others are ascribed to such figures. Some relate encounters and events in mystical language and describe arcane rituals. Most of these works arose from sects that had been or would be declared heretical, such as, importantly, the Gnostics. Some of them argued against various heresies, and a few appear to have been neutral efforts to popularize the life of some saint or other early leader of the church, including a number of women. In the early decades of Christianity no orthodoxy had been established, and various parties or factions were vying for ascendancy and regularity in the young church. All sought through their writings, as through their preaching and missions, to win believers. In this setting virtually all works advocating beliefs that later became heretical were destined to denunciation and destruction.\n\nIn addition to apocryphal works per se, the New Testament includes a number of works and fragments that are described by a second meaning of the term deuterocanonical: “added later.” The Letter to the Hebrews attributed to Paul, who died before it was written, is one of these; others are the letters of James, Peter (II), John (II and III), and Jude, and the Revelation to John. Fragments include Mark 16:9–20, Luke 22:43–44, and John 7:53 and 8:1–11. All are included in the Roman canon and are accepted by the Eastern Church and most Protestant churches.\n\nHeretical movements such as Gnosticism and Montanism spawned a great body of New Testament pseudepigrapha. The existence of such purported scriptures lent great impetus to the process of canonization in the young and orthodox Christian Church. See also various apocryphal works cited above.\n\n#gnosticinformant #apocrypha #christianity",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nJohn S. Kloppenborg is a specialist in Christian origins and second Temple Judaism, in particular the Jesus tradition (the canonical and non canonical gospels), and the social world of the early Jesus movement in Jewish Palestine and in the cities of the eastern Empire. He has written extensively on the Synoptic Sayings Gospel (Q) and the Synoptic Problem, and is currently writing on the parables of Jesus, the letter of James, and cultic, professional, and ethnic associations in the Graeco-Roman world. He is one of the general editors of the International Q Project and holds a five year SSHRC Insight Grant on Associative Practices in the Graeco-Roman World.\n\nhttps://www.tst.edu/directory/faculty/kloppenborg-john-s\nProfessor John Kloppenborg:\nhttps://www.religion.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/john-kloppenborg-frsc\nGet the Book Christ's Associations (Recommended):\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Christs-Associations-Connecting-Belonging-Ancient/dp/0300217048\nQ:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Earliest-Gospel-Introduction-Original-Stories/dp/0664232221\n\nThough this document has never been found, John Kloppenborg offers a succinct account of why scholars maintain it existed in the first place and demonstrates how they have been able to reconstruct its contents and wording from the two later Gospels that used it as a source: Matthew and Luke. Presented here in its entirety, as developed by the International Q Project, this Gospel reveals a very different portrait of Jesus than in much of the later canonical writings, challenging the way we think of Christian origins and the very nature and mission of Jesus Christ.\n\nDrawing on data about associative practices throughout the ancient world, this innovative study offers new insight into the structure and mission of the early Christ groups. John S. Kloppenborg situates the Christ associations within the broader historical context of the ancient Mediterranean and reveals that they were probably smaller than previously believed and did not have a uniform system of governance, and that the attraction of Christ groups was based more on practice than theological belief.\n--\nContents:\n00:00 - Intro\n05:00 - Ecclesia\n14:10 - Q\n24:05 - Gospel of Thomas\n28:25 - Paul's Knowledge of Q\n32:18 - God Fearers, Syncretists, and Hypsisterians\n39:07 - Cult Receptions in Rome\n40:58 - Mythicism\n50:36 - What Jesus Really Said\n01:03:28 - Pagan Christian Connections\n01:15:26 - Outro\n--\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nReconstructions of the historical Jesus are based on the Pauline epistles and the gospels, while several non-biblical sources also support his historical existence.  Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and developing new and different research criteria.\n\nVirtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed.  Historian Michael Grant asserts that if conventional standards of historical criticism are applied to the New Testament, \"we can no more reject Jesus' existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.\" There is no indication that writers in antiquity who opposed Christianity questioned the existence of Jesus.\n\n@kloppenborg\nEstimated to date back to the very early Jesus movement, the lost Gospel known as Q offers a distinct and remarkable picture of Jesus and his significance--and one that differs markedly from that offered by its contemporary, the apostle Paul.\n\nQ presents Jesus as a prophetic critic of unbelief and a sage with the wisdom that can transform. In Q, the true meaning of the \"kingdom of God\" is the fulfillment of a just society through the transformation of the human relationships within it.\n\n#gnosticinformant #jesus #christianity",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\n2nd Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LateNiteGnosis\n\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/uWBZkxd4UX\n\nLucius Cornelius Sulla (l. 138 - 78 BCE) enacted his constitutional reforms (81 BCE) as dictator to strengthen the Roman Senate's power. Sulla was born in a very turbulent era of Rome's history, which has often been described as the beginning of the fall of the Roman Republic. There were two primary opposing factions in Roman politics: the Optimates who emphasized the leadership and prominent role of the Senate, and the Populares who generally advocated for the rights of the people.\n\nDuring this era, senatorial power was curbed and significant progress was made for the rights of the common folk, particularly the magistracy of tribune of the plebs, which was specifically created to be a guardian of the people. Sulla was an Optimate and after his rise to power, he declared himself dictator and passed several reforms to the constitution to revitalize and restore senatorial power to what it once was. \n\nSulla was born into an ancient patrician family and so could trace his ancestry back to the original senators appointed by Romulus, the founder of Rome. Part of the cursus honorum, the unspoken but accepted career ladder of public office, was to first serve as a military officer before being able to run for public office. Sulla, by way of his patrician rank, skipped military service and was elected to the junior magistracy of quaestor in 108 BCE. He quickly made a name for himself as an excellent commander and negotiator serving under consul Gaius Marius a Populare who served an extraordinary five consecutive consulships from 104 - 100 BCE - in the Jugurthine War. \n\nSulla was elected praetor urbanus in 97 BCE and was governor of the province of Cilicia in Asia Minor the following year. The Senate ordered Sulla to reinstate King Ariobarzanes - a friend of Rome - back on the Cappadocian throne because he had been ousted by King Mithridates VI of Pontus who wanted to insert his son as the Cappadocian king. Sulla proved successful and was even hailed by his soldiers as imperator, or victorious commander.\n\nIn the Late Republic, Italians had long desired Roman citizenship and equal say in politics and power. The Romans had a knack for teasing the Italians with citizenship but never going the full distance in actually passing a law granting the Italians what they wanted. This civil discord reached a critical point in 91 BCE, the start of the Social War, between Rome and Italians who were eventually granted citizenship in 89 BCE after massive casualties on both sides. During the Social War, Sulla had independent command over legions in Southern Italy where he laid siege to the Italian city of Pompeii and successfully fended off armies attempting to aid Pompeii. He fought valiantly and his soldiers awarded him with the Grass Crown the highest military honor. This military success made him immensely popular back in Rome and won him the consulship of 88 BCE.\n\nDuring his consulship, he was given eastern command of the legions to face King Mithridates VI of Pontus, one of Rome's most formidable enemies, who was wreaking havoc in the east. Mithridates VI had amassed an empire and surrounded himself with allies, and during Sulla's consulship, he ordered all cities in his Asian territories to murder all Romans and Italians. Not even women and children were spared. But before Sulla could embark on his trip to the east and defeat Mithridates VI, Marius and his ally, Sulpicius, using armed gangs and 600 equestrians as a bodyguard had 'convinced' the Assembly to remove Sulla's eastern command and had it transferred it to Marius. Marius then deployed two military tribunes to assume command of Sulla's army.\n\nIn one of the crucial turning points in Rome's history, Sulla then gave not a military speech to his soldiers, but a political one, in which he roused his 35,000 legionaries and riled them up about the wrongs done to him and them. The east was known for its endless riches and Marius was now robbing them of the bountiful eastern plunder that would have been theirs. Sulla's stirring speech was successful, and his legions were now loyal to Sulla alone. When Marius' tribunes finally arrived, Sulla's soldiers murdered them. \n\n#gnosticinformant #sulla #rome \n\nContents:\n00:00 - Introduction (Greek Background)\n01:19 - Alexander the Great and the Rise of Rome\n04:38 - Game of Thrones\n08:58 - Ptolemies\n16:19 - The Roman Front\n20:37 - The Beginning of Marius and Sulla's Beef\n26:29 - Mithridatic Wars\n30:50 - Sulla as ProtoCaesar\n34:38 - First Triumvirate\n36:00 - Second Triumvirate\n37:00 - Augustus as Winner\n38:50 - Conclusion",

MacDonaldhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/homeric-mimesis/\n\nJoin Dr. Dennis R. MacDonald In This Exclusive Eighteen-Part Online Lecture Series To Get An In-Depth Study Of Literary Imitations Of Greek\n\nPoetry In The Synoptic Gospels.\nStudents are encouraged to purchase Dr. Dennis R. MacDonald's book titled, “Synopses of Epic, Tragedy, and the Gospels,” from Amazon, which will be used repeatedly and referenced throughout the entirety of the course.\nDennis R. MacDonald, a distinguished scholar and Emeritus Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Claremont School of Theology, earned a Bachelor's degree from Duke University, a Master of Divinity degree from Yale Divinity School, and his Ph.D. in Religion from Harvard University in 1976. He has since held esteemed academic positions at various institutions such as Gospel College, the Iliff School of Theology, and the Claremont School of Theology, among others. Dr. MacDonald served as the Director of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity at the Claremont Graduate University from 2000-2010. He also has been a visiting professor at prestigious institutions including Harvard Divinity School, Union Theological Seminary (NYC), Florida State University, and Yonsei University (S. Korea). His professional affiliations include being a long-time member of Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas (SNTS) and the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL).\n\n\n\nDr. MacDonald is recognized as a leading authority on the literary and cultural contexts of the New Testament, particularly on the use of classical and Jewish sources in the Gospels and other early Christian writings. His work has been widely cited and has earned him a reputation as a visionary scholar who has helped reshape the study of early Christianity. Throughout his career, Dr. MacDonald has been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the John Templeton Award for Theological Promise, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship.\n\n\n\nDr. MacDonald has edited several collections of essays on early Christian literature and has authored numerous groundbreaking books, more than a dozen monographs, and scores of articles in his field of expertise. His most influential works include \"The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark,\" \"Does the New Testament Imitate Homer? Four Cases from the Acts of the Apostles,\" and \"Two Shipwrecked Gospels: The Logoi of Jesus and Papias's Exposition of Logia about the Lord.\" He has dedicated himself to a scholarly pursuit of considerable significance. Through the authorship of multiple books, he meticulously documented the pervasive influence of ancient Greek literature on the New Testament's composition. His proposition of a mimetic approach has the potential to serve as a critical paradigm shift within the field of New Testament studies. This approach reorients focus from the mere editing of the New Testament authors to their creative emulation of Greek epic literature, thereby offering a fresh perspective on their literary achievements.\n\n\n\nDr. MacDonald's contributions extend beyond academia, as he has also appeared on several television broadcasts for the History Channel and A&E, and is a sought-after guest for podcasts, including MythVision Podcast.

    "description": "https://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/left-behind/\nClick Here for the Course!\nLeft Behind. A Course about the Rapture.\nProfessor Bart D. Ehrman (Ph.D)\n\nthe Rapture, in Christianity, the eschatological (concerned with the last things and Endtime) belief that both living and dead believers will ascend into heaven to meet Jesus Christ at the Second Coming (Parousia).\n\nThe belief in the Rapture emerged from the anticipation that Jesus would return to redeem all members of the church. The term rapture, however, appears nowhere in the New Testament. In his First Letter to the Thessalonians, the Apostle Paul wrote that the Lord will come down from heaven and that a trumpet call will precede the rise of “the dead in Christ” (4:16). Thereafter, “we who are still alive and are left will be caught up” (in Latin, rapio, the standard translation of Paul’s original Koine Greek) “together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (4:17). The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew, and Luke) mention Jesus’ return to earth from heaven; e.g., The Gospel According to Mark cites Jesus as foretelling a “ ‘coming in clouds’ with great power and glory” (13:26).\n\nBelief in the Rapture is often connected with a belief in the literal coming of the millennium, the 1,000-year rule of Jesus Christ after his return, as mentioned in chapter 20 of The Revelation to John (also known as The Book of Revelation), although there are also amillennial interpretations of the belief that reject that notion. There is also a divide among pre-tribulationists, who believe that the Rapture will occur before a period of tribulation on earth mentioned in Daniel (12:1) and Matthew (24:21) and preceding the End, and post-tribulationists, those who believe that it will come after that period. Finally, dispensationalism, the notion that God periodically enters into a new covenant with his people, has had some influence on the belief, insofar as some believers in the Rapture consider themselves to be dispensationalists.\n\nAlong with the epistles of Paul and the Revelation to John, apocalyptic literature and millennialist thinking have long maintained a hold on the Christian imagination, even when they have been variously interpreted or—in the case of millennialism—even rejected by some of the major figures in the history of Christian theology. The 16th-century movement called Futurism, expounded by the Jesuit Francisco Ribera, stressed the future fulfillment of the prophecy of the End as mentioned in scripture with both the rise of the Antichrist and the return of Christ. Another historical event whose ideas may have had some influence on the later evolution of the idea was the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony by Puritans seeking to build a “City upon a Hill” in anticipation of the Second Coming. The evangelical fervour of the Great Awakening (early 18th century) and Second Great Awakening (late 18th to early 19th century) in the United States widely promoted ideas about the millennium, about a new dispensation, and about the imminence of Christ’s return. The most famous of such thinkers was William Miller, whose prediction that the Second Coming would occur in 1843 inspired the subsequent formation of Adventist churches.\n\nThe idea of the Rapture persisted through the remainder of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century, gaining popularity among some evangelical and fundamentalist Christians as well as among some other Christian and even non-Christian new religious movements. During the Cold War, between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as the threat of nuclear war grew, prophecies about the Rapture gained currency. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the idea was prominent in popular culture, in part because of the millennialist fervour that arose as the year 2000 approached. The so-called “Chick Pamphlets” (illustrated tracts authored by the evangelist Jack Chick) and the Left Behind (1995–2007) novel and movie franchise were two examples of that phenomenon. Meanwhile, Endtime prophecies promoting a specific date for the Rapture—most notably the two dates in 2011 predicted by the American evangelist Harold Camping—proliferated.\n\n#gnosticinformant #rapture #bartehrman \n\nContents:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:30 - Rapture\n06:02 - Jesus as a Failed Prophet\n08:41 - Sleep in the New Testament\n09:22 - Persecution of Jesus or Church?\n11:00 - Millennium\n13:20 - Reinterpretation and Changes\n17:33 - Psychology\n20:36 - Outro",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.\n\nSatan, or the Devil, is one of the best-known characters in the Western traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Surprisingly, this entity was a late-comer in the ancient world. Satan, as a totally evil being, is nowhere to be found in the Jewish Bible. He evolved during the height of the Persian Achaemenid Empire (beginning c. 550 BCE) and was adopted by Jews living under Persian rule at the time. His formal name, Satan, derives from the Hebrew 'ha-Satan'. 'Ha' means 'the' and 'Satan' means 'opposer' or 'adversary'. The name described his eventual function as the opposer of God’s creation. Greek 'diabolos', English 'devil', meant 'accuser', 'slanderer', again describing his role. The concept of Satan emerged over time and in phases.\n\nAs the ancients constructed their religious systems, the existence of evil had to be explained and rationalized. In this capacity, the Gods were responsible for both good and evil. The term to describe this ability is omnipotence (all-powerful). In Deuteronomy 28, God declares that he controls both prosperity and suffering. Many creation myths addressed how and why evil arose.\nIn the Mesopotamian creation myth, the Enuma Elish, the gods themselves are responsible for evil. They are capricious and chaotic and created humans simply as slaves to offer them sacrifices. The God of Israel is shown as the opposite; he is never capricious, there is a divine plan, and everything he created is deemed good. The narrative function of the 'fall' in the Garden of Eden, the story of Adam and Eve, was to demonstrate that evil began through the fault of humans, not God. Their disobedience led to man’s struggles to produce food and woman’s pain in childbirth. But the most severe punishment was the loss of their immortality. The sin of Adam and Eve brought on the greatest evil, death. As their descendants, we are all doomed to this fate.\n\nBeing human, people projected their own experiences upon the gods. Kings had courts of nobles and advisers. As on earth, so in the heavens. Like any court, there were higher and lower officials. The higher ones were the angels in Judaism. The lower deities, daemons (in Greek), were originally neutral but over time were blamed for evil.\n\nIn Genesis, God speaks to his court, \"the sons of God\", the angels, as he proceeds to create the earth. At the end of creation, we have a strange passage in Genesis 6. We read that \"the sons of God\" had intercourse with human women, producing the \"Nephilim\", ancient giants. The purpose of this narrative is to explain why God sent the flood (evil on the earth). Many pantheons had gods who mated with women, particularly Zeus in Greek mythology. Israelite tradition, however, rejected this behavior as this mixing could lead to the great sin of idolatry.\nThe Book of Job (c. 600 BCE) is the earliest text to address the problem of theodicy, which is a modern term for the problem \"If God is good, why does he permit evil and suffering to exist?\" The book opens with the angels apparently reporting to God. Among them is the angel ha-Satan, whose function was to travel the world placing 'obstacles' (the meaning of his name) in front of humans, requiring them to make a choice (good or evil). In this role, we can say that he acts as God’s prosecuting attorney. Reporting back to God, he mentioned God’s servant Job, who had prospered. \n\nIn one of John’s visions, he referenced Isaiah 14, a polemic against the king of Babylon. Isaiah castigated the king who titled himself \"day-star\" for his hubris of thinking he was divine. When Jerome translated the Hebrew scriptures into Latin in the 4th century CE, he knew that the Romans named their morning star - the planet Venus - Lucifer and translated the passage as such. Lucifer became the most popular name in the Middle Ages.\n\nAt the end of Christ’s 1000-year reign on earth, Satan is released for the final battle. The irony is found in the image of Christ \"as a lamb\" who nevertheless defeats this monster. He is tossed into the \"lake of fire\", the Dead Sea (Rev. 20:1-5).\n\n#gnosticinformant #lucifer #satan\n\nContents:\n00:00 - Development of Satan in the Bible\n02:33 - Serpents in Egyptian Myth\n04:00 - Serpents in Medea\n05:00 - Set\n06:25 - Angra Mainyu\n07:52 - Summerians\n08:20 - Saturnian Bronze Age\n11:00 - Allotments to the Gods\n11:54 - Orphism in Revelations and Hellenism\n14:10 - Ban of Bacchus Worship, Ammon\n17:38 - Hades and Eve\n18:34 - Ancient Dionysian Worship\n19:47 - Orphic Dionysian Worship, Pan\n26:02 - Origins of Lucifer, Rebel Gods\n30:55 - Does Isaiah mention the Angelic Fall?\n33:35 - Ezekiel and the Weeping of Dead Gods\n37:02 - Enoch and Pagans (Satan)\n38:30 - Baphomet the Three Head God\n39:53 - Paradise Lost\n40:50 - Modern Satanism and Gnosis\n41:40 - Choose Nature or Apocalypticism\n\n#documentary #satan #lucifer",

For the ancient Egyptians, the story of Osiris is one of tragedy and hope; it is nothing less than the promise of everlasting life. Osiris, god of the dead, was also the “Triumphant” One and the “Lord of Eternity.” John Ray, a reader in Egyptology at the University of Cambridge, writes that Osiris was “Onnofri,” meaning “the perfect or complete being.” According to Plutarch, writing around AD 120, Osiris will eventually rise again to govern Egypt. The Osiris legend is perhaps the oldest resurrection story of the ancient world. The Birth and Death of Osiris According to scholars of Ancient Egyptian religion, Osiris might have been an early king of a small state on the Nile delta. He was credited with introducing early Egyptians to the cultivation of grain, wheat, and barley and ending the practice of cannibalism. Osiris was the law-giver and taught Egyptians how to worship the gods. Osiris was hated by his brother Set who contrived to murder him upon his return to Egypt; after teaching the Egyptians, Osiris traveled to western Asia, teaching other cultures. Along with 72 other conspirators, Set invited Osiris to a party during which he tricked his brother into climbing into a specially made coffin. Once inside, the lid was flung over the coffin and it was sealed, suffocating Osiris. The coffin was then floated down the Nile. Leaving her son, Horus the Younger, under the protection of the cobra goddess, Isis searched for her husband’s body, finding it in Byblos where the coffin had become part of an immense tree that had been cut down and used to build the palace of the king. Securing the coffin, Isis returned to Egypt. The Resurrection of Osiris While Isis retrieved her son, Set found the coffin and tore the body of Osiris to pieces. Some scholars suggest 14, other cite 16 pieces. Isis again traveled the land of Egypt, collecting the body parts yet burying copies of each part in different cities to confuse her enemies. Traditionally, however, the “tomb” of Osiris was considered to be at Abydos, the site of mass pilgrimages by Egyptians desiring to become Osiris in death. Through her magical abilities and the help of Thoth, Isis revived Osiris but as king of the underworld where he ruled and judged the dead in the Hall of Two Truths. Although the story of Osiris may predate the Old Kingdom, John Ray states that the earliest fragmentary accounts come out of the fifth and sixth dynasties Pyramid Texts yet by the First Intermediate Period all Egyptians followed the funerary practices of the story to make them “Osiris,” identifying with the god. According to social anthropologist Sir James Frazer, “In the resurrection of Osiris the Egyptians saw the pledge of a life everlasting for themselves beyond the grave.” (246) The story of Osiris is certainly far more complicated that this overview and readers are encouraged to consult the sources. This includes the lamentation of the god’s death by Isis as well as the yearly celebratory feast – all, in a sense, reenactments of his death and incarnation, often compared to similar rites associated with Dionysus.\n\n\nRead more at: https://www.shorthistory.org/ancient-civilizations/ancient-egypt/osiris-the-god-of-egyptian-resurrection/\n\n#gnosticinformant #osiris #resurrection \n--\nContents:\n00:00 - Teaser/Intro\n01:53 - Osiris and Bodily Resurrection\n06:38 - Mummies and Saints\n08:36 - \"Eternal Life\" Egyptian Mimicry\n11:17 - Egyptian Social Hierarchy\n18:35 - Christian/Egyptian Magic\n10:50 - Isis and Osiris (Masturbating Gods)\n26:15 - Egyptian Trinities\n27:53 - Horus, Eros, Plato, and Mary\n31:19 - Churches on Pagan Holy Places\n35:45 - Osiris's Erections\n37:50 - Evolution of Egyptian Doctrine\n40:52 - Diodorus on the Eucharist\n43:56 - Attis Hymn, Christian Forgery\n45:30 - Egyptians Invented Satan\n47:30 - Satan and Set, Yahweh the Storm God\n52:45 - Set in the Temple?",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/NealSendlak1\n\nSt. Patrick, (flourished 5th century, Britain and Ireland; feast day March 17), patron saint and national apostle of Ireland, credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland and probably responsible in part for the Christianization of the Picts and Anglo-Saxons. He is known only from two short works, the Confessio, a spiritual autobiography, and his Letter to Coroticus, a denunciation of British mistreatment of Irish Christians.\n\nPatrick was born in Britain of a Romanized family. At age 16 he was torn by Irish raiders from the villa of his father, Calpurnius, a deacon and minor local official, and carried into slavery in Ireland. He spent six bleak years there as a herdsman, during which he turned with fervour to his faith. Upon dreaming that the ship in which he was to escape was ready, he fled his master and found passage to Britain. There he came near to starvation and suffered a second brief captivity before he was reunited with his family. Thereafter, he may have paid a short visit to the Continent.\n\nThe best known passage in the Confessio tells of a dream, after his return to Britain, in which one Victoricus delivered him a letter headed “The Voice of the Irish.” As he read it, he seemed to hear a certain company of Irish beseeching him to walk once more among them. “Deeply moved,” he says, “I could read no more.” Nevertheless, because of the shortcomings of his education, he was reluctant for a long time to respond to the call. Even on the eve of reembarkation for Ireland he was beset by doubts of his fitness for the task. Once in the field, however, his hesitations vanished. Utterly confident in the Lord, he journeyed far and wide, baptizing and confirming with untiring zeal. In diplomatic fashion he brought gifts to a kinglet here and a lawgiver there but accepted none from any. On at least one occasion, he was cast into chains. On another, he addressed with lyrical pathos a last farewell to his converts who had been slain or kidnapped by the soldiers of Coroticus.\n\nCareful to deal fairly with the non-Christian Irish, he nevertheless lived in constant danger of martyrdom. The evocation of such incidents of what he called his “laborious episcopate” was his reply to a charge, to his great grief endorsed by his ecclesiastical superiors in Britain, that he had originally sought office for the sake of office. In point of fact, he was a most humble-minded man, pouring forth a continuous paean of thanks to his Maker for having chosen him as the instrument whereby multitudes who had worshipped “idols and unclean things” had become “the people of God.”\n\nThe phenomenal success of Patrick’s mission is not, however, the full measure of his personality. Since his writings have come to be better understood, it is increasingly recognized that, despite their occasional incoherence, they mirror a truth and a simplicity of the rarest quality. Not since St. Augustine of Hippo had any religious diarist bared his inmost soul as Patrick did in his writings. As D.A. Binchy, the most austerely critical of Patrician scholars, put it, “The moral and spiritual greatness of the man shines through every stumbling sentence of his ‘rustic’ Latin.”\n\nIt is not possible to say with any assurance when Patrick was born. There are, however, a number of pointers to his missionary career having lain within the second half of the 5th century. In the Coroticus letter, his mention of the Franks as still “heathen” indicates that the letter must have been written between 451, the date generally accepted as that of the Franks’ irruption into Gaul as far as the Somme River, and 496, when they were baptized. Patrick, who speaks of himself as having evangelized heathen Ireland, is not to be confused with Palladius, sent by Pope Celestine I in 431 as “first bishop to the Irish believers in Christ.”\nBefore the end of the 7th century, Patrick had become a legendary figure, and the legends have continued to grow. One of these would have it that he drove the snakes of Ireland into the sea to their destruction. Patrick himself wrote that he raised people from the dead, and a 12th-century hagiography places this number at 33 men, some of whom are said to have been deceased for many years. He also reportedly prayed for the provision of food for hungry sailors traveling by land through a desolate area, and a herd of swine miraculously appeared.\n\nAnother legend, probably the most popular, is that of the shamrock, which has him explain the concept of the Holy Trinity, three persons in one God, to an unbeliever by showing him the three-leaved plant with one stalk. Traditionally, Irishmen have worn shamrocks, the national flower of Ireland, in their lapels on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17.\n\n#gnosticinformant #stpatricksday #saintpatrick",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nIn many societies, ancient and modern, religion has performed a major role in their development, and the Roman Empire was no different. From the beginning Roman religion was polytheistic. From an initial array of gods and spirits, Rome added to this collection to include both Greek gods as well as a number of foreign cults. As the empire expanded, the Romans refrained from imposing their own religious beliefs upon those they conquered; however, this inclusion must not be misinterpreted as tolerance - this can be seen with their early reaction to the Jewish and Christian population. Eventually, all of their gods would be washed away, gradually replaced by Christianity, and in the eyes of some, this change brought about the decline of the western empire.\n\nEarly forms of the Roman religion were animistic in nature, believing that spirits inhabited everything around them, people included. The first citizens of Rome also believed they were watched over by the spirits of their ancestors. Initially, a Capitoline Triad (possibly derived from a Sabine influence) were added to these “spirits\" - the new gods included Mars, the god of war and supposed father of Romulus and Remus (founders of Rome); Quirinus, the deified Romulus who watched over the people of Rome; and lastly, Jupiter, the supreme god. They, along with the spirits, were worshipped at a temple on Capitoline Hill. Later, due to the Etruscans, the triad would change to include Jupiter who remained the supreme god; Juno, his wife and sister; and Minerva, Jupiter's daughter.\n\nDue to the presence of Greek colonies on the Lower Peninsula, the Romans adopted many of the Greek gods as their own. Religion and myth became one. Under this Greek influence, the Roman gods became more anthropomorphic – with the human characteristics of jealousy, love, hate, etc. However, this transformation was not to the degree that existed in Greek mythology. In Rome individual expression of belief was unimportant, strict adherence to a rigid set of rituals was far more significant, thereby avoiding the hazards of religious zeal. Cities adopted their own patron deities and performed their own rituals. any ways, their religion remained practical.\n\nEven though there were four colleges for priests, there was no priestly class; it would always remain a public office. This practice would even extend to the imperial palace. From the time of Emperor Augustus the emperor would assume the title of pontifex maximus or chief priest. Other than the pontifexes there were augures, individuals who read the entrails of animals and the flight of birds to interpret omens, or in other words, the will of the gods. Elaborate rituals were performed to bring Roman victory in battle, and no declaration of war or major event was undertaken without the clear approval of the gods. Dating from the time of the Etruscans, a diviner or haruspices, was always consulted, and it was considered dangerous to ignore the omens. Spurinna, a Roman soothsayer, read animal entrails and foresaw Julius Caesar's death on the Ides of March. When Roman Commander Publius Claudius Pulcher ignored the omens - refusal of the sacred chickens to eat - before a battle during the First Punic War, he was defeated, as was his military career.\n\nHowever, when looking at the religion of Rome, one must examine the impact of the most important gods. Foremost among the gods were, of course, Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Zeus (although not as playful), and his wife/sister Juno. He was the king of the gods; the sky god (the great protector) - controlling the weather and forces of nature, using thunderbolts to give warning to the people of Rome. Originally linked with farming as Jupiter Elicius, his role changed as the city grew, eventually obtaining his own temple on Capitoline Hill. Later, he became Jupiter Imperator Invictus Triumphator - Supreme General, Unconquered, and ultimately, Jupiter Optimus Maximus - Best and Greatest. His supremacy would be temporarily set aside during the reign of Emperor Elagabalus who attempted to replace the religion of Rome with that of the Syrian god Elagabal. After the emperor's assassination, his successor, Alexander Severus, returned Jupiter to his former glory. Next, Jupiter's wife/sister was Juno, for whom the month of June is named - she was the equivalent of the Greek Hera. Besides being the supreme goddess with a temple on Esquiline Hill, she was the goddess of light and moon, embodying all of the virtues of Roman matron hood - as Juno Lucina she became the goddess of childbirth and fertility.\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #ancientrome",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe ruins of the Temple of Apollo that are visible today date from the fourth century BC, and are of a peripteral Doric building. It was erected by Spintharus, Xenodoros, and Agathon on the remains of an earlier temple, dated to the sixth century BC, which had been erected on the site of a seventh-century BC construction attributed in legend to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes. \n\nAncient tradition accounted for four temples that successively occupied the site before the 548/7 BC fire, following which the Alcmaeonids built a fifth. The poet Pindar celebrated the Alcmaeonids' temple in Pythian 7.8-9 and he also provided details of the third building (Paean 8. 65–75). Other details are given by Pausanias (10.5.9-13) and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (294 ff.). The first temple was said to have been constructed out of olive branches from Tempe. The second was made by bees out of wax and wings, but was miraculously carried off by a powerful wind and deposited among the Hyperboreans. The third, as described by Pindar, was created by the deities Hephaestus and Athena, but its architectural details included Siren-like figures or \"Enchantresses\", whose baneful songs eventually provoked the Olympian deities to bury the temple in the earth (according to Pausanias, it was destroyed by earthquake and fire). In Pindar's words (Paean 8.65-75, Bowra translation), addressed to the Muses:\n\nMuses, what was its fashion, shown\nBy the skill in all arts\nOf the hands of Hephaestus and Athena?\nOf bronze the walls, and of bronze\nStood the pillars beneath,\nBut of gold were six Enchantresses\nWho sang above the eagle.\nBut the sons of Cronus\nOpened the earth with a thunderbolt\nAnd hid the holiest of all things made.\nAway from their children\nAnd wives, when they hung\nTheir lives on the honey-hearted words.\nThe fourth temple was said to have been constructed from stone by Trophonius and Agamedes. However, a 2019 theory gives a completely new explanation of the above myth of the four temples of Delphi.\n\nFrom the entrance of the upper site, continuing up the slope on the Sacred Way almost to the Temple of Apollo, are a large number of votive statues, and numerous so-called treasuries. These were built by many of the Greek city-states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice, which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a \"tithe\" or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored Athenian Treasury, built to commemorate their victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC.\n\nThe Siphnian Treasury was dedicated by the city of Siphnos, whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.\n\nOne of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Having built it in the late classical period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place at Delphi amongst the other city-states. Completed in 380 BC, their treasury seems to draw inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.\n\nThe name Pythia is derived from Pytho, which in myth was the original name of Delphi. Etymologically, the Greeks derived this place name from the verb πύθειν (púthein) \"to rot\", which refers to the sickly sweet smell from the decomposing body of the monstrous Python after it was slain by Apollo. \n\nThe Pythia was established at the latest in the 8th century BC,  (though some estimates date the shrine to as early as 1400 BC  and was widely credited for her prophecies uttered under divine possession (enthusiasmos) by Apollo. The Pythian priestess emerged pre-eminent by the end of the 7th century BC and continued to be consulted until the late 4th century AD. During this period, the Delphic Oracle was the most prestigious and authoritative oracle among the Greeks, and she was among the most powerful women of the classical world. The oracle is one of the best-documented religious institutions of the classical Greeks. Authors who mention the oracle include Aeschylus, Aristotle, Clement of Alexandria, Diodorus, Diogenes, Euripides, Herodotus, Julian, Justin, Livy, Lucan, Nepos, Ovid, Pausanias, Pindar, Plato, Plutarch, Sophocles, Strabo, Thucydides, and Xenophon.\n\nNevertheless, details of how the Pythia operated are scarce, missing, or non-existent entirely, as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain. Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #apollo #delphi",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nJason Reza Jorjani:\n@incendiaryideas \n\nLovers of Sophia:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lovers-Sophia-Jason-Reza-Jorjani-ebook/dp/B081NYMT3H\n\nPlato's so-called unwritten doctrines are metaphysical theories ascribed to him by his students and other ancient philosophers but not clearly formulated in his writings. In recent research, they are sometimes known as Plato's 'principle theory' (German: Prinzipienlehre) because they involve two fundamental principles from which the rest of the system derives. Plato is thought to have orally expounded these doctrines to Aristotle and the other students in the Academy and they were afterwards transmitted to later generations.\n\nThe credibility of the sources that ascribe these doctrines to Plato is controversial. They indicate that Plato believed certain parts of his teachings were not suitable for open publication. Since these doctrines could not be explained in writing in a way that would be accessible to general readers, their dissemination would lead to misunderstandings. Plato therefore supposedly limited himself to teaching the unwritten doctrines to his more advanced students in the Academy. The surviving evidence for the content of the unwritten doctrines is thought to derive from this oral teaching.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, historians of philosophy initiated a wide-ranging project aiming at systematically reconstructing the foundations of the unwritten doctrines. The group of researchers who led this investigation, which became well-known among classicists and historians, came to be called the 'Tübingen School' (in German: Tübinger Platonschule), because some of its leading members were based at the University of Tübingen in southern Germany. On the other hand, numerous scholars had serious reservations about the project or even condemned it altogether. Many critics thought the evidence and sources used in the Tübingen reconstruction were insufficient. Others even contested the existence of the unwritten doctrines or at least doubted their systematic character and considered them mere tentative proposals. The intense and sometimes polemical disputes between the advocates and critics of the Tübingen School were conducted on both sides with great energy. Advocates suggested it amounted to a 'paradigm shift' in Plato studies.\n\nThe expression 'unwritten doctrines' refers to doctrines of Plato taught inside his school and was first used by his student Aristotle. In his treatise on physics, he wrote that Plato had used a concept in one dialogue differently than 'in the so-called unwritten doctrines.' Modern scholars who defend the authenticity of the unwritten doctrines ascribed to Plato lay stress on this ancient expression. They hold that Aristotle used the phrase 'so-called' not in any ironic sense, but neutrally.\n\nThe scholarly literature sometimes also uses the term 'esoteric doctrines.' This has nothing to do with the meanings of 'esoteric' common today: it does not indicate a secret doctrine. For scholars, 'esoteric' indicates only that the unwritten doctrines were intended for a circle of philosophy students inside Plato's school (in Greek, 'esoteric' literally means 'inside the walls'). Presumably they had the necessary preparation and had already studied Plato's published doctrines, especially his Theory of Forms, which is called his 'exoteric doctrine'.\n\nModern advocates of the possibility of reconstructing the unwritten doctrines are often called in a short and casual way 'esotericists' and their skeptical opponents are thus 'anti-esotericists.' \n\nThe Tübingen School is sometimes called the Tübingen School of Plato studies to distinguish it from an earlier 'Tübingen School' of theologians based at the same university. Some also refer to the 'Tübingen paradigm.' Since Plato's unwritten doctrines were also vigorously defended by the Italian scholar Giovanni Reale, who taught in Milan, some  also refer to the 'Tübingen and Milanese School' of Plato interpretation. Reale introduced the term 'protology,' i.e., 'doctrine of the One,' for the unwritten doctrines, since the highest of the principles ascribed to Plato is known as the 'One.'\n\nThe case for the unwritten doctrines involves two steps. The first step consists in the presentation of the direct and circumstantial evidence for the existence of special philosophical doctrines taught orally by Plato. This, it is claimed, shows that Plato's dialogues, which have all survived,[citation needed] do not contain all of his teaching, but only those doctrines suitable for dissemination by written texts. In the second step, the range of sources for the supposed content of the unwritten doctrines is evaluated and the attempt made to reconstruct a coherent philosophical system.\n\n#gnosticinformant #platonism #esoterica",

Much of his traditional scholarly work has been devoted to Thucydides; his book The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New Written Word appeared from Rowman and Littlefield in 1996; his second Thucydides book (The Ancient Simplicity: Thucydides and the Limits of Political Realism) was published by the University of California Press in 1998.\n\nAt the same time, he has a long-standing interest in the relationship between the humanities and rapidly developing digital technology. He began this side of his work as a graduate student at Harvard when the Classics Department purchased its first TLG authors on magnetic tape in the summer of 1982. He developed a Unix-based full text retrieval system for the TLG that was widely used in North America and Europe in the middle 1980s. He also helped establish a typesetting consortium to facilitate scholarly publishing. Since 1985 he has been engaged in planning and development of the Perseus Project, which he directs as the Editor-in-Chief. Besides supervising the Perseus Project as a whole, he has been primarily responsible for the development of the morphological analysis system which provides many of the links within the Perseus database.\n\nMark Course:\nDr. James Tabor\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/firstgospel/\n\nMoses Course:\nDr. Bart D.

His work was the first recorded political and moral analysis of a nation’s war policies.\n\nAll that is certainly known (perhaps all that ancient scholars knew) of Thucydides’ life is what he reveals about himself in the course of his narrative. He was an Athenian, old enough when the war began to estimate its importance and judge that it was likely to be a long one and to write an account of it, observing and making notes from its beginning. He was probably born, therefore, not later than 460—perhaps a few years earlier since his detailed narrative begins, just before 431, with the events which provoked the war. He was certainly older than 30 when he was elected stratēgos, a military magistrate of great importance, in 424. Hence, he belongs to the generation younger than that of the Greek historian Herodotus.\n\nHe was in Athens when the great pestilence of 430–429 raged; he caught the disease himself and saw others suffer. Later, in 424, he was elected one of the 10 stratēgoi of the year and, because of his connections, was given command of the fleet in the Thraceward region, based at Thasos. He failed to prevent the capture of the important city of Amphipolis by the Spartan general Brasidas, who launched a sudden attack in the middle of winter. Because of this blunder, Thucydides was recalled, tried, and sentenced to exile. This, he says later, gave him greater opportunity for undistracted study for his History and for travel and wider contacts, especially on the Peloponnesian side—Sparta and its allies.\nThe History, which is divided into eight books, probably not by Thucydides’ design, stops in the middle of the events of the autumn of 411 BC, more than six and a half years before the end of the war. This much at least is known: that three historians, Cratippus (a younger contemporary), Xenophon (who lived a generation later), and Theopompus (who lived in the last third of the 4th century), all began their histories of Greece where Thucydides left off. Xenophon, one might say, began the next paragraph nearly as abruptly as Thucydides ended his.\n\n#thucydides #ancientgreek #perseus",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nMystery Cults Course:\nDr. M David Litwa\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nIn classical antiquity, including the Hellenistic world of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, historians and archaeologists view the public and private rituals associated with religion as part of everyday life. Examples of this phenomenon are found in the various state and cult temples, Jewish synagogues, and churches. These were important hubs for ancient peoples, representing a connection between the heavenly realms (the divine) and the earthly planes (the dwelling place of humanity). This context of magic has become an academic study, especially in the last twenty years.\n\nPervasive throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia until late antiquity and beyond, mágos, \"Magian\" or \"magician\", was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek goēs (γόης), the older word for a practitioner of magic, to include astrology, alchemy and other forms of esoteric knowledge.[citation needed] This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for (Pseudo-)Zoroaster, who was perceived by the Greeks to be the \"Chaldean\", founder of the Magi and inventor of both astrology and magic, a meaning that still survives in the modern-day words \"magic\" and \"magician\". \n\nHerodotus, Xenophon, Plutarch – did use magos in connection with their descriptions of (Zoroastrian) religious beliefs or practices, the majority seem to have understood it in the sense of \"magician\". Accordingly, the more skeptical writers then also identified the \"magicians\" – i.e. individual magians – as charlatans or frauds. In Plato's Symposium , the Athenian identified them as maleficent, allowing however a measure of efficacy as a function of the god Eros. Pliny paints them in a particularly bad light. \n\nAccording to one source magic in general was held in low esteem and condemned by speakers and writers.  Betz notes book burnings in regards to texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri, when he cites Ephesus in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 19: 10). And on the account of Suetonius, Augustus ordered the burning of 2,000 magical scrolls in 13 BC. Betz states:\nAs a result of these acts of suppression, the magicians and their literature went underground. The papyri themselves testify to this by the constantly recurring admonition to keep the books secret.  The religious beliefs and practices of most people were identical with some form of magic, and the neat distinctions we make today between approved and disapproved forms of religion-calling the former \"religion\" and \"church\" and the latter \"magic\" and \"cult\" - did not exist in antiquity except among a few intellectuals. It is known that philosophers of the Neopythagorean and Neoplatonic schools, as well as Gnostic and Hermetic groups, used magical books and hence must have possessed copies. But most of their material vanished and what we have left are their quotations.\n\nReligious ritual had the intended purpose of giving a god their just due honor, or asking for divine intervention and favor, while magic is seen as practiced by those who seek only power, and often undertaken based on a false scientific basis.  Ultimately, the practice of magic includes rites that do not play a part in worship, and are ultimately irreligious. Associations with this term tend to be an evolving process in ancient literature, but generally speaking ancient magic reflects aspects of broader religious traditions in the Mediterranean world, that is, a belief in magic reflects a belief in deities, divination, and words of power.[citation needed] The concept of magic however came to represent a more coherent and self-reflective tradition exemplified by magicians seeking to fuse varying non-traditional elements of Greco-Roman religious practice into something specifically called magic. This fusing of practices reached its peak in the world of the Roman Empire, in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE.\n\nThe magic papyri we have left to study, present more Graeco-Egyptian, rather than Graeco-Roman beliefs. Betz further notes:\nIn this syncretism, the indigenous ancient Egyptian religion has in part survived, in part been profoundly Hellenized. In its Hellenistic transformation, the Egyptian religion of the pre-Hellenistic era appears to have been reduced and simplified, no doubt to facilitate its assimilation into Hellenistic religion as the predominant cultural reference. It is quite clear that the magicians who wrote and used the Greek papyri were Hellenistic in outlook. Hellenization, however, also includes the Egyptianizing of Greek religious traditions. The Greek magical papyri contain many instances of such Egyptianizing transformations, which take very different forms in different texts or layers of tradition.\n\n\n#mysticism  #magic #divination",

Allison\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/jesus-quest/\n\nOf the extensive literary activity of Eusebius, a relatively large portion has been preserved. Although posterity suspected him of Arianism, Eusebius had made himself indispensable by his method of authorship; his comprehensive and careful excerpts from original sources saved his successors the painstaking labor of original research. Hence, much has been preserved, quoted by Eusebius, which otherwise would have been lost.\n\nThe literary productions of Eusebius reflect on the whole the course of his life. At first, he occupied himself with works on biblical criticism under the influence of Pamphilus and probably of Dorotheus of Tyre of the School of Antioch. Afterward, the persecutions under Diocletian and Galerius directed his attention to the martyrs of his own time and the past, and this led him to the history of the whole Church and finally to the history of the world, which, to him, was only a preparation for ecclesiastical history.\n\nThen followed the time of the Arian controversies, and dogmatic questions came into the foreground. Christianity at last found recognition by the State; and this brought new problems – apologies of a different sort had to be prepared. Lastly, Eusebius wrote eulogies in praise of Constantine. To all this activity must be added numerous writings of a miscellaneous nature, addresses, letters, and the like, and exegetical works that extended over the whole of his life and that include both commentaries and an important treatise on the location of biblical place names and the distances between these cities.\n\nPamphilus and Eusebius occupied themselves with the textual criticism of the Septuagint text of the Old Testament and especially of the New Testament. An edition of the Septuagint seems to have been already prepared by Origen, which, according to Jerome, was revised and circulated by Eusebius and Pamphilus. For an easier survey of the material of the four Evangelists, Eusebius divided his edition of the New Testament into paragraphs and provided it with a synoptical table so that it might be easier to find the pericopes that belong together. These canon tables or \"Eusebian canons\" remained in use throughout the Middle Ages, and illuminated manuscript versions are important for the study of early medieval art, as they are the most elaborately decorated pages of many Gospel books. Eusebius detailed in Epistula ad Carpianum how to use his canons.\n\nThe Chronicle  is divided into two parts. The first part, the Chronography  gives an epitome of universal history from the sources, arranged according to nations. The second part, the Canons, furnishes a synchronism of the historical material in parallel columns, the equivalent of a parallel timeline.\n\nThe work as a whole has been lost in the original Greek, but it may be reconstructed from later chronographists of the Byzantine school who made excerpts from the work, especially George Syncellus. The tables of the second part have been completely preserved in a Latin translation by Jerome, and both parts are still extant in an Armenian translation. \n\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #churchhistory",

She earned her Ph.D. at Brown University in Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean, with a focus on early Christianity, ancient Judaism, and Roman archaeology.\n\nBefore coming to UM, Professor Walsh taught at Wheaton College (Mass.), The College of the Holy Cross, and received teaching certificates and pedagogical training at Brown University and Harvard University. She teaches courses on the New Testament, Greco-Roman literature and material culture.\n\nHer first monograph, The Origins of Early Christian Literature: Contextualizing the New Testament within Greco-Roman Literary Culture, was recently published with Cambridge University Press.\n\nConventional approaches to the Synoptic gospels argue that the gospel authors acted as literate spokespersons for their religious communities. Whether described as documenting intra-group 'oral traditions' or preserving the collective perspectives of their fellow Christ-followers, these writers are treated as something akin to the Romantic poet speaking for their Volk - a questionable framework inherited from nineteenth-century German Romanticism. In this book, Robyn Faith Walsh argues that the Synoptic gospels were written by elite cultural producers working within a dynamic cadre of literate specialists, including persons who may or may not have been professed Christians. Comparing a range of ancient literature, her ground-breaking study demonstrates that the gospels are creative works produced by educated elites interested in Judean teachings, practices, and paradoxographical subjects in the aftermath of the Jewish War and in dialogue with the literature of their age. Walsh's study thus bridges the artificial divide between research on the Synoptic gospels and Classics.\n\nThe Origins of Early Christian Literature: Contextualizing the New Testament within Greco-Roman Literary Culture:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Origins-Early-Christian-Literature-Contextualizing-ebook/dp/B08K3NVXTZ?ref_=ast_author_mpb\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #robynfaithwalsh #christianity",

    "title": "Orgiastic Rites of the Mysteries",
    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nIn ancient Greek religion, an orgion (ὄργιον, more commonly in the plural orgia) was an ecstatic form of worship characteristic of some mystery cults. The orgion is in particular a cult ceremony of Dionysos (or Zagreus), celebrated widely in Arcadia, featuring \"unrestrained\" masked dances by torchlight and animal sacrifice by means of random slashing that evoked the god's own rending and suffering at the hands of the Titans. The orgia that explained the role of the Titans in Dionysos's dismemberment were said to have been composed by Onomacritus.  Greek art and literature, as well as some patristic texts, indicate that the orgia involved snake handling.\n\nOrgia may have been earlier manifestations of cult than the formal mysteries, as suggested by the violently ecstatic rites described in myth as celebrated by Attis in honor of Cybele and reflected in the willing self-castration of her priests the Galli in the historical period. The orgia of both Dionysian worship and the cult of Cybele aim at breaking down barriers between the celebrants and the divinity through a state of mystic exaltation: \n\nDionysian orgy allowed the Bacchant to emerge from the 'ego' to be united with the god in the ecstatic exaltation of omophagia, dancing and wine. … This kind of bodily mysticism and psychosomatic liberation had only temporary effects each time—the period of the ekstasis. \n\nInitiates of the Orphic and Bacchic orgia practiced distinctive burial customs (see Totenpass) expressive of their beliefs in an afterlife; for instance, it was forbidden for the dead to wear wool. \n\nMembers of a group devoted to performing orgia are called orgeônes, whose activities were regulated by law. The cult of the Thracian goddess Bendis was organized at Athens by her orgeônes as early as the Archaic period. \n\nThe participation of women in orgia, which in some manifestations was exclusive to women, sometimes led to prurient speculation and attempts to suppress the rites. In 186 BC, the Roman senate tried to ban Dionysian religion as subversive both morally and politically. \n\nIsidore of Seville says that the Latin equivalent of orgia was caerimoniae (English \"ceremonies\"), the arcane rites of ancient Roman religion preserved by the various colleges of priests.\n\nThe Bacchanalia were unofficial, privately funded popular Roman festivals of Bacchus, based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysia. They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of Liber, and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC. Like all mystery religions of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites. They seem to have been popular and well-organised throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula. \n\nLivy, writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalized and extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia, with frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes; he represents the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. Livy claims that seven thousand cult leaders and followers were arrested, and that most were executed. Livy believed the Bacchanalia scandal to be one of several indications of Rome's inexorable moral decay. Modern scholars take a skeptical approach to Livy's allegations. \n\nThe cult was not banned. Senatorial legislation to reform the Bacchanalia in 186 BC attempted to control their size, organisation, and priesthoods, under threat of the death penalty. This may have been motivated less by the kind of lurid and dramatic rumours that Livy describes than by the Senate's determination to assert its civil, moral and religious authority over Rome and its allies, after the prolonged social, political and military crisis of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC). \n\nThe Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god of wine, freedom, intoxication and ecstasy. They were based on the Greek Dionysia and the Dionysian Mysteries, and probably arrived in Rome c. 200 BC via the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and from Etruria, Rome's northern neighbour. Tenney Frank suggests that some form of Dionysian worship may have been introduced to Rome by captives from the formerly Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy, captured from the Carthaginians in 209 BC.[1] Like all mystery cults, the Bacchanalia were held in strict privacy, and initiates were bound to secrecy; what little is known of the cult and its rites derives from Greek and Roman literature, plays, statuary and paintings. One of the earliest sources is Greek playwright Euripides's The Bacchae, which won the Athenian Dionysia competition in 405 BC. The Bacchanalia may have had mystery elements and public elements.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #bacchus #greekmythology",

    "title": "What is Orphism?",
    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nOrphic religion, a Hellenistic mystery religion, thought to have been based on the teachings and songs of the legendary Greek musician Orpheus. No coherent description of such a religion can be constructed from historical evidence. Most scholars agree that by the 5th century BC there was at least an Orphic movement, with travelling priests who offered teaching and initiation, based on a body of legend and doctrine said to have been founded by Orpheus.\n\nPart of the Orphic ritual is thought to have involved the mimed or actual dismemberment of an individual representing the god Dionysus, who was then seen to be reborn. Orphic eschatology laid great stress on rewards and punishment after the death of the body, the soul then being freed to achieve its true life.\n\nThe enchanted worldview of Ancient Greeks offers an abundance of intriguing myths. Myths are vivid stories rich in symbolic meaning — their purpose is to help people understand the world around them, as well as the world within them. Some of these stories stand out as especially relevant, which is why they obtain cult status and become the organizing theme of religious festivals.\n\nMoreover, there are instances where a myth appears to be so important it becomes a separate religion on its own. Such is the case with Orphism — the mystery religion allegedly founded by Orpheus, the legendary Greek poet.\n\nAs with most things concerning Orphism, its origin is veiled in mystery. Scholars can’t agree on the precise time frame during which this religion was founded. According to the earliest evidence pointing to Orphic practices, this religion has been around since at least the 6th century BC.\n\nSome experts dispute the claim that Orphism was an organized religion. According to them, it only began as a local movement whose role was subsequently blown out of proportion by authors living long after its foundation. \n\nHowever, ancient philosophers such as Socrates and Plato would disagree with this theory. For instance, in Plato’s dialogue named Cratylus, Socrates claims that Orphic poets deserve credit for ascribing names to things, and thus for creating the Greek language itself. This legend is only a part of a belief widely held by philosophers in ancient Greece. Namely, many wise men believed that Orphism was the core of the common Greek religion, and that it was the oldest religion in existence.\n\nOrphism differs from the traditional Greek religion in many respects, so it’s no surprise that it provides a different account when it comes to the creation of the universe. The traditional Greek cosmology is outlined in “Theogony”, a seminal work by the Greek epic poet Hesiod. Although the Orphic worldview has some parallels with “Theogony”, it also introduces some elements apparently foreign to ancient Greek culture. This is what led many scholars to theorize that Orphism was imported, or at least influenced by the Egyptian and Near-Eastern cultures.\n\nAccording to adherents of Orphism, the creator of the universe is Phanes — the primordial god whose name means “the light-bringer” or “the shining one”. This deity also comes with many other epithets, such as Protogonos (The First-begotten), and Erikepaios (The Powerful One). This creator god has also been equated with numerous other deities, such as Eros, Pan, and Zeus.\n\nPhanes was hatched from The Cosmic Egg. His emergence caused the Egg to split into two halves, thus creating earth and the sky. After this, The First-begotten went on to create other deities.\n\nThe central myth of Orphism revolves around the death and resurrection of Dionysus Zagreus. Dionysus Zagreus was the son of Zeus and Persephone. He was the most beloved son of Zeus, which is why he intended him to become the successor of his throne at Olympus. When Hera found out about this, she was struck with jealousy because Zeus’ successor wasn’t one of her sons. In retribution, she plotted to kill Dionysus.\n\nPhanes possessed a magic scepter that gave him power to rule the world. This scepter is a major part of the cosmological plot. Namely, he passed it to Nyx, who handed it down to Uranus, who in turn gave it to Cronos, only for him to forward it to his son Zeus.\n\nFinally having the magic scepter in his hands, Zeus was possessed by lust for power. In his first power-ridden feat, he castrated his father Cronos by swallowing his genitals. However, he didn’t stop there, as he swallowed Phanes in order to gain powers over the elements and the creative life-force. Once he obtained all the power one could imagine, he endeavored to pass on his scepter to his son Dionysus. This leads us to the central myth of Orphism.\n\nThere are many accounts of the rebirth of Dionysus. According to the most popular legend, Zeus impregnated a mortal woman named Semele, which resulted in Dionysus being born for the second time.\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #orphism #pythagorean",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe Derveni papyrus is an ancient Greek papyrus roll that was found in 1962. It is a philosophical treatise that is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem, a theogony concerning the birth of the gods, produced in the circle of the philosopher Anaxagoras. The roll dates to around 340 BC, during the reign of Philip II of Macedon, making it Europe's oldest surviving manuscript. The poem itself was composed near the end of the 5th century BC, and \"in the fields of Greek religion, the sophistic movement, early philosophy, and the origins of literary criticism it is unquestionably the most important textual discovery of the 20th century.\" While interim editions and translations were published over the subsequent years, the manuscript as a whole was finally published in 2006.\n\nTHE DERVENI PAPYRUS, our oldest surviving Greek manuscript, was\ndiscovered in the remains of a funeral pyre1 almost forty years ago, in\nJanuary 1962. Along with other bizarre and astounding material, it\noffers an allegorical interpretation of a cosmogonic poem ascribed to Orpheus. It is a text of capital importance for understanding the religious and philosophical crisis of the late fifth century B.C.E., when polytheism was challenged by monotheism and pantheism. The papyrus' final publication is still awaited, although the difficult and painstaking work of putting together the over 200 carbonized fragments, recovered by the use of static electricity, appears, according to what has been published, to be largely complete. Meanwhile, considerably more can be done to interpret what is already known of the papyrus, especially since the recent publication of a greatly improved text of its opening. The excellent supplements there offered prove that this text is a work of the sophistic enlightenment, by clarifying its attitude to mystery cult and traditional Greek religion in general. In offering a translation based on my own restorations of the original Greek, I shall argue three propositions, which are wholly independent of each other: \n(1) Its author wrote his treatise in order to argue that conventional religious belief and practice, which may seem shocking or bizarre if taken literally, need to be interpreted allegorically in order to reconcile them with\nthe latest science of his day.\n(2) Its outlook matches exactly what has been reconstructed, on the basis\nof other considerations, as the attitude of the thinker who, in my view, wrote it, the notorious \"atheist\" Diagoras of Melos, who was not in fact an \"atheist\" in any modern sense, but a sophist like Critias or Prodicus.\n(3) The condemnation of Diagoras by the Athenians in 415 B.C.E. for defaming the Eleusinian mysteries was part of the fierce religious reaction\nagainst contemporary philosophy and science, which included accusations against Anaxagoras and would culminate in those against Socrates; this reaction affected the thought of followers of Anaxagoras, like Diogenes of Apollonia, and even more that of later philosophers, from Plato and Isocrates onwards. Let us first consider its author's aim. It is my contention that he sets out to criticize most of his contemporaries on the ground that they believed too literally in the rites and holy texts of traditional religion. According to him, both Orpheus (in col. VII) and'Heraclitus (in col. IV) compose allegories about the secrets of nature and of God; his term for this is iepoXoyeiGOal (see\nbelow). In the Orphic cosmogony, the allegory runs \"from the first word to\nthe last\"; it was fully intended by the poet, as is proved by his opening\nverse, where he declared that he was writing only for the \"pure in hearing\"\n(col. VII). The chosen are few indeed, since not even the priests can explain the rites and sacred texts to those whom they initiate (col. XX): this is because they do not explain them as allegories. To prove his point, the author (very plausibly) interprets the sacrifices to the Erinyes and the Eumenides allegorically, as attempts to appease the souls of the angry dead (in cols. IIII, VI), claims that Heraclitus was allegorizing when he spoke of the Erinys (col. IV), and (totally implausibly) offers a lengthy allegorical explanation of Orpheus' cosmogonic poem (in cols. VII-XIX, XXI-XXVI),\npausing in col. XX to remind us of his purpose. Since people lack so credible an explanation, they risk losing their faith, because they do not understand such apparently bizarre rites and texts. This is why, he argues, they do not believe in the terrors of Hades, because they take visions and oracles literally (col. V); the author, of course, can explain them allegorically. His methods of exegesis, namely etymology and allegory, are those of the sophistic enlightenment, so mocked by Aristophanes.\n\n#gnosticinformant #dervenipapyrus #greekmythology",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nRusell Gmirkin:\nhttp://russellgmirkin.com/\n\nPlato and the Creation of the Hebrew Bible:\nhttp://russellgmirkin.com/plato-and-the-hebrew-bible\n\nThis book compares the ancient law collections of the Ancient Near East, the Greeks and the Pentateuch to determine the legal antecedents for the biblical laws. A striking number of legal parallels are found to be with Athenian laws, and specifically with those found in Plato's Laws of ca. 350 BCE. Constitutional features in biblical law similarly mostly agree with Athens and with Plato's Laws. Greek parallels are also noted for specific law collections, such as Ten Commandments and the Deuteronomic law code. The synthesis of narrative and legal content is also shown to be compatible with Greek literature. Finally, this book argues that the creation of the Hebrew Bible itself took place according to the program for creating a national ethical literature found in Plato's Laws, reinforcing the importance of this specific text to the authors of the Torah and Hebrew Bible in the early Hellenistic Era.\n  Chapter 1 describes the research methods this book employs and situates it within the history of scholarship on Greek comparative studies. Many previous studies have pointed out parallels between the Hebrew Bible and Greek literature and culture, but until quite recently Greek influences were assumed early and indirect. External evidence excludes neither a Hellenistic Era date nor substantial Greek literary influence on the biblical text. This suggests that Greek written traditions should be taken into account when seeking legal antecedents to the biblical law collections.\nChapter 4 performs a similar comparative study on the law collections as a whole. It is shown that the biblical law collections correspond to Greek rather than Ancient Near Eastern law collections with respect to sources, purpose, framing structure, divine promulgation, public recitation, ratification, educational utility and prescriptive force. \nChapter 5 discusses the integration of legal content with narrative found in both the Pentateuch and Greek writings, but not in the Ancient Near East. Discussions of constitutions and laws appeared in Greek historical narratives, panegyrics, origin and foundation stories, ethnographies, biographies, constitutional histories and philosophical dialogues. The story of Moses closely conforms to the Greek foundation story, in which the expedition leader also created the new colony’s constitution and laws. The changes from patriarchy to constitutional democracy to monarchy and tyranny appear to echo themes in Greek constitutional histories.\nChapter 2 examines influences from Athens and from Plato’s Laws on governmental institutions in the Pentateuch, such as: the genre of constitutional law, unknown in the Ancient Near East; similar citizenship requirements and enrollment procedures; military organization into ten or twelve civic tribes, brotherhoods, clans and households; land distribution by allotment into tribal territories; identical function of kinship groups in inheritance, levirate marriage, and blood vengeance; deliberative bodies with comparable executive and judicial responsibilities; similar civil and religious magistrates; and similar procedures for the citizen selection, scrutiny and audit of magistrates.\nChapter 3 compares Ancient Near Eastern and Greek influences on Pentateuchal laws, including laws on homicide, assault, theft, marriage, inheritance, sexual offenses, slavery, economic relief, livestock, property crimes, commerce, the military, magic, treason, religion, and ethics.  While some Pentateuchal laws derive from Old Babylonian and Assyrian collections, many have striking parallels with Greek and Athenian laws, and especially with Plato’s Laws. These include the prosecution and execution of dangerous animals; slaying a night thief; exile for unintentional homicide; blood avengers; sacrilege as political subversion; military exemptions; commandments on ethics, and others.\nChapter 6 argues that the Pentateuch was written by Jews and Samaritans invited to Alexandria by Ptolemy II, and additional books later at Jerusalem, without Samaritan participation. The reinvention of the Jewish nation as a theocracy closely conformed to the government in Plato’s Laws. The Hebrew Bible was an ethical national literature written to promote the new set of laws in accordance with the detailed instructions found in Plato’s Laws. Plato’s strategies for convincing the citizens their laws were ancient and divine appear to have worked brilliantly in Hellenistic Judea, where the biblical laws and literature of ca. 270 BC were soon enshrined as the ancient ancestral texts of the Jews, a perception that has continued virtually unchallenged down into modern times.\n\n#gnosticinformant #platonism #hebrewbible",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nMimesis criticism is a method of interpreting texts in relation to their literary or cultural models. Mimesis, or imitation (imitatio), was a widely used rhetorical tool in antiquity up until the 18th century's romantic emphasis on originality. Mimesis criticism looks to identify intertextual relationships between two texts that go beyond simple echoes, allusions, citations, or redactions. The effects of imitation are usually manifested in the later text by means of distinct characterization, motifs, and/or plot structure.\n\nAs a critical method, mimesis criticism has been pioneered by Dennis MacDonald, especially in relation to New Testament and other early Christian narratives imitating the \"canonical\" works of Classical Greek literature.\nGreek rhetorician Aristotle (4th century b.c.e.) discusses the rhetorical technique of mimesis or imitation; what Aristotle describes, however, is the author's imitation of nature, not earlier literary or cultural models.\nPhilodemus of Gadara (1st century b.c.e.), an Epicurean philosopher and poet and one of Virgil's teachers, affirms that writers of prose histories and fictions used literary models. He writes (rhetorically) in book five of On Poetry, \"Who would claim that the writing of prose is not reliant on the Homeric poems?\" (5.30.36-31.)\nA Greek historian and rhetorician from the late first century b.c.e./early first century c.e., Dionysius of Halicarnassus represents a change from the Aristotelian rhetorical notion of mimesis, from imitation of nature's to imitation of literature. His most important work in this respect, On Mimesissurvives only in fragments. Apparently, most of this work concerned the proper selection of literary models.\nRoman rhetorician M. Fabius Quintilianus published his twelve-volume Institutio oratoria around 95 c.e. In book 10, Quintilian - who was well-read with respect to both Greek and Latin rhetoricians, including Dionysius - gives advice to teachers who are instructing students in oration. He tells them that, by the time students begin composition, they should be so well-versed in exemplary models that are able to imitate them without physically consulting them (10.1.5). Quintilian writes,\n\nFor in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them. (10.1.15; Butler, LCL)\n\nHe also advises that students constantly reread the exemplary models (10.1.19), not only in sections but all the way through (10.1.20), so that they might be empowered to imitate these models with more craft and subtlety.\n\nOf course, the selection of one's literary model is of the utmost importance. In Quintilian's opinion, one could find no better model than Homer, \"for he has given us a model and an inspiration for very department of eloquence\" (10.1.46; Butler, LCL). When it comes to the act of imitation itself, he writes,\n\nThere can be no doubt that in art no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success. And it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others. It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of letters that they may learn to write, and that musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and peasants the principles of agriculture which have been proved in practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we may note that the elementary study of every branch of learning is directed by reference to some definite standard that is placed before the learner. (10.2.1-2; Butler, LCL)\n\nFurthermore, students are encouraged to improve upon their chosen models (10.2.12). One way for students to accomplish this task, Quintilian says, is to imitate several models in eclectic fashion: \"We shall do well to keep a number of different excellences before our eyes, so that different qualities from different authors may impose themselves on our minds, to be adopted for use in the place that becomes them best\" (10.2.26; Butler, LCL). On this point, Quintilian was at odds with Cicero, who felt it best for authors to imitate a single author.\n\nIn order to circumvent the capriciousness of subjectivity, MacDonald suggests six criteria for determining whether a claim for a mimetic connection between texts is reasonable: accessibility, analogy, density, order, distinctive traits, and interpretability. The first two criteria concern the status of the text used as a model (\"ante-text\"); the final four concern the later text that may have used the antetext.\n\n#christianity #shortsviral #shorts",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nElgabalus was Roman emperor from 218 to 222 CE. Having failed to keep many of his promises to the army, Roman Emperor Macrinus (217 – 218 CE) was becoming increasingly unpopular, and it would only take a little lie from a young boy's mother to change everything. On May 16, 218 CE a fourteen-year-old teenager was sneaked into the camp of the Third Gallic Legion in Syria and proclaimed the new imperial ruler. Shortly afterwards, Macrinus was dead. Although the new emperor would change his name to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, history would know him as Elagabalus.\n\nVarius Avitus Bassianus (Elagabalus) was born in c. 204 CE (exact date unknown) at Emesa in Syria to Sextus Varius Marcellus, a former senator under Emperor Caracalla, and Julia Soaemis, niece of Septimius Severus's second wife Julia Domna. At the time he assumed the title and throne, Elagabalus was the hereditary high priest at the Temple of the Sun for the Syrian sun-god Elagabal. Later, his extreme dedication to his religion would contribute to his demise.\n\nAccording to most sources, Macrinus had been instrumental in Caracalla's assassination. Because he feared her closeness to many in the army remaining loyal to the slain emperor, Macrinus commanded that Julia Domna, Caracalla's mother, leave Antioch. After her death - she had starved herself rather than leave the city - her sister Julia Maesa and two nieces, Julia Soaemis and Julia Mamaea, swore revenge. On May 16, 218 CE the young Elagabalus was smuggled into the Third Legion's camp by the Roman commander Comazon and declared emperor. His mother's  wealth and the young man's remarkable resemblance to Caracalla was enough to convince everyone that he was not the son of Varius Marcellus but the illegitimate son of Caracalla, or that is what his mother hoped they would believe.\n\nOn June 8, 218 CE, Macrinus and his forces were defeated by the Roman commander Gannys outside Antioch. The fallen emperor's failed attempt to cross the Bosporus at Cappadocia and escape to Rome would bring about his (and his nine-year-old son's) death. Macrinus's death and the claim that Elagabalus was actually Caracalla's son would be enough for the Roman Senate to accept him as the new emperor - the youngest to ever sit on the throne; official recognition would not come until his arrival in Rome. However, instead of leaving immediately, the new emperor, his mother and grandmother would winter at Nicomedia before arriving in Rome in the autumn of 219 CE. Unfortunately for the man who had defeated Macrinus, Gannys would not get to see his young protégé seated on the throne. By some accounts he had been not only a protector but a father-figure to Elagabalus whilst others claim he was either a eunuch or Julia Soaemis' lover. Whatever his relationship to the family may have been, his closeness to the young emperor meant that he remained a threat to a controlling mother and grandmother, and this threat led to his death.\n\nUpon his arrival in Rome and despite his youth, Elagabalus was officially recognized by the Senate as emperor - they had hoped for economic and political stability after the chaotic reigns of Caracalla and Macrinus. Controversy, however, would soon rear its ugly head; something that would not only anger the Senate but also shock much of the populace, especially the Christians and Jews. As a high priest Elagabalus made plans to replace the old, traditional religion of Rome with that of his own - the worship of Elagabal. This Syrian god was even to replace the supreme god of Roman mythology - Jupiter.\n\nTo cement his intentions Elagabalus had a large, black conical-shaped stone (possibly a meteorite) brought from Syria - a cult symbol of his religion - and installed on the Palatine Hill. A new temple, the Elagabalium, was built to honor Elagabal. In his Roman History Cassius Dio, who called the emperor the “False Antoninus,” wrote,\n\nThe offense consisted, not in his introducing a foreign god into Rome or in his exalting in very strange ways, but in his placing him even before Jupiter himself and causing himself to be voted his priest…. Furthermore, he was frequently seen even in public clad in the barbaric dress which the Syrian priests use, and this had as much to do as anything with his receiving the nickname of 'The Assyrian.'\n\nUpon Elagabalus' arrival in Rome, many of those loyal to Emperor Macrinus were executed. And, while many in the Senate were left alone, other high ranking imperial officers were dismissed and replaced by unqualified “henchmen” from Syria. Of course, the day-to-day activities of government were ignored by the young ruler and left to others, namely, his mother and grandmother. Both were granted the title of Augusta and even given permission to attend sessions of the Senate. \n\n#romanempire #elagabalus #heliogabalus",

Its proposed features have been derived by linguistic reconstruction from documented Indo-European languages. No direct record of Proto-Indo-European exists. \n\nFar more work has gone into reconstructing PIE than any other proto-language, and it is the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. The majority of linguistic work during the 19th century was devoted to the reconstruction of PIE or its daughter languages, and many of the modern techniques of linguistic reconstruction (such as the comparative method) were developed as a result.[citation needed]\n\nPIE is hypothesized to have been spoken as a single language from 4500 BC to 2500 BC[3] during the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age, though estimates vary by more than a thousand years. According to the prevailing Kurgan hypothesis, the original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have been in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of eastern Europe. The linguistic reconstruction of PIE has provided insight into the pastoral culture and patriarchal religion of its speakers. \n\nAs speakers of Proto-Indo-European became isolated from each other through the Indo-European migrations, the regional dialects of Proto-Indo-European spoken by the various groups diverged, as each dialect underwent shifts in pronunciation (the Indo-European sound laws), morphology, and vocabulary. Over many centuries, these dialects transformed into the known ancient Indo-European languages. From there, further linguistic divergence led to the evolution of their current descendants, the modern Indo-European languages. Today, the descendant languages of PIE with the most native speakers are Spanish, English, Portuguese, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Bengali, Russian, Punjabi, German, Persian, French, Marathi, Italian, and Gujarati.\n\nPIE is believed to have had an elaborate system of morphology that included inflectional suffixes (analogous to English child, child's, children, children's) as well as ablaut (vowel alterations, as preserved in English sing, sang, sung, song) and accent. PIE nominals and pronouns had a complex system of declension, and verbs similarly had a complex system of conjugation. The PIE phonology, particles, numerals, and copula are also well-reconstructed.\n\nAsterisks are used as a conventional mark of reconstructed words, such as *wódr̥, *ḱwṓ, or *tréyes; these forms are the reconstructed ancestors of the modern English words water, hound, and three, respectively.\n\nDevelopment of the hypothesis\nNo direct evidence of PIE exists; scholars have reconstructed PIE from its present-day descendants using the comparative method. For example, compare the pairs of words in Italian and English: piede and foot, padre and father, pesce and fish. Since there is a consistent correspondence of the initial consonants that emerges far too frequently to be coincidental, one can infer that these languages stem from a common parent language.  Detailed analysis suggests a system of sound laws to describe the phonetic and phonological changes from the hypothetical ancestral words to the modern ones. These laws have become so detailed and reliable as to support the Neogrammarian rule: the Indo-European sound laws apply without exception.\n\nIn 1818, Rasmus Christian Rask elaborated the set of correspondences in his prize essay Undersøgelse om det gamle Nordiske eller Islandske Sprogs Oprindelse ('Investigation of the Origin of the Old Norse or Icelandic Language'), where he argued that Old Norse was related to the Germanic languages, and had even suggested a relation to the Baltic, Slavic, Greek, Latin and Romance languages. In 1816, Franz Bopp published On the System of Conjugation in Sanskrit, in which he investigated the common origin of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. In 1833, he began publishing the Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavic, Gothic, and German. \n\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #polymath #language",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe story of Dhu al-Qarnayn (in Arabic ذو القرنين, literally \"The Two-Horned One\"; also transliterated as Zul-Qarnain or Zulqarnain), is mentioned in Surah al-Kahf of the Quran. \n\nIt has long been recognised in modern scholarship that the story of Dhu al-Qarnayn has strong similarities with the Syriac Legend of Alexander the Great. According to this legend, Alexander travelled to the ends of the world then built a wall in the Caucasus mountains to keep Gog and Magog out of civilized lands (the latter element is found several centuries earlier in Flavius Josephus). Several argue that the form of this narrative in the Syriac Alexander Legend (known as the Neṣḥānā) dates to between 629 and 636 CE and so is not the source for the Qur'anic narrative  based on the view held by many Western  and Muslim  scholars that Surah 18 belongs to the second Meccan Period (615–619). The Syriac Legend of Alexander has however received a range of dates by different scholars, from a latest date of 630  (close to Muhammad's death) to an earlier version inferred to have existed in the 6th century CE. Sidney Griffith argues that the simple storyline found in the Syriac Alexander Legend (and the slightly later metrical homily or Alexander poem) \"would most likely have been current orally well before the composition of either of the Syriac texts in writing\" and it is possible that it was this orally circulating version of the account which was recollected in the Islamic milieu.  The majority of modern researchers of the Qur'an as well as Islamic commentators identify Dhu al-Qarnayn as Alexander the Great.\n\nAlexander the Great was an immensely popular figure in the classical and post-classical cultures of the Mediterranean and Middle East. Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the Alexander romance and some recensions feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to Paradise, journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the Land of Darkness in search of the Water of Life (Fountain of Youth).\n\nThe earliest Greek manuscripts of the Alexander romance, as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at Alexandria in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages.  As the Alexander romance persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighbouring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of satire, representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favour to an unrighteous ruler? This theological need, plus acculturation to Hellenism, led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish ethnocentrism. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a righteous gentile or even a believing monotheist.\n\nThe Christianized peoples of the Near East, inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the Alexander romance, further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a saint. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander \"the Believing King\", implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the Alexander romance were combined with Biblical legends such as Gog and Magog.\n\nDuring the period of history during which the Alexander romance was written, little was known about the true historical Alexander the Great as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends. It was not until the Renaissance (1300–1600 AD) that the true history of Alexander III was rediscovered:\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #alexanderthegreat #islam",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French dragon,  meaning \"huge serpent, dragon\", from Ancient Greek δράκων, drákōn (genitive δράκοντος, drákontos) \"serpent, giant seafish\".  The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological.[6] The Greek word δράκων is most likely derived from the Greek verb δέρκομαι (dérkomai) meaning \"I see\", the aorist form of which is ἔδρακον (édrakon). This is thought to have referred to something with a \"deadly glance,\"  or unusually bright  or \"sharp\"  eyes, or because a snake's eyes appear to be always open; each eye actually sees through a big transparent scale in its eyelids, which are permanently shut. The Greek word probably derives from an Indo-European base *derḱ- meaning \"to see\"; the Sanskrit root दृश् (dr̥ś-) also means \"to see\".\n\nDraconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe  and the earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature. Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mušḫuššu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology; Vṛtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand'Goule in the Poitou region in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern, and Kulshedra in Albanian Mythology and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology; Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon from Beowulf.\n\ndragon, in the mythologies, legends, and folktales of various cultures, a large lizard- or serpent-like creature, conceived in some traditions as evil and in others as beneficent. In medieval Europe, dragons were usually depicted with wings and a barbed tail and as breathing fire. In Greece the word drakōn, from which the English word was derived, was used originally for any large serpent , and the dragon of mythology, whatever shape it later assumed, remained essentially a snake.\n\nIn general, in the Middle Eastern world, where snakes are large and deadly, the serpent or dragon was symbolic of the principle of evil. Thus, the Egyptian god Apepi, for example, was the great serpent of the world of darkness. But the Greeks and Romans, though accepting the Middle Eastern idea of the serpent as an evil power, also at times conceived the drakontes as beneficent—sharp-eyed dwellers in the inner parts of Earth. On the whole, however, the evil reputation of dragons was the stronger, and in Europe it outlived the other. Christianity confused the ancient benevolent and malevolent serpent deities in a common condemnation. In Christian art the dragon came to be symbolic of sin and paganism and, as such, was depicted prostrate beneath the heels of saints and martyrs.\n\nThe dragon’s form varied from the earliest times. The Chaldean dragon Tiamat had four legs, a scaly body, and wings, whereas the biblical dragon of Revelation, “the old serpent,” was many-headed like the Greek Hydra. Because they not only possessed both protective and terror-inspiring qualities but also had decorative effigies, dragons were early used as warlike emblems, as indicated in the story of King Agamemnon (from Homer’s Iliad), who had on his shield a blue three-headed snake, and in the practice among Norse warriors of painting dragons on their shields and carving dragons’ heads on the prows of their ships.\n\nIn East Asian mythologies the dragon retains its prestige and is conceived as a beneficent creature. The Chinese dragon, lung, represents yang, the principle of heaven, activity, and maleness in the yinyang of Chinese cosmology. From ancient times it was the emblem of the imperial family, and until the founding of the republic (1911) the dragon adorned the Chinese flag. The dragon came to Japan with much of the rest of Chinese culture, and there (as ryū or tatsu) it became capable of changing its size at will, even to the point of becoming invisible. Both Chinese and Japanese dragons, though regarded as powers of the air, are usually wingless. They are among the deified forces of nature in Daoism. Dragons also figure in the ancient mythologies of other Asian cultures, including those of Korea, India, and Vietnam.\n\nThe term dragon has no zoological meaning, but it has been applied in the Latin generic name Draco to a number of species of small lizards found in the Indo-Malayan region. The name is also popularly applied to the giant monitor, Varanus komodoensis, discovered on Komodo Island and a few neighbouring islands of the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia.\n\n#houseofthedragon  #shortsviral #shorts",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nJulian the Apostate (born AD 331/332, Constantinople—died June 26/27, 363, Ctesiphon, Mesopotamia), Roman emperor from AD 361 to 363, nephew of Constantine the Great, and noted scholar and military leader who was proclaimed emperor by his troops. A persistent enemy of Christianity, he publicly announced his conversion to paganism in 361, thus acquiring the epithet “the Apostate.”\n\nJulian was a younger son of Julius Constantius, the half brother of Constantine I (the Great), and his second wife, Basilina. In 337, when Julian was five, his cousin (the third son of Constantine I), also called Constantius, became emperor in the East as Constantius II and in 350, with the death of his brother Constans I, sole legitimate emperor (though there were two usurpers who were not overthrown until 353). The army, determined to have none but Constantine I’s sons as his successors, murdered the other possible aspirants. Constantius II had had Julian’s father killed in or just after 337, and an elder brother of Julian was killed in 341. Basilina had died soon after the birth of Julian, who was thus early left an orphan. With his surviving half brother, Gallus, seven years his senior, he was brought up in obscurity, first by Eusebius, Arian bishop of Nicomedia in Bithynia, and later at the remote estate of Macellum in Cappadocia. By the patronage of Eusebia, wife of Constantius II, Julian, at age 19, was allowed to continue his education, first at Como and later in Greece. In 351 he converted to the pagan Neoplatonism, recently “reformed” by Iamblichus, and was initiated into theurgy by Maximus of Ephesus.\n\nHis physical appearance is described thus by his contemporary and comrade-in-arms, Ammianus Marcellinus:\n\nHe was of medium stature, his hair was soft, as if it had been combed, his beard rough and pointed. His eyes were fine and flashing, an indication of the nimbleness of his mind. He had handsome eyebrows, a straight nose, rather a large mouth with a drooping lower lip. His neck was thick and slightly bent, his shoulders broad and big. From top to toe he was well-knit, and so was strong and a good runner.\n\nHis statue in the Louvre generally confirms this description, showing him as a stocky, rather diffident-looking philosopher.\n\nJulian’s freedom as a student had a powerful influence on him and ensured that for the first time in a century the future emperor would be a man of culture. He studied at Pergamum, at Ephesus, and later at Athens. He adopted the cult of the Unconquered Sun.\n\nThat his literary talent was considerable is demonstrated in his surviving works, most of which illustrate his deep love of Hellenic culture. Julian had been baptized and raised as a Christian, but, although he outwardly conformed until he was supreme, Christianity in its official guise meant to him the religion of those who had murdered his father, his brother, and many of his relations and, as such, was hardly likely to commend itself to him. He found far more solace in his philosophic speculations. This reaction has sometimes been defended as natural but eccentric. Natural it certainly was, but it is a misinterpretation of the age to imagine that Julian was alone in preferring Hellenism to Christianity. Society, and particularly the educated society in which Julian was at home, was in fact still largely if not predominantly pagan. Even bishops were proud of their Greek culture; no one was proud of the exotic degeneracy and extravagance of the court of Constantius. It is not surprising that Julian’s austerity, chastity, and enthusiasm for the heritage of Greece found a sympathetic response among many of his cousin’s subjects.\n\nHis project to rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was designed rather to insult the Christians than to please the Jews, who, for long accustomed to the worship of the synagogue, would have found the revival of animal sacrifice acutely embarrassing. The plan was dropped when it was reported (as it was on both an earlier and a later occasion) that “balls of fire” had issued from the old foundations and scared away the workmen. Christian cities were penalized, and churches were burned in Damascus and Beirut. Bishops, including the great Athanasius, were banished. One was horribly tortured. Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god associated with nature, wine, and ecstasy, was installed in the Christian basilicas of Emesa (modern Ḥimṣ, Syria) and Epiphaneia (modern Ḥamāh, Syria). \nJulian’s religious policy had no lasting effect. It had shown that paganism, as a religion, was doomed. It is perhaps sad, in retrospect, that the odium of proving it should rest on Julian, who with a little less venom and more tact might have been remembered for his many virtues rather than for his two fatal blunders.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #romanempire #christianity",

Medea figures in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, appearing in Hesiod's Theogony around 700 BCE,[1] but best known from Euripides's tragedy Medea and Apollonius of Rhodes's epic Argonautica. Medea is known in most stories as a sorceress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess Hecate.\n\nMedea plays the archetypal role of helper-maiden, aiding Jason in his search for the Golden Fleece by using her magic to save his life out of love. Once he finished his quest, she abandons her native home of Colchis, and flees westwards with Jason, where they eventually settle in Corinth and get married. Euripides's 5th-century BCE tragedy Medea, depicts the ending of her union with Jason, when after ten years of marriage, Jason abandons her to wed King Creon's daughter Creusa. Medea and her sons by Jason are to be banished from Corinth. In revenge, she murders Creusa with poisoned gifts. Later, she murders her own sons by Jason before fleeing for Athens, where she eventually marries king Aegeus.\n\nWhat happens afterwards varies according to several accounts. Herodotus in his Histories mentions that she ended up leaving Athens and settling in the Iranian plateau among the Aryans, who subsequently changed their name to the Medes.\n\nMedea in a fresco from Herculaneum.\nMedea is a direct descendant of the sun god Helios (son of the Titan Hyperion) through her father King Aeëtes of Colchis. According to Hesiod (Theogony 956–962), Helios and the Oceanid Perseis produced two children, Circe and Aeetes.[4] Aeëtes then married the Oceanid Idyia and Medea was their child. From here, Medea's family tree becomes a little more complicated and disputed. By some accounts, Aeëtes and Idyia only had two daughters, Medea and Chalciope [de] (or Chalkiope). There was one son, Apsyrtus (or Apsyrtos), who was the son of Aeëtes through Asterodea. This would make him a half-brother to Medea herself. According to others, Idyia gave birth to Medea and Apsyrtus while Asterodea gave birth to Chalciope. Even with the two differing accounts, it is known that Medea has a sister and a brother. As she becomes older, Medea marries Jason and together they have children. The number and names of their children are questioned by scholars. Depending on the account, it is two to fourteen children. In his play, Medea, Euripides mentions two unnamed sons.[5] According to other accounts, her children were \"Mermerus, Pheres or Thessalus, Alcimenes and Tisander, and according to others, she had seven sons and seven daughters, while others mention only two children, Medus (some call him Polyxenus) and Eriopis, or one son Argos.\".[6] No matter the number of children, Medea eventually leaves Jason in Corinth, and marries the King of Athens \n\nMedea is a gene from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that was one of the first two Smad genes discovered. For both genes, the maternal effect lethality was the basis for selection of their names. Medea was named for the mythological Greek Medea, who killed her progeny fathered by Jason.(Aegeus) and bears him a son. While with him, it is questioned if that was when she had her son Medeius, who goes on to become the ancestor of the Medes by conquering their lands.\n\nMultiple scholars have discussed Medea's use as a \"helper maiden\" to Jason's quest. A helper maid is typically a young woman who helps on a hero's quest, usually out of love. Instead of being the center of the story, like she is in Euripides's Medea, this version of Medea is reduced to a supporting role. Her main purpose is to help the hero with his quest. Jason would never have been successful on his quest without Medea's help, something that is pointed out and referenced many times in ancient texts and contemporary scholarly work.\nUnderstanding Medea's genealogy helps define her divinity. By some accounts, like the Argonautica, she is depicted as a young, mortal woman who is directly influenced by the Greek gods Hera and Aphrodite.[7] While she possesses magical abilities, she is still a mortal with divine ancestry. Other accounts, like Euripides's play Medea, focus on her mortality. Hesiod's Theogony places her marriage to Jason on the list of marriages between mortals and divine, suggesting that she is predominantly divine.[8] She also has connections with Hecate,[9] the goddess of magic, which could be one of the main sources from which she draws her magical ties.",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nProfessor M. David Litwa:\n@m.davidlitwa \nhttps://www.patreon.com/mdavidlitwa/posts\nGet the Book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Evil-Creator-Origins-Early-Christian/dp/0197566421\nMystery Cults Course:\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nIn the Platonic, Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic, and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, the demiurge  is an artisan-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. The Gnostics adopted the term demiurge. Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the Creator figure in the monotheistic sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.\n\nThe word demiurge is an English word derived from demiurgus, a Latinised form of the Greek δημιουργός or dēmiurgós. It was originally a common noun meaning \"craftsman\" or \"artisan\", but gradually came to mean \"producer\", and eventually \"creator\". The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from Plato's Timaeus, written c. 360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic (c. 310–90 BC) and Middle Platonic (c. 90 BC–AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the Ideas, but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself \"the One\". In the arch-dualist ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is malevolent, as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of Valentinus, the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.\n\nThe first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (Τὸ Ἕν, 'To Hen'), the source, or the Monad. This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad emanated the demiurge or Nous (consciousness) from its \"indeterminate\" vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection.  This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the \"Demiurge\" or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the nonsentient force or dynamis, also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is energeia emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called nous, Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. Plotinus also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in The Enneads[9] which more correctly is to express the concept of idealism or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the \"mind\" or nous (c.f. pantheism).\n\nThe figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable “One,” or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of henosis.  Iamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (nous), while among \"the many\" that follow it there is a second, super-existent \"One\" that is the producer of intellect or soul (psyche).\n\nThe \"One\" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a triad is formed of the intelligible nous, the intellective nous, and the psyche in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of Aristotle's actus and potentia (actuality and potentiality) of the unmoved mover and Plato's Demiurge.\n\nGnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God or Supreme Being and the demiurgic \"creator\" of the material, commonly identified as Yahweh, the God of the Hebrew Bible. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the Supreme Being: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine in materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to) the problem of evil.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #yahweh",

    "description": "Original Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6sCTk871wQ\n\nDr. Jennifer Bird:\n @JenniferBirdPhD \n\n#shorts  #shortsviral  #jesus  \n\nThe phrase \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" (ὁ μαθητὴς ὃν ἠγάπα ὁ Ἰησοῦς, ho mathētēs hon ēgapā ho Iēsous) or, in John 20:2; \"the other disciple whom Jesus loved\" (τὸν ἄλλον μαθητὴν ὃν ἐφίλει ὁ Ἰησοῦς, ton allon mathētēn hon ephilei ho Iēsous), is used six times in the Gospel of John, but in no other New Testament accounts of Jesus. John 21:24states that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of this disciple.\n\nSince the end of the first century, the beloved disciple has been commonly identified with John the Evangelist.  Scholars have debated the authorship of Johannine literature (the Gospel of John, Epistles of John, and the Book of Revelation) since at least the third century, but especially since the Enlightenment. The authorship by John the Apostle is rejected by many modern scholars, but not entirely.  There is a consensus among Johannine scholars that the beloved disciple was a real historical person, but there is no consensus on who the beloved disciple was.\n\nThe disciple whom Jesus loved is referred to, specifically, six times in the Gospel of John:\n\nIt is this disciple who, while reclining beside Jesus at the Last Supper, asks Jesus who it is that will betray him, after being requested by Peter to do so. \nLater at the crucifixion, Jesus tells his mother, \"Woman, here is your son\", and to the beloved disciple he says, \"Here is your mother.\" \nWhen Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb, she runs to tell the beloved disciple and Peter. The two men rush to the empty tomb and the beloved disciple is the first to reach it. However, Peter is the first to enter. \nIn John 21,  the last chapter of the Gospel of John, the beloved disciple is one of seven fishermen involved in the miraculous catch of 153 fish.  \nAlso in the book's final chapter, after Jesus implies the manner in which Peter will die, Peter sees the beloved disciple following them and asks, \"What about him?\" Jesus answers, \"If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.\" \nAgain in the Gospel's last chapter, it states that the very book itself is based on the written testimony of the disciple whom Jesus loved. \nThe other Gospels do not mention anyone in parallel circumstances who could be directly linked to the beloved disciple. For example, in Luke 24:12,  Peter runs to the tomb. Matthew, Mark, and Luke do not mention any one of the 12 disciples having witnessed the crucifixion.\n\nJesus and John at the Last Supper, by Valentin de Boulogne\nThe closing words of the Gospel of John state explicitly concerning the beloved disciple that \"It is this disciple who testifies to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.\"\n\nNevertheless, while some modern academics continue to share the view of Augustine and Polycrates,  a growing number[citation needed] do not believe that John the Apostle wrote the Gospel of John or indeed any of the other New Testament works traditionally ascribed to him, making this linkage of a 'John' to the beloved disciple difficult to sustain.[4]\n\nSome scholars have additionally suggested a homoerotic interpretation of Jesus's relationship with the beloved disciple, although such a scriptural reading is disputed by others. Tilborg suggests that the portrait in the Gospel of John is \"positively attuned to the development of possibly homosexual behaviour\". However, he cautions that \"in the code such imaginary homosexual behaviour is not an expression of homosexuality.\" Meanwhile, theologian Ismo Dunderberg has also explored the issue and argues that the absence of accepted Greek terms for \"lover\" and \"beloved\" discounts an erotic reading. \n\nThe relationship between Jesus and John was certainly interpreted by some as being of a physical erotic nature as early as the 16th century (albeit in a heretical context) – documented, for example, in the trial for blasphemy of Christopher Marlowe, who was accused of claiming that \"St. John the Evangelist was bedfellow to Christ and leaned always in his bosom, that he used him as the sinners of Sodoma\". In accusing Marlowe of the \"sinful nature\" of homosexual acts, James I of England inevitably invited comparisons to his own erotic relationship with the Duke of Buckingham, which he also compared with that of the beloved disciple.  Finally, Francesco Calcagno, a friar of Venice faced trial and was executed in 1550 for claiming that \"St. John was Christ's catamite\". \n\nWayne Dynes also makes a link to the modern day where in 1970s New York a popular religious group was established called the \"Church of the Beloved Disciple\", with the intention of giving a positive reading of the relationship to support respect for same-sex love.",

    "title": "God is Dead",
    "description": "\"God is dead\" (also known as the death of God) is a statement made by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche's first use of this statement is his 1882 The Gay Science, where it appears three times.[note 1] The phrase also appears in Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\n\nThe meaning of this statement is that since, as Nietzsche says, \"the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable\", everything that was \"built upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it\", including \"the whole European morality\", is bound to \"collapse\". \n\nOther philosophers had previously discussed the concept, including Philipp Mainländer and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Proponents of the strongest form of the Death of God theology have used the phrase in a literal sense, meaning that the Christian God who had existed at one point has ceased to exist.\n\nBuddhist philosopher K. Satchidananda Murty wrote in The Realm of Between published by the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in 1973, that, coming across in a hymn of Martin Luther what Hegel described as \"the cruel words\", \"the harsh utterance\", namely, \"God is dead\", developed the theme of God's death according to whom, to one form of experience, God is dead. Murty continued that commenting on Kant's first Critique, Heinrich Heine who had purportedly influenced Nietzsche spoke of a dying God. Since Heine and Nietzsche the phrase Death of God became popular.\n\nContemporary historians believe that 19th-century German idealist philosophers, especially those associated with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, are responsible for removing the specifically Christian resonance of the phrase relating to the death of Jesus Christ and associating it with secular philosophical and sociological theories.debated, writes in his 1844 book The Ego and its Own that \"the work of the Enlightenment, the vanquishing of God: they did not notice that man has killed God in order to become now - 'sole God on high'\".\n\nAfter Buddha was dead people showed his shadow for centuries afterwards in a cave, — an immense frightful shadow. God is dead: but as the human race is constituted, there will perhaps be caves for millenniums yet, in which people will show his shadow. — And we — we have still to overcome his shadow!\n\nStill in The Gay Science, the expression is stated into the mouth of a \"madman\", in \"The Madman\", as follows:\n\nGod is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?\n\n— Nietzsche, The Gay Science, Section 125, tr. Walter Kaufmann\nIn the madman passage, the madman is described as running through a marketplace shouting, \"I seek God! I seek God!\" He arouses some amusement; no one takes him seriously. \"Maybe he took an ocean voyage? Lost his way like a little child? Maybe he's afraid of us (non-believers) and is hiding?\" – much laughter. Frustrated, the madman smashes his lantern on the ground, crying out that \"God is dead, and we have killed him, you and I!\". \"But I have come too soon\", he immediately realizes, as his detractors of a minute before stare in astonishment: people cannot yet see that they have killed God. He goes on to say:\nThis prodigious event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time, the light of the stars requires time, deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars – and yet they have done it themselves.\n\n— trans. Walter Kaufmann, The Gay Science, sect. 125\nLastly, the \"The Meaning of our Cheerfulness\" section of the The Gay Science discusses what \"God is dead\" means (\"that the belief in the Christian God has become unworthy of belief\"), and the consequences of this fact. \n\nIn Thus Spoke Zarathustra, at the end of the section 2 of Zarathustra's prologue, after beginning his allegorical journey, Zarathustra encounters an aged ascetic who expresses misanthropy and love of God (a \"saint\"). Nietzsche writes:\n\n[Zarathustra] saluted the saint and said \"What should I have to give you! But let me go quickly that I take nothing from you!\" And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing as two boys laugh.\n\nBut when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: \"Could it be possible! This old saint has not heard in his forest that God is dead!\"\n\n— Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra\n\n#nietzsche #shorts #shortsviral",

    "description": "Link for Course:\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/unknown-jesus/\n\nProfessor Bart D. Ehrman:\nBart D. Ehrman is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He began his teaching career at Rutgers University, and joined the faculty in the Department of Religious Studies at UNC in 1988, where he has served as both the Director of Graduate Studies and the Chair of the Department.\n\nProfessor Ehrman completed his M.Div. and Ph.D. degrees at Princeton Seminary, where his 1985 doctoral dissertation was awarded magna cum laude. An expert on the New Testament and the history of Early Christianity, has written or edited thirty books, numerous scholarly articles, and dozens of book reviews. \n\nBart Ehrman on Bible Secrets\nIn addition to works of scholarship, Professor Ehrman has written several textbooks for undergraduate students and trade books for general audiences. Six of his books have been on the New York Times Bestseller list: Misquoting Jesus; God’s Problem; Jesus Interrupted; Forged; and How Jesus Became God. His books have been translated into twenty-seven languages.\n\nMark is at the same time the most brilliant AND most underrated Gospel of the New Testament, with a sophisticated understanding of Jesus that is so nuanced most readers simply never see it!\n\nDid Mark have first-hand knowledge of Jesus’ life or was he just makin’ stuff up?\nExplore the answer to this and other controversial questions in this 8-lecture online course where Dr. Bart Ehrman unpacks The Gospel of Mark showing how its narrative contains clever subtleties and numerous surprises that make it one of the most intriguing pieces of literature from the early years of Christianity.\nOther controversial questions covered in this 8-lecture course include:  \n\nWhy don’t most readers today recognize the highly unusual way Mark portrays Jesus and the meaning of his life?\n\nFor Mark, how can Jesus be the expected destroyer of God’s enemies and the king of the Jewish people, if he was himself rejected by them, captured, and publicly tortured to death? Isn’t that the opposite of the “Messiah”?\n\nWhy in Mark (unlike the other Gospels) does none of Jesus’ close relations realize who he really is? Not the Jewish leaders? Not those hearing his message? His neighbors? His companions? His closest disciples? His mother?\n\nDoes the Gospel of Mark portray Jesus as God?\n\nIs Mark’s account an accurate portrayal of what the historical Jesus himself said and did? Or is it a portrayal that shapes Jesus’ life and ministry according to Mark’s own theological understanding of Jesus? Could it be both?\n\nDid Mark have first-hand knowledge of Jesus’ life, or is most of his information second-, third-, or fourth-hand? Is he just makin’ stuff up?\n\nHow did later copyists of Mark’s Gospel change what he said to create a different story? Have any of these changes misled readers away from Mark’s original message?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is the oldest of the four canonical gospels and of the three synoptic Gospels. It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death, burial, and the discovery of his empty tomb. There is no miraculous birth or doctrine of divine pre-existence,  nor, in the original ending (Mark 16:1–8), any post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  It portrays Jesus as a teacher, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker. He refers to himself as the Son of Man. He is called the Son of God, but keeps his messianic nature secret; even his disciples fail to understand him.  All this is in keeping with Christian interpretation of prophecy, which is believed to foretell the fate of the messiah as suffering servant. The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the Resurrection of Jesus. \n\nMost scholars date Mark to c. 66–74 AD, either shortly before or after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. They reject the traditional ascription to Mark the Evangelist, the companion of the Apostle Peter – which probably arose from the desire of early Christians to link the work to an authoritative figure – and believe it to be the work of an author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.  It was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel, Matthew; the Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark. \n\nBuying this course gives you lifetime access so you can watch and learn whenever you like\n\nLIVE RECORDING OF THE COURSE WILL BE ON FEBRUARY 18-19\n\n#gnosticinformant #bartehrman #gospelofmark",

The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from invading barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. Climatic changes and both endemic and epidemic disease drove many of these immediate factors.  The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure. \n\nIn 376, unmanageable numbers of Goths and other non-Roman people, fleeing from the Huns, entered the Empire. In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died, leaving a collapsing field army, and the Empire, still plagued by Goths, divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons. Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers and, like the Goths, were not exterminated, expelled or subjugated. The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never effectively consolidated.\n\nBy 476, the position of Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power, and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. Barbarian kingdoms had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire. In 476, the Germanic barbarian king Odoacer deposed the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire in Italy, Romulus Augustulus, and the Senate sent the imperial insignia to the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno.\n\nWhile its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today, the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire, survived and, although lessened in strength, remained for centuries an effective power of the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nWhile the loss of political unity and military control is universally acknowledged, the Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as late antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople, also known as the conquest of Constantinople, was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. The city was captured on 29 May 1453[13][14] as part of the culmination of a 53-day siege which had begun on 6 April.\n\nThe attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed \"the Conqueror\"), while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. After conquering the city, Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople.\n\nThe conquest of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking the effective end of the last remains of the Roman Empire, a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had lasted nearly 1500 years. Among many modern historians, the fall of Constantinople is considered the end of the medieval period.[15][16] The city's fall also stood as a turning point in military history. Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. The Walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian Walls, were some of the most advanced defensive systems in the world at the time. These fortifications were overcome with the use of gunpowder, specifically in the form of large cannons and bombards, heralding a change in siege warfare. \n\n\n#fallofrome #romanhistory #romanempire",

Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe city of Rome is built on top of a labyrinth of quarries, tunnels, sewers, and catacombs. Hidden in this shadow city lurk many ancient frescoes that would otherwise have been destroyed by time and weather. In the catacombs of saints Marcellinus and Peter, among the thousands of burials, is one of the earliest narrative images of a passage from the Bible.Mark 5:25–34 tells the story of a woman who has been bleeding for 12 years. She comes to Jesus in a crowd and believes that just by touching His cloak she will be healed. She does, and she is, and Jesus tells her that it is her faith that has saved her. That scene is painted on the walls of the catacombs, which were started in the second or third century.\n\nWhen archaeologists dug into the Catacombs of Priscilla in Rome in the 19th century, they found it a ruin. Two hundred years earlier, the tombs had been ransacked on the orders of the papacy. Sarcophagi had been smashed and mosaics torn down.No one is entirely sure why this happened. The fragments left are historically valuable, but the paintings on the walls and ceilings, dating from the third century are even more valuable.The frescoes have proved to be controversial. Many of the paintings show women. Some seem to show women preaching, even in the role of priests. But tucked away in one corner of the tombs is perhaps the oldest image of the Christ child and Mary. Some dispute whether this is Mary and Jesus, but if it is, then it is centuries older than the next depiction of the mother of Jesus.\nThe Church father Tertullian described how the Romans blamed the Christians for all their troubles in the third century: “They think the Christians the cause of every public disaster, of every affliction with which the people are visited. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not rise or send its waters over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there is an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straight away the cry is, ‘Away with the Christians, to the lion!’ ”This explains why the Christians needed so many underground places to store the remains of their martyrs. The Catacombs of Callixtus were one such place. On the walls is a mural of Jesus as the Good Shepherd from the third century. Here, He is a simple shepherd carrying water and bearing a lamb on his shoulders—representing His care for the innocent and His own role as Lamb of God.\n\nOne of the best known stories from the New Testament is Jesus’s healing of the paralyzed man. The man’s friends are so desperate to get him to Jesus that they tear the roof off the house Jesus is in and lower him down inside on a bed. Seeing this, Jesus simply tells the man to “Get up, take your mat and go home.” The man picks up his bed and strolls away.Dating from around AD 230, this mural was discovered on the wall of a church in Syria. While we might read a cartoon left to right, here the image seems to have the story read right to left in pictures. The man begins on his bed in the right-hand side, Jesus commands him in the middle, and the man walks off with his bed on his back on the left.\n\nThe Hinton St. Mary Mosaic comes from Britain and once belonged to a prominent Roman family of the province. It once covered a dining room floor. The whole mosaic freely mixes Christian and Pagan imagery, as well as scenes of hunting. One portion shows the Greek hero Bellerophon riding the winged horse Pegasus.In the center is a beardless young man flanked by two pomegranates. Without the symbols behind him, it might be impossible to link Him with Jesus. Behind the man’s head are the Greek letters chi and rho, the first letters of Christ’s name in Greek and a common symbol for Him. The mosaic is thought to date from the early fourth century.\n\nIt perhaps says something about human nature that possibly our oldest image of Jesus is from a mocking piece of graffiti. The Alexamenos Graffito is also known as the graffito blasfemo, or blasphemous graffito, for reasons rapidly apparent. The best dating for the graffito is AD 200.Found carved in plaster in Rome, the image shows a man staring up at a crucified figure. A closer look at the figure on the cross reveals the head of a donkey Underneath is scrawled, in Greek, “Alexamenos worships God.”It must be remembered crucifixion was a punishment dealt out to the lowest of the low. Even showing that would be an insult. 1 Corinthians 1:23 has St. Paul telling them that “we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.” The donkey head was just to reinforce the image.\n\n#jesus #short #top10",

Allison Jr\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/jesus-quest/\n\nGospel of Mark Course:\nDr. James Tabor\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/firstgospel/\n\nJesus the Magician is a 1978 book by Morton Smith arguing that the historical Jesus was a magician who \"sprang from a Galilean strain of Semitic paganism\". The idea that Jesus was a magician did not originate with Morton Smith. It was previously voiced by the philosopher and critic Celsus (The True Word c. 200 CE) as we know from the rebuttal authored by the Christian apologist/scholar Origen: “It was by magic that he was able to do the miracles” (Contra Celsum 1.6).\n\nMagi, singular Magus, also called Wise Men, in Christian tradition, the noble pilgrims “from the East” who followed a miraculous guiding star to Bethlehem, where they paid homage to the infant Jesus as king of the Jews (Matthew 2:1–12). Christian theological tradition has always stressed that Gentiles as well as Jews came to worship Jesus—an event celebrated in the Eastern church at Christmas and in the West at Epiphany (January 6). Eastern tradition sets the number of Magi at 12, but Western tradition sets their number at three, probably based on the three gifts of “gold, frankincense, and myrrh” (Matthew 2:11) presented to the infant.\nThe Gospel According to Matthew relates how at Jerusalem the Magi attracted the interest of King Herod I of Judaea by announcing Jesus’ birth: “Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage” (Matthew 2:2). Having already learned the place of Jesus’ birth from the priests and scribes, Herod extracted from the Magi the exact date on which the star heralding the birth appeared as confirmation of the biblical prophecy. He then sent them to see the infant Jesus, requesting that they disclose upon their return his exact location. They continued on to Bethlehem, where they worshipped Jesus and offered him gifts. Warned in a dream not to return to Herod, “they left for their own country by another road” (Matthew 2:12). The ensuing massacre of young male children in Bethlehem by Herod in an attempt to kill the infant Jesus is commemorated on the Feast of the Holy Innocents.\nSubsequent traditions embellished the narrative. As early as the 3rd century they were considered to be kings, probably interpreted as the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalms 72:11 (“May all kings fall down before him”). In about the 8th century the names of three Magi—Bithisarea, Melichior, and Gathaspa—appear in a chronicle known as the Excerpta latina barbari. They have become known most commonly as Balthasar, Melchior, and Gaspar (or Casper). According to Western church tradition, Balthasar is often represented as a king of Arabia or sometimes Ethiopia, Melchior as a king of Persia, and Gaspar as a king of India.\n\nThe three are often venerated as saints and martyrs, and their supposed relics were transferred from Constantinople (modern Istanbul), possibly in the late 5th century, to Milan and thence to Cologne Cathedral in the 12th century. Devotion to the Magi was especially fervent in the Middle Ages, and they are some of the patron saints of travelers.\n\nTheurgy describes the practice of rituals, sometimes seen as magical in nature, performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking the presence of one or more deities, especially with the goal of achieving henosis (uniting with the divine) and perfecting oneself.\n\nMagic, sometimes spelled magick, is an ancient praxis rooted in sacred rituals, spiritual divinations, and/or cultural lineage—with an intention to invoke, manipulate, or otherwise manifest supernatural forces, beings, or entities in the natural, incarnate world. It is a categorical yet often ambiguous term which has been used to refer to a wide variety of beliefs and practices, frequently considered separate from both religion and science. \n\nIn modern occultism and neopagan religions, many self-described magicians and witches regularly practice ritual magic;[11] defining magic as a technique for bringing about change in the physical world through the force of one's will. This definition was popularised by Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), an influential British occultist, and since that time other religions (e.g. Wicca and LaVeyan Satanism) and magical systems (e.g. chaos magick) have adopted it.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #jesus #christianity",

    "title": "Psychedelic Use in Ancient Religions | Dr. Ammon",
    "description": "Subscribe to Dr. Ammon :\n @ladybabylon666 \n\nEntheogens are psychoactive substances that induce alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, or behavior  for the purposes of engendering spiritual development or otherwise  in sacred contexts. Anthropological study has established that entheogens are used for religious, magical, shamanic, or spiritual purposes in many parts of the world. Entheogens have traditionally been used to supplement many diverse practices geared towards achieving transcendence, including divination, meditation, yoga, sensory deprivation, healings, asceticism, prayer, trance, rituals, chanting, imitation of sounds, hymns like peyote songs, drumming, and ecstatic dance. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as those experienced in meditation,  near-death experiences and mystical experiences. The term is derived from two words of Ancient Greek, ἔνθεος and γενέσθαι . The adjective entheos translates to English as \"full of the god, inspired, possessed,\" and is the root of the English word \"enthusiasm.\" The Greeks used it as praise for poets and other artists. Genesthai means \"to come into being\". Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or \"spiritual\" manner. \n\nRuck  argued that the term hallucinogen was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and insanity. The term psychedelic was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words about psychosis and also because it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of the 1960s pop culture. In modern usage, entheogen may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with recreational use of the same drugs. The meanings of the term entheogen was formally defined by Ruck et al.:\n\nIn a strict sense, only those vision-producing drugs that can be shown to have figured in shamanic or religious rites would be designated entheogens, but in a looser sense, the term could also be applied to other drugs, both natural and artificial, that induce alterations of consciousness similar to those documented for ritual ingestion of traditional entheogens.\n\n— Ruck et al., 1979, Journal of Psychedelic Drugs \n\nDuring the nine days every year that the Pythia was to receive prophecies, she followed a ritual thought to purify her. In addition to fasting and drinking holy water, the Pythia bathed at the Castalian Spring. The priestess would then burn laurel leaves and barley meal in the temple as a sacrifice to Apollo.\n\nFrom ancient sources, we know that the Pythia entered a sacred room called the adyton. The oracle sat on a bronze tripod seat close to a crack in the stone floor of the room that released noxious gasses. Once seated, the oracle would inhale the vapors escaping from the spring that ran beneath the temple.\n\nWhen the Pythia inhaled the vapors, she entered into a trance-like state. According to Greek mythology, the vapors that the oracle inhaled came from the decomposing body of Python, who had been slain by Apollo. In reality, the fumes were caused by tectonic movement along the Delphic fault, which released hydrocarbons into the stream below.\n\nIt was during the trans-like state induced by the vapors, that the god Apollo communicated with her. The priests interpreted the prophecies or predictions and delivered the message from Apollo to the visitor. \n\nHow the oracle relayed the answers given to her from the god Apollo is contested. We rely on early works written by Plutarch for much of what we know about it.\n\nSome sources described the oracles’ prophecies as being spoken in dactylic hexameters. This means that the prediction would be spoken rhythmically. The verse would then be interpreted by the priests of Apollo and relayed to the person seeking the answer to a question. \n\nNumerous scholars have proposed that the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from the kykeon's functioning as an entheogen, or psychedelic agent.  The use of potions or philtres for magical or religious purposes was relatively common in Greece and the ancient world. The initiates, sensitized by their fast and prepared by preceding ceremonies , may have been propelled by the effects of a powerful psychoactive potion into revelatory mind states with profound spiritual and intellectual ramifications. In opposition to this idea, other pointedly skeptical scholars note the lack of any solid evidence and stress the collective rather than individual character of initiation into the Mysteries.  Indirect evidence in support of the entheogenic theory is that in 415 BC Athenian aristocrat Alcibiades was condemned partly because he took part in an \"Eleusinian mystery\" in a private house.\n\n#delphi #greekmythology #psychedelic",

And his fame spread into all of Syria, and they brought to him those who were ill, and Jesus cured them.\n\nReaders of the above quote have every reason to feel confused. Gospel of healing? And what’s with the rest of the text, which doesn’t quite agree with the canonical gospel attributed to Matthew? Indeed, this somewhat imprecise citation of Matthew 4:23–24 is not an excerpt from a Bible codex. The text was found inscribed on a piece of parchment excavated a hundred years ago at the site of ancient Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. Dating to the sixth or seventh century and measuring about 2 1/3 by 4 1/3 inches, the scrap—first published in 1911 (as P. Oxy. 8.1077)—is a Christian amulet \n\nProclus (c. 480): theurgy is \"a power higher than all human wisdom embracing the blessings of divination, the purifying powers of initiation and in a word all the operations of divine possession\" \nKeith Thomas: \"Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer, fasting and devotional preparation.\" \nPierre A. Riffard: \"Theurgy is a type of magic. It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke beneficent spirits in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them, for instance by forcing them to animate a statue, to inhabit a human being (such as a medium), or to disclose mysteries.\" \n\nIn late neoplatonism, the spiritual universe is regarded as a series of emanations from the One. From the One emanated the Divine Mind (Nous) and in turn from the Divine Mind emanated the World Soul (Psyche). Neoplatonists insisted that the One is absolutely transcendent and in the emanations nothing of the higher was lost or transmitted to the lower, which remained unchanged by the lower emanations.\n Therefore, his school resembles a school of meditation or contemplation.\n\nIamblichus, a student of Anatolius and Porphyry (the latter himself was a student of Plotinus), taught a more ritualized method of theurgy that involved invocation and religious, as well as magical, ritual.[6] Iamblichus believed theurgy was an imitation of the gods, and in his major work, On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians, he described theurgic observance as \"ritualized cosmogony\" that endowed embodied souls with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos.\n\nJulian favored ritual theurgy, with an emphasis on sacrifice and prayer. He was heavily influenced by Iamblichus' ideas. \n\nEsoteric Christianity accepts theurgy as a tradition that could greatly benefit a person. The main feat of Esoteric Christianity is to learn the mysteries of God (see Raziel) and to rise to higher consciousness in the understanding of God's relationship to individual consciousness. Theurgy, in the esoteric tradition, uses this knowledge to heighten one's own spiritual nature.  Some branches of Esoteric Christianity hold that if an Esoteric Christian, Rosicrucian, or Theosopher practices it they could potentially rise to the degree of Magus or Adept after a certain level of spiritual attainment. In a traditional and magical sense, theurgy is seen as the opposite of Goetia, even though many argue that they overlap. \n\nJust like their pagan neighbors, Jesus’s followers of the first Christian centuries would commonly resort to protection amulets to guard themselves from illness and any kind of harm. Although the Church authorities used to refute what they saw as a superstition and an abomination to the Christian faith, the pagan practice of wearing protection amulets survived well into the second half of the first millennium, with some clergy even participating.\n\nhttps://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/artifacts-and-the-bible/ancient-amulets-with-incipits/\n\n#christianity #religionforbreakfast #magic",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nGnosticism 'having knowledge') is a collection of religious ideas and systems which coalesced in the late 1st century AD among Jewish and early Christian sects. These various groups emphasized personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) above the orthodox teachings, traditions, and authority of religious institutions. Gnostic cosmogony generally presents a distinction between a supreme, hidden God and a malevolent lesser divinity (sometimes associated with the Yahweh of the Old Testament)  who is responsible for creating the material universe.   \nGnostic writings flourished among certain Christian groups in the Mediterranean world around the second century, when the Fathers of the early Church denounced them as heresy.  Efforts to destroy these texts proved largely successful, resulting in the survival of very little writing by Gnostic theologians.  Nonetheless, early Gnostic teachers such as Valentinus saw their beliefs as aligned with Christianity. In the Gnostic Christian tradition, Christ is seen as a divine being which has taken human form in order to lead humanity back to recognition of its own divine nature. However, Gnosticism is not a single standardized system, and the emphasis on direct experience allows for a wide variety of teachings, including distinct currents such as Valentinianism and Sethianism. In the Persian Empire, Gnostic ideas spread as far as China via the related movement Manichaeism, while Mandaeism, which is one of the only two surviving Gnostic religions from antiquity, is found in Iraq, Iran and diaspora communities. Jorunn Buckley posits that the early Mandaeans may have been among the first to formulate what would go on to become Gnosticism within the early Jesus movement. \nGnosis refers to knowledge based on personal experience or perception. In a religious context, gnosis is mystical or esoteric knowledge based on direct participation with the divine. In most Gnostic systems, the sufficient cause of salvation is this \"knowledge of\" (\"acquaintance with\") the divine. It is an inward \"knowing\", comparable to that encouraged by Plotinus (neoplatonism), and differs from proto-orthodox Christian views. Gnostics are \"those who are oriented toward knowledge and understanding – or perception and learning – as a particular modality for living\".  The usual meaning of gnostikos in Classical Greek texts is \"learned\" or \"intellectual\", such as used by Plato in the comparison of \"practical\" (praktikos) and \"intellectual\" (gnostikos).   Plato's use of \"learned\" is fairly typical of Classical texts. \n\nBy the Hellenistic period, it began also to be associated with Greco-Roman mysteries, becoming synonymous with the Greek term musterion. The adjective is not used in the New Testament, but Clement of Alexandria speaks of the \"learned\" (gnostikos) Christian in complimentary terms.  The use of gnostikos in relation to heresy originates with interpreters of Irenaeus. Some scholars  consider that Irenaeus sometimes uses gnostikos to simply mean \"intellectual\", whereas his mention of \"the intellectual sect\"  is a specific designation The term \"Gnosticism\" does not appear in ancient sources, and was first coined in the 17th century by Henry More in a commentary on the seven letters of the Book of Revelation, where More used the term \"Gnosticisme\" to describe the heresy in Thyatira. e term Gnosticism was derived from the use of the Greek adjective gnostikos (Greek γνωστικός, \"learned\", \"intellectual\") by St. Irenaeus (c. 185 AD) to describe the school of Valentinus as he legomene gnostike haeresis \"the heresy called Learned (gnostic).\" \n\nOrigins\nThe origins of Gnosticism are obscure and still disputed. The proto-orthodox Christian groups called Gnostics a heresy of Christianity,  but according to the modern scholars the theology's origin is closely related to Jewish sectarian milieus and early Christian sects.[1][22][note 14][23] Scholars debate Gnosticism's origins as having roots in Neoplatonism and Buddhism, due to similarities in beliefs , but ultimately, its origins are currently unknown. As Christianity developed and became more popular, so did Gnosticism, with both proto-orthodox Christian and Gnostic Christian groups often existing in the same places. The Gnostic belief was widespread within Christianity until the proto-orthodox Christian communities expelled the group in the second and third centuries (AD). Gnosticism became the first group to be declared heretical. \n  \n\n\nMoses Course:\nDr. Bart D.

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nRabbi Tovia Singer:\nhttps://outreachjudaism.org/\nSubscribe to his channel:\n@ToviaSinger1 \n\nmessiah, (from Hebrew mashiaḥ, “anointed”), in Judaism, the expected king of the Davidic line who would deliver Israel from foreign bondage and restore the glories of its golden age. The Greek New Testament’s translation of the term, christos, became the accepted Christian designation and title of Jesus of Nazareth, indicative of the principal character and function of his ministry. More loosely, the term messiah denotes any redeemer figure; and the adjective messianic is used in a broad sense to refer to beliefs or theories about an eschatological improvement of the state of humanity or the world.\n\nThe biblical Old Testament never speaks of an eschatological messiah, and even the “messianic” passages that contain prophecies of a future golden age under an ideal king never use the term messiah. Nevertheless, many modern scholars believe that Israelite messianism grew out of beliefs that were connected with their nation’s kingship. When actual reality and the careers of particular historical Israelite kings proved more and more disappointing, the “messianic” kingship ideology was projected on the future.\n\nMoses Course:\nDr. Bart D. Ehrman\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/finding-moses/\n\nMystery Cults Course:\nDr. M David Litwa\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nTovia Singer (born September 20, 1960) is an American Orthodox rabbi and the founder and director of Outreach Judaism. Outreach Judaism is managed under the Eits Chaim Indonesia Foundation, which describes itself as an advocate for the Jewish faith, the Jewish people, and the State of Israel.  After five years in Indonesia, Singer moved to Jerusalem, Israel on the 9th of May 2019 where he now lives in the Jewish quarter of the Old-City.\n  \nSinger is the founder and director of Outreach Judaism, a Jewish counter-missionary organization. It describes itself as \"an international organization that responds directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity.\" Singer cautions regarding congregations that \"are designed to appear Jewish, but are actually fundamentalist Christian churches, which use traditional Jewish symbols to lure the most vulnerable of our Jewish people into their ranks.\" Outreach Judaism was described by J. Gordon Melton in 2002 as an example of \"the current state of Jewish counter-cult activity.\" \n \nFrom 2002 to 2010 Singer hosted The Tovia Singer Show on Arutz Sheva's Israel National Radio. The show launched again in October 2013. The radio show had many prominent guests, including Israeli and American politicians, rabbis, terror victims, and authors. Among those who came on the show were: 47th Governor of Texas Rick Perry; American stand-up comedian in political satire, Jackie Mason; former US ambassador for the UN, John R. Bolton; businessman Ronald Lauder; Israeli Ambassador Dore Gold; American-born Israeli historian, author and politician, Michael Oren; Dead Sea Scroll expert Prof. Lawrence Schiffman; American conservative political activist, Alan Keyes; Israeli politician, Danny Danon; former American ambassador and an ardent anti-communist, Jeane Kirkpatrick and many others. Singer was also one of the first who interviewed Walid Shoebat. In 2006, Singer interviewed Wafa Sultan on the show. \n\nSinger is the author of the book and audio series Let's Get Biblical: Why Doesn't Judaism Accept the Christian Messiah? His new expanded edition is a two-volume book that takes a critical look at long-standing Christian charges against the Jewish faith.  According to David Brickner it has \"grabbed the attention of many evangelicals simply because it has been so widely distributed.\" A book review by Jewish Values Online described Singer as \"a master of his material\" and that \"his meticulous research and command of Biblical sources is most impressive.\" \n\nTogether with Eits Chaim Indonesia Foundation whose founders are of Dutch Jewish descent, Singer started the only Jewish Center legally acknowledged by the Indonesian Minister of Religious Affairs - Torat Chaim. Since Judaism is not yet a recognized religion in Indonesia, religious freedom for Torat Chaim and its members is guaranteed and protected by the Christian Desk of the Indonesian Religious Affairs Department. \n\nOn November 25, 2022, the Jerusalem Post reported that Lihi Lapid, the wife of Prime Minister Yair Lapid, sued Singer for reporting a claim by missionary Chaim Malespin that Ms. Lapid believes in Jesus.  Lapid claimed that Singer apologized for this, which Singer denied in a response published in the Jerusalem Post on November 27.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #toviasinger #christianity",

Tabor (Ph.D):\nhttps://jamestabor.com/about-dr-tabor/\nSubscribe to James Tabor's Youtube:\n@JamesTaborVideos \n\nDr. James Tabor retired (2022) as a full-Professor from the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he taught Christian origins and ancient Judaism, for 33 years, serving as Chair for a decade. His MA/Ph.D. is from the University of Chicago (1981). He previously taught at the University of Notre Dame and the College of William and Mary. Tabor has combined his work on ancient texts with extensive fieldwork in archaeology in Israel and Jordan. Since 2008 he has been co-director, with Shimon Gibson, of the acclaimed Mt. Zion excavation in Jerusalem. He was also involved in the 1993 Waco tragedy drawing upon his expertise in understanding ancient Biblical apocalyptic ideas and he testifying before Congress in the 1995 Waco Hearings.\n\nAmong Tabor’s publications include over 50 published articles as well as nine academic books: Things Unutterable (1985), A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom Among Christians and Jews in Antiquity (Harper Collins:1992 with Arthur Droge) Why Waco: Cults and the Battle for Religious Freedom in America (UC Berkeley:1995 with Eugene Gallagher), The Jesus Dynasty (Simon & Schuster, 2006), The Jesus Discovery: The New Archaeological Find that Reveals the Birth of Christianity (Simon & Schuster, 2012 with Simcha Jacobovici), Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity (Simon & Schuster, 2012), The Book of Genesis: A New Translation from the Transparent English Bible (Genesis Press, 2020), Paul’s Ascent to Paradise: The Apostolic Message and Mission of Paul in the Light of His Mystical Experiences (Genesis Press, 2020). Dr. Tabor has just completed a new book, The Lost Mary: From the Jewish Mother of Jesus to the Virgin Mother of God which is out in French (Marie: De son enfance juive à la fondation du christianisme Flammarion, 2020) and forthcoming in English (Knopf, 2023). He is now working on two new books: Jesus Betrayed: How Christianity Lost its Way and Prophecy Belief in MAGA America: Shifting Biblical Interpretations and Why They Matter.\n\n\nThe Gospel of Mark  is the second of the four canonical gospels and of the three synoptic Gospels. It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death, burial, and the discovery of his empty tomb. There is no miraculous birth or doctrine of divine pre-existence,  nor, in the original ending (Mark 16:1–8), any post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. It portrays Jesus as a teacher, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker. He refers to himself as the Son of Man. He is called the Son of God, but keeps his messianic nature secret; even his disciples fail to understand him. All this is in keeping with Christian interpretation of prophecy, which is believed to foretell the fate of the messiah as suffering servant.  The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the Resurrection of Jesus.\n\nMost scholars date Mark to c. 66–74 AD, either shortly before or after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. They reject the traditional ascription to Mark the Evangelist, the companion of the Apostle Peter – which probably arose from the desire of early Christians to link the work to an authoritative figure – and believe it to be the work of an author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.[9] It was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel, Matthew; the Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark. \n\nIn the 19th century, Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and Luke. The hypothesis of Marcan priority continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering Son of God.\n\n#gnosticinformant #jamestabor #gospelofmark",

It commemorates the digging of the waterway, which was an event in the history of Jerusalem and is mentioned more than once in the Bible. The city of Jerusalem is almost entirely surrounded by two deep valleys which unite to the southeast of the city, namely, the valley of Jehoshaphat on the east, and that generally identifiedwith Ge-hinnom, or the valley of the sons of Hinnom, on the west and the south. Between these two valleys is the Tyropœon, a depression now almost filled in, which begins in the center of Jerusalem, and extends to the point where the two valleys join, separating the upper city from the hill on which the Temple stood. The space between the Tyropœon and the valley of Jehoshaphat is called \"Ophel,\" and is in the form of a spur projecting toward the south, and bounded on the north by the wall of Ḥaram al-Sharif. At the foot of the Ḥaram is the spring now called \"The Virgin's Spring,\" the water from which traverses the whole length of the hill of Ophel from north to south in a subterranean channel and empties into the Pool of Siloam, whence it is drawn to irrigate the gardens on the slopes of Jerusalem. On the right wall of this conduit, about five or six meters from the Pool of Siloam, the inscription in question was found, the base of the letters being on a level with the water. Sayce, who has done more than any one else to bring this inscription to light, gives the curious story of its discovery in \"Records of the Past\" (New Series, i. 168-175, London, 1888; see also Ph. Berger in \"Journal des Débats,\" April 16, 1882). The inscription was broken in an attempt made to steal it; but the fragments are now in the museum at Constantinople; and from casts that have been taken, copies of which are in Paris, London, and Berlin, it has been possible to gain an exact idea of its arrangement and to decipher it almost entirely.\n\nThe language of the inscription is pure Hebrew, and its general sense is clear; indeed, if the first line had not been mutilated there would be hardly a single doubtful word. The translation, resulting from the combined efforts of various scholars, is as follows:\n\nLiné 1. . . . the piercing. . . . And this is the history of the digging. When . . .\n2. the pickaxes one against the other. And when there were only three cubits more to cut through, the men were heard\n3. calling from one side to the other; [for] there was zedah in the rock, on the right and on the left. And on the day of theV11p340001.jpgThe Siloam Inscription, with Transcription.(From Benzinger, \"Hebräiscbe Archäologie.\")\n4. piercing the workmen struck each to meet the other, pickax against pickax. And there flowed\n5. the waters from the spring to the pool for a space of 200 cubits. And [100]\n6. cubits was the height over the head of the workmen.\nFor a detailed account of the work of decipherment see the references in Lidzbarski, \"Handbuch der Nordsemitischen Epigraphik,\" p. 439.\n\nClermont-Ganneau has brought forward an ingenious hypothesis in regard to the blank upper part of the cartouche; he concluded that it had been reserved for the date, or rather for a symbolical picture, which for some reason or other was not supplied. However, in all known inscriptions the writers began at the beginning, and the introductory formula was carved first and not afterward; and as regards the symbolical picture, representations in this style occur so seldom in Palestine, and are so little in conformity with Jewish custom, that its existence must not be assumed arbitrarily.\n\nIt is not easy to explain the choice of place for the inscription. One might have expected to find it either at the entrance of the waterway or at the point where the two gangs of men met; but instead it was engraved in an obscure position five or six meters from the end. It might be assumed, in explanation, that the tunnel was originally longer, and that the inscription was in fact at the point of junction. But this hypothesis involves such topographical difficulties that it is best to set it aside. The first word of the inscription might have furnished a clue; but as it has been obliterated, one can only guess at the reason for its obscure position.\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #siloam #jerusalem",

His most notable stance is arguing in favor of the Christ myth theory – the claim that a historical Jesus did not exist. Price is the author of a number of books on biblical studies and the historicity of Jesus.\n\nA former Baptist minister, Price was a fellow of the Jesus Project, a group of 150 individuals who studied the historicity of Jesus and the Gospels, the organizer of a Web community for those interested in the history of Christianity,  and a member of the advisory board of the Secular Student Alliance.[3] He is a religious skeptic, especially of orthodox Christian beliefs, occasionally describing himself as a Christian atheist.  Price eventually moved to a maximalist (or rather minimalist, by analogy with biblical minimalism) position in favor of the Christ myth theory, believing that neither Jesus nor Nazareth itself existed in Roman Galilee.\n\nPrice is also a writer, editor, and critic in the field of speculative fiction. He has written about the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe created by the writer H. P. Lovecraft.  Price was appointed executor of Lin Carter's literary estate, although Price's actions became controversial in 2020 after an inflammatory introduction he wrote to Lin Carter's Flashing Swords! 6 anthology caused multiple authors to withdraw their work in protest. He co-wrote a book on the rock band Rush with his wife, Carol Selby Price, Mystic Rhythms: The Philosophical Vision of Rush (1999).\n\nPrice is currently the editor of the Journal of Higher Criticism.\n\nPrice has been a figure in H. P. Lovecraft scholarship and fandom for many years. He is the editor of the journal Crypt of Cthulhu.  (published by Necronomicon Press) and of a series of Cthulhu Mythos anthologies. In essays that introduce the anthologies and the individual stories, Price traces the origins of Lovecraft's entities, motifs, and literary style. The Cthulhu Cycle, for example, saw the origins of Cthulhu the octopoid entity in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \"The Kraken\" (1830) and particular passages from Lord Dunsany, while The Dunwich Cycle points to the influence of Arthur Machen on Lovecraft's \"The Dunwich Horror.\"\n\nPrice's religious background often informs his Mythos criticism, seeing gnostic themes in Lovecraft's fictional god Azathoth  and interpreting \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" as a kind of initiation ritual. \n\nPrice was in charge of the majority of the early Cthulhu anthologies by Chaosium; his first book published by Chaosium was The Hastur Cycle (1993), a short story anthology about a single element of Lovecraftian stories, and following this was Mysteries of the Worm (1993), a collection Cthulhu Mythos fiction by Robert Bloch.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #robertmprice #askmeanything",

Many of the texts belonging in this category were later translated into Arabic and Latin, often being extensively revised and expanded throughout the centuries. Some of them were also originally written in Arabic, though in many cases their status as an original work or translation remains unclear.  These Arabic and Latin Hermetic texts were widely copied throughout the Middle Ages (the most famous example being the Emerald Tablet).\n\nThe \"religio-philosophical\" Hermetica are a relatively coherent set of religio-philosophical treatises which were mostly written in the second and third centuries CE, though the very earliest one of them, the Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius, may go back to the first century CE.  They are chiefly focused on the relationship between human beings, the cosmos, and God (thus combining philosophical anthropology, cosmology, and theology). Many of them are also moral exhortations calling for a way of life (the \"way of Hermes\") leading to spiritual rebirth, and eventually to divinization in the form of a heavenly ascent.  The treatises in this category were probably all originally written in Greek, even though some of them only survive in Coptic, Armenian, or Latin translations.  During the Middle Ages, most of them were only accessible to Byzantine scholars (an important exception being the Asclepius, which mainly survives in an early Latin translation), until a compilation of Greek Hermetic treatises known as the Corpus Hermeticum was translated into Latin by the Renaissance scholars Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500). \n\nThough strongly influenced by Greek and Hellenistic philosophy (especially Platonism and Stoicism),  and to a lesser extent also by Jewish ideas,  many of the early Greek Hermetic treatises also contain distinctly Egyptian elements, most notably in their affinity with the traditional Egyptian wisdom literature. This used to be the subject of much doubt, but it is now generally admitted that the Hermetica as such did in fact originate in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt, even if most of the later Hermetic writings (which continued to be composed at least until the twelfth century CE) did not. It may even be the case that the great bulk of the early Greek Hermetica were written by Hellenizing members of the Egyptian priestly class, whose intellectual activity was centred in the environment of the Egyptian temples.\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #hermetic #esoterica",

Most predictions are related to Abrahamic religions, often standing for or similar to the eschatological events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the rapture, the Great Tribulation, the Last Judgment, and the Second Coming of Christ. Many religious-related end-time events are predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction, who often quote the Bible, and in particular the New Testament, as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions. \n\nThis often takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point where it will have been 6000 years since the supposed creation of the Earth by the Abrahamic God, which according to the Talmud marks the deadline for the Messiah to appear.  Predictions of the end from natural events have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these disasters are generally accepted within the scientific community as plausible \"end of the world\" scenarios, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands or even billions of years from now.\n\nLittle research has been done into why people make apocalyptic predictions. Historically, it has been done for reasons such as diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, and promoting hatred of certain groups; antisemitism was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times, while French and Lutheran depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists respectively. According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic predictions include mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source, an innate human fascination with fear, personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness and a modern romanticism involved with end-times due to its portrayal in contemporary fiction.  The prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture which encourages the embracement of a future that will be drastically different from the present. Such a culture is credited with the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the 2012 phenomenon, while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring the end of humanity. \n\nPolls conducted in 2012 across 20 countries found over 14% of people believe the world will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6% of people in France to 22% in the US and Turkey. Belief in the apocalypse is observed to be most prevalent in people with lower rates of education, lower household incomes, and those under the age of 35.   In the UK in 2015, 23% of the general public believed the apocalypse was likely to occur in their lifetime, compared to 10% of experts from the Global Challenges Foundation. The general public believed the likeliest cause would be nuclear war, while experts thought it would be artificial intelligence. Only 3% of Britons thought the end would be caused by the Last Judgement, compared to 16% of Americans. Between one and three percent of people from both countries said the apocalypse would be caused by zombies or alien invasion.\n\noung Earth creationism (YEC) is a form of creationism which holds as a central tenet that the Earth and its lifeforms were created by supernatural acts of the Abrahamic God between approximately 6,000 and 10,000 years ago.  In its most widespread version, YEC is based on the religious belief in the inerrancy of certain literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis. Its primary adherents are Christians and Jews who believe that God created the Earth in six literal days,  in contrast with old Earth creationism (OEC), which holds literal interpretations of Genesis that are compatible with the scientifically determined ages of the Earth  and universe and theistic evolution, which posits that the scientific principles of evolution, the Big Bang, abiogenesis, solar nebular theory, age of the universe, and age of Earth are compatible with a metaphorical interpretation of Genesis.\n\n#gnosticinformant #christianity #top3",

It also considers the historical and cultural contexts in which Jesus lived.  Virtually all scholars of antiquity accept that Jesus was a historical figure, and attempts to deny his historicity have been consistently rejected by the scholarly consensus as a fringe theory. \n\nReconstructions of the historical Jesus are based on the Pauline epistles and the gospels, while several non-biblical sources also support his historical existence. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and developing new and different research criteria. Scholars differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the biblical accounts, with two events being supported by nearly universal scholarly consensus: Jesus was baptized and crucified.     Historical Jesus scholars typically contend that he was a Galilean Jew and living in a time of messianic and apocalyptic expectations.  Some scholars credit the apocalyptic declarations of the gospels to him, while others portray his \"Kingdom of God\" as a moral one, and not apocalyptic in nature. \n\nThe portraits of Jesus that have been constructed through history using these processes have often differed from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts. Such portraits include that of Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, charismatic healer, Cynic philosopher, Jewish messiah, prophet of social change,  and rabbi. There is little scholarly agreement on a single portrait, nor the methods needed to construct it, but there are overlapping attributes among the various portraits, and scholars who differ on some attributes may agree on others.\n\nVirtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed. Historian Michael Grant asserts that if conventional standards of historical criticism are applied to the New Testament, \"we can no more reject Jesus' existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned\".  There is no indication that writers in antiquity who opposed Christianity questioned the existence of Jesus. \n\nSince the 1970s, various scholars such as Joachim Jeremias, E. P. Sanders and Gerd Theissen have traced elements of Christianity to diversity in first-century Judaism and discarded nineteenth-century views that Jesus was based on previous pagan deities. Mentions of Jesus in extra-biblical texts do exist and are supported as genuine by the majority of historians. Historical scholars see differences between the content of the Jewish Messianic prophecies and the life of Jesus, undermining views Jesus was invented as a Jewish Midrash or Peshar.   The presence of details of Jesus' life in Paul, and the differences between letters and Gospels, are sufficient for most scholars to dismiss mythicist claims concerning Paul. Theissen says \"there is broad scholarly consensus that we can best find access to the historical Jesus through the Synoptic tradition.\"  Bart D. Ehrman adds: \"To dismiss the Gospels from the historical record is neither fair nor scholarly.\"\n\n#history #jesus #dalecallisonjr",

The Greek Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) are the \"sons of Zeus\"; the Vedic Divó nápātā (Aśvins) are the \"sons of Dyaús\", the sky-god; the Lithuanian Dievo sūneliai (Ašvieniai) are the \"sons of the God\" (Dievas); and the Latvian Dieva dēli are likewise the \"sons of the God\" (Dievs). \n\nRepresented as young men and the steeds who pull the sun across the sky, the Divine Twins rode horses (sometimes they were depicted as horses themselves) and rescued men from mortal peril in battle or at sea.  The Divine Twins are often differentiated: one is represented as a young warrior while the other is seen as a healer or concerned with domestic duties.[138] In most tales where they appear, the Divine Twins rescue the Dawn from a watery peril, a theme that emerged from their role as the solar steeds.  At night, the horses of the sun returned to the east in a golden boat, where they traversed the sea[note 8] to bring back the Sun each morning. During the day, they crossed the sky in pursuit of their consort, the morning star. \n\nOther reflexes may be found in the Anglo-Saxon Hengist and Horsa (whose names mean \"stallion\" and \"horse\"), the Celtic \"Dioskouroi\" said by Timaeus to be venerated by Atlantic Celts as a set of horse twins, the Germanic Alcis, a pair of young male brothers worshipped by the Naharvali,  or the Welsh Brân and Manawydan.  The horse twins could have been based on the morning and evening star (the planet Venus) and they often have stories about them in which they \"accompany\" the Sun goddess, because of the close orbit of the planet Venus to the sun. \n\nOther propositions\nSome scholars have proposed a consort goddess named *Diwōnā, spouse of Dyēws with a possible descendant in the Greek goddess Dione. A thematic echo may also occur in Vedic India, as both Indra's wife Indrānī and Zeus's consort Dione display a jealous and quarrelsome disposition under provocation. A second descendant may be found in Dia, a mortal said to unite with Zeus in a Greek myth. The story leads ultimately to the birth of the Centaurs after the mating of Dia's husband Ixion with the phantom of Hera, the spouse of Zeus. The reconstruction is however only attested in those two traditions and therefore not secured.  The Greek Hera, the Roman Juno, the Germanic Frigg and the Indic Shakti are often depicted as the protectress of marriage and fertility, or as the bestowal of the gift of prophecy. James P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams note however that \"these functions are much too generic to support the supposition of a distinct PIE 'consort goddess' and many of the 'consorts' probably represent assimilations of earlier goddesses who may have had nothing to do with marriage.\" \n\nAlthough the etymological association is often deemed untenable, some scholars (such as Georges Dumézil and S. K. Sen) have proposed *Worunos or *Werunos (also the eponymous god in the reconstructed dialogue The king and the god) as the nocturnal sky and benevolent counterpart of Dyēws, with possible cognates in Greek Ouranos and Vedic Varuna, . Worunos may have personified the firmament, or dwelled in the night sky. In both Greek and Vedic poetry, Ouranos and Varuna are portrayed as \"wide-looking\", bounding or seizing their victims, and having or being a heavenly \"seat\".  In the three-sky cosmological model, the celestial phenomena linking the nightly and daily skies is embodied by a \"Binder-god\": the Greek Kronos, a transitional deity between Ouranos and Zeus in Hesiod's Theogony, the Indic Savitṛ, associated with the rising and setting of the sun in the Vedas, and the Roman Saturnus, whose feast marked the period immediately preceding the winter solstice.\n\n#gnosticinformant #gemeni #dioscuri",

Ehrman\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/finding-moses/\n\nMystery Cults Course:\nDr. M David Litwa\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\n\nThe Christ myth theory, also known as the Jesus myth theory, Jesus mythicism, or the Jesus ahistoricity theory, is the view that \"the story of Jesus is a piece of mythology\", possessing no \"substantial claims to historical fact\". Alternatively, in terms given by Bart Ehrman paraphrasing Earl Doherty, \"the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity.\" \n\nIn contrast, the mainstream scholarly consensus holds that Jesus was a historical figure who lived in 1st-century Roman Palestine, and that he was baptized and was crucified. Beyond that, mainstream scholars have no consensus about the historicity of the other major details of the gospel stories, or on the extent to which the Pauline epistles and the gospels replaced the historical human Jesus with a religious narrative of a supernatural \"Christ of faith\". \n\nMythicism \"goes back to Enlightenment times, when the historical-critical study of the past was born,\"  and was revived in the 1970s. Proponents broadly argue that a historical Jesus never existed, and that a mythological character was later historicized in the gospels. Some authors have argued that the sources on Jesus are so obscured by myths and dogma that \"we could no longer be sure there had ever been a real person at the root of the whole thing.\"  A view closer to the mainstream position is that the historical Jesus was the Galilean preacher preserved in the hypothetical Q-source, and that details about him were added to Paul's mythical Jesus. \n\nMost mythicists employ a threefold argument: they question the reliability of the Pauline epistles and the gospels to establish the historicity of Jesus; they argue that there is lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second centuries; and they argue that early Christianity had syncretistic and mythological origins, as reflected in both the Pauline epistles and the gospels, with Jesus being a celestial being who was concretized in the gospels. \n\nThe Christ myth theory is rejected as a fringe theory by virtually all scholars of antiquity,  and mythicist views are criticized in terms of methodologies, conclusions, and outdated comparisons with mythology.\n\nMainstream scholarship recognizes that there was a historical Jesus.   However scholars differ about the accuracy of the biblical accounts about Jesus, with only two events supported by nearly-universal scholarly consensus: Jesus' baptism, and his crucifixion. The mainstream scholarly view is that the Pauline epistles and the gospels describe the \"Christ of faith\", presenting a religious narrative which replaced the historical Jesus who did live in 1st-century Roman Palestine. Martin Kähler made the famous distinction between the \"Jesus of history\" and the \"Christ of faith\", arguing that faith is more important than exact historical knowledge.   According to Ehrman, Jesus was a first-century Palestine Jew, who was not like the Jesus preached and proclaimed today, and that the most widely held view by critical scholars is that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet who was subsequently deified. \n\nThe origins and rapid rise of Christianity, as well as the historical Jesus and the historicity of Jesus, are a matter of longstanding debate in theological and historical research. While Christianity may have started with an early nucleus of followers of Jesus,  within a few years after the presumed death of Jesus in c. AD 33, at the time Paul started preaching, a number of \"Jesus-movements\" seem to have existed, which propagated divergent interpretations of Jesus' teachings.  A central question is how these communities developed and what their original convictions were,  as a wide range of beliefs and ideas can be found in early Christianity, including adoptionism and docetism,  and also Gnostic traditions which used Christian imagery,  which were all deemed heretical by proto-orthodox Christianity. \n\n\n#gnosticinformant #richardcarrier #mythicism",

Ehrman\n\nThe Theogony is an 8th-century BCE didactic and instructional poem, credited to the Greek poet Hesiod. The Theogony was, at first, not actually written down, rather, it was part of a rich oral tradition which only achieved written form decades later. The Theogony traces the history of the world from its creation through the battle between the Olympians and the Titans to the ascension of Zeus as the absolute ruler of all of the Olympian gods. With the rise of Zeus to supremacy and the birth of his many children, the poem ends and does not address the continued struggles between mankind and the gods. Much of what is known today concerning early Greek mythology comes from Hesiod's work and that other great Greek poet Homer. Collectively, their works would serve as a major influence on later Greek literature and drama, and Roman mythology, especially through the epic Metamorphoses by Ovid.\n\nAuthorship\nThe Theogony (from the Greek theogonia, meaning \"generations of the gods\") is an epic poem of 1,022 hexameter lines which describes the birth of the gods in the Greek pantheon. It is thought to have been composed c. 700 BCE (give or take a generation either side of that date). Little is known of Hesiod's life. His father emigrated from Cyme in Asia Minor and settled in Boeotia, a small state in central Greece. It is assumed that the poet was a farmer; a fact garnered from the early verses of the Theogony. He may also have been a rhapsodist, a reciter of poetry, where he learned the technique and vocabulary of heroic songs.\n\nAlthough there are some who question whether or not Hesiod actually wrote the Theogony, most classicists believe he did. However, parts of the work may have been added by later poets and there is a definite similarity in some aspects to earlier Mesopotamian literature. The historian Dorothea Wender believes that the Theogony was an earlier work than Works and Days, the other work attributed to Hesiod. She considers the latter to be a better work, and while the Theogony seems to be unpolished, the author could have had difficulty with written composition.\n\nWender criticizes Hesiod for not discussing the dethroning of Kronos and his endless mention of \"colourless deities.\" Also, Hesiod's Zeus is too invincible. There is no suspense. \"Homer gets more excitement out of a footrace than Hesiod does out of a full-scale war in heaven\" (18). However, to Wender, the poem still has historical interest. Certainly, the Theogony was influential; the historian Norman Cantor in his Antiquity wrote that the Greeks adopted Homer and Hesiod's notion of the gods and\n\na distinctive Greek religion was developed. This religion was always complex and never consistent in all its details; still, its view of man and the world lies at the center of Greek culture. \n\nHesiod was influential on Classical Greek literature and philosophy, his Prometheus story, for example, inspiring such playwrights as Aeschylus (c. 525 - c. 456 BCE). His poetic style was much imitated, particularly in Hellenistic times and in Roman times - both the Republic and Imperial Rome - when Hesiod's works continued to be recited and set to music. The great Roman writer Ovid (43 BCE - 17 CE) would use many of the themes of the Theogony in his Metamorphoses.\n\nBirth of the Gods\nAfter the hymn to the Muses, Hesiod describes the birth of the gods. He asks the Muses to \"give me sweet song\" to tell\n\nhow the gods and earth arose at first\nAnd rivers and the boundless swollen sea\nAnd shining stars, and the broad heaven above\nAnd how the gods divided up their wealth\nand how they shared their honours, how they first\nCaptured Olympus with its many folds. (26)\n\nThey spoke of Chaos and how from Chaos came night and day. From Chaos came Earth (Gaia) who bore Heaven or Sky (Ouranos) as well as other children including Eros (Desire), Tartarus (Underworld), Erebus (Darkness), and Nyx (Night). From Nyx would come Doom, Dreams, Discord, Blame, and Sleep.\n\nHesiod speaks of how Nyx also gave birth to the Destines and the merciless Fates,\n\nwho track down the sins of men\nAnd gods, and ever cease from awful rage\nUntil they give the sinner punishment.

    "description": "https://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/other-virgin-births/\nLink for Course! Prof. Bart D. Ehrman (Ph.D)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/other-virgin-births/\n\nThe virgin birth of Jesus is the Christian doctrine that Jesus was conceived by his mother, Mary, through the power of the Holy Spirit and without sexual intercourse. It is mentioned only in Matthew 1:18–25 and Luke 1:26–38, and the modern scholarly consensus is that the narrative rests on very slender historical foundations.  The ancient world had no understanding that male semen and female ovum were both needed to form a fetus;  this cultural milieu was conducive to miraculous birth stories,  and tales of virgin birth and the impregnation of mortal women by deities were well known in the 1st-century Greco-Roman world and Second Temple Jewish works. \n\nChristians—Catholics, Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox—traditionally regard the doctrine as an explanation of the mixture of the human and divine natures of Jesus.  The Eastern Orthodox Churches accept the doctrine as authoritative by reason of its inclusion in the Nicene Creed, and the Catholic Church likewise holds it authoritative for faith through the Apostles' Creed as well as the Nicene. Nevertheless, there are many contemporary churches in which it is considered orthodox to accept the virgin birth but not heretical to deny it.\n\nThe Quran asserts the virgin birth of Jesus, deriving its account from the 2nd century AD Protoevangelium of James,  but denies the Trinitarian implications of the gospel story (Jesus is a messenger of God but also a human being and not the Second Person of the Christian Trinity).\n\nStories of miraculous births often include conceptions by miraculous circumstances and features such as intervention by a deity, supernatural elements, astronomical signs, hardship or, in the case of some mythologies, complex plots related to creation.\n\nGreco-Roman and Hellenistic literature is rich in the tradition of birth among the gods. In his poem Theogony, the Greek poet Hesiod tells a story that Zeus had once lain with the goddess Metis, impregnating her, but, fearing that she might bear a child mightier than he himself, he swallowed her.  Their daughter Athena was born fully grown from Zeus's forehead, fully armed and clad in armor. Hesiod also relates that the goddess Aphrodite was born from the foam of the sea after Ouranos's castrated testicles were thrown into it. \n\nHelios was a child of Zeus by Euryphaessa. He was also called \"the son of Earth and starry Heaven,\" and the son of Hyperion. Dionysus was dithyrambus, \"he who entered life by a double door.\" His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus appeared to her in a flash of lightning, and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant. In time, Dionysus was born \"perfect\" from Zeus' thigh. Dionysus Zagreus was important in Orphic theology. Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him. Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed. Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.\n\nThe love of a god for a mortal, resulting in the birth of a hero, is one notable deviation from the tradition of the origin of gods. The legend of Perseus, whose mother conceived him when Jupiter came to her in the form of a golden shower, is one example of this type. The Greek Anthology has the following: Zeus, turned to gold, piercing the brazen chamber of Danae, cut the knot of intact virginity.\n\nHeroes created by generation of a god with a mortal include Ion by Apollo and Creusa, Romulus by Mars and Aemila, Asclepius by Apollo and Coronis, and Helen by Zeus and Leda. Plutarch records how Theseus and Romulus were both born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage and at the same time had the reputation of being sprung from the gods. . But there were other stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus. The story of Romulus' divine origin says that his mother was the mortal daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, and his father was Mars.\n\nBart Denton Ehrman  (born 1955) is an American New Testament scholar focusing on textual criticism of the New Testament, the historical Jesus, and the origins and development of early Christianity. He has written and edited 30 books, including three college textbooks. He has also authored six New York Times bestsellers. He is the James A.

Another source gives the year of the siege of Masada as 73 or 74 CE. The Roman legion surrounded Masada, building a circumvallation wall and then a siege ramp against the western face of the plateau.  According to Dan Gill, geological investigations in the early 1990s confirmed earlier observations that the 114 m (375 ft) high assault ramp consisted mostly of a natural spur of bedrock. The ramp was complete in the spring of 73, after probably two to three months of siege, allowing the Romans to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a battering ram on April 16.  The Romans employed the X Legion and a number of auxiliary units and Jewish prisoners of war, totaling some 15,000 (of whom an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 were fighting men), in crushing Jewish resistance at Masada. A giant siege tower with a battering ram was constructed and moved laboriously up the completed ramp. According to Josephus, when Roman troops entered the fortress, they discovered that its defenders had set all the buildings but the food storerooms ablaze and committed mass suicide or killed each other, 960 men, women, and children in total. Josephus wrote of two stirring speeches that the Sicari leader had made to convince his men to kill themselves.  Only two women and five children were found alive. \n\nJosephus presumably based his narration upon the field commentaries of the Roman commanders that were accessible to him. \n\nThere are discrepancies between archaeological findings and Josephus' writings. Josephus mentions only one of the two palaces that have been excavated, refers only to one fire, though many buildings show fire damage, and claims that 960 people were killed, though the remains of at most 28 bodies have been found.  Some of the other details that Josephus gives, were correct – for instance, he describes the baths that were built there, the fact that the floors in some of the buildings ‘were paved with stones of several colours’, and that many pits were cut into the living rock to serve as cisterns. Yadin found some partially intact mosaic floors which meet that description.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #masada #ancienthistory",

The act of simony, or paying for position, is named after Simon who tried to buy his way into the power of the Apostles.\n\nAccording to Acts, Simon was a Samaritan magus or religious figure of the 1st century AD and a convert to Christianity, baptised by Philip the Evangelist. Simon later clashed with Peter. Accounts of Simon by writers of the second century exist, but are not considered verifiable.Surviving traditions about Simon appear in orthodox texts, such as those of Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius, where he is often described as the founder of Gnosticism,  which has been accepted by some modern scholars,  while others reject that he was a Gnostic, just designated as one by the Church Fathers. \n\nJustin, who was himself a 2nd-century native of Samaria, wrote that nearly all the Samaritans in his time were adherents of a certain Simon of Gitta, a village not far from Flavia Neapolis. Irenaeus held him as being the founder of the sect of the Simonians. Hippolytus quotes from a work he attributes to Simon or his followers the Simonians, Apophasis Megale, or Great Declaration. According to the early church heresiologists, Simon is also supposed to have written several lost treatises, two of which bear the titles The Four Quarters of the World and The Sermons of the Refuter.\n\nIn apocryphal works including the Acts of Peter, Pseudo-Clementines, and the Epistle of the Apostles, Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will. He is sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Samaritan\" due to his malevolent character.  The Apostolic Constitutions also accuses him of \"lawlessness\" (antinomianism).\n\nAs described by Epiphanius, in the beginning God had his first thought, his Ennoia, which was female, and that thought was to create the angels. The First Thought then descended into the lower regions and created the angels. But the angels rebelled against her out of jealousy and created the world as her prison, imprisoning her in a female body. Thereafter, she was reincarnated many times, each time being shamed. Her many reincarnations included Helen of Troy, among others, and she finally was reincarnated as Helen, a slave and prostitute in the Phoenician city of Tyre. God then descended in the form of Simon Magus, to rescue his Ennoia, and to confer salvation upon men through knowledge of himself.\n\n#gnosticinformant #mdavidlitwa #simonmagus",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nGet the Book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Christs-Associations-Connecting-Belonging-Ancient/dp/0300217048\nJohn Kloppenborg studies the origins of Christianity, early Christian documents and the history of Second Temple Judaism. He has researched and written most substantially about the Q document, also known as the Sayings Gospel Q. This hypothetical document would one of the oldest circulating sources of the sayings of Jesus. It is hypothesized as prior to, and known to the authors of The Gospel of Matthew, The Gospel of Luke, and is similar in some ways to the (non-synoptic) The Gospel of Thomas. He has also worked extensively on the Synoptic problem and co-edited a major collection in 2011 on the centenary of the publication of William Sanday's Oxford Studies in the Synoptic Problem (1911).\n\nKloppenborg has also done original research and written on the social world of the early Jesus movement in Jewish Palestine, cultic associations and occupational guilds in the eastern Roman Empire and the social significance of the parables of Jesus. Other areas of interest have been the letters of the New Testament, especially the Letter of James, and the culture of the Graeco-Roman world as relates to such matters as: religion, spirituality, cultic associations, ethnic sub-groups and their ancient organization, professional societies and the general conditions of the societies in the Near East during the time of Second Temple Judaism, the time of Jesus and the formation of the Bible as we know it.\n\nPapias was the Bishop of Hierapolis who lived c. 60 – c. 130 AD.  He wrote the Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord  in five books. This work, which is lost apart from brief excerpts in the works of Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 180) and Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 320), is an important early source on Christian oral tradition and especially on the origins of the canonical Gospels.\n\nMoses Course:\nDr. Bart D.

His three works, originally written in the Phoenician language, survive only in partial paraphrase and a summary of a Greek translation by Philo of Byblos recorded by the Christian bishop Eusebius. These few fragments comprise the most extended literary source concerning Phoenician religion in either Greek or Latin: Phoenician sources, along with all of Phoenician literature, were lost with the parchment on which they were written.\n\nAll knowledge of Sanchuniathon and his work comes from the Praeparatio Evangelica of Eusebius (I. chs ix-x),[3] which contains some information about him, along with the only surviving excerpts from his writing, as summarized and quoted from his purported translator, Philo of Byblos.\n\nEusebius quotes neo-Platonist writer Porphyry as stating that Sanchuniathon of Berytus (Beirut) wrote the truest history because he obtained records from Hierombalus priest of Ieuo (Ancient Greek: Ἰευώ), that Sanchuniathon dedicated his history to Abibalus (Abibaal) king of Berytus, and that it was approved by the king and other investigators, the date of this writing being before the Trojan War (around 1200 BC) approaching close to the time of Moses, \"when Semiramis was queen of the Assyrians.\"  Thus Sanchuniathon is placed firmly in the mythic context of the pre-Homeric Greek Heroic Age, an antiquity from which no other Greek or Phoenician writings are known to have survived to the time of Philo.\n\nSanchuniathon claims to have based his work on \"collections of secret writings of the Ammouneis discovered in the shrines\", sacred lore deciphered from mystic inscriptions on the pillars which stood in the Phoenician temples,  lore which exposed the truth—later covered up by allegories and myths—that the gods were originally human beings who came to be worshipped after their deaths and that the Phoenicians had taken what were originally names of their kings and applied them to elements of the cosmos (compare euhemerism), worshipping forces of nature and the sun, moon, and stars. Eusebius cites Sanchuniathon in his attempt to discredit pagan religion based on such foundations. \n\nThis rationalizing euhemeristic slant and the emphasis on Beirut, a city of great importance in the late classical period but apparently of little importance in ancient times, suggests that the work itself is not nearly as old as it claims to be. Some have suggested it was forged by Philo himself or assembled from various traditions and presented within an authenticating pseudepigraphical format to give the material a patina of believability. Philo may have translated genuine Phoenician works ascribed to an ancient writer known as Sanchuniathon but in fact written in more recent times. This judgment is echoed by the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, which described Sanchuniathon as \"belong more to legend than to history.\" \n\nNot all readers have taken such a critical view:\n\nThe Humour which prevail'd with several learned Men to reject Sanchoniatho as a counterfeit because they knew not what to make of him, his Lordship always blam'd. Philo Byblius, Porphyry, and Eusebius, who were better able to judge than any Moderns, never call in question his being genuine.\n\n— Squier Payne, in a preface to Richard Cumberland's Sanchoniatho's Phoenician History (1720) \nHowever that may be,  much of what has been preserved in this writing, despite the euhemeristic interpretation given it, turned out to be supported by the Ugaritic mythological texts excavated at Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) in Syria since 1929; Otto Eissfeldt demonstrated in 1952  that it does incorporate genuine Phoenician elements that can now be related to the Ugaritic texts, some of which, as shown in extant versions of Sanchuniathon, remained unchanged since the second millennium BC. The modern consensus is that Philo's treatment of Sanchuniathon offered a Hellenistic view of Phoenician materials written between the time of Alexander the Great and the first century BC, if it was not a literary invention of Philo.\n\n#gnosticinformant #genesis #oldtestament",

Grabbe is a retired American scholar and Emeritus Professor of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism at the University of Hull, England.\n\nAs an historian of ancient Judaism, he has authored several standard treatments. He founded and convenes the European Seminar on Methodology in Israel’s History, and publishes the proceedings in the sub-series European Seminar in Historical Methodology. Before retirement, he established and taught for several years a module, Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, and another module, Religious Sectarianism in History and the Modern World.\n\nAn alumnus of Claremont Graduate University, he was a student of William H. Brownlee and frequent guest on both Viking Radio and Radio Humberside to discuss such topics as: the Ten Commandments, the Jewish festivals, the 4th of July, and Nostradamus and the millennium. Grabbe delivered the 2008 Brownlee Memorial Lecture on the topic: Exit David and Solomon? The Current Debate on the History of Ancient Israel.\n\nAt age sixty-five, Grabbe was presented with a Festschrift, a memorial book, by editors Philip Davies and Diana Edelman, containing a collection of thirty essays by his colleagues and friends, offering \"reflections on the practice and theory of history writing, on the current controversies and topics of major interest\". The essays show Grabbe's influence on the field of biblical studies and history.\n\n\nLink for the DEBATE (Pay Per View EXCLUSIVE):\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/jesus-resurrection-tc/\n\nMoses Course:\nDr. Bart D.

Quoting from Manetho's Aegyptiaca, Josephus states that when the Hyksos were expelled from Egypt, they founded Jerusalem (Contra Apion I.90). ] It is unclear if this is original to Manetho or Josephus's own addition, as Manetho does not mention \"Jews\" or \"Hebrews\" in his preserved account of the expulsion.  Josephus's account of Manetho connects the expulsion of the Hyksos to another event two hundred years later, in which a group of lepers led by the priest Osarseph were expelled from Egypt to the abandoned Avaris. There they ally with the Hyksos and rule over Egypt for thirteen years before being driven out, during which time they oppress the Egyptians and destroy their temples. After the expulsion, Osarseph changes his name to Moses (Contra Apion I.227-250).  Assmann argues that this second account is largely a mixture of the experiences of the later Amarna period with the Hyksos invasion, with Osarseph likely standing in for Akhenaten.  The final mention of Osarseph, in which he changes his name to Moses, may be a later interpolation.  The second account is sometimes held not to have been written by Manetho at all.\n\nOver the years, especially in the early to mid 20th century, some scholars have suggested that seemingly authentic Egyptian elements in the Bible indicate the historical plausibility of the story of the Egyptian sojourn and exodus of the Israelites, including the story of Joseph, great grandson of Abraham.  John Bright states that Egyptian and Biblical records both suggest that Semitic people maintained access to Egypt at all periods of Egypt's history, and he suggested that it is tempting to suppose that Joseph who, according to the Old Testament (Genesis 39:50), was in favour at the Egyptian court and held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land, was associated to the Hyksos rule in Egypt during the Fifteenth Dynasty. Such a connection might have been facilitated by their shared Semitic ethnicity. He also wrote that there is no proof for these events.  Howard Vos has suggested that the \"coat of many colors\" said to have been worn by Joseph could be similar to the colorful garments seen in the painting of foreigners in the tomb of Khnumhotep II. \n\nRonald B. Geobey notes a number of problems with identifying the narrative of Joseph with events either prior to or during the Hyksos' rule, such as the detail that the Egyptians abhorred Joseph's people (\"shepherds\"; Gen. 46:31) and numerous anachronisms.    \n\n\n#gnosticinformant #hyksos #exodus",

(Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nMinerva is the Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, law, victory, and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy. Minerva is not a patron of violence such as Mars, but of strategic war. From the second century BC onward, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena.  Minerva is one of the three Roman deities in the Capitoline Triad, along with Jupiter and Juno.\n\nShe was the virgin goddess of music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts. She is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named as the \"owl of Minerva\", which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge as well as, less frequently, the snake and the olive tree. Minerva is commonly depicted as tall with an athletic and muscular build, as well as wearing armour and carrying a spear. As the most important Roman goddess, she is highly revered, honored, and respected.  Marcus Terentius Varro considered her to be ideas and the plan for the universe personified.\n\nFollowing the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of Metis, who had been swallowed by Jupiter, and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armour. Jupiter had sex with the titaness Metis, which resulted in her attempting to change shape (or shapeshift) to escape him. Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had Saturn, and in turn, Saturn had Caelus. Fearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The Titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armour for her child while within Jupiter's body. In some versions of the story, Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind as the source of his wisdom. Others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva. The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain. To relieve the pain, Vulcan used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and in full battle armour.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the forehead of her father Zeus. In some versions of the story, Athena has no mother and is born from Zeus' forehead by parthenogenesis. In others, such as Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus swallows his consort Metis, who was pregnant with Athena; in this version, Athena is first born within Zeus and then escapes from his body through his forehead. In the founding myth of Athens, Athena bested Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. She was known as Athena Parthenos \"Athena the Virgin,\" but in one archaic Attic myth, the god Hephaestus tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius, an important Athenian founding hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have aided the heroes Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War.\n\nShe plays an active role in the Iliad, in which she assists the Achaeans and, in the Odyssey, she is the divine counselor to Odysseus. In the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, afterward transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.\n\nAthena was not only the patron goddess of Athens, but also other cities, including Argos, Sparta, Gortyn, Lindos, and Larisa.  Athena was frequently equated with Aphaea, a local goddess of the island of Aegina, originally from Crete and also associated with Artemis and the nymph Britomartis. In Arcadia, she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as Athena Alea. \n\n#gnosticinformant #athena  #minerva",

(Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nThe newer Siloam Tunnel (Hebrew: נִקְבַּת הַשִּׁלֹחַ, Nikbat HaShiloaḥ), also known as Hezekiah's Tunnel (Hebrew: תעלת חזקיהו, Te'alát Ḥizkiyáhu), is a water tunnel that was carved within the City of David in ancient times, now located in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan in eastern Jerusalem. Its popular name is due to the most common hypothesis that it dates from the reign of Hezekiah of Judah (late 8th and early 7th century BC) and corresponds to the \"conduit\" mentioned in 2 Kings 20:20 in the Hebrew Bible.[1] According to the Bible, King Hezekiah prepared Jerusalem for an impending siege by the Assyrians, by \"blocking the source of the waters of the upper Gihon, and leading them straight down on the west to the City of David\" (2 Chronicles 32:30). By diverting the waters of the Gihon, he prevented the enemy forces under Sennacherib from having access to water.\n\nSupport for the dating to Hezekiah's period is derived from the Biblical text that describes construction of a tunnel and to radiocarbon dates of organic matter contained in the original plastering. However, the dates were challenged in 2011 by new excavations that suggested an earlier origin in the late 9th or early 8th century BC.\n\nThe tunnel leads from the Gihon Spring to the Pool of Siloam. If indeed built under Hezekiah, it dates to a time when Jerusalem was preparing for an impending siege by the Assyrians, led by Sennacherib. Since the Gihon Spring was already protected by a massive tower and was included in the city's defensive wall system, Jerusalem seems to have been supplied with enough water in case of siege even without this tunnel. According to Aharon Horovitz, director of the Megalim Institute, the tunnel can be interpreted as an additional aqueduct designed for keeping the entire outflow of the spring inside the walled area, which included the downstream Pool of Siloam, with the specific purpose of withholding water from any besieging forces. Both the spring itself, and the pool at the end of the tunnel, would have been used by the inhabitants as water sources. Troops positioned outside the walls wouldn't have reached any of it, because even the overflow water released from the Pool of Siloam would have fully disappeared into a karstic system located right outside the southern tip of the city walls. In contrast to that, the previous water system did release all the water not used by the city population into the Kidron Valley to the east, where besieging troops could have taken advantage of it.\n\nThe curving tunnel is 583 yards (533 m; about 1⁄3 mile) long and by using the 12 inch (30 cm) altitude difference between its two ends, which corresponds to a 0.06 percent gradient, the engineers managed to convey the water from the spring to the pool.\n\nAccording to the Siloam inscription, the tunnel was excavated by two teams, one starting at each end of the tunnel and then meeting in the middle. The inscription is partly unreadable at present, and may originally have conveyed more information than this. It is clear from the tunnel itself that several directional errors were made during its construction.  Recent scholarship has discredited the idea that the tunnel may have been formed by substantially widening a pre-existing natural karst. How the Israelite engineers dealt with the difficult feat of making two teams digging from opposite ends meet far underground is still not fully understood, but some suggest that the two teams were directed from above by sound signals generated by hammering on the solid rock through which the tunnelers were digging.\n\nThe tunnel was first described in modern times by Franciscus Quaresmius in 1625. It was later explored in 1838 by the American biblical scholar Edward Robinson,  and in 1865 by Charles Warren. \n\nNeither Quaresmius nor Robinson identified the tunnel with Hezekiah,  but in 1871 Warren suggested that the Pool of Siloam may have been \"dug by King Hezekiah\" and in 1884 following the discovery of the Siloam inscription wrote that: \"The inscription thus appears to belong to the later period of the Hebrew monarchy, and may very well be considered to agree with the Biblical account of Hezekiah's preparations for Sennacherib's siege.\"\n\n#gnosticinformant #jerusalem #hezekiah",

Acts 16:17, \"these men are servants of the most high God\" — oracle of the pythonissa at Philippi). It seems probable that the native Cappadocian cult of Zeus Sabazios was deliberately merged in the cult of Jahve Sabaoth practised by the numerous and intellectually predominant Jewish colonies, and that associations (sodalicia, thiasoi) of strict monotheists were formed, who fraternized with the Jews, but considered themselves free from the Mosaic Law. The importance and exalted ideas of these associations can be gathered from the fact that when someone asked Apollo of Klaros whether the Hypsistos alone was without beginning and end, he answered: \"He is the Lord of all, self-originated, self-produced, ruling all things in some ineffable way, encompassing the heavens, spreading out the earth, riding on the waves of the sea; mixing fire with water, soil with air, and earth with fire; of winter, summer, autumn, and spring, causing the changes in their season, leading all things towards the light and settling their fate in harmonious order.\" The existence of these Hypsistarians must have been partially responsible for the astounding swiftness of the spread of Christianity in Asia Minor, yet not all of them accepted the new faith, and small communities of monotheists, neither Christians nor Jews, continued to exist, especially in Cappadocia. The father of Gregory of Nazianzus belonged to such a sect in his youth, and they are described in his panegyric written by his son. They rejected idols and pagan sacrifices, and acknowledged the Creator (pantokrator) and the Most High, to whom however, in opposition to the Christians, they refused the title of \"Father\"; they had some superstitions in common with the Jews, their worship of fire and light, the keeping of the Sabbath, the distinctions of food, but circumcision they rejected. No doubt Persius had Hypsistarians in view when he ridiculed such hybrid religionists in Satire v, 179-184, and Tertullian seems to refer to them in \"Ad nationes\", I, xiii. The statement that Hypsistarians continued to exist till the ninth century, is based on a mistaken interpretation of Nicephorus Const., \"Antirhet. adv. Const. Copr.\", I, in Migne, P.G., col. 209. Hypsistarians are probably referred to under the name Coelicoloe in a decree of the Emperors Honorius and Theodosius (A.D. 408), in which their places of worship are transferred to the Catholics.\n\nThe Jews of Syria and Anatolia identified Sabazios with Sabaoth. Under the Roman rulers Sabazios was worshiped in Thrace, where he was more often known as Sebazios or, in Latin, Sabazius, Sabadius, or Sebadius and where he received such epithets as epekoos (\"benevolent\"), kurios (\"lord\"), megistos (\"greatest\"), and so forth. In Crimea, probably under Jewish-Anatolian influence, he was called hupsistos. He was constantly identified with both Zeus and the sun. Motifs of hands making the votive gesture of benedictio Latina are among the distinctive features of his cult. According to several Christian writers the most impressive rite of initiation into the mysteries of Sabazios consisted of the adept's contact with a snakethat was first put over his breast  and then pulled down to his genitals.\n\nNo less enigmatic than Zalmoxis, Sabazios was worshiped as early as the fourth century bce both as a chthonic and as a heavenly god. Scholars have too often tried to solve this riddle by supposing a borrowing from Jewish religion, but Jewish influence was not relevant in Anatolia before the third century bce. One should rather consider that chthonic features determined the character of the Thracian Sabazios, whereas the Phrygian Sabazios was probably connected with the sky.\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #sabazios #hypsistos",

At least 10,000 Roman sarcophagi have survived, with fragments possibly representing as many as 20,000.  Although mythological scenes have been quite widely studied,  sarcophagus relief has been called the \"richest single source of Roman iconography,\"  and may also depict the deceased's occupation or life course, military scenes, and other subject matter. The same workshops produced sarcophagi with Jewish or Christian imagery. Early Christian sarcophagi produced from the late 3rd century onwards, represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of Early Christian art.\n\nThey were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and Athens, which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the stela gravestone remained more common. They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands. Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. \"Roman\" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while \"Attic\" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types. \n\nThe time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and portraits of the deceased were slow to appear. The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on Greek and Roman mythology or mystery religions that offered personal salvation, and allegorical representations. Roman funerary art also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors.  Early Christian art quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the Life of Christ in two rows within an architectural framework. The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (ca. 359) is of this type, and the earlier Dogmatic Sarcophagus rather simpler. The huge porphyry Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina are grand Imperial examples.\n\nCremation was the predominant means of disposing of remains in the Roman Republic. Ashes contained in cinerary urns and other monumental vessels were placed in tombs. From the 2nd century AD onward, inhumation became more common, and after the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, was standard practice. The Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus is a rare example from much earlier. A sarcophagus, which means \"flesh-eater\" in Greek, is a stone coffin used for inhumation burials. Sarcophagi were commissioned not only for the elite of Roman society (mature male citizens) but also for children, entire families, and beloved wives and mothers. The most expensive sarcophagi were made from marble, but other stones, lead, and wood were used as well. Along with the range in production material, there existed a variety of styles and shapes, depending on where the sarcophagus was produced and whom it was produced for.\n\nA transition from the classical garland and seasonal reliefs with smaller mythological figures to a greater focus on full mythological scenes began with the break up of the classical style in the late second century towards the end of Marcus Aurelius' reign. This shift led to the development of popular themes and meanings portrayed through mythological scenes and allegories. The most popular mythological scenes on Roman sarcophagi functioned as aids to mourning, visions of life and happiness, and opportunities for self-portrayal for Roman citizens.\n\n\n\n#gnosticinformant #galilee #romanempire",

On the side, she carves out time for speaking and writing on marriage in the Bible. Her background within the United Methodist Church, education in a Presbyterian affiliated institution, time spent in several ministerial contexts, six years of graduate work in biblical studies, and more than 20 years of teaching in classrooms of all kinds all inform her approach to having quite honest, and sometimes difficult, conversations about what is actually to be found in the scriptures of the Christian Bible.\n\n \n\nNo question, her favorite conversations include\n\ngender, sexuality, and marriage:\n\nwhat the Bible does and does not say about them!\n\nEducation\n \nBS Mathematics, Education Minor\n Virginia Tech . 1994\n \n\nMaster of Divinity\nPrinceton Theological Seminary . 2001\n \n\n​PhD, New Testament & Early Christianity\nVanderbilt University . 2007\n\nHomosexuality has been at the forefront of debate in the church for the last quarter century, with biblical interpretation at its heart. In the Man Jesus Loved, Jennings proposes a gay affirmative reading of the Bible in the hope of respecting the integrity of these texts and making them more clear as well as more persuasive. This reading suggests that the exclusion of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or same-sex practices fundamentally distorts the Bible generally and the traditions concerning Jesus in particular.\n\nhe phrase \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" is used six times in the Gospel of John,[1] but in no other New Testament accounts of Jesus. John 21:24 states that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of this disciple.\n\nSince the end of the first century, the Beloved Disciple has been commonly identified with John the Evangelist.  Scholars have debated the authorship of Johannine literature (the Gospel of John, Epistles of John, and the Book of Revelation) since at least the third century, but especially since the Enlightenment. The authorship by John the Apostle is rejected by many modern scholars,  but not entirely. There is a consensus among Johannine scholars that the Beloved Disciple was a real historical person, but there is no consensus on who the beloved disciple was.\n\nThe disciple whom Jesus loved is referred to, specifically, six times in the Gospel of John:\n\nIt is this disciple who, while reclining beside Jesus at the Last Supper, asks Jesus who it is that will betray him, after being requested by Peter to do so.\nLater at the crucifixion, Jesus tells his mother, \"Woman, here is your son\", and to the Beloved Disciple he says, \"Here is your mother.\" \nWhen Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb, she runs to tell the Beloved Disciple and Peter. The two men rush to the empty tomb and the Beloved Disciple is the first to reach it. However, Peter is the first to enter.\nIn John 21, the last chapter of the Gospel of John, the Beloved Disciple is one of seven fishermen involved in the miraculous catch of 153 fish.\nAlso in the book's final chapter, after Jesus implies the manner in which Peter will die, Peter sees the Beloved Disciple following them and asks, \"What about him?\" Jesus answers, \"If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.\" \nAgain in the Gospel's last chapter, it states that the very book itself is based on the written testimony of the disciple whom Jesus loved.\nThe other Gospels do not mention anyone in parallel circumstances who could be directly linked to the Beloved Disciple. For example, in Luke 24:12,  Peter runs to the tomb. Matthew, Mark, and Luke do not mention any one of the 12 disciples having witnessed the crucifixion.\n\nAlso, the New Testament makes two references to an unnamed \"other disciple\" in John 1:35-40 and John 18:15-16,[17] which may be to the same person based on the wording in John 20:2.\n\n#gnosticinformant #jenniferbird #beloveddisciple",

(Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nConventional approaches to the Synoptic gospels argue that the gospel authors acted as literate spokespersons for their religious communities. Whether described as documenting intra-group 'oral traditions' or preserving the collective perspectives of their fellow Christ-followers, these writers are treated as something akin to the Romantic poet speaking for their Volk - a questionable framework inherited from nineteenth-century German Romanticism. In this book, Robyn Faith Walsh argues that the Synoptic gospels were written by elite cultural producers working within a dynamic cadre of literate specialists, including persons who may or may not have been professed Christians. Comparing a range of ancient literature, her ground-breaking study demonstrates that the gospels are creative works produced by educated elites interested in Judean teachings, practices, and paradoxographical subjects in the aftermath of the Jewish War and in dialogue with the literature of their age. Walsh's study thus bridges the artificial divide between research on the Synoptic gospels and Classics.\n\nThe Greco-Roman civilizatio as understood by modern scholars and writers, includes the geographical regions and countries that culturally—and so historically—were directly and intimately influenced by the language, culture, government and religion of the Greeks and Romans. A better-known term is classical civilization. In exact terms the area refers to the \"Mediterranean world\", the extensive tracts of land centered on the Mediterranean and Black Sea Basins, the \"swimming pool and spa\" of the Greeks and the Romans, in which those peoples' cultural perceptions, ideas, and sensitivities became dominant in classical antiquity.\n\nThat process was aided by the universal adoption of Greek as the language of intellectual culture and commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean and of Latin as the language of public administration and of forensic advocacy, especially in the Western Mediterranean.\n\nGreek and Latin were never the native languages of many or most of the rural peasants, who formed the great majority of the Roman Empire's population, but they became the languages of the urban and cosmopolitan elites and the Empire's lingua franca, even if only as corrupt or multifarious dialects for those who lived within the large territories and populations outside the Macedonian settlements and the Roman colonies. All Roman citizens of note and accomplishment, regardless of their ethnic extractions, spoke and wrote in Greek or Latin. Examples include the Roman jurist and imperial chancellor Ulpian, who was of Phoenician origin; the mathematician and geographer Claudius Ptolemy, who was of Greco-Egyptian origin; and the famous post-Constantinian thinkers John Chrysostom and Augustine, who were of Syrian and Berber origins respectively. Note too the historian Josephus Flavius, who was of Jewish origin but spoke and wrote in Greek.\n\n\n\n#robynfaithwalsh #gnosticinformant #christianity",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nFor the book and Ross Nichols:\nhttps://themosesscroll.com/\n\nFor Part Two of this Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C83dnf4na4c&t=103s\n\nThe following account is an excerpt from The Moses Scroll (pages 82-85). On the heels of the publication of Ginsburg’s forgery declaration, the pace of attacks from all quarters of the Academic world increased. News out of Germany hit the papers on 28 August 1883. Meanwhile, Shapira wrote a lengthy rebuttal to Ginsburg’s published report of 27 August from Amsterdam.\n\nThe Times correspondent in Berlin wanted to confirm the rumors that the Germans had made an offer to purchase the fragments, “notwithstanding their verdicts,” but that the price offered was not acceptable to Shapira  But it remained unclear who those friends were. If the message reached any of his English friends, they elected to keep the matter secret or disregard the warning. No one ever mentioned hearing anything whatsoever from anyone in Germany regarding the authenticity of the scroll. It is also interesting to note that none of those who offered excuses for the silence on the part of the German scholars were in the meeting! Moses Wilhelm Shapira had presented his leather strips to the best scholars in Germany and England. They had all come to the same conclusion.\n\nAs the scholarly world lined up to declare their condemnation of Shapira’s manuscript, each claiming he knew it was forged all along, Shapira arrived in Amsterdam. On Tuesday, 28 August, he wrote a lengthy letter to Edward Augustus Bond, chief librarian for the British Museum, countering many of the points Ginsburg had proffered as evidence of forgery. His previous note to Ginsburg, as well as this note to Bond, revealed Shapira’s state of mind. Despite the growing number of opinions against the authenticity of the manuscript, he remained convinced. He would do his best to convince someone of the same.\n\nShapira then directly countered the arguments of Ginsburg. First on the list was Ginsburg’s theory that the forger, or part of Ginsburg’s hypothetical team of forgers, was a Polish Jew. \n\nAn example of one of Ginsburg’s arguments was, “In the north of Europe, moreover, the Jews pronounce alike the letters teth and tau. This accounts for the otherwise inexplicable spelling in this document of the word rendered ‘frontlets’ in our Authorized Version.” Shapira countered this in several ways. First, this word is repeated in prayer by religious Jews three times daily. Not even an “ignorant Jew if he only knew to read a little Hebrew would have mistaken and miswritten that word.” He then made the point that even though the word appears three times in the Bible (Exod 13:16; Deut 6:8; 11:18), no one even knows what it means. He said that the translation of “frontlets,” was “by imagination.” Shapira argued that this word, as it appears in the Bible, may not even be of Hebrew origin. Additionally, the word in question is difficult to read in the manuscript, a point that Ginsburg and Guthe both noted in their transcriptions. Finally, Shapira asked why a Polish Jew and the forgery team would only make the teth and tau mistake in a single word and not throughout the entire scroll.\n\nShapira demonstrated an erudite knowledge of Hebrew as he countered other points of Ginsburg’s statement. At the end of the letter he said, “I am not convinced that the manuscripts are false. Nevertheless, I do not wish to sell it even if the buyer should take the risk for himself (I have such offers), unless to authorities.” Clearly, this letter shows that Shapira still believed in the genuineness of his manuscript. It was no longer about the money. He had tried the path that might lead to what Meyer had called “a colossal sum,” but now he wanted only to save his good name.\nAs August of 1883 came to a close, Hermann Guthe’s assessment of the Shapira MSS was published without notice or fanfare in Leipzig.\n\n\nGuthe concluded his publication with the following comments: “The examination of the text has led to the certain realization that the manuscript is a forgery.… It is not the artistry of a gifted craftsman to which we must, as must others attribute this forgery. Its originator is at least a dilettante in the area of Old Testament science, scarcely a representative thereof by profession—his work must, then, in any case count as a witness of arguably good facilities…. He shows, namely, in the last part of his work, a quite good handling of Hebrew expression, has language understanding, as the application of interpuncts in the Decalogue proves, has certain epigraphical knowledge, is familiar with multiple results of Pentateuch criticism, was able to giftedly recognize doublets in our Bible text, but betrays, in his critical operations, the complete lack of a firm method.“\n\n\n\n#moses #gnosticinformant #shapirascroll",

    "description": "In modern scholarship, the Christ myth theory is considered a fringe theory, and finds virtually no support from scholars to the point of being addressed in footnotes or almost completely ignored due to the obvious weaknesses they espouse. Common criticisms against the Christ myth theory include: general lack of expertise or relationship to academic institutions and current scholarship; reliance on arguments from silence, dismissal of what sources actually state, and superficial comparisons with mythologies.\n\nAccording to agnostic scholar Bart D. Ehrman, nearly all scholars who study the early Christian period believe that Jesus did exist, and Ehrman observes that mythicist writings are generally of poor quality because they are usually authored by amateurs and non-scholars who have no academic credentials or have never taught at academic institutions. Maurice Casey, an agnostic scholar of New Testament and early Christianity, stated that the belief among professors that Jesus existed is generally completely certain. According to Casey, the view that Jesus did not exist is \"the view of extremists\", \"demonstrably false\" and \"professional scholars generally regard it as having been settled in serious scholarship long ago\".\n\nIn 1977, classical historian and popular author Michael Grant in his book Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels, concluded that \"modern critical methods fail to support the Christ-myth theory\". \nIf we apply to the New Testament, as we should, the same sort of criteria as we should apply to other ancient writings containing historical material, we can no more reject Jesus' existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.\n\nGraeme Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Classical Ancient History and Archaeology at Australian National University stated in 2008: \"Frankly, I know of no ancient historian or biblical historian who would have a twinge of doubt about the existence of a Jesus Christ—the documentary evidence is simply overwhelming\". R. Joseph Hoffmann, who had created the Jesus Project, which included both mythicists and historicists to investigate the historicity of Jesus, wrote that an adherent to the Christ myth theory asked to set up a separate section of the project for those committed to the position. Hoffmann also called the mythicist theory \"fatally flawed\".\n\nPhilip Jenkins, Distinguished Professor of History at Baylor University, wrote, \"What you can't do, though, without venturing into the far swamps of extreme crankery, is to argue that Jesus never existed. The 'Christ-Myth Hypothesis' is not scholarship, and is not taken seriously in respectable academic debate. The grounds advanced for the 'hypothesis' are worthless. The authors proposing such opinions might be competent, decent, honest individuals, but the views they present are demonstrably wrong. ... Jesus is better documented and recorded than pretty much any non-elite figure of antiquity.\"\n\nAccording to Daniel Gullotta, most of the mythicist literature contains \"wild theories, which are poorly researched, historically inaccurate, and written with a sensationalist bent for popular audiences.\"\n\nAccording to James F. McGrath and Christopher Hansen, mythicists sometimes rely on questionable and outdated methods like Rank and Raglan mythotypes that end up resulting in misclassifying real historical persons as mythical figures.\n\nFew of these mythicists are actually scholars trained in ancient history, religion, biblical studies or any cognate field, let alone in the ancient languages generally thought to matter for those who want to say something with any degree of authority about a Jewish teacher who (allegedly) lived in first-century Palestine. ... These views are so extreme and so unconvincing to 99.99% of the real experts that anyone holding them is as likely to get a teaching job in an established department of religion as a six-day creationist is likely to land on in a bona fide department of biology.\n\nIn 2000 Van Voorst gave an overview of proponents of the \"Nonexistence Hypothesis\" and their arguments, presenting seven arguments against the hypothesis as put forward by \"Wells and his predecessors\":\n\n\"Arguments from silence\" are to be rejected, because \"it is wrong to suppose that what is unmentioned or undetailed did not exist\". Van Voorst further argued that the early Christian literature was not written for historical purposes.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on.

David Litwa (Ph.D):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmeuaHHwq9ssljFa4aN_Eg\n\n\nIt is one of the Hermetic texts and follows the common pattern of a dialog between teacher and student.\n\nIn the Hermetica, most often the teacher is Hermes Trismegistos and the student Asclepios, Ammon, or “Tat,” the son of Hermes. In the Kore Kosmou, Isis is the teacher and Her son, Horus, is the student.\n\nCertainly, there were many more Hermetica than what has come down to us. It also seems likely that there were once more Isis-as-teacher texts than just the Kore Kosmou and the few fragments we have. This, of course, would make a great deal of sense: Isis and Thoth-Hermes—Egypt’s two great and wise Magician Deities—serving as the main Hermetic teachers. It is interesting to note that, as time goes on, more and more scholars are recognizing the genuinely Egyptian elements that are such an important part of the Hermetica. More on that later.\n\nBut in case you’re not familiar with Hermeticism and the Hermetica, here’s a brief introduction and then we’ll delve into Andrea’s question about the Kore Kosmou and discuss what the text contains.\n\nHermeticism & the Hermetic Texts\nHermes Trismegistos as a human sage, from the Siena Cathedral\nHermes Trismegistos as a human sage, from the Siena Cathedral\nHermeticism began as a late Pagan branch of esotericism and was one of the many products of the meeting of the ancient Hellenic and Egyptian cultures in the centuries surrounding the beginning of the Common Era. The primordial and venerable religion of Egypt, its ancient wisdom, and its eternal magic combined with the dominant Greek culture, religion, and philosophy to produce a powerful mix that continues to influence esotericism to the present day.\n\nHermeticism’s most fertile home was the great syncretic Egyptian capital city of Alexandria—a city that had honored Isis from its inception and which left an indelible stamp upon the Hermetic tradition. As religious wisdom and philosophy flowed into Alexandria from many cultures, it likewise flowed into Hermeticism. In addition to Egyptian and Greek Paganism, Judaism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Iranian Zoroastrian all added to the Hermetic amalgamation.\n\nThoth; Trismegistos’ Egyptian original\nThe Hermetic texts address a wide range of topics, including cosmic principles, the nature and orders of Being and beings, the human desire to know the Divine, astrology, alchemy, magic, and medicine, among others.\n\nScholars generally place the individual texts of the Hermetica in one of two camps: the philosophical and religious Hermetica, or the technical—that is, magical or theurgic—Hermetica. The main philosophical Hermetic texts that have come down to us are contained in the Corpus Hermeticum, a collection of approximately 17 treatises written in Latin and Greek. The exact date for the composition of the texts is unknown, but they are usually thought to be dated to the second or third centuries CE. Technical Hermetica range more broadly, and are tentatively dated to a period spanning the first century CE to the fourth. It is quite possible, however, that at least some of the texts were based on significantly earlier models.\n\n\n#mdavidlitwa #korekosmou #hermetica #gnosticinformant #greekmythology #egyptian #mythvision #mythology",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nGet the Book from Bruce Chilton Ph.D:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Herods-Murder-Politics-Art-Succession/dp/1506474284\n\nUntil his death in 4 BCE, Herod the Great's monarchy included territories that once made up the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Although he ruled over a rich, strategically crucial land, his royal title did not derive from heredity. His family came from the people of Idumea, ancient antagonists of the Israelites.\n\nYet Herod did not rule as an outsider, but from a family committed to Judaism going back to his grandfather and father. They had served the priestly dynasty of the Maccabees that had subjected Idumea to their rule, including the Maccabean version of what loyalty to the Torah required. Herod's father, Antipater, rose not only to manage affairs on behalf of his priestly masters, but to become a pivotal military leader. He inaugurated a new alignment of power: an alliance with Rome negotiated with Pompey and Julius Caesar. In the crucible of civil war among Romans as the Triumvirate broke up, and of war between Rome and Parthia, Antipater managed to leave his sons with the prospect of a dynasty.\n\nHerod inherited the twin pillars of loyalty to Judaism and loyalty to Rome that became the basis of Herodian rule. He elevated Antipater's opportunism to a political art. During Herod's time, Roman power took its imperial form, and Octavian was responsible for making Herod king of Judea. As Octavian ruled, he took the title Augustus, in keeping with his devotion to his adoptive father's cult of \"the divine Julius.\" Imperial power was a theocratic assertion as well as a dominant military, economic, and political force.\n\nHerod framed a version of theocratic ambition all his own, deliberately crafting a dynastic claim grounded in Roman might and Israelite theocracy. That unlikely hybrid was the key to the Herodians' surprising longevity in power during the most chaotic century in the political history of Judaism.\n\n\nIsrael Go Fund Me:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/trip-to-israel-with-archaeologist-to-make-content\n\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\nThe Course for Mystery Cults by Professor Litwa is NOW AVAILABLE!!!

While researching celestial mythology at Brigham Young University, John McHugh stumbled upon the arcane code that is the template for the legends and miracles in all Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic scriptures.\nThis code was embedded in the archaic Mesopotamian belief system that conceptualized the astral sky as the “heavens,” and its constellations and planets as deities inhabiting this divine realm. Celestial tableaux were understood as historical scenes that had once taken place on earth. Mesopotamian astronomers were regarded as magicians, the magi, whose task was to interpret and elaborate secretly on this “Heavenly Writing”― the literal writing of the gods. The Celestial Code of Scriptures is the first book to present and explain this secret Mesopotamian cipher.\n\n\n\n#nativeamerican #colombus #indigenous",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\nThe Course for Mystery Cults by Professor Litwa is NOW AVAILABLE!!! \n\nIASION was an agricultural hero and the springtime consort of Demeter in the Samothracian Mysteries.\n\nIasion lay with the goddess in a thrice-ploughed field during the wedding celebrations of Kadmos (Cadmus) and Harmonia on the island of Samothrake. When Zeus learned of the affair he slew Iasion with a thunderbolt. According to some Iasion and the agricultural hero Triptolemos were afterwards placed amongst the stars as the constellation Gemini (the Heavenly Twins).\n\nIasion was perhaps equated with Attis, the dying consort of the Phrygian goddess Kybele (Cybele), and Karmanor (Carmanor), Demeter's consort on the island of Krete (Crete). Hesiod appears to equate the two when he places Iasion in Krete. The meaning of the name Iasion is obscure but it may connected with the Greek word for bindweed, a small white-flowering vine commonly found growing in wheat fields entwined around the grain-stalks.\n\nIASION (Iasiôn), also called Iasius, was, according to some, a son of Zeus and Electra, the daughter of Atlas, and a brother of Dardanus (Apollod. iii. 12. § 1; Serv. ad Aen. i. 384; Hes. Theog. 970; Ov. Amor. iii. 10, 25); but others called him a son of Corythus and Electra, of Zeus and the nymph Hemera, or of Ilithyius, or of Minos and the nymph Pyronia. (Schol. ad Theocrit. iii. 30; Serv. ad Aen. iii. 167; Eustath. ad Hom p. 1528; Hygin. Fab. 270.) At the wedding of his sister Harmonia, Demeter fell in love with him, and in a thrice-ploughed field (tripolos) she became by him the mother of Pluton or Plutus in Crete, in consequence of which Zeus killed him with a flash of lightning. Iasion was slain by Dardanus, and according to Hyginus (Fab. 250) he was killed by his own horses, whereas others represent him as living to an advanced age as the husband of Demeter. (Ov. Met. ix. 421, &c.) In some traditions Eetion is mentioned as the only brother of Dardanus (Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 916; Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 219), whence some critics have inferred that Iasion and Eetion are only two names for the same person. A further tradition states that Iasion and Dardanus, being driven from their home by a flood, went from Italy, Crete, or Arcadia, to Samothrace, whither he carried the Palladium, and where Zeus himself instructed him in the mysteries of Demeter.\n\nHomer, Odyssey 5. 125 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :\n\"[Hermes commands Kalypso (Calypso) to release Odysseus :] Kalypso shuddered, and her words came forth in rapid flight : ‘You are merciless, you gods, resentful beyond all other beings; you are jealous if without disguise a goddess makes a man her bedfellow, her beloved husband . . . So it was when Demeter of the braided tresses followed her heart and lay in love with Iasion in the triple-furrowed field; Zeus was aware of it soon enough and hurled the bright thunderbolt and killed him.’\"\n[N.B. the cutting of three furrows was part of fertility rites performed to inaugurate the new agricultural year.]\n\nHesiod, Theogony  (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) :\n\"Demeter, bright goddess, was joined in sweet love with the hero Iasion in a thrice-ploughed fallow in the rich land of Krete (Crete), and bare Ploutos (Plutus, Wealth), a kindly god who goes everywhere over land and the sea's wide back, and him who finds him and into whose hands he comes he makes rich, bestowing great wealth upon him.\"\n\nClement, Exhortation to the Greeks 2. 12 (trans. Butterworth) (Greek Christian writer C2nd A.D.) :\n\"[An early Christian critique of the pagan Mysteries :] A curse then upon the man who started this deception for mankind, whether it be Dardanos, who introduced the Mysteria for of the Meter Theon (Mother of the Gods); or Eetion [i.e. Iasion], who founded the Samothracian orgies and rites (orgia, teletas).\"\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 250 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :\n\"Teams [of horses] which destroyed their drivers . . . Horses destroyed Iasion, son of Jove [Zeus] by Electra, daughter of Atlas.\" [N.B. Presumably Iasion was killed when Zeus cast his lightning bolt, causing his horses to bolt in panic and throwing him from the chariot.]\n\nPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 270 :\n\"Those who were most handsome. Iasion, son of Ilithius, whom Ceres [Demeter] is said to have loved.\"\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses 9. 421 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :\n\"A rumbling argument arose in heaven, the gods all grumbling why others should not be able to grant such gifts [the restoration of youth to the elderly, the sole prerogative of the goddess Hebe]. Aurora [Eos] grumbled at her husband's [Tithonos'] age, and gentle Ceres [Demeter] that Iasion was going grey.\"\n\n#iasios #iasion #greekmythology",

Ehrman (Ph.D Princeton)\nBart Denton Ehrman[a] (born 1955) is an American New Testament scholar focusing on textual criticism of the New Testament, the historical Jesus, and the origins and development of early Christianity. He has written and edited 30 books, including three college textbooks. He has also authored six New York Times bestsellers. He is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nEhrman currently serves as co-editor of the series New Testament Tools, Studies, and Documents (E. J. Brill), co-editor-in-chief for the journal Vigiliae Christianae, and on several other editorial boards for journals and monographs. Ehrman formerly served as president of the Southeast Region of the Society of Biblical Literature, chair of the New Testament textual criticism section of the society, book review editor of the Journal of Biblical Literature, and editor of the monograph series The New Testament in the Greek Fathers (Scholars Press).\nIn 2006 he appeared on The Colbert Report and The Daily Show, to promote his book Misquoting Jesus, and in 2009 reappeared on The Colbert Report with the release of Jesus, Interrupted. Ehrman has appeared on the History Channel, the National Geographic Channel, Discovery Channel, A&E, Dateline NBC, CNN, and NPR's Fresh Air and his writings have been featured in Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Washington Post.\n\nMoses, Hebrew Moshe, (flourished 14th–13th century BCE), Hebrew prophet, teacher, and leader who, in the 13th century BCE (before the Common Era, or BC), delivered his people from Egyptian slavery. In the Covenant ceremony at Mt. Sinai, where the Ten Commandments were promulgated, he founded the religious community known as Israel. \n\nFew historical figures have engendered such disparate interpretations as has Moses. Early Jewish and Christian traditions considered him the author of the Torah (“Law,” or “Teaching”), also called the Pentateuch (“Five Books”), comprising the first five books of the Bible, and some conservative groups still believe in Mosaic authorship.\nOther critical methods (studying the biblical text from the standpoint of literary form, oral tradition, style, redaction, and archaeology) are equally valid. The most accurate answer to a critical problem is therefore likely to come from the convergence of various lines of evidence. The aid of critical scholarship notwithstanding, the sources are so sketchy that the man Moses can be portrayed only in broad outline.\nAccording to the biblical account, Moses’ parents were from the tribe of Levi, one of the groups in Egypt called Hebrews. Originally the term Hebrew had nothing to do with race or ethnic origin. It derived from Habiru, a variant spelling of Ḫapiru (Apiru), a designation of a class of people who made their living by hiring themselves out for various services. The biblical Hebrews had been in Egypt for generations, but apparently they became a threat, so one of the pharaohs enslaved them. Unfortunately, the personal name of the king is not given, and scholars have disagreed as to his identity and, hence, as to the date of the events of the narrative of Moses. One theory takes literally the statement in I Kings 6:1 that the Exodus from Egypt occurred 480 years before Solomon began building the Temple in Jerusalem. This occurred in the fourth year of his reign, about 960 BCE; therefore, the Exodus would date about 1440 BCE.\nThis conclusion, however, is at variance with most of the biblical and archaeological evidence. The storage cities Pitḥom and Rameses, built for the pharaoh by the Hebrews, were located in the northeastern part of the Egyptian delta, not far from Goshen, the district in which the Hebrews lived. It is implicit in the whole story that the pharaoh’s palace and capital were in the area, but Thutmose III (the pharaoh in 1440) had his capital at Thebes, far to the south, and never conducted major building operations in the delta region. Moreover, Edom and Moab, petty kingdoms in Transjordan that forced Moses to circle east of them, were not yet settled and organized. Finally, as excavations have shown, the destruction of the cities the Hebrews claimed to have captured occurred about 1250, not 1400.\n\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/finding-moses/\n⬆️⬆️⬆️LINK FOR COURSE ⬆️⬆️⬆️\n💥💥💥💥🚨💥🚨💥🚨💥💥💥 (Click either one)\n⬇️⬇️⬇️LINK FOR COURSE ⬇️⬇️⬇️\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/finding-moses/\n\n#bartehrman #gnosticinformant #moses",

White:\n   @Crecganford \nhttps://crecganford.com/\n\nThe story of House of the Dragon will center on the Iron Throne as did Game of Thrones, meaning Aegon Targaryen (an eventual King of Westeros) and his dragon Sunfyre will play a part in the show. Sunfyre, despite being one of the younger dragons on the show, is still massive in scale. Sunfyre is known as Sunfyre the Golden due to his gleaming golden scales. One thing that is interesting about Sunfyre is his golden flames that seem to match the color of his scaling.\nDaeron Targaryen is the younger brother of Aegon and rides a female dragon named Tessarion. Tessarion, similarly to Meleys, is known as the Blue Queen due to the dark cobalt blue color of her wings and will appear in the HBOMax TV show. Like Sunfyre, Tessarion's flames match the color of her scales, burning a bright blue. Tessarion also differs from the other dragons in that her belly scales and claws are bright bronze colored, contrasting with the dark blue of the bulk of Tessarion's body.\nAemond Targaryen, brother of Daeron and Aegon, is a dragon rider alongside his siblings. Aemond rides Vhagar, who was one of the three dragons used by the Targaryens to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. Vhagar, during the time of the conquest, was ridden by Queen Visenya Targaryen before being passed down through generations to become Aemond's mount. At the time of House of the Dragon, Vhagar is one of the largest dragons in Westeros, beaten only by Balerion in size. Vhagar is a bronze dragon with green/blue highlights and bright green eyes.\nThese are the main dragons that have Dragonriders in House of the Dragon, however, there will be many others in the show that may or may not play as big a part. Here is a round-up of some of the other dragons that could feature in House of the Dragon.\n\nDreamfyre (Halaena Targaryen's Dragon): Dreamfyre is a pale blue and silver dragon, ridden by Halaena the sister of Aemond, Daeron, and Aegon. Dreamfyre was initially ridden by Rhaena Targaryen, the granddaughter of Aegon the Conqueror.\nMoondancer (Baela Targaryen's Dragon): Baela rides Moondancer, one of the younger dragons in House of the Dragon, being only the size of a warhorse when Baela, the daughter of Matt Smith's Daemon Targaryen, first mounted her. Moondancer is a slender, green dragon described as being very quick both on land and in the sky.\n\nSilverwing (Ulf White's Dragon): Ulf White is a Targaryen bastard who rides Silverwing during the Dance of Dragons. Silverwing was initially ridden by Alysanne Targaryen, grandmother of King Viserys, and was a silver dragon who was docile and very friendly to strangers.\nSeasmoke: Seasmoke is a wild silver-grey dragon that lives on Dragonstone, the Targaryen stronghold from Game of Thrones. Eventually, during the Dance of Dragons, Seasmoke is claimed by Addam of Hull, a bastard who later became legitimized as Addam Valeryon during the Dance.\n\nSheepstealer: Like Seasmoke, Sheepstealer is a wild dragon from Dragonstone who earned his name due to his taste for mutton. Sheepstealer is a mud brown color and has only had one rider in Nettles, who tamed Sheepstealer by presenting the dragon with fresh mutton every day until he became accustomed to her.\nIt has been confirmed by the showrunners of House of the Dragon that 17 dragons will appear in the show, though surely to varying capacities. During the time of the Dance of Dragons in the books by George R. R. Martin, there are around 20 dragons in total. Given how House of the Dragon will lead up to the Dance of Dragons, the Targaryen Civil War, it would make sense for all dragons to appear. However, as only 17 dragons will appear in House of the Dragon, it appears some dragons may be removed that were present in the book.\nOne of these could be Cannibal, another wild dragon from Dragonstone who earns his name from eating dead dragons. This dragon could be removed from the show as he is one of the few dragons not to receive a rider at any point in the books. Another dragon that doesn't receive a rider, and is also wild like Cannibal and Sheepstealer, is Grey Ghost. Grey Ghost was named for his elusive nature and was eventually killed by Sunfyre, Aegon's dragon. As these two dragons don't have much of an impact on the story of House of the Dragon, it is likely they won't feature in the show. Balerion was the dragon ridden by Aegon the Conqueror and was instrumental in the conquest of Westeros and the foundation of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n#houseofthedragon #gameofthrones #dragons",

The disappointment of the second prediction was worse than the first one.\n\nIn 1284, Pope Innocent III (d. 1216) predicted that the world would end 666 years after the rise of Islam. (do you see how long the divide and conquer principle has been going on?)\n\nIn 1658, Christopher Columbus claimed that the world was created in 5343 BCE, and would last 7000 years. Assuming no year zero, that means the end would come in 1658.\n\nMathematician Jacob Bernoulli predicted a comet would destroy the earth on April 5, 1719.\n\nThe newly formed Seventh Day Adventists, a group founded by former Millerites, predicted the Second Coming would be in 1874.\n\nMother Shipton, a 15th-century prophet, was quoted as saying “The world to an end shall come, In eighteen hundred and eighty one” in a book published in 1862. In 1873 it was revealed to be a forgery; however, this did not stop some people from expecting the end.\n\nCamille Flammarion predicted that the 1910 appearance of Halley’s Comet might destroy life on Earth, but not the planet itself.\n\nEvangelist Wilbur Glenn Voliva announced that “the world is going to go ‘puff’ and disappear in September, 1935.\n\nOn December 21, 1954, according to Dorothy Martin, the world was to be destroyed by terrible flooding on this date, claimed this leader of a UFO cult called Brotherhood of the Seven Rays.\n\nPsychic Jeane Dixon predicted that on February 4, 1962, a planetary alignment was to bring destruction to the world.\n\nGeorge Van Tassel predicted the Apocalypse to occur on August 20, 1967, during which the southeastern US would be destroyed by a Soviet nuclear attack, according to this UFO prophet, who claimed to have channeled an alien named Ashtar.\n\nEvangelist Pat Robertson predicted in 1976 that the end of the world was coming in October or November 1982.\n\nJosé Argüelles claimed that Armageddon would take place on August 17, 1987 unless 144,000 people gathered in certain places in the world in order to “resonate in harmony” on this day.\n\nHal Lindsey suggested that the Rapture would take in 1987, reasoning that it was 40 years (one Biblical generation) after Israel gained statehood.\n\nLouis Farrakhanm, the leader of the Nation of Islam, declared that the Gulf War would be the “War of Armageddon which is the final war.”\n\nHarold Camping predicted the Rapture would occur on September 6, 1994. When it failed to occur he revised the date to September 29 and then to October 2 (and many more times afterwards).\n\nPat Robertson in his 1990 book The New Millennium, suggested April 29, 2007 as the day of Earth’s destruction.\n\nJonas Wendell – 1873\nIn 1870, Wendell published his views in the booklet entitled The Present Truth, or Meat in Due Season, concluding that the Second Advent was sure to occur in 1873.\n\nCatholic Apostolic Church – 1901\nThis church, founded in 1831, claimed that Jesus would return by the time the last of its 12 founding members died. The last member died in 1901, and Jesus has not come.\n\nThe disappointment has led to a gradual decline in church membership. The organization is barley known in some parts of the worlds.\n\nThe American mystic (psychic), Edgar Cayce, predicted Jesus Christ would return in the year 2000 as well.\n\nIf Newton was a true physicist and mathematician, surely he was a false prophet. In his book, Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John, he predicted Christ’s Millennium would begin in the year 2000.\n\nJames Harmston, the leader of the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days, also had his prediction for Jesus to come in 2000, precisely in April 6, 2001.\n\nGrigori Rasputin – Aug 23, 2013\nHe predicted a storm would hit the earth, causing a fire to destroy most life on land and Jesus Christ would return to earth to comfort those in distress.\n\nNostradamus said the world would end in 1999.\n\nMayan Calendar 2012\n\n\n#doomsday #apocalypse #endtimes #gnosticinformant",

When Osiris' body was cut in 14 pieces, Set scattered them all over Egypt and his wife Isis retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish; Isis made him a wooden replacement.\n\nThe phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god Min was often depicted as ithyphallic, that is, with an erect penis.\n\nIn traditional Greek mythology, Hermes, god of boundaries and exchange (popularly the messenger god) is considered to be a phallic deity by association with representations of him on herms (pillars) featuring a phallus. There is no scholarly consensus on this depiction and it would be speculation to consider Hermes a type of fertility god. Pan, son of Hermes, was often depicted as having an exaggerated erect phallus.\n\nPriapus is a Greek god of fertility whose symbol was an exaggerated phallus. The son of Aphrodite and Dionysus, according to Homer and most accounts, he is the protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens, and male genitalia. His name is the origin of the medical term priapism.\n\nThe city of Tyrnavos in Greece holds an annual Phallus festival, a traditional event celebrating the phallus on the first days of Lent.[4]\n\nThe phallus was ubiquitous in ancient Roman culture, particularly in the form of the fascinum, a phallic charm.[5][6] The ruins of Pompeii produced bronze wind chimes (tintinnabula) that featured the phallus, often in multiples, to ward off the evil eye and other malevolent influences. Statues of Priapus similarly guarded gardens. Roman boys wore the bulla, an amulet that contained a phallic charm, until they formally came of age. According to Augustine of Hippo, the cult of Father Liber, who presided over the citizen's entry into political and sexual manhood, involved a phallus. The phallic deity Mutunus Tutunus promoted marital sex. A sacred phallus was among the objects considered vital to the security of the Roman state which were in the keeping of the Vestal Virgins. Sexuality in ancient Rome has sometimes been characterized as \"phallocentric\".[7]\n\nAncient India\n\nIthyphallic Shiva, 3rd century AD\nShiva, the most widely worshipped male deity in Hinduism pantheon, is worshipped much more commonly in the form of the lingam. Evidence of the lingam in India dates back to prehistoric times. Although Lingam is neither a mere phallic iconography nor the textual sources signify it as so, stone Lingams with several varieties are found to this date in many of the old temples, and in museums in India and abroad, which are often more clearly phallic than later stylized lingams. The famous \"man-size\" Gudimallam Lingam in Andhra Pradesh is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) in height, carved in polished black granite, and clearly represents an erect phallus, with a figure of the deity in relief superimposed down the shaft.[8]\n\nMany of the earliest depictions of Shiva as a figure in human form are ithyphallic, as for example in coins of the Kushan Empire. Some figures up to about the 11th century AD have erect phalluses, although they become increasingly rare.\n\nIndonesia\nAccording to the Indonesian chronicles of the Babad Tanah Jawi, Prince Puger gained the kingly power from God, by ingesting sperm from the phallus of the already-dead Sultan Amangkurat II of Mataram.[9][10]\n\nBhutan\nThe phallus is commonly depicted in its paintings. Wooden phalluses, with white ribbons hanging from the tip, are often hung above the doorways of houses, to deter evil spirits.\n\nAncient Scandinavia\n\nHusavik Phallusmuseum (Icelandic Phallological Museum), Húsavík\nThe Norse god Freyr is a phallic deity, representing male fertility and love.\nThe short story Völsa þáttr describes a family of Norwegians worshiping a preserved horse penis.\nSome image stones, such as the Stora Hammers and Tängelgårda stones, were phallic shaped.\nIran\n\nKhaled Nabi cemetery in Iran with phallic tombstones. Dating pre-Islamic era.\nKhalid Nabi Cemetery (Persian: گورستان خالد نبی‎, \"Cemetery of the Prophet Khaled\") is a cemetery in northeastern Iran's Golestan province. Touristic visitors often have perceived the cylindrical shafts with the thicker top as depictions of male phalli. This gave rise to popular hypotheses about pre-Islamic fertility cults.\n\n\n#alexanderbard #gnosticinformant #tantra",

Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nIsrael Go Fund Me:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/trip-to-israel-with-archaeologist-to-make-content\n\nRabbi Tovia Singer:\nhttp://www.toviasinger.tv/\n@ToviaSinger1 \n\nSinger is the author of the book and audio series Let's Get Biblical: Why Doesn't Judaism Accept the Christian Messiah? His new expanded edition is a two-volume book that takes a critical look at long-standing Christian charges against the Jewish faith. According to David Brickner it has \"grabbed the attention of many evangelicals simply because it has been so widely distributed.\" A book review by Jewish Values Online described Singer as \"a master of his material\" and that \"his meticulous research and command of Biblical sources is most impressive.\"\n\nTogether with Eits Chaim Indonesia Foundation, whose founders are of Dutch Jewish descent, Singer started the only Jewish Center legally acknowledged by the Indonesian Minister of Religious Affairs - Torat Chaim. Since Judaism is not yet a recognized religion in Indonesia, religious freedom for Torat Chaim and its members is guaranteed and protected by the Christian Desk of the Indonesian Religious Affairs Department.\n\nIn Abrahamic religions, a messiah (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ, romanized: māšīyaḥ; Greek: Χριστός, ; Arabic: مسيح, masîḥ; lit. 'the anointed one') is a saviour or liberator of a group of people. \n\nHa-mashiach (המשיח, 'the Messiah' is to be a Jewish leader, physically descended from the paternal Davidic line through King David and King Solomon. He is thought to accomplish predetermined things in a future arrival, including the unification of the tribes of Israel, the gathering of all Jews to Eretz Israel, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, the ushering in of a Messianic Age of global universal peace, and the annunciation of the world to come.\n\nThe Greek translation of Messiah is Khristós (Χριστός) anglicized as Christ. Christians commonly refer to Jesus of Nazareth as either the \"Christ\" or the \"Messiah\", believing that the messianic prophecies were fulfilled in the mission, death, and resurrection of Jesus and that he will return to fulfill the rest of messianic prophecies.\n\nIn Jewish eschatology, the term came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be \"anointed\" with holy anointing oil, to be king of God's kingdom, and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be God or a pre-existent divine Son of God. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David, hence why he is referred to as Messiah ben David, 'Messiah, son of David'. In Judaism, the messiah is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism. He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear.\"\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).\n\nA common modern rabbinic interpretation is that there is a potential messiah in every generation. The Talmud, which often uses stories to make a moral point (aggadah), tells of a highly respected rabbi who found the Messiah at the gates of Rome and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"\n\n\n#toviasinger #messiah  #gnosticinformant",

The primary source for the incident is Paul's Epistle to the Galatians 2:11–14.Since the 19th century figure, Ferdinand Christian Baur, biblical scholars have found evidence of conflict among the leaders of early Christianity; for example, James D. G. Dunn proposes that Peter was a \"bridge-man\" between the opposing views of Paul and James, brother of Jesus. The final outcome of the incident remains uncertain, resulting in several Christian views on the Old Covenant.\n\nAccording to church tradition, Peter and Paul taught together in Rome and founded Christianity in that city. Eusebius cites Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth as saying, \"They taught together in like manner in Italy, and suffered martyrdom at the same time.\" This may indicate their reconciliation. In 2 Peter 3:16, Paul's letters are referred to as \"scripture\", which indicates the respect the writer had for Paul's apostolic authority. However, most modern scholars regard the Second Epistle of Peter as written in Peter's name by another author.\n\nRomulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. Traditionally, they were the sons of Rhea Silvia, daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa.\nNumitor had been deposed by his younger brother Amulius, who forced Rhea to become one of the Vestal Virgins (and thereby vow chastity) in order to prevent her from giving birth to potential claimants to the throne. Nevertheless, Rhea bore the twins Romulus and Remus, fathered by the war god Mars. Amulius ordered the infants drowned in the Tiber River, but the trough in which they were placed floated down the river and came to rest at the site of the future Rome, near the Ficus ruminalis, a sacred fig tree of historical times. There a she-wolf and a woodpecker—both sacred to Mars—suckled and fed them until they were found by the herdsman Faustulus.\n\nReared by Faustulus and his wife, Acca Larentia, the twins became leaders of a band of adventurous youths, eventually killing Amulius and restoring their grandfather to the throne. They subsequently founded a town on the site where they had been saved. When Romulus built a city wall, Remus jumped over it and was killed by his brother.\nRomulus consolidated his power, and the city was named for him. He increased its population by offering asylum to fugitives and exiles. He invited the neighbouring Sabines to a festival and abducted their women. The women married their captors and intervened to prevent the Sabines from seizing the city. In accordance with a treaty drawn up between the two peoples, Romulus accepted the Sabine king Titus Tatius as his coruler. Titus Tatius’s early death left Romulus sole king again, and, after a long rule, he mysteriously disappeared in a storm. Believing that he had been changed into a god, the Romans worshipped him as the deity Quirinus.\n\nThe famous bronze statue of a she-wolf now in the Capitoline Museums in Rome is believed to date to the early years of the Roman Republic (late 6th to early 5th century BCE); the suckling twins were added in the 16th century CE. Some scholars, however, have claimed that the statue is from the medieval period.\n\nPeter & Paul's statues now stand as guards in front of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City Rome.\n\n\n#Johndominiccrossan #acts  #romanmythology",

Prometheus is best known for defying the gods by stealing fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge, and more generally, civilization. In some versions of the myth he is also credited with the creation of humanity from clay. Prometheus is known for his intelligence and for being a champion of humankind, and is also generally seen as the author of the human arts and sciences. He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion, the hero of the flood story.\n\nThe punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft of fire and giving it to humans is a popular subject of both ancient and modern culture. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, sentenced Prometheus to eternal torment for his transgression. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle—the emblem of Zeus—was sent to eat his liver (in ancient Greece, the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions). His liver would then grow back overnight, only to be eaten again the next day in an ongoing cycle. According to several major versions of the myth, most notably that of Hesiod, Prometheus was eventually freed by the hero Heracles. In yet more symbolism, the struggle of Prometheus is located by some at Mount Elbrus or at Mount Kazbek, two volcanic promontories in the Caucasus Mountains beyond which for the ancient Greeks lay the realm of the barbarii.\n\nIn another myth, Prometheus establishes the form of animal sacrifice practiced in ancient Greek religion. Evidence of a cult to Prometheus himself is not widespread. He was a focus of religious activity mainly at Athens, where he was linked to Athena and Hephaestus, who were the Greek deities of creative skills and technology.\n\nIn the Western classical tradition, Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving (particularly the quest for scientific knowledge) and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences. In particular, he was regarded in the Romantic era as embodying the lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence could also result in tragedy: Mary Shelley, for instance, gave The Modern Prometheus as the subtitle to her novel Frankenstein (1818).\n\nLucifer is one of various figures in folklore associated with the planet Venus. The entity's name was subsequently absorbed into Christianity as a name for the devil. Modern scholarship generally translates the term in the relevant Bible passage (Isaiah 14-12), where the Greek Septuagint reads ὁ ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωὶ, as \"morning star\" or \"shining one\" rather than as a proper noun, Lucifer, as found in the Latin Vulgate.\n\nAs a name for the Devil in Christian theology, the more common meaning in English, \"Lucifer\" is the rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל, hêlēl, in Isaiah given in the King James Version of the Bible. The translators of this version took the word from the Latin Vulgate, which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized), meaning \"the morning star\", \"the planet Venus\", or, as an adjective, \"light-bringing\".\n\nAs a name for the planet in its morning aspect, \"Lucifer\" (Light-Bringer) is a proper noun and is capitalized in English. In Greco-Roman civilization, it was often personified and considered a god and in some versions considered a son of Aurora (the Dawn). A similar name used by the Roman poet Catullus for the planet in its evening aspect is \"Noctifer\" (Night-Bringer).\n\nPrometheus Unbound is a four-act lyrical drama by Percy Bysshe Shelley, first published in 1820. It is inspired by the classical Prometheia, a trilogy of plays attributed to Aeschylus. Shelley's play concerns Prometheus' release from captivity, but unlike Aeschylus' version, there is no reconciliation between Prometheus and Jupiter (Zeus). Instead, Jupiter is abandoned by his supportive elements and falls from power, which allows Prometheus to be released.\n\nSuppliants and Prometheus Bound were each the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively.\n\n#Prometheus #lucifer #greekmythology",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nOldest Images of Jesus in History\n\n10. Jesus in multiple scenes. The Sarcophagus of Adelphia is an early Christian, circa 340 AD sarcophagus now in the Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi in Syracuse, region of Sicily, Italy. Multiple depictions of Jesus without a beard. 340 CE. \n\n9. Bearded Jesus with Alpha & Omega. The Catacombs of Comadilla are an underground Christian cemetery named after the Domitilla family that had initially ordered them to be dug. They are located in Rome, Italy. Bearded Jesus with Alpha & Omega. 325 CE.\n\n8. Beardless Jesus with his hand out to Mary. The Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter are found approximately three kilometers from southeast Rome and the ancient Via Labicana, and date to the 4th century AD. The catacombs were named in reference to the Christian martyrs Marcellinus and Peter who may have been buried there according to legend, near the body of St. Tiburtius. 305 CE.\n\n7. Beardless Jesus in Toga with Chi-Rho and 2 Pomegranates. The Hinton St Mary Mosaic is a large, almost complete Roman mosaic discovered at Hinton St Mary, Dorset, England. It appears to feature a portrait bust of Jesus Christ as its central motif. 275 CE. \n\n6. Good Shepherd Jesus. Catacomb of Priscilla, Rome, late 2nd century through the 4th century C.E. 250 CE.\n\n5. Adoration of the Magi with Balaam Prophecy. The Epitaph of Severa, London Museum, England.\n250 CE.\n\n4. Jesus with Wand curing Lazarus and Turning Water into Wine. The Catacomb of Callixtus (also known as the Cemetery of Callixtus) is one of the Catacombs of Rome on the Appian Way, most notable for containing the Crypt of the Popes (Italian: Cappella dei Papi), which once contained the tombs of several popes from the 2nd to 4th centuries. 235 CE.\n\n3. Jesus Healing the paralytic at Capernaum. The Dura-Europos church (or Dura-Europos house church) was the earliest-identified Christian house church. It was located in Dura-Europos, Syria, and was one of the earliest-known Christian churches, and seems to have occupied an ordinary house that was converted for worship some time between 233 and 256. In 256, the town was abandoned after the Persian siege. It was less famous, smaller, and more-modestly decorated than the nearby Dura-Europos synagogue, though there are many similarities between them. 225 CE. \n\n2. Jesus as the Good Shepherd Wall Painting. The Catacombs of Domitilla are an underground Christian cemetery named after the Domitilla family that had initially ordered them to be dug.They are located in Rome, Italy. 2nd Century CE.\n\n1. Alexamenos Graffiti.\nThe Alexamenos graffito is a piece of Roman graffito scratched in plaster on the wall of a room near the Palatine Hill in Rome, Italy, which has now been removed and is in the Palatine Museum. It may be meant to depict Jesus; if so, it competes with an engraved gem held in the British Museum as the earliest known pictorial representation of the Crucifixion of Jesus.\n1st Century.\n\n\n\n\n\n#jesus  #jesuschrist #top10",

First published in 1964, it is divided into five parts, four of which were written by associates of Jung: Marie-Louise von Franz, Joseph L. Henderson, Aniela Jaffé, and Jolande Jacobi. The book, which contains numerous illustrations, seeks to provide a clear explanation of Jung's complex theories for a wide non-specialist readership.\n\nJung wrote Part 1, \"Approaching the Unconscious,\" of the book in English:\n\nThe last year of his life was devoted almost entirely to this book, and when he died in June 1961, his own section was complete (he finished it, in fact, only some 10 days before his final illness) and his colleagues' chapters had all been approved by him in draft. . . . The chapter that bears his name is his work and (apart from some fairly extensive editing to improve its intelligibility to the general reader) nobody else's. It was written, incidentally, in English. The remaining chapters were written by the various authors to Jung's direction and under his supervision.\n\n\n\n\n\n#CarlJung #GnosticInformant #robertprice",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nFor David FItzgerald:\nhttp://davidfitzgerald.org/\n\nESHMUN was a Phoenician healer god, later identified with Asklepios, the patron of medicine, by the Greeks and the Romans. He seems to be attested since the third millennium bce in Syria, though his physiognomy becomes clear only in the first millennium bce. The etymology of Eshmun clearly connects him with \"oil,\" which had therapeutic and ritual functions (in relationship with the kingship ritual) in the ancient Near East. In the Ebla archives (middle of the third millennium bce), the theophoric element sí-mi-nu/a is found in some personal names, written dì-giš in Sumerian, meaning \"oil.\" In the ritual texts of Ugarit and Ras Ibn Hani, in the late Bronze Age (eighteenth century bce), the god Šmn is also mentioned as a beneficiary of offerings (Keilalphabetischen Texte aus Ugarit 1.164:9, 1.41:[45], 1.87:50). Unfortunately nothing is known about the functions or the role of this god in the Syrian pantheons, but his connection with oil must indicate that he was \"the one who oils,\" and thus \"the one who heals.\" This is surely the main reason why Eshmun was later assimilated to Asklepios/Aesculapius. His occasional interpretatio as Apollo (for example, in Carthage) is also based on the same background, because Apollo was also a salvific god. According to Philo of Byblos (Eus., Praeparation Evangelica I, 10, 38), Eshmun was Sydyk's son (Sydyk was the personification of Justice), while Damascius (Vita Is. ß 302) knows his father as Sadykos, who had first seven sons, the Dioscouri or Kabeiri, then an eighth son, Eshmun (Esmounos; the number 8 was a sign of election, of a special destiny). According to Pausanias (VII, 23,7–8), who refers a Sidonian testimony, Eshmun's father was Apollo, while the god himself was the Air, which brings health. According to Cicero (Nat. deor. III, 22, 57) and Lydus (De mens. IV, 142), Arsippos was the name of the third Aesculapius, that is, Rashap (Reshef), the semitic Apollo.\n\nEshmun and the Baal Tradition\nFrom a typological and historical point of view, Eshmun, though he is not a storm god, seems to be near to the Syrian Baal tradition, which emphasizes the salvific functions of the god, documented in Ugarit through Baal's connection with the Rapiu/Refaim (\"the healers\"=the dead). Eshmun's cult is documented not only in the sphere of public religion, but also on the level of private or popular beliefs, where the questions of health, wealth, and salvation were essential.\n\nThe earliest attestation of Eshmun seems to be the London Medical Papyrus, where we find, transcribed into Egyptian hieratic syllabic script, some short West Semitic magical texts, dated from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries bce (Steiner, J. C., Journal of Near Eastern Studies 51, 1992, pp. 191–200). One of them (no. 28) contains the name of Eshmun and probably also of Astarte, while the text of number 33 alludes to an anonymous \"healer\" (rpy), who is probably Eshmun.\ny the food from your mouth, the clothes from your body, and the oil for your anointing\" (State Archives of Assyria II, 1988, no. 5, IV, 14–17, p. 27). The mention of the oil probably alludes to Eshmun's specific functions. The association of Melqart, Baal of Tyre, and Eshmun, Baal of Sidon, is not rare. For example, in Batsalos, near Kition (Cyprus), the double divine name, Eshmun-Melqart, indicates a strong cultural association between the two gods, who protected and defended the people.\n\n\nSee Also\nAsklepios; Phoenician Religion.\n\nBibliography\nBaudissin, W.

When Hebrew mythical thought met Greek philosophical thought in the first century B.C.E. it was only natural that someone would try to develop speculative and philosophical justification for Judaism in terms of Greek philosophy. Thus Philo produced a synthesis of both traditions developing concepts for future Hellenistic interpretation of messianic Hebrew thought, especially by Clement of Alexandria, Christian Apologists like Athenagoras, Theophilus, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and by Origen. He may have influenced Paul, his contemporary, and perhaps the authors of the Gospel of John (C. H. Dodd) and the Epistle to the Hebrews (R. Williamson and H. W. Attridge). In the process, he laid the foundations for the development of Christianity in the West and in the East, as we know it today. Philo’s primary importance is in the development of the philosophical and theological foundations of Christianity. The church preserved the Philonic writings because Eusebius of Caesarea labeled the monastic ascetic group of Therapeutae and Therapeutrides, described in Philo’s The Contemplative Life, as Christians, which is highly unlikely. Eusebius also promoted the legend that Philo met Peter in Rome. Jerome (345-420 C.E.) even lists him as a church Father. Jewish tradition was uninterested in philosophical speculation and did not preserve Philo’s thought. According to H. A. Wolfson, Philo was a founder of religious philosophy, a new habit of practicing philosophy. Philo was thoroughly educated in Greek philosophy and culture as can be seen from his superb knowledge of classical Greek literature. He had a deep reverence for Plato and referred to him as “the most holy Plato” (Prob. 13). Philo’s philosophy represented contemporary Platonism which was its revised version incorporating Stoic doctrine and terminology via Antiochus of Ascalon (ca 90 B.C.E.) and Eudorus of Alexandria, as well as elements of Aristotelian logic and ethics and Pythagorean ideas. Clement of Alexandria even called Philo “the Pythagorean.”  But it seems that Philo also picked up his ancestral tradition, though as an adult, and once having discovered it, he put forward the teachings of the Jewish prophet, Moses, as “the summit of philosophy” (Op. 8), and considered Moses the teacher of Pythagoras (b. ca 570 B.C.E.) and of all Greek philosophers and lawgivers (Hesiod, Heraclitus, Lycurgus, to mention a few). For Philo, Greek philosophy was a natural development of the revelatory teachings of Moses. He was no innovator in this matter because already before him Jewish scholars attempted the same. Artapanus in the second century B.C.E identified Moses with Musaeus and with Orpheus. According to Aristobulus of Paneas (first half of the second century B.C.E.), Homer and Hesiod drew from the books of Moses which were translated into Greek long before the Septuagint.\n\nPlato, (born 428/427 BCE, Athens, Greece—died 348/347, Athens), ancient Greek philosopher, student of Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE), teacher of Aristotle (384–322 BCE), and founder of the Academy, best known as the author of philosophical works of unparalleled influence.\n\nIf you’re interested in Christianity’s origins, there are some very good reasons to be interested in Platonism:\n\nPlato understood the self as divided between body and soul, with the soul more closely related to goodness and truth; this made Christianity’s later soul-body division easier to understand. (Some early Christians, like Justin Martyr, even regarded the Platonists as unknowing proto-Christians, though this conclusion was later rejected.)\n \nPlato’s theory of forms prefigured the Christian understanding of heaven as a perfect world, of which the physical realm is a mere imitation.\nBoth worldviews assume the existence of absolute truth and unchanging reality; again, Plato’s thought helped prepare people for Christianity.\n \n“I found that whatever truth I had read [in the Platonists] was [in the writings of Paul] combined with the exaltation of thy grace.”\n\nEusebius of Caesarea\n“[Plato is] the only Greek who has attained the porch of (Christian) truth.”\n\n\n#Platonism #Christianity #philosophy",

They were personal or supernatural companion spirits, comparable to the Roman genii, who ensured good luck, fertility, health, protection and wisdom.\n\nThough little noted in Greek mythology he was prominent in Greek folk religion;[5] it was customary to drink or pour out a few drops of unmixed wine to honor him in every symposium or formal banquet. In Aristophanes' Peace, when War has trapped Peace in a deep pit, Hermes comes to give aid: \"Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when, freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet Eirene and draw her out of this pit... This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the Agathos Daimon.\" A temple dedicated to them was situated on the road from Megalopolis to Maenalus in Arcadia.\n\nAn Agathos Daimon was the spouse or companion of Tyche Agathe. \"Tyche we know at Lebadeia as the wife of the Agathos Daimon, the Good or Rich Spirit\". Their numinous presence could be represented in art as a serpent or more concretely as a young man bearing a cornucopia and a bowl in one hand, and a poppy and an ear of grain in the other. The agathodaemon was later adapted into a general daemon of fortuna, particularly of the continued abundance of a family's good food and drink.Later some other versions have described agathodaemons as psychopomp beings which takes the dead ones which are on their card to the afterlife (Underworld ) but he doesn't judges them Agathodaemons have been described as personal guardians, helpers or protectors of people.According to the ancient Greeks each person was born with each personalities, the agathodaemon and the cacodaemon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#mdavidlitwa #GnosticInformant #Agathodaemon",

He lived in the Roman province of Numidia, in the Berber city of Madauros, modern-day M'Daourouch, Algeria. He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. This is known as the Apologia.\n\nHis most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel the Metamorphoses, otherwise known as The Golden Ass. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the adventures of its protagonist, Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey. Lucius goes through various adventures before he is turned back into a human being by the goddess Isis.\n\nApologia  is the version of the defence presented in Sabratha, in 158–159, before the proconsul Claudius Maximus, by Apuleius accused of the crime of magic. Between the traditional exordium and peroratio, the argumentation is divided into three sections:\n\nRefutation of the accusations levelled against his private life. He demonstrates that by marrying Pudentilla he had no interested motive and that he carries it away, intellectually and morally, on his opponents.\nAttempt to prove that his so-called \"magical operations\" were in fact indispensable scientific experiments for an imitator of Aristotle and Hippocrates, or the religious acts of a Roman Platonist.\nA recount of the events that have occurred in Oea since his arrival and pulverize the arguments against him.\nThe main interest of the Apology is historical, as it offers substantial information about its author, magic and life in Africa in the second century\n\n\n\n\n#Apuleius #Apology #GnosticInformant",

Historical scholarship and cinema alike tend to see the conflict as the culmination of long Jewish resistance to Roman oppression. In this volume, Steven Mason re-examines the war in all relevant contexts (such as the Parthian dimension, and Judaea's place in Roman Syria) and phases, from the Hasmoneans to the fall of Masada. Mason approaches each topic as a historical investigation, clarifying problems that need to be solved, understanding the available evidence, and considering scenarios that might explain the evidence. The simplest reconstructions make the conflict more humanly intelligible while casting doubt on received knowledge.\n\nAbout Steve Mason:\n\"I'm privileged to be a historian of the ancient eastern Mediterranean world, under Roman rule (ca. 200 BCE to 400 CE). After a BA and MA in McMaster University's Religious Studies department, in early Judaism and Christian origins, I continued to a PhD from St Michael's Toronto, with a year each in Jerusalem (Hebrew U) and Tübingen along the way. Three years of the usual job anxiety for humanities PhDs ended with a contract and eventually permanent post at Toronto's York U, in classics-religious studies-humanities, later in the Department of History as a Canada Research Chair in Greco-Roman Cultural Interaction (2003-2011). Then I decided to leave for the UK, home of my second citizenship, then for the Continent, where I've landed at the University of Groningen.\nAlthough I don't object to the label 'Josephus scholar', being happy to be called a scholar (= 'student') of any kind, the majority of my research time for twenty years+ has been among other ancient texts and material evidence (sites, coins, inscriptions, etc.). I hope that my latest book -- A History of the Jewish War, AD 66-74 -- helps to show this approach to the past.\"\n\nVespasian was the first emperor from an equestrian family and only rose into the senatorial rank as the first member of his family later in his lifetime. Vespasian's renown came from his military success; he was legate of Legio II Augusta during the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 and subjugated Judaea during the Jewish rebellion of 66.\nWhile Vespasian besieged Jerusalem during the Jewish rebellion, emperor Nero committed suicide and plunged Rome into a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. After Galba and Otho perished in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in April 69. The Roman legions of Roman Egypt and Judaea reacted by declaring Vespasian, their commander, the emperor on 1 July 69. In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with Mucianus, the governor of Syria, and Primus, a general in Pannonia, leaving his son Titus to command the besieging forces at Jerusalem. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian took control of Egypt. On 20 December 69, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the Senate.\n\nNero was born at Antium in AD 37, the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger.\nDuring Nero's reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by the Iceni's queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish–Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 he committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.\n\n\n#Josephus #SteveMason #jewishwar",

Thank you existing Patrons.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ladybabylon.com/\n\nAlexander romance, any of a body of legends about the career of Alexander the Great, told and retold with varying emphasis and purpose by succeeding ages and civilizations.\n\nThe chief source of all Alexander romance literature was a folk epic written in Greek by a Hellenized Egyptian in Alexandria during the 2nd century AD. Surviving translations and copies make its reconstruction possible. It portrayed Alexander as a national messianic hero, the natural son of an Egyptian wizard-king by the wife of Philip II of Macedon. Magic and marvels played a subsidiary part in the epic—in the story of Alexander’s birth, for example, and in his meeting with the Amazons in India. In later romances, however, marvels and exotic anecdotes predominated and gradually eclipsed the historical personality. Minor episodes in the original were filled out, often through “letters” supposedly written by or to Alexander, and an independent legend about his capture of the wild peoples of Gog and Magog was incorporated into several texts of many vernacular versions. An account of the Alexander legends was included in a 9th-century Old English translation of Orosius’ history of the world. In the 11th century a Middle Irish Alexander romance appeared, and about 1100, the Middle High German Annolied. During the 12th century, Alexander appeared as a pattern of knightly chivalry in a succession of great poems, beginning with the Roman d’Alexandre by Albéric de Briançon. This work inspired the Alexanderlied by the German poet Lamprecht der Pfaffe. An Anglo-Norman poet, Thomas of Kent, wrote the Roman de toute chevalerie toward the end of the 12th century, and about 1275 this was remodeled to become the Middle English romance of King Alisaunder. Italian Alexander romances began to appear during the 14th century, closely followed by versions in Swedish, Danish, Scots, and (dating from a little earlier) in the Slavic languages.\n\nEastern accounts of Alexander’s fabled career paid a good deal of attention to the Gog and Magog episode, a version of this story being included in the Qurʾān. The Arabs, expanding Syrian versions of the legend, passed them on to the many peoples with whom they came in contact. Through them, the Persian poets, notably Neẓāmī in the 12th century, gave the stories new form.\n\nAlexander romance literature declined in the late 12th century, and, with the revival of classical scholarship during the Renaissance, historical accounts displaced the Alexander romances.\r\n\r\n#AlexandertheGreat #ByzantineLegends #OracleofAmmon",

(Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\n\nhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/diodorus-sicilydeg\nDiodorus Siculus, or Diodorus of Sicily (Greek: Διόδωρος Diodoros; fl. 1st century BC), was an ancient Greek historian. He is known for writing the monumental universal history Bibliotheca historica, in forty books, fifteen of which survive intactmbetween 60 and 30 BC. The history is arranged in three parts. The first covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy, arranged geographically, describing regions around the world from Egypt, India and Arabia to Europe. The second covers the time from the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third covers the period to about 60 BC. Bibliotheca, meaning 'library', acknowledges that he was drawing on the work of many other authors.\nDiodorus' universal history, which he named Bibliotheca historica (Greek: Βιβλιοθήκη Ἱστορική, \"Historical Library\"), was immense and consisted of 40 books, of which 1–5 and 11–20 survive: fragments of the lost books are preserved in Photius and the Excerpts of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.\n\nIt was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-Hellenic and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of Ancient Egypt (book I), of Mesopotamia, India, Scythia, and Arabia (II), of North Africa (III), and of Greece and Europe (IV–VI).\n\nIn the next section (books VII–XVII), he recounts the history of the world from the Trojan War down to the death of Alexander the Great. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the successors of Alexander down to either 60 BC or the beginning of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. (The end has been lost, so it is unclear whether Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours he stopped short at 60 BC.) He selected the name \"Bibliotheca\" in acknowledgment that he was assembling a composite work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include Hecataeus of Abdera, Ctesias of Cnidus, Ephorus, Theopompus, Hieronymus of Cardia, Duris of Samos, Diyllus, Philistus, Timaeus, Polybius, and Posidonius.\n\nThe story of Osiris and Isis started from the beginning of the ancient Egyptian civilization, Osiris held the position of the ruler of Egypt next to his Wife Demeter goddess of motherhood & healing. His brother Seth “God of the Desert” became highly jealous of his power and glory so he came up with a plan to kill him which involved a beautiful chest.\nSeth held a party and declared a competition as he brought a chest and promised that the one who can fit inside it will give to him as a gift but the trick was the chest was built perfectly for Osiris. So when Osiris lay in the chest, set slammed it shut and then thrown to the Nile where he suffocated to death. Then Set took control of Egypt and new age chaos, terror and darkness began.\n\nDemeter started to look for her husband and vowed to return him back to the world of the living. She was able to find his body and began to prepare the needed magical potions and left the body under the protection of her sister Nephthys the mother of Anubis and Seth’s wife. Seth was able to discover the location of Osiris’ body through her then he cut the body into 42 pieces and thrown all across the land and the Nile of Egypt. Isis was horrified by what set did to the body of Osiris but she didn’t surrender as she collected all the body parts and was able to bring him from the dead but he was not complete so can no longer rule the living so he became the lord of the underworld.\nBefore Osiris descends to the underworld, he and Isis gave birth to Horus the Sky God. Horus was raised in absolute secrecy because of his evil uncle Seth, Horus was repeatedly attacked by all the savage creatures sent by set during his hellish childhood.\nWhen Horus came of age and became a powerful warrior, he challenged his uncle in battle. Set was able to steal one of Horus’s eyes but it didn’t make any difference as he was defeated by Horus and banished into the deserts. The rest of the gods recognized Horus as the rightful heir of Egypt and a new era of peace, prosperity and harmony began. \nBibliotheca historica:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheca_historica\n\nMusic by Jeremy Soule (Skyrim Sounstrack)\n#DiodoursSicilus #Orphicmysteries #GnosticInformant",

    "description": "The Sibylline Oracles (Latin: Oracula Sibyllina; sometimes called the pseudo-Sibylline Oracles)[citation needed] are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek hexameters ascribed to the Sibyls, prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in a frenzied state. Fourteen books and eight fragments of Sibylline Oracles survive, in an edition of the 6th or 7th century AD. They are not to be confused with the original Sibylline Books of the ancient Etruscans and Romans which were burned by order of the Roman general Flavius Stilicho in the 4th century AD. Instead, the text is an \"odd pastiche\" of Hellenistic and Roman mythology interspersed with Jewish, Gnostic and early Christian legend.\r\n\r\nThe Sibylline Oracles are a valuable source for information about classical mythology and early first millennium Gnostic, Hellenistic Jewish and Christian beliefs. Some apocalyptic passages scattered throughout seem to foreshadow themes of the Book of Revelation and other apocalyptic literature. The oracles have undergone extensive editing, re-writing, and redaction as they came to be exploited in wider circles.\r\n\r\nOne passage has an acrostic, spelling out a Christian code-phrase with the first letters of successive lines.\r\n\r\nBelievers and Non-Believers are all welcome to share their theories\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ladybabylon.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Ammon Link for Greek Tutoring\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/88...\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperchats are especially appreciated.

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nhttps://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Drowned_God\nYara Greyjoy: The Seven are gods of weakness and defeat, pretty chains that the First Men kindly put on after the Andals crushed them, except in the Iron Islands.\n\nSince the Dawn Age, the Ironborn have followed the Drowned God, who plucked fire from the sea and made us to reave and sack and carve our names in blood and song.\n\nWhen the Andals landed on the Iron Islands, they found a god who was Father, Warrior, and Stranger; who took Mother, Maiden, and Crone when he would; and held the Smith in thrall. His priests are Drowned Men, who are clothed and armed by the sea itself.\n\nThey consecrate us to the Drowned God through our most sacred rite, the Drowning, and ask the God to raise them from the sea as he was, harder and stronger.\n\nThe ironborn do not fear the bloodiest battle or the roughest waves, for the Drowned God taught us long ago that what is dead may never die.\n\nWhen an Ironborn falls, we say that the Drowned God needed a strong oarsman and took him below to feast in the God's watery halls, attended by mermaids.\n\nBut even in death, an ironborn is a warrior. We fight against the Storm God, who holds a castle in the clouds and sends the winds to lure the ironborn off course or wreck their ships.\n\nIt's said my legendary ancestor, the Grey King, waged war against upon the Storm God for a thousand years. With the Drowned God's help, he slew the great Sea Dragon Nagga and used her bones for his hall. After his death, the Storm God tried to wash away any memory of this terrible foe, but his songs fill our halls to this day.\n\nIt was the Storm God who first blew the Andals to the Iron Islands; to subdue us and turn us from our faith. True, they conquered and killed our king; but in time, they forsook their septs for the shore and their fat septons for the Drowned Men. The Andals came to us conquerors; in the end, they drowned.\n\nThe ironborn are of the sea, as our God made us, and given to it as our God taught us. We do not fear the Storm God's winds or his waves. But you should, for they bring us to you.\n\n@gameofthrones \n\nhttps://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon\nThe reign of House Targaryen begins.

They are the \"most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece\". Their basis was an old agrarian cult, and there is some evidence that they were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenean period.The Mysteries represented the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades, in a cycle with three phases: the descent (loss), the search, and the ascent, with the main theme being the ascent (ἄνοδος) of Persephone and the reunion with her mother. It was a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spread to Rome.Similar religious rites appear in the agricultural societies of the Near East and in Minoan Crete.\r\n\r\nThe Mysteries are related to a myth concerning Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility as recounted in one of the Homeric Hymns (c. 650 BC). According to the hymn, Demeter's daughter Persephone (also referred to as Kore, \"maiden\") was assigned the task of painting all the flowers of the earth. Before completion, she was seized by Hades, the god of the underworld, who took her to his underworld kingdom. Distraught, Demeter searched high and low for her daughter. Because of her distress, and in an effort to coerce Zeus to allow the return of her daughter, she caused a terrible drought in which the people suffered and starved, depriving the gods of sacrifice and worship. As a result, Zeus relented and allowed Persephone to return to her mother.\r\n\r\nAccording to the myth, during her search Demeter traveled long distances and had many minor adventures along the way. In one she taught the secrets of agriculture to Triptolemus. Finally, by consulting Zeus, Demeter reunited with her daughter and the earth returned to its former verdure and prosperity: the first spring.\r\n\r\nZeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever consumed food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds (either six or four according to the telling), which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother for the rest of the year.  Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.\r\n\r\nIn the central foundation document of the mystery, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter line 415, Persephone is said to stay in Hades during winter and return to her mother in the spring of the year: \"This was the day [of Persephone's return], at the very beginning of bountiful springtime.\"\r\n\r\nPersephone's rebirth is symbolic of the rebirth of all plant life and the symbol of eternity of life that flows from the generations that spring from each other.\r\n\r\nKykeon was an Ancient Greek drink of various descriptions. Some were made mainly of water, barley and naturally occurring substances. Others were made with wine and grated cheese. It is widely believed that kykeon usually refers to a psychoactive compounded brew, as in the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries. A kykeon was used at the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries to break a sacred fast, but it is also mentioned as a favourite drink of Greek peasants.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carl Ruck, Ph.D (Harvard) Classicist\r\nhttps://www.bu.edu/classics/faculty-p...\r\nCarl A.P. Ruck is an authority on the ecstatic rituals of the god Dionysus. With the ethno-mycologist R. Gordon Wasson and Albert Hofmann, he identified the secret psychoactive ingredient in the visionary potion that was drunk by the initiates at the Eleusinian Mystery. In Persephone’s Quest: Entheogens and the Origins of Religion, he proclaimed the centrality of psychoactive sacraments at the very beginnings of religion, employing the neologism “entheogen” to free the topic from the pejorative connotations for words like drug or hallucinogen.\r\nwww.entheomedia.net\r\nEthno-mycologist R.

She goes with her loyal maid to the camp of the enemy general, Holofernes, with whom she slowly ingratiates herself, promising him information on the Israelites. Gaining his trust, she is allowed access to his tent one night as he lies in a drunken stupor. She decapitates him, then takes his head back to her fearful countrymen. The Assyrians, having lost their leader, disperse, and Israel is saved. Though she is courted by many, Judith remains unmarried for the rest of her life.\n\nIn the third year of the reign of King Ahasuerus of Persia the king banishes his queen, Vashti, and seeks a new queen. Beautiful maidens gather together at the harem in the citadel of Susa under the authority of the eunuch Hegai.\n\nOn the third day, Esther goes to the courtyard in front of the king's palace, and she is welcomed by the king, who stretches out his scepter for her to touch, and offers her anything she wants \"up to half of the kingdom\". Esther invites the king and Haman to a banquet she has prepared for the next day. She tells the king she will reveal her request at the banquet. During the banquet, the king repeats his offer again, whereupon Esther invites both the king and Haman to a banquet she is making on the following day as well.\n\nSeeing that he is in favor with the king and queen, Haman takes counsel from his wife and friends to build a gallows upon which to hang Mordecai; as he is in their good favors, he believes he will be granted his wish to hang Mordecai the very next day. After building the gallows, Haman goes to the palace in the middle of the night to wait for the earliest moment he can see the king.\n\nAfter Haman is put to death, Ahasuerus gives Haman's estate to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai being her relative, and the king makes Mordecai his adviser. When Esther asks the king to revoke the order exterminating the Jews, the king is initially hesitant, saying that an order issued by the king cannot be repealed. Ahasuerus allows Esther and Mordecai to draft another order, with the seal of the king and in the name of the king, to allow the Jewish people to defend themselves and fight with their oppressors on the thirteenth day of Adar.\n\nThe Shrine venerated as the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai in Hamadan, Iran\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim, in memory of their deliverance. Haman having set the date of the thirteenth of Adar to commence his campaign against the Jews, this determined the date of the festival of Purim.\n\nMary Magdalene, sometimes called Mary of Magdala, or simply the Magdalene or the Madeleine, was a woman who, according to the four canonical gospels, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion and resurrection. She is mentioned by name twelve times in the canonical gospels, more than most of the apostles and more than any other woman in the gospels, other than Jesus's family. Mary's epithet Magdalene may mean that she came from the town of Magdala, a fishing town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee in Roman Judea.\n\n#MaryMagdalene #Judith #Esther",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nLetter of Clement of Alexandria on Secret Mark\nTranslated by Morton Smith.\n\nFrom the letters of the most holy Clement, the author of the Stromateis. To Theodore.\n\nYou did well in silencing the unspeakable teachings of the Carpocrations. For these are the \"wandering stars\" referred to in the prophecy, who wander from the narrow road of the commandments into a boundless abyss of the carnal and bodily sins. For, priding themselves in knowledge, as they say, \"of the deep things of Satan\", they do not know that they are casting themselves away into \"the nether world of the darkness\" of falsity, and boasting that they are free, they have become slaves of servile desires. Such men are to be opposed in all ways and altogether. For, even if they should say something true, one who loves the truth should not, even so, agree with them. For not all true things are the truth, nor should that truth which merely seems true according to human opinions be preferred to the true truth, that according to the faith.\n\nNow of the things they keep saying about the divinely inspired Gospel according to Mark, some are altogether falsifications, and others, even if they do contain some true elements, nevertheless are not reported truly. For the true things, being mixed with inventions, are falsified, so that, as the saying goes, even the salt loses its savor.\n\nAs for Mark, then, during Peter's stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord's doings, not, however, declaring all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria, bringing both his own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the things suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought in certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue, lead the hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils. Thus, in sum, he prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously, in my opinion, and, dying, he left his composition to the church in 1, verso Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully guarded, being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries.\n\nBut since the foul demons are always devising destruction for the race of men, Carpocrates, instructed by them and using deceitful arts, so enslaved a certain presbyter of the church in Alexandria that he got from him a copy of the secret Gospel, which he both interpreted according to his blasphemous and carnal doctrine and, moreover, polluted, mixing with the spotless and holy words utterly shameless lies. From this mixture is drawn off the teaching of the Carpocratians.\n\n\"And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, 'Son of David, have mercy on me.' But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightaway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb, they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do, and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the Kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan.\"\n\nAnd after the words, \"And he comes into Jericho,\" the secret Gospel adds only, \"And the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome were there, and Jesus did not receive them.\" But the many other things about which you wrote both seem to be, and are, falsifications.\n\nhttp://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/secretmark.html\n\n\n\n\n#SecretMark #ClementofAlexandria #gospels #gnosticinformant",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nSerapis (Koinē Greek: Σέραπις, later form) or Sarapis (Σάραπις, earlier form, originally Demotic: wsjr-ḥp, \"Osiris-Apis\") or Sorapis (Koinē Greek: Σόραπις) is a Graeco-Egyptian deity. The cult of Serapis was promoted during the third century BC on the orders of Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter of the Ptolemaic Kingdomin Egypt as a means to unify the Greeks and Egyptians in his realm. A serapeum (Koinē Greek: Σεραπεῖον serapeion) was any temple or religious precinct devoted to Serapis. The cultus of Serapis was spread as a matter of deliberate policy by the Ptolemaic kings. Serapis continued to increase in popularity during the Roman Empire, often replacing Osiris as the consort of Isis in temples outside Egypt.\n\nSerapis was depicted as Greek in appearance but with Egyptian trappings, and combined iconography from a great many cults, signifying both abundance and resurrection. Though Ptolemy I may have created the official cult of Serapis and endorsed him as a patron of the Ptolemaic dynasty and Alexandria, Serapis was a syncretistic deity derived from the worship of the Egyptian Osiris and Apis and also gained attributes from other deities, such as chthonic powers linked to the Greek Hades and Demeter, and benevolence linked to Dionysus.\n\nThere is evidence that the cult of Serapis existed before the Ptolemies came to power in Alexandria: a temple of Serapis in Egypt is mentioned in 323 BC by both Plutarch (Life of Alexander, 76) and Arrian (Anabasis, VII, 26, 2). The common assertion that Ptolemy \"created\" the deity is derived from sources which describe him erecting a statue of Serapis in Alexandria: this statue enriched the texture of the Serapis conception by portraying him in both Egyptian and Greek style.\n\nIn 389, a Christian mob led by Pope Theophilus of Alexandria destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria, but the cult survived until all forms of pagan religion were suppressed under Theodosius I in 391.\n\nThe most renowned serapeum was in Alexandria. Under Ptolemy I Soter, efforts were made to integrate Egyptian religion with that of their Hellenic rulers. Ptolemy's policy was to find a deity that should win the reverence alike of both groups, despite the curses of the Egyptian priests against the gods of the other previous foreign rulers (e.g. Set, who was lauded by the Hyksos). Alexander the Great had attempted to use Amun for this purpose, but he was more prominent in Upper Egypt, and not as popular in Lower Egypt, where the Greeks had stronger influence.\n\nThe Greeks had little respect for animal-headed figures, and so a Greek-style anthropomorphic statue was chosen as the idol, and proclaimed as the equivalent of the highly popular Apis.It was named Userhapi (i.e. \"Osiris-Apis\"), which became Greek Sarapis, and was said to be Osiris in full, rather than just his ka (life force).\n\nThe earliest mention of a Sarapis occurs in the disputed death scene of Alexander (323 BC).[9] Here, Sarapis has a temple at Babylon, and is of such importance that he alone is named as being consulted on behalf of the dying king. The presence of Sarapis in Babylon would radically alter perceptions of the mythologies of this era: the unconnected Babylonian god Ea (Enki) was titled Šar Apsi, meaning \"king of the Apsu\" or \"the watery deep\", and perhaps he is the one meant in the diaries. His significance in the Hellenic psyche, due to its involvement in Alexander's death, may have also contributed to the choice of Osiris-Apis as the chief Ptolemaic god.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, Ptolemy stole the cult statue from Sinope in Asia Minor, having been instructed in a dream by the \"unknown god\" to bring the statue to Alexandria, where the statue was pronounced to be Sarapis by two religious experts. One of the experts was of the Eumolpidae, the ancient family from whose members the hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries had been chosen since before history, and the other was the scholarly Egyptian priest Manetho, which gave weight to the judgement both for the Egyptians and the Greeks.\n\n The Christians among them are worshippers of Serapis, and those calling themselves bishops of Christ scruple not to act as the votaries of that God. The truth is, there is no one, whether Ruler of a synagogue, or Samaritan, or Presbyter of the Christians, or mathematician, or astrologer, or magician, that does not do homage to Serapis. The Patriarch himself, when he comes to Egypt, is by some compelled to worship Serapis, and by others, Christ. - Historia Augusta\n\n\n#Serapis #Osiris #GnosticInformant",

Thank you existing Patrons.\r\n\r\nMore from Rusell Gmirkin\r\nhttp://russellgmirkin.com/\r\n\r\nGet the Book:\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Russell-E.-Gmirkin/e/B001KDVO10%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\r\n\r\nPtolemy II was responsible for the transformation of the cult of Alexander the Great which had been established by Ptolemy I into a state cult of the Ptolemaic dynasty. At the start of his sole reign, Ptolemy II deified his father. He deified his mother Berenice I as well after her death in the 270s. The couple were worshipped as a pair, the Theoi Soteres (Saviour Gods). Around 272 BC, Ptolemy II promoted himself and his sister-wife Arsinoe II to divine status as the Theoi Adelphoi (Sibling Gods).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this ruler cult was centred on Alexandria, it was propagated throughout the Ptolemaic empire. The Nesiotic League, which contained the Aegean islands under Ptolemaic control, held its own Ptolemaia festival at Delos from the early 270s BC. Priests and festivals are also attested on Cyprus at Lapethos, at Methymna on Lesbos, on Thera, and possibly at Limyra in Lycia.\r\n\r\nThis decree was followed in 258 BC by a 'General Inventory' in which the whole of Egypt was surveyed to determine the quantity of different types of land, irrigation, canals, and forests within the kingdom and the amount of income that could be levied from it. Efforts were made to increase the amount of arable land in Egypt, particularly by reclaiming large amounts of land from Lake Moeris in the Fayyum. Ptolemy distributed this land to the Ptolemaic soldiers as agricultural estates in 253 BC.\r\n\r\n\r\nScholarship and culture\r\nPtolemy II was an eager patron of scholarship, funding the expansion of the Library of Alexandria and patronising scientific research. Poets like Callimachus, Theocritus, Apollonius of Rhodes, and Posidippus were provided with stipends and produced masterpieces of Hellenistic poetry, including panegyrics in honour of the Ptolemaic family. Other scholars operating under Ptolemy's aegis included the mathematician Euclid and the astronomer Aristarchus. Ptolemy is thought to have commissioned Manetho to compose his Aegyptiaca, an account of Egyptian history, perhaps intended to make Egyptian culture intelligible to its new rulers.\r\n\r\nA tradition preserved in the pseudepigraphical Letter of Aristeas presents Ptolemy as the driving force behind the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek as the Septuagint. This account contains several anachronisms and is unlikely to be true. The Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible is likely to have taken place among the Jews of Alexandria, but was probably a protracted process rather than a single moment of translation.\r\n\r\nRelations with the western Mediterranean\r\nPtolemy II and King Hiero II of Syracuse are regularly referred to as having enjoyed particularly close relations. There is substantial evidence for the exchange of goods and ideas between Syracuse and Alexandria. Hiero seems to have modelled various aspects of his royal self-representation and perhaps his tax system, the Lex Hieronica on Ptolemaic models. Two of the luminaries of Ptolemy II's court, the poet Theocritus and the mathematician and engineer Archimedes came from and eventually returned to Syracuse. Numismatic evidence seems to indicate that Ptolemy II funded Hiero II's original rise to power – a series of Ptolemaic bronze coins known as the 'Galatian shield without Sigma' minted between 271 and 265 BC, have been shown to have been minted in Sicily itself, on the basis of their style, flan shape, die axes, weight and find spots. The first set seem to have been minted by a Ptolemaic mint, perhaps left there in 276 BC after Pyrrhus of Epirus' withdrawal from Sicily. They are succeeded by a series that seems to have been minted by the regular Syracusan mint, perhaps on the outbreak of the First Punic War in 265 BC.\r\n\r\n#russellgmirkin #Septuagint #hebrewbible",

    "title": "Mystery of the Cainites: Early Christian Sect",
    "description": "https://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\nThe Course for Mystery Cults by Professor Litwa is NOW AVAILABLE!!! Click the Link for more Details! (Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nFOR PART TWO ON THE CAINITES:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MDavidLitwa\nPlease Consider joining Professor M. David Litwa's Patreon to help fund his research.\n\nThe Cainites were an early Christian sect known to venerate Cain as the first victim of the Demiurge, the deity of the Old Testament, who was identified by many groups of Gnostics as evil. The sect following was relatively small. They were mentioned by Tertullian and Irenaeus as existing in the eastern Roman Empire during the 2nd century. One of their purported religious texts was the Gospel of Judas.\n\nIreneaus states that the Cainites regarded Cain as derived from the highest God, not the Creator God worshipped by Jews and other Christians. According to Irenaeus, they claimed fellowship with Esau, Korah, the men of Sodom, and all such people, and regarded themselves as persecuted by the Creator. But they escaped injury from him, because they were protected by the goddess Sophia.\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis (Haer. 38), who appears to have some source of information independent of Irenaeus, gives a much longer account. He describes Abel as being derived from the weaker principle.\n\nLike other Gnostics, the Cainites distinguished between the Creator and the Supreme God. They identified the Creator with the God of the Jews, viewing him and those he favored with hostility and believing that the purpose of redemption was the dissolution of his work. They claimed kinship with those to whom he showed antagonism in the Old Testament but believed he was the weaker power and could do them no permanent harm, since they enjoyed the protection of Sophia.\n\nThey may have shared with other heretical Christians a belief in the division of humanity into two classes: the spiritual and the material. Material people belonged to the realm of the Creator and derived their being from him but were doomed to destruction. Spiritual people were imprisoned in bodies of flesh but derived their essential being from the highest Power. They were opposed by the Creator and his minions but were destined to triumph over them as Cain did over Abel.\n\nThey regarded Judas the traitor as having full cognizance of the truth. He therefore, rather than the other disciples, was able to accomplish the mystery of the betrayal, and so bring about the dissolution of all things both celestial and terrestrial. The Cainites possessed a work entitled The Gospel of Judas, and Irenaeus says that he had himself collected writings of theirs, where they advocated that the work of Hystera should be dissolved. By Hystera they meant the Maker of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThere is no doubt that they applauded the action of Judas in the betrayal, but authorities differ as to the motive which prompted him. The view that Judas through his more perfect Gnosis penetrated the wish of Jesus more successfully than the others, and accomplished it by bringing him to the Cross through which he effected redemption, is only one of them.\n\nEpiphanius also says that Judas forced the Archons, or rulers, against their will to slay Christ, and thus assisted us to the salvation of the Cross. Philaster, on the other hand, assigns the action of Judas to his knowledge that Christ intended to destroy the truth—a purpose which he frustrated by the betrayal.\n\nSo far as the moral character and conduct of the Cainites is concerned, there is no doubt that Irenaeus intended to represent them as shrinking from no vileness, but rather as deliberately practising it. He states that they taught, as did Carpocrates, that salvation could be attained only by passing through all experience. Whenever any sin or vile action was performed by them, they asserted that an angel was present whom they invoked, claiming that they were fulfilling his operation. Perfect knowledge consisted in going without a tremor into such actions as it is not lawful even to name.\n\nCarpocrates, we are told, defended this practice by a theory of transmigration. It was necessary to pass through all experiences, and hence the soul had to pass from body to body till the whole range of experience had been traversed. If, however, this could all be crowded into a single lifetime, then the transmigration became unnecessary. AWe have no substantial justification for asserting or doubting the truth of Irenaeus' account, though accusations of immorality urged against heretics should always be received with caution. This further connects the Cainites with the Pythagoreans (Trans-Migration of Soul) who also revered Cake offerings and Vegetarianism over Meat Sacrificing. \n\n\n\n\n\n#MDavidLitwa #Cainites #GnosticInformant nag hammadi gnostic informant esoteric septuagint yaldabaoth",

Dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, between c. 9500 and 8000 BCE, the site comprises a number of large circular structures supported by massive stone pillars – the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are richly decorated with abstract anthropomorphic details, clothing, and reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15 m (50 ft)-high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell also includes many smaller rectangular buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.\r\n\r\nThe site was first used at the dawn of the Neolithic period, which in Southwest Asia marks the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture, but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice-versa. Göbekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on the top of a rocky mountaintop, far from known sources of water and to date produced no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation, has played a prominent role in this debate. The site's original excavator, German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, described it as the \"world's first temple\": a sanctuary used by groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers from a wide area, with few or no permanent inhabitants. Other archaeologists challenged this interpretation, arguing that the evidence for a lack of agriculture and a resident population was far from conclusive. Recent research has also led the current excavators of Göbekli Tepe to revise or abandon many of the conclusions underpinning Schmidt's interpretation.\r\n\r\n#JohnDominicCrossan #GöbekliTepe #Bible #gnosticinformant",

Historical scholarship and cinema alike tend to see the conflict as the culmination of long Jewish resistance to Roman oppression. In this volume, Steven Mason re-examines the war in all relevant contexts (such as the Parthian dimension, and Judaea's place in Roman Syria) and phases, from the Hasmoneans to the fall of Masada. Mason approaches each topic as a historical investigation, clarifying problems that need to be solved, understanding the available evidence, and considering scenarios that might explain the evidence. The simplest reconstructions make the conflict more humanly intelligible while casting doubt on received knowledge.\n\nAbout Steve Mason:\n\"I'm privileged to be a historian of the ancient eastern Mediterranean world, under Roman rule (ca. 200 BCE to 400 CE). After a BA and MA in McMaster University's Religious Studies department, in early Judaism and Christian origins, I continued to a PhD from St Michael's Toronto, with a year each in Jerusalem (Hebrew U) and Tübingen along the way. Three years of the usual job anxiety for humanities PhDs ended with a contract and eventually permanent post at Toronto's York U, in classics-religious studies-humanities, later in the Department of History as a Canada Research Chair in Greco-Roman Cultural Interaction (2003-2011). Then I decided to leave for the UK, home of my second citizenship, then for the Continent, where I've landed at the University of Groningen.\nAlthough I don't object to the label 'Josephus scholar', being happy to be called a scholar (= 'student') of any kind, the majority of my research time for twenty years+ has been among other ancient texts and material evidence (sites, coins, inscriptions, etc.). I hope that my latest book -- A History of the Jewish War, AD 66-74 -- helps to show this approach to the past.\"\n\nVespasian was the first emperor from an equestrian family and only rose into the senatorial rank as the first member of his family later in his lifetime. Vespasian's renown came from his military success; he was legate of Legio II Augusta during the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 and subjugated Judaea during the Jewish rebellion of 66.\nWhile Vespasian besieged Jerusalem during the Jewish rebellion, emperor Nero committed suicide and plunged Rome into a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. After Galba and Otho perished in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in April 69. The Roman legions of Roman Egypt and Judaea reacted by declaring Vespasian, their commander, the emperor on 1 July 69. In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with Mucianus, the governor of Syria, and Primus, a general in Pannonia, leaving his son Titus to command the besieging forces at Jerusalem. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian took control of Egypt. On 20 December 69, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the Senate.\n\nNero was born at Antium in AD 37, the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger.\nDuring Nero's reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by the Iceni's queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish–Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 he committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.\n\n\n#Josephus #SteveMason #jewishwar",

He received his BA and MA at New York University, and completed his doctorate in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Dr. Jorjani has taught courses on Science, Technology, and Society (STS), the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, and the history of Iran as a full-time faculty member at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Earlier he taught Comparative Religion, Ethics, Political Theory, and the History of Philosophy at the State University of New York. He is a professional member of the Society for Scientific Exploration (SSE). \n\nZoroaster is regarded as the spiritual founder of Zoroastrianism. He is said to have been an Iranian prophet who founded a religious movement that challenged the existing traditions of ancient Iranian religion, and inaugurated a movement that eventually became a staple religion in ancient Iran. He was a native speaker of Old Avestan and lived in the eastern part of the Iranian plateau, but his exact birthplace is uncertain.\n\nThere is no scholarly consensus on when he lived. Some scholars, using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence, suggest a dating to somewhere in the second millennium BC. Other scholars date him to the 7th and 6th centuries BC as a near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great. Zoroastrianism eventually became the official state religion of ancient Iran—particularly during the era of the Achaemenid Empire—and its distant subdivisions from around the 6th century BC until the 7th century AD, when the religion itself began to decline following the Arab-Muslim conquest of Iran. Zoroaster is credited with authorship of the Gathas as well as the Yasna Haptanghaiti, a series of hymns composed in his native Avestan dialect that comprise the core of Zoroastrian thinking. Little is known about Zoroaster; most of his life is known only from these scant texts. By any modern standard of historiography, no evidence can place him into a fixed period and the historicization surrounding him may be a part of a trend from before the 10th century AD that historicizes legends and myths. \n\n\n\n\n\n#JasonRezaJorjani #GnosticInformant #Zoroastrian",

Thank you existing Patrons.\r\n\r\nUberboyo's Channel:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrk8Y2fsR5i_5c1iTR9tZpg\n\nSong by UberBoyo (Time is a Weapon)\nhttps://youtu.be/dvl2w08p1v0\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche developed influential concepts such as the Übermensch and his doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, music, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew inspiration from Greek tragedy as well as figures such as Zoroaster, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nThe Apollonian and Dionysian is a two-fold philosophical concept, based on features of ancient Greek mythology: Apollo and Dionysus. This relationship takes the form of a dialectic. Even though the concept is related to The Birth of Tragedy, the poet Hölderlin had already spoken of it, and Winckelmann had talked of Bacchus.\n\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\nThe Course for Mystery Cults by Professor Litwa is NOW AVAILABLE!!!

Elaborating on the conception of Hamlet as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and is a living antithesis to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses the knowledge that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the Primordial Unity, which revives Dionysian nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, the experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by frenzy. Frenzy acts as intoxication and is crucial for the physiological condition that enables the creation of any art. Stimulated by this state, a person's artistic will is enhanced:\n\n\nNietzsche is adamant that the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with Euripides, that tragedy begins its Untergang (literally 'going under' or 'downward-way;' meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of Socratic rationalism and morality in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of ethics and reason robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. Plato continued along this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses found in the Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy. He notes that without the Apollonian, the Dionysian lacks the form and structure to make a coherent piece of art, and without the Dionysian, the Apollonian lacks the necessary vitality and passion. Only the fertile interplay of these two forces brought together as an art represented the best of Greek tragedy.\n\nAn example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book Patterns of Culture, where anthropologist Ruth Benedict acknowledges Nietzschean opposites of \"Apollonian\" and \"Dionysian\" as the stimulus for her thoughts about Native American cultures. Carl Jung has written extensively on the dichotomy in Psychological Types. Michel Foucault commented that his own book Madness and Civilization should be read \"under the sun of the great Nietzschean inquiry\". Here Foucault referenced Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred. Painter Mark Rothko was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy presented in The Birth of Tragedy.\n\nIn this video we discuss the current zeitgeist of today. We also look back at the Western Canon of Literature and how scripture, mythology, and philosophy as well as film and art shape who we are as a society.\r\n\r\n #Nietzsche #Uberboyo #birthoftragedy",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nSubscribe to Tominus Maximus:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TominusMaximus\n\nThe Etruscan civilization (/ɪˈtrʌskən/) of ancient Italy covered a territory, at its greatest extent, of roughly what is now Tuscany, western Umbria, and northern Lazio as well as what are now the Po Valley, Emilia-Romagna, south-eastern Lombardy, southern Veneto, and western Campania.\n\nThe territorial extent of Etruscan civilization reached its maximum around 750 BC, during the foundational period of the Roman Kingdom. Its culture flourished in three confederacies of cities: that of Etruria (Tuscany, Latium and Umbria), that of the Po Valley with the eastern Alps, and that of Campania.The league in northern Italy is mentioned in Livy. The reduction in Etruscan territory was gradual, but after 500 BC, the political balance of power on the Italian peninsula shifted away from the Etruscans in favor of the rising Roman Republic.\n\nThe earliest known examples of Etruscan writing are inscriptions found in southern Etruria that date to around 700 BC. The Etruscans developed a system of writing derived from the Euboean alphabet, which was used in the Magna Graecia (coastal areas located in Southern Italy). The Etruscan language remains only partly understood, making modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on much later and generally disapproving Roman and Greek sources. In the Etruscan political system, authority resided in its individual small cities, and probably in its prominent individual families. At the height of Etruscan power, elite Etruscan families grew very rich through trade with the Celtic world to the north and the Greeks to the south, and they filled their large family tombs with imported luxuries.\n\nIt was only in the 5th century BC, when the Etruscan civilization had been established for several centuries, that Greek writers started associating the name \"Tyrrhenians\" with the \"Pelasgians\", and even then, some did so in a way that suggests they were meant only as generic, descriptive labels for \"non-Greek\" and \"indigenous ancestors of Greeks\", respectively.\n\nThe 5th-century BC historians Thucydidesnd Herodotusand the 1st-century BC historian Strabo, did seem to suggest that the Tyrrhenians were originally Pelasgians who migrated to Italy from Lydia by way of the Greek island of Lemnos. They all described Lemnos as having been settled by Pelasgians, whom Thucydides identified as \"belonging to the Tyrrhenians\" (τὸ δὲ πλεῖστον Πελασγικόν, τῶν καὶ Λῆμνόν ποτε καὶ Ἀθήνας Τυρσηνῶν). As Strabo and Herodotus told it,the migration to Lemnos was led by Tyrrhenus / Tyrsenos, the son of Atys (who was king of Lydia). Strabo added that the Pelasgians of Lemnos and Imbros then followed Tyrrhenus to the Italian Peninsula. And, according to the logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos, there was a Pelasgian migration from Thessaly in Greece to the Italian peninsula, as part of which the Pelasgians colonized the area he called Tyrrhenia, and they then came to be called Tyrrhenians.\n\n\nHowever, the 1st-century BC historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek living in Rome, dismissed many of the ancient theories of other Greek historians and postulated that the Etruscans were indigenous people who had always lived in Etruria and were different from both the Pelasgians and the Lydians. Dionysius noted that the 5th-century historian Xanthus of Lydia, who was originally from Sardis and was regarded as an important source and authority for the history of Lydia, never suggested a Lydian origin of the Etruscans and never named Tyrrhenus as a ruler of the Lydians.\n\nSimilarly, the 1st-century BC historian Livy, in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri, said that the Rhaetians were Etruscans who had been driven into the mountains by the invading Gauls; and he asserted that the inhabitants of Raetia were of Etruscan origin.\n\nThe Alpine tribes have also, no doubt, the same origin (of the Etruscans), especially the Raetians; who have been rendered so savage by the very nature of the country as to retain nothing of their ancient character save the sound of their speech, and even that is corrupted.\n\nFirst-century historian Pliny the Elder also put the Etruscans in the context of the Rhaetian people to the north, and wrote in his Natural History (AD 79):\n\n\n\n\n#TominusMaximus #Etruscans #Rome #gnosticinformant",

Outreach Judaism is managed under the Eits Chaim Indonesia Foundation, which describes itself as an advocate for the Jewish faith, the Jewish people, and the State of Israel. After five years in Indonesia, Singer moved to Jerusalem on 9 May 2019\nOutreach Judaism\nSinger is the founder and director of Outreach Judaism, a Jewish counter-missionary organization.[3] It describes itself as \"an international organization that responds directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity.\" Singer cautions regarding congregations that \"are designed to appear Jewish, but are actually fundamentalist Christian churches, which use traditional Jewish symbols to lure the most vulnerable of our Jewish people into their ranks.\" Outreach Judaism was described by J. Gordon Melton in 2002 as an example of \"the current state of Jewish counter-cult activity.\" \nOther activities\nFrom 2002 to 2010 Singer hosted The Tovia Singer Show on Arutz Sheva's Israel National Radio. The show launched again in October 2013. The radio show had many prominent guests, including Israeli and American politicians, rabbis, terror victims, and authors. Among those who came on the show were: 47th Governor of Texas Rick Perry; American stand-up comedian in political satire, Jackie Mason; former US ambassador for the UN, John R. Bolton; businessman Ronald Lauder; Israeli Ambassador Dore Gold; American-born Israeli historian, author and politician, Michael Oren; Dead Sea Scroll expert Prof. Lawrence Schiffman; American conservative political activist, Alan Keyes; Israeli politician, Danny Danon; former American ambassador and an ardent anti-communist, Jeane Kirkpatrick and many others. Singer was also one of the first who interviewed Walid Shoebat. In 2006, Singer interviewed Wafa Sultan on the show.\n\nSinger is the author of the book and audio series Let's Get Biblical: Why Doesn't Judaism Accept the Christian Messiah? His new expanded edition is a two-volume book that takes a critical look at long-standing Christian charges against the Jewish faith. According to David Brickner it has \"grabbed the attention of many evangelicals simply because it has been so widely distributed.\" A book review by Jewish Values Online described Singer as \"a master of his material\" and that \"his meticulous research and command of Biblical sources is most impressive.\"\n\nTogether with Eits Chaim Indonesia Foundation, whose founders are of Dutch Jewish descent, Singer started the only Jewish Center legally acknowledged by the Indonesian Minister of Religious Affairs - Torat Chaim. Since Judaism is not yet a recognized religion in Indonesia, religious freedom for Torat Chaim and its members is guaranteed and protected by the Christian Desk of the Indonesian Religious Affairs Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Melchizedek #Hebrews #ToviaSinger #gnostic #gnosticinformant",

David Litwa:\nhttps://mdavidlitwa.wordpress.com/\n\nCarpocrates of Alexandria was the founder of an early Christian sect from the first half of the 2nd century. As with many \"Gnostic\" sects, one knows of the Carpocratians only through the writings of the Church Fathers, principally Irenaeus of Lyons and Clement of Alexandria. As these writers strongly opposed \"Gnostic\" doctrine, there is a question of negative bias when using this source. While the various references to the Carpocratians differ in some details, they agree as to the libertinism of the sect, a charge commonly levied by pagans against Christians and conversely by Christians against pagans and heretics.\n\nEpiphanes is the author of On Righteousness, a notable early Gnostic literary work that promotes communist principles, that was published and discussed by Clement of Alexandria, in Stromaties, III. Epiphanes was also attributed with founding Monadic Gnosis. G.R.S. Mead however thinks that Epiphanes was a legend and may not have been an actual person, that the real author of On Righteousness may be the Valentinian, Marcus. This is purely speculative though. His deification is one of the most attested apotheosis events in world history.\n\nAnother legend that Epiphanes led Monadic Gnosis, may have come from misunderstanding of the Greek word eiphanes which may have been mistaken as a personal name if in text, when in fact the Greek means distinguished, as in a distinguished teacher.\n\nA notable belief attributed to Epiphanes and described in On Righteousness was the idea of communal living or communism, including shared property and spouses. \nThe text begins: \n\"The righteousness of God is a kind of sharing along with equality.\" The idea of communal living may have come from Plato's ideas in The Republic. Clement took this very seriously as a sign of libertine promiscuity, but the real followers were likely to be more philosophical and merely observant of the Early Christian practice of Agape, communal feasts and property.\n\nThis is backed up by multiple verses from Paul's Epistles as well as the Book of Acts.\n\nFor the NEWEST BOOK by M.

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nIn 2010, Sun TV telecast video recordings that claimed to show Nithyananda and an actress Ranjitha (who was one of his followers) in a bedroom. The story became viral among news media in Tamil Nadu. Nithyananda and Ranjitha claimed the video to be fabricated and accused Sun TV of extortion. A Forensic Sciences Laboratory in Bengaluru confirmed that the video appeared to be that of Nithyananda and Ranjitha but did not discuss whether the tape was faked. Sun TV and other media channels since then were subject to various lawsuits and criminal investigations for blackmail using morphed content.Ranjitha filed a complaint with High Court of Karnataka against news channels. Channels were ordered to apologize to Ranjitha upon acknowledging the content was faked.\n\nIn 2010, a United States citizen who was a disciple of Nithyananda accused him of raping her in the US and in India repeatedly over the course of five years. She filed a complaint with Ann Arbor, Michigan, Police, and police didn't commence any formal investigation.] In turn, Nithyananda sued her in US for defamation caused by her accusation, for which she was penalized US$463,211.25 by a default judgement in 2014. She also filed a complaint with the Karnataka Police in India. On 19 February 2018, the Third Additional District and Sessions Court in Ramanagara ordered the framing of charges against Nithyananda and five others in relation to the case. Criminal revision petitions by the accused were dismissed in the Karnataka High Court on 16 May 2018. An appeal against the High Court decision in the Supreme Court of India, in which all of the accused pleaded not guilty (except for one who was absent from court), was dismissed on 1 June 2018, following which charges were framed in the Ramanagara court on 4 June.\n\nIn 2019, a couple from Tamil Nadu approached the High Court of Gujarat claiming that three of their four children were taken to Nithyananda's ashram in Ahmedabad from Bangalore without their knowledge; the couple sought return of their children to their custody. A first information report (FIR) for alleged abduction was filed by the Gujarat Police in relation to the case on 17 November 2019. In affidavits filed in the Gujarat High Court from various locations in the Americas, two of the missing children, who were by that time adults, rejected their father's claim that they have been detained forcibly. In a joint live video statement, the two girls further claimed that their father had plotted the abduction controversy after his name cropped up in an embezzlement case.\n\n\n\n\n\n#Nithyananda #Kailaasa #Hinduguru #gnosticinformant",

Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nHeliopolis 'City of the Sun' was a major city of ancient Egypt. It was the capital of the 13th or Heliopolite Nome of Lower Egypt and a major religious centre. It is now located in Ayn Shams, a northeastern suburb of Cairo.\n\nHeliopolis was one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt, occupied since the Predynastic Period. It greatly expanded under the Old and Middle Kingdoms but is today mostly destroyed, its temples and other buildings having been scavenged for the construction of medieval Cairo. Most information about the ancient city comes from surviving records.\n\nThe major surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the obelisk of the Temple of Ra-Atum erected by Senusret I of Dynasty XII. It still stands in its original position, now within Al-Masalla in Al-Matariyyah, Cairo. The 21 m (69 ft) high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000 lbs) and is believed to be the oldest surviving obelisk in the world.The Romans also took the Obelisk of Montecitorio from the city to Rome, under Augustus, where it remains. The two smaller obelisks called Cleopatra's Needle, in London and New York, also came from the city.\n\nAlexander the Great, on his march from Pelusium to Memphis, halted at this city.\n\nThe temple of Ra was said to have been, to a special degree, a depository for royal records, and Herodotus states that the priests of Heliopolis were the best informed in matters of history of all the Egyptians. Heliopolis flourished as a seat of learning during the Greek period; the schools of philosophy and astronomy are claimed to have been frequented by Orpheus, Homer, Pythagoras, Plato, Solon, and other Greek philosophers. Ichonuphys was lecturing there in 308 BC, and the Greek mathematician Eudoxus, who was one of his pupils, learned from him the true length of the year and month, upon which he formed his octaeterid, or period of 8 years or 99 months. Ptolemy II had Manetho, the chief priest of Heliopolis, collect his history of the ancient kings of Egypt from its archives. The later Ptolemies probably took little interest in their \"father\" Ra, and Alexandria had eclipsed the learning of Heliopolis; thus with the withdrawal of royal favour Heliopolis quickly dwindled, and the students of native lore deserted it for other temples supported by a wealthy population of pious citizens. By the first century BC, in fact, Strabo found the temples deserted, and the town itself almost uninhabited, although priests were still present.\n\nHeliopolis was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, being noted by most major geographers of the period, including Ptolemy, Herodotus, and others, down to the Byzantine geographer Stephanus of Byzantium.\n\nJosephus, Against Apion, Book 1 (26-27)\n It is said that the priest who gave\nthem a constitution and code of laws was a native\nof Heliopolis, named Osarsiph ^ after the Heliopolitan god Osiris, and that when he went over to\nthis people he changed his name and was called\nMoses.\"\n\n(Excerpt From the Life of Heliogabalus)\nAs soon as he entered the city, however, neglecting all the affairs of the provinces, he established Heliogabalus as a god on the Palatine Hill close to the imperial palace; and he built him a temple, to which he desired to transfer the emblem of the Great Mother, the fire of Vesta, the Palladium, the shields of the Salii, and all that the Romans held sacred, purposing that no god might be worshipped at Rome save only Heliogabalus. He declared, furthermore, that the religions of the Jews and the Samaritans and the rites of the Christians must also be transferred to this place, in order that the priesthood of Heliogabalus might include the mysteries of every form of worship.   - Historia Augusta Antonius Heliogabalus\n\nOther sources used in this video:\nHesiod Theogony (Helios)\nApollodorus of Rhodes (Heliadae)\nCassius Dio (Heliogabalus)\nPlutarch (On Isis & Osiris)\nManetho (Egyptian History)\nGenesis 37 (Joseph)\nPlato Cratylus\n*Egyptian Book of the Dead \"Of Making The Perfect Khu\" From Papyrus of Nu, British Museum NO. 10,477 sheet 16*\n*Obelisk of Heliopolis Inscription*\n\n(Prophecy about Egypt)\n On that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing allegiance to YHVH of Hosts; one will be called the City of the Sun. - Isaiah 19:18\n\n\n\n#Heliopolis #Helios #Gnosticinformant #Gnostic #Genesis nag hammadi library",

Approximately 1,500 texts and fragments have been found to date. The texts were written in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE.\n\nThe most famous of the Ugarit texts are the approximately fifty epic poems; the three major literary texts are the Baal Cycle, the Legend of Keret, and the Tale of Aqhat. The other texts include 150 tablets describing the Ugaritic cult and rituals, 100 letters of correspondence, a very small number of legal texts (Akkadian is considered to have been the contemporary language of law), and hundreds of administrative or economic texts.\n\nUnique among the Ugarit texts are the earliest known abecedaries, lists of letters in alphabetic cuneiform, where not only the canonical order of Phoenician script is evidenced, but also the traditional names for letters of the alphabet.\n\nOther tablets found in the same location were written in other cuneiform languages (Sumerian, Hurrian and Akkadian), as well as Egyptian and Luwian hieroglyphs, and Cypro-Minoan.\n\nThe Canaanite religion was the group of ancient Semitic religions practiced by the Canaanites living in the ancient Levant from at least the early Bronze Age through the first centuries AD. Canaanite religion was polytheistic and, in some cases, monolatristic.\n\nBefore the beginning of kingship in Sumer, the city-states were effectively ruled by theocratic priests and religious officials. Later, this role was supplanted by kings, but priests continued to exert great influence on Sumerian society. In early times, Sumerian temples were simple, one-room structures, sometimes built on elevated platforms. Towards the end of Sumerian civilization, these temples developed into ziggurats—tall, pyramidal structures with sanctuaries at the tops.\n\nThe Sumerians believed that the universe had come into being through a series of cosmic births. First, Nammu, the primeval waters, gave birth to Ki (the earth) and An (the sky), who mated together and produced a son named Enlil. Enlil separated heaven from earth and claimed the earth as his domain. Humans were believed to have been created by Enki, the son of Nammu and An. Heaven was reserved exclusively for deities and, upon their deaths, all mortals' spirits, regardless of their behavior while alive, were believed to go to Kur, a cold, dark cavern deep beneath the earth, which was ruled by the goddess Ereshkigal and where the only food available was dry dust. In later times, Ereshkigal was believed to rule alongside her husband Nergal, the god of death.\n\nThe major deities in the Sumerian pantheon included An, the god of the heavens, Enlil, the god of wind and storm, Enki, the god of water and human culture, Ninhursag, the goddess of fertility and the earth, Utu, the god of the sun and justice, and his father Nanna, the god of the moon. During the Akkadian Empire, Inanna, the goddess of sex, beauty, and warfare, was widely venerated across Sumer and appeared in many myths, including the famous story of her descent into the Underworld.\n\nSumerian religion heavily influenced the religious beliefs of later Mesopotamian peoples; elements of it are retained in the mythologies and religions of the Hurrians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and other Middle Eastern culture groups. Scholars of comparative mythology have noticed many parallels between the stories of the ancient Sumerians and those recorded later in the early parts of the Hebrew Bible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#MatthewMonger #YHWH #Etymology #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

The Bible is an anthology—a compilation of texts of a variety of forms—originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophesies, among other genres. The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon. Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, while understanding what that means in different ways.\n\nThe origins of the oldest writings of the Israelites are lost to antiquity. The religious texts were compiled by different religious communities into various official collections. The earliest contained the first five books of the Bible called the Torah which was accepted as Jewish canon by the 5th century BCE. A second collection of narrative histories and prophesies was canonized in the 3rd century BCE. A third collection containing psalms, proverbs, and narrative histories, was canonized sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.[1] The transmission history of these combined collections spans approximately 3000 years, and there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon was settled in its present form. Some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty (140–40 BCE),[a] while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. The Dead Sea scrolls are approximately dated to 250 BCE–100 CE and are the oldest existing copies of the books of the Hebrew Bible. Tanakh is an alternate term for the Hebrew Bible composed of the first letters of the three parts of the Hebrew scriptures: the Torah (\"Teaching\"), the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\"), and the Ketuvim (\"Writings\"). The Torah is also known as the Pentateuch. The Masoretic Text, in Hebrew and Aramaic, is considered the authoritative text by Rabbinic Judaism; the Septuagint, a Koine Greek translation from the third and second centuries BCE, largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible.\n\nChristianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the Old Testament. The early Church continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books. The gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts coalesced into the \"New Testament\" very early. In the first three centuries CE, the concept of a closed canon emerged in response to heretical writings in the second century. The list of books included in the Catholic Bible was established as canon by the Council of Rome in 382, followed by that of Hippo in 393 and Carthage in 397. Christian biblical canons range from the 73 books of the Catholic Church canon, and the 66-book canon of most Protestant denominations, to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon, among others.\n\nWith estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling publication of all time. It has had a profound influence both on Western culture and history and on cultures around the globe. The study of the Bible through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well. The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.\n\nConsidered to be scriptures (sacred, authoritative religious texts), the books were compiled by different religious communities into various biblical canons (official collections of scriptures). The earliest compilation, containing the first five books of the Bible and called the Torah (meaning \"law\", \"instruction\", or \"teaching\") or Pentateuch (\"five books\"), was accepted as Jewish canon by the 5th century BCE. A second collection of narrative histories and prophesies, called the Nevi'im (\"prophets\"), was canonized in the 3rd century BCE. A third collection called the Ketuvim (\"writings\"), containing psalms, proverbs, and narrative histories, was canonized sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE. These three collections were written mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with some parts in Aramaic, which together form the Hebrew Bible or \"TaNaKh\" (an abbreviation of \"Torah\", \"Nevi'im\", and \"Ketuvim\"). The transmission history of the Tanakh spans approximately 3000 years.\n\n\n\n#OldTestament #NewTestament #Bible #Jesus #Christianity #Gnostic #GnosticInformant #religion gnostic informant recurring themes",

Duke University\nMaster of Divinity (M.Div.) Emory University\n\nIn this Video we discuss Aulus Cornelius Celcus (175–177 C.E.)\n\nCelsus was the author of a work titled The True Word (Logos Alēthēs). The argument was contested by the contemporary Christian community and the book eventually banned in 448 AD by order of Valentinian III and Theodosius II, along with Porphyry's 15 books attacking the Christians, The Philosophy from Oracles, so no complete copies are extant, but it can be reconstructed from Origen's detailed account of it in his 8 volume refutation, which quotes Celsus extensively. Origen's work has survived and thereby preserved Celsus' work with it.\n\nCelsus seems to have been interested in Ancient Egyptian religion, and he seemed to know of Hellenistic Jewish logos-theology, both of which suggest The True Doctrine was composed in Alexandria. Origen indicates that Celsus was an Epicurean living under the Emperor Hadrian.\n\nCelsus writes that \"there is an ancient doctrine [archaios logos] which has existed from the beginning, which has always been maintained by the wisest nations and cities and wise men\". He leaves Jews and Moses out of those he cites (Egyptians, Syrians, Indians, Persians, Odrysians, Samothracians, Eleusinians, Hyperboreans, Galactophagoi, Druids, and Getae), and instead blames Moses for the corruption of the ancient religion: \"the goatherds and shepherds who followed Moses as their leader were deluded by clumsy deceits into thinking that there was only one God, [and] without any rational cause ... these goatherds and shepherds abandoned the worship of many gods\". However, Celsus' harshest criticism was reserved for Christians, who \"wall themselves off and break away from the rest of mankind\".\n\nCelsus initiated a critical attack on Christianity, ridiculing many of its dogmas. He wrote that some Jews said Jesus' father was actually a Roman soldier named Pantera. Origen considered this a fabricated story. In addition, Celsus addressed the miracles of Jesus, holding that \"Jesus performed his miracles by sorcery (γοητεία)\":\n\nO light and truth! he distinctly declares, with his own voice, as ye yourselves have recorded, that there will come to you even others, employing miracles of a similar kind, who are wicked men, and sorcerers; and Satan. So that Jesus himself does not deny that these works at least are not at all divine, but are the acts of wicked men; and being compelled by the force of truth, he at the same time not only laid open the doings of others, but convicted himself of the same acts. Is it not, then, a miserable inference, to conclude from the same works that the one is God and the other sorcerers? Why ought the others, because of these acts, to be accounted wicked rather than this man, seeing they have him as their witness against himself? For he has himself acknowledged that these are not the works of a divine nature, but the inventions of certain deceivers, and of thoroughly wicked men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Celsus #Origen #MDAVIDLITWA #Gnostic #GnosticInformant gnostic informant m david litwa justin martyr irenaeus against heresies contra celsum",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nESHMUN was a Phoenician healer god, later identified with Asklepios, the patron of medicine, by the Greeks and the Romans. He seems to be attested since the third millennium bce in Syria, though his physiognomy becomes clear only in the first millennium bce. The etymology of Eshmun clearly connects him with \"oil,\" which had therapeutic and ritual functions (in relationship with the kingship ritual) in the ancient Near East. In the Ebla archives (middle of the third millennium bce), the theophoric element sí-mi-nu/a is found in some personal names, written dì-giš in Sumerian, meaning \"oil.\" In the ritual texts of Ugarit and Ras Ibn Hani, in the late Bronze Age (eighteenth century bce), the god Šmn is also mentioned as a beneficiary of offerings (Keilalphabetischen Texte aus Ugarit 1.164:9, 1.41:[45], 1.87:50). Unfortunately nothing is known about the functions or the role of this god in the Syrian pantheons, but his connection with oil must indicate that he was \"the one who oils,\" and thus \"the one who heals.\" This is surely the main reason why Eshmun was later assimilated to Asklepios/Aesculapius. His occasional interpretatio as Apollo (for example, in Carthage) is also based on the same background, because Apollo was also a salvific god. According to Philo of Byblos (Eus., Praeparation Evangelica I, 10, 38), Eshmun was Sydyk's son (Sydyk was the personification of Justice), while Damascius (Vita Is. ß 302) knows his father as Sadykos, who had first seven sons, the Dioscouri or Kabeiri, then an eighth son, Eshmun (Esmounos; the number 8 was a sign of election, of a special destiny). According to Pausanias (VII, 23,7–8), who refers a Sidonian testimony, Eshmun's father was Apollo, while the god himself was the Air, which brings health. According to Cicero (Nat. deor. III, 22, 57) and Lydus (De mens. IV, 142), Arsippos was the name of the third Aesculapius, that is, Rashap (Reshef), the semitic Apollo.\n\nEshmun and the Baal Tradition\nFrom a typological and historical point of view, Eshmun, though he is not a storm god, seems to be near to the Syrian Baal tradition, which emphasizes the salvific functions of the god, documented in Ugarit through Baal's connection with the Rapiu/Refaim (\"the healers\"=the dead). Eshmun's cult is documented not only in the sphere of public religion, but also on the level of private or popular beliefs, where the questions of health, wealth, and salvation were essential.\n\nThe earliest attestation of Eshmun seems to be the London Medical Papyrus, where we find, transcribed into Egyptian hieratic syllabic script, some short West Semitic magical texts, dated from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries bce (Steiner, J. C., Journal of Near Eastern Studies 51, 1992, pp. 191–200). One of them (no. 28) contains the name of Eshmun and probably also of Astarte, while the text of number 33 alludes to an anonymous \"healer\" (rpy), who is probably Eshmun.\n\nEshmun in Phoenicia\nThe first epigraphical evidence related to Eshmun is the treaty (754 bce) between Mati'el, the king of Arpad (North Syria) and Assurnirari V, king of Assyria, where Eshmun is mentioned in the group of the Syrian gods who warrant the treaty, together with Melqart (the Baal of Tyre; cf. State Archives of Assyria II, 1988, no. 2, VI, 22, p. 13). Both appear again in the treaty between Asarhaddon of Assyria and Baal of Tyre (675–670 bce). The consequences are stated, should the Tyrian king not respect the oath: \"May Melqart and Eshmun deliver your land to destruction and your people to deportation; may they [uproot] you from your land and take away the food from your mouth, the clothes from your body, and the oil for your anointing\" (State Archives of Assyria II, 1988, no. 5, IV, 14–17, p. 27). The mention of the oil probably alludes to Eshmun's specific functions. The association of Melqart, Baal of Tyre, and Eshmun, Baal of Sidon, is not rare. For example, in Batsalos, near Kition (Cyprus), the double divine name, Eshmun-Melqart, indicates a strong cultural association between the two gods, who protected and defended the people.\n\n\n\"Eshmun .\" Encyclopedia of Religion. .

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nCaesar Augustus (23 September 63 B.C.E. – 19 August C.E. 14), also known as Octavian, was the first Roman emperor, reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. His status as the founder of the Roman Principate (the first phase of the Roman Empire) has consolidated a legacy as one of the greatest leaders in human history. The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana.\n\nOriginally named Gaius Octavius, he was born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions. He, Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi (42 BC), the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members; Lepidus was exiled in 36 BC and Antony was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.\n\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates and the legislative assemblies, yet maintained autocratic authority by having the Senate grant him lifetime tenure as commander-in-chief, tribune and censor. A similar ambiguity is seen in his chosen names, the implied rejection of monarchical titles whereby he called himself Princeps Civitatis (First Citizen) juxtaposed with his adoption of the ancient title Augustus.\n\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum and Raetia, expanding possessions in Africa, and completing the conquest of Hispania, but suffered a major setback in Germania. \n\nIn 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died. His mother married a former governor of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and was elected consul in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar. Julia died in 52 or 51 BC, and Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.\n\nFrom this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the toga virilis four years later, and was elected to the College of Pontiffs in 47 BC. The following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, built by Julius Caesar.\n\nAccording to Nicolaus of Damascus, Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in Africa, but gave way when his mother protested. In 46 BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of Pompey, Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.  Velleius Paterculus reports that after that time, Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage. When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.\n\nOctavius was studying and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security, Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had adopted Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.\n\nOctavian avenged his adopted father from the grave and all 300 conspirators were dead within a few years. He conquered all of the Roman Empire and was the Sole Dictator after a final civil war with Antony. He then was initiated into the Mysteries of Eleusis, was named Augustus and styled himself as the Son of God (Divi Filius) until he died of old age.\n\nSources:\nSuetonius - 12 Caesars\nPlutarch - Lives\nCassius Dio - Roman History\nJosephus - Antiquities\nNicolaus of Damascus - Life of Augustus\nPhilo Judaeus - On the Embassy to Gaius\nOvid - Metamorphosis, Tristia \nLucan - Civil War\nVirgil - Georgics, Eclogues\nTacitus - Histories\nSeneca - Octavia\nHorace - Odes & Epodes\nJulius Marathus - Birth of Augustus (Suetonius)\nAsclepiades of Mendes - Theologoumenon (Suetonius)\nLivy - Rise of Rome\nPliny the Elder \n\n\n#Augustus #Caesar #DiviFilius #SonofGod #Octavian #Rome #Gnostic #GnosticInformant gnostic informant apotheosis",

(0:23) Only Begotten Son. \nEusebius and Philo of Byblos hand down an ancient Phoenician Myth of Chronos called Israel who offers his only begotten Son to Ouranos the Father in Heaven. This seems to be re-told in the Torah in Genesis when Abraham offers up Isaac to YHVH.\n\n9. (1:59) The Fish God Oannes\nThe fish God Oannes was an ancient Chaldean Deity who came out of the Sea and gave prophecy to the Chaldeans. He had an equivalent in Assyria known as Dagon. The Book of Jonah is clearly borrowing from this Myth. Jonah is also a translation of Oannes.\n\n8. (4:12) Dark Omens & the Death of a God\nAccording to Virgil's Georgics, the sky was dark, graves were opened up, and the earth quaked when Caesar was killed. The same story is told by Matthew about Jesus Crucifixion.\n\n7. (7:49) Tempted by the Devil in the Wilderness\nIn the Zend Avesta  Fargard XIX, Zoroaster is tempted by Angra Mainyu, the Ahriman, the Daeva of Daevas, to denounce his worship of the good laws of Ahura Mazda and he will be given the Boon to Rule All Nations. Jesus is tempted by the Devil, Satan, to worship him instead of the Father God, and he will be given all the Nations.\n\n6. (10:16) Anointed, Fame, Far & Wide\nIn Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus returns home and gets his feet Anointed by Eurycleia of Ithaca, whos name means \"Far & Wide\" in Greek. Jesus is Anointed at Bethany by Mary, and he tells her she will be remembered for her fame far and wide for what she has done. It is a pun on the name of Eurycleia of Ithaca.\n\n5. (11:40) Drifting in a Basket up the River\nSargon of Akkad is born of a slave, who sets Sargon adrift the Euphrates River, until he is taken in by a Princess who puts him as the Cup Bearer for the King of Kish. Moses is born of an Jewish-Egyptian (Levite) slave woman who sets him in a basket up the Nile river where he is taken in by a princess who makes Moses into the Cup-Bearer for Pharaoh. \n\n4. (12:36) Creation\nIn the Enuma Elish, there is 7 tablets of Creation. In the first tablet, it talks about the beginning of time being a deep abyss with no form except for primordial water gods Tiamat and Apsu. The 7th tablet talks about a day for rest for the gods. In Genesis 1, the beginning is a deep abyss with no form besides the Primordial Waters. The Hebrew word for the deep abyss is Tehom, which is cognate with Tiamat, the primordial Sumerian God. The 7th day of creation is a day of rest.\n\n3. (14:05) Begotten By God\nIn the Greek Alexander Romance, Alexander goes into the desert in search of the Oasis at Siwa, where the Great God Ammon tells him that He is the Son of God. Jesus goes into the desert in search for an Oasis where John the Baptist baptizes him, and he hears God tell him that He has been Begotten on this day.\n\n2 (15:10) The Flood\nIn the Greek Myth, Deucolion son of Prometheus is told to build an Arc to survive the coming flood sent by Zeus. The Sumerian Myths, Epic of Gilgamesh and Atrahasis, the protagonist builds an Ark for animals and family to survive a global flood sent by Anu, and at the end of the flood, he sends out 2 birds to find land, where they land the boat on a mountain. In Genesis, Noah builds an Ark and takes 2 of every animal, his family, and also sends out 2 birds to find land so he can land his Ark on a mountain.\n\n1. (16:47) 3 Day Motif\nThe 3 Day Motif is written about in the Myth of Inanna/Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld to Save Tammuz/Dummuzi the Shepherd. She is down in Hell for 3 days and goes through the 7 levels and takes off an article of clothing each time. She is given 2 maids to help her in her travels, and on the 4th day she rises with Tammuz and brings the Resurrection of the Dead with her.(Akitu Festival, Babylonian New Year/Spring Equinox) The book of Esther also gives us the same 3 day Motif in which she also has to remove clothing and is given 2 maids to help her. On the 4th day she is Triumphant and saves Mordecai from Haman. Jonah is in the belly of the fish for 3 days and 3 nights. Jesus is in the Belly of the Earth (Hell) for 3 days and 3 nights after he is Crucified on Passover (Spring Equinox) and rises on the next day. He is said to Resurrect the Dead when he returns for the 2nd coming.\n\nTop 10 Pagan Myths Found in the Bible\nNeal Sendlak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Top10 #PaganMyths #Bible #Gnostic #GnosticInformant gnostic informant descent of ishtar",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nEros, The Mightiest of All Gods\n\nIn Greek mythology, Eros (UK: /ˈɪərɒs, ˈɛrɒs/, US: /ˈɛrɒs, ˈɛroʊs/; Ancient Greek: Ἔρως, romanized: Érōs, lit. 'Desire') is the Greek god of love and sex. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\"desire\"). In the earliest account, he is a primordial god, while in later accounts he is described as one of the children of Aphrodite and Ares and, with some of his siblings, was one of the Erotes, a group of winged love gods.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony (c. 700 BC), one of the most ancient of all Greek sources, Eros (the god of love) was the fourth god to come into existence, coming after Chaos, Gaia (the Earth), and Tartarus (the abyss).\n\nHomer does not mention Eros. However, Parmenides (c. 400 BC), one of the pre-Socratic philosophers, makes Eros the first of all the gods to come into existence.\n\nThe Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries featured Eros as a very original god, but not quite primordial, since he was the child of Night (Nyx). Aristophanes (c. 400 BC), influenced by Orphism, relates the birth of Eros:\n\nAt the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light.\n\nIn Plato's Symposium, Phaedrus argues to Socrates that Eros (Love) is the Mightiest of all Gods. \n\nJesus tells his disciples that Love is the Greatest Commandment.\n\nThe Nag Hammadi text known as \"On the Origins of the World\" describes Eros as the First Blood with 2 Genders, before the Grape Vine, Fig Tree and Pomegranate.\n\nIn the ancient love novel by Longus aka Logos known as Daphis & Chloe, Eros is mentioned to be Greater than Zeus because he can control the Elements and change fates. Only Eros has power over other Gods. \n\nIt is Eros/Cupid who ultimately makes the Savior Gods and Heroes fall in love with the ones who need their help. This makes Eros the real unsung Savior among Gods and Heroes. \n\n\n\n#cupid #eros #love #Gnostic #GnosticInformant symposium plato phaedrus plato gnostic informant",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nPhilo of Alexandria (20 BCE – c.  50 CE)\n(Philo Judaeus) Also known to write about God the Father who gives his inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven to the Logos, Son of God, Savior. And how God is of Nature of 3.\nON THE CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE OR SUPPLIANTS:\n\nI.  Having mentioned the Essenes, who in all respects selected for their admiration and for their especial adoption the practical course of life, and who excel in all, or what perhaps may be a less unpopular and invidious thing to say, in most of its parts, I will now proceed, in the regular order of my subject, to speak of those who have embraced the speculative life, and I will say what appears to me to be desirable to be said on the subject, not drawing any fictitious statements from my own head for the sake of improving the appearance of that side of the question which nearly all poets and essayists are much accustomed to do in the scarcity of good actions to extol, but with the greatest simplicity adhering strictly to the truth itself, to which I know well that even the most eloquent men do not keep close in their speeches. Nevertheless we must make the endeavour and labour to attain to this virtue; for it is not right that the greatness of the virtue of the men should be a cause of silence to those who do not think it right that anything which is creditable should be suppressed in silence;  but the deliberate intention of the philosopher is at once displayed from the appellation given to them; for with strict regard to etymology, they are called therapeutae and therapeutrides, {from therapeuoµ, \"to heal.\"} either because they process an art of medicine more excellent than that in general use in cities (for that only heals bodies, but the other heals souls which are under the mastery of terrible and almost incurable diseases, which pleasures and appetites, fears and griefs, and covetousness, and follies, and injustice, and all the rest of the innumerable multitude of other passions and vices, have inflicted upon them), or else because they have been instructed by nature and the sacred laws to serve the living God, who is superior to the good, and more simple than the one, and more ancient than the unit;  When the Israelites saw and experienced this great miracle, which was an event beyond all description, beyond all imagination, and beyond all hope, both men and women together, under the influence of divine inspiration, becoming all one chorus, sang hymns of thanksgiving to God the Saviour, Moses the prophet leading the men, and Miriam the prophetess leading the women. Now the chorus of male and female worshippers being formed, as far as possible on this model, makes a most humorous concert, and a truly musical symphony, the shrill voices of the women mingling with the deep-toned voices of the men. The ideas were beautiful, the expressions beautiful, and the chorus-singers were beautiful; and the end of ideas, and expressions, and chorussingers, was piety; therefore, being intoxicated all night till the morning with this beautiful intoxication, without feeling their heads heavy or closing their eyes for sleep, but being even more awake than when they came to the feast, as to their eyes and their whole bodies, and standing there till morning, when they saw the sun rising they raised their hands to heaven, imploring tranquillity and truth, and acuteness of understanding. And after their prayers they each retired to their own separate abodes, with the intention of again practising the usual philosophy to which they had been wont to devote themselves.  This then is what I have to say of those who are called therapeutae, who have devoted themselves to the contemplation of nature, and who have lived in it and in the soul alone, being citizens of heaven and of the world, and very acceptable to the Father and Creator of the universe because of their virtue, which has procured them his love as their most appropriate reward, which far surpasses all the gifts of fortune, and conducts them to the very summit and perfection of happiness.\n...\n And then some one rising up sings a hymn which has been made in honour of God, either such as he has composed himself, or some ancient one of some old poet, for they have left behind them many poems and songs in trimetre iambics, and in psalms of thanksgiving and in hymns, and songs at the time of libation, and at the altar, and in regular order, and in choruses, admirably measured out in various and well diversified strophes. And after him then others also arise in their ranks, in becoming order, while every one else listens in decent silence, except when it is proper for them to take up the burden of the song, and to join in at the end; for then they all, both men and women, join in the hymn.\n\n#RussellGimirkin #therapeutae #GnosticInformant",

Medea figures in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, appearing in Hesiod's Theogony around 700 BCE, but best known from Euripides's tragedy Medea and Apollonius of Rhodes' epic Argonautica. Medea is known in most stories as a sorceress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess Hecate.\n\nMedea plays the archetypal role of helper-maiden, aiding Jason in his search for the Golden Fleece by using her magic to save his life out of love. Once he finished his quest, she abandons her native home of Colchis, and flees westwards with Jason, where they eventually settle in Corinth and get married. Euripides' 5th century BC tragedy Medea, depicts the ending of said union with Jason, when after ten years of marriage, Jason abandons her to wed king Creon's daughter Creusa. Medea and her sons by Jason are to be banished from Corinth. In revenge, she murders Creusa with poisoned gifts. Later, she murders her own sons by Jason before fleeing for Athens, where she eventually marries king Aegeus.\n\nThe three Gorgon sisters—Medusa, Stheno, and Euryale—were all children of the ancient marine deities Phorcys (or \"Phorkys\") and his sister Ceto (or \"Keto\"), chthonic monsters from an archaic world. Their genealogy is shared with other sisters, the Graeae, as in Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, which places both trios of sisters far off \"on Kisthene's dreadful plain\":\n\nNear them their sisters three, the Gorgons, winged\nWith snakes for hair—hatred of mortal man.\n\nWhile ancient Greek vase-painters and relief carvers imagined Medusa and her sisters as having monstrous form, sculptors and vase-painters of the fifth century BC began to envisage her as being beautiful as well as terrifying. In an ode written in 490 BC, Pindar already speaks of \"fair-cheeked Medusa\".\n\nIn a late version of the Medusa myth, by the Roman poet Ovid (Metamorphoses 4.794–803), Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden, but when Neptune/Poseidon had sex with her in Minerva/Athena's temple,  Minerva punished Medusa by transforming her beautiful hair into horrible snakes.\n\nIn most versions of the story, she was beheaded by the hero Perseus, who was sent to fetch her head by King Polydectes of Seriphus because Polydectes wanted to marry Perseus's mother. The gods were well aware of this, and Perseus received help. He received a mirrored shield from Athena, sandals with gold wings from Hermes, a sword from Hephaestus and Hades's helm of invisibility. Since Medusa was the only one of the three Gorgons who was mortal, Perseus was able to slay her while looking at the reflection from the mirrored shield he received from Athena. During that time, Medusa was pregnant by Poseidon. When Perseus beheaded her, Pegasus, a winged horse, and Chrysaor, a giant wielding a golden sword, sprang from her body\n\n\n\n\n#Mythology #DavidHillman #Gnosticinformant #Gnostic #gnosis mark 14:51 mark 14:32 armegon gnostic informant",

The conversion could also be understood when Bard and Söderqvist place Zoroastrianism next to Taoism and Buddhism in their work in what they refer to as The Silk Route Triad, as the historical peak of religious thought and practice.\nBooks:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AAlexander+Bard&s=relevancerank&text=Alexander+Bard&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#AlexanderBard #SilkRoadTriad #Zoroastrian #Vedic #Hinduism #Sanskrit #persian #buddhism #taoism #daoism #Gnostic #GnosticInformant #gnosis monastic gnostic informant hegel cyrus the great",

Paris Match has called Enslaved “One small step for man…One giant leap for civil rights!”\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcha_Jacobovici\n\nIn this video we revisit the Exodus. Did it happen? Could scholars be wrong on the dating of 13th century B.C.E.? Could Simcha be correct that the true date of the historical Exodus is around the 16th century B.C.E.?\n\nTune in to find out!\n\n\n\n\n\n#NakedArchaeologist #SimchaJacobovici #Exodus #Gnostic #GnosticInformant #Bible",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nSubscribe to Tominus Maximus:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TominusMaximus\n @Tominus Maximus  \n\nThe story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\n— Edward Gibbon. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter 38 \"General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West\"\n\nIn this video we discuss Ancient Rome throughout it's major phases. Rome as a rising Mythical Kingdom led by Romulus Quirinus, to the Republic forged in Macedonian & Punic Wars, down to the Empire handed down to Caesar Augustus by the Will of His Father Gaius Julius Caesar. And Finally, after multiple dynasties and a dark age, the attempt at Redemption through Christian Theocracy. We discuss all this and more.\n\n\n\n#AncientRome #TominusMaximus #FallofRome #Gnostic #GnosticInformant flavius gnostic informant plutarch etruscan",

Ph.D (Harvard)\n Professor of Classics at Boston University, an authority on the\necstatic rituals of the god Dionysus.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Apples-Apollo-Christian-Mysteries-Eucharist/dp/089089924X\nWith the ethno-mycologist R. Gordon Wasson and Albert Hofmann, he identified the secret\npsychoactive ingredient in the visionary potion that was drunk by the initiates at the Eleusinian\nMystery. In Persephone’s Quest: Entheogens and the Origins of Religion (translated into\nSpanish), he proclaimed the centrality of psychoactive sacraments at the very beginnings of\nreligion, employing the neologism “entheogen” to free the topic from the pejorative\nconnotations for words like drug or hallucinogen.\n\nHis publications include: The World of Classical Myth: Gods and Goddesses: Heroines and\nHeroes; The Apples of Apollo: Pagan and Christian Mysteries of the Eucharist; The Road to\nEleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries (translated into Spanish, Modern Greek, German,\nand Italian); Sacred Mushrooms of the Goddess: Secrets of Eleusis (translated into Modern\nGreek); The Hidden World: Survival of Pagan Shamanic Themes in European Fairytales;\nMushrooms, Myth, and Mithras: The Drug Cult that Civilized Europe; The Effluents of Deity:\nAlchemy and Psychoactive Sacraments in Medieval and Renaissance Art; Entheogens, Myth and\nHuman Consciousness; Intensive Latin: First Year and Review; Ancient Greek: Intensive Review\nand Reference; IG II2 2323 The List of Victors in Comedy at the Dionysia; Pindar: Selected Odes:\nDionysus in Thrace: Ancient Entheogenic Themes in the Mythology and Archaeology of Northern\nGreece, Bulgaria and Turkey; The Son Conceived in Drunkenness: Magical Plants in the World of\nthe Greek Hero; The Great Gods of Samothrace and the Cult of the Little People; also over fifty\nessays in anthologies and journals.\n\nDennis R.

MacDonald offers a provocative explanation of those scandalous words of Christ from the Fourth Gospelan explanation that he argues would hardly have surprised some of the Gospel's early readers. John sounds themes that would have instantly been recognized as proper to the Greek god Dionysos (the Roman Bacchus), not least as he was depicted in Euripides's play The Bacchae. A divine figure, the offspring of a divine father and human mother, takes on flesh to live among mortals but is rejected by his own. He miraculously provides wine and offers it as a sacred gift to his devotees, women prominent among them, dies a violent deathand returns to life. Yet John takes his drama in a dramatically different direction: while Euripides's Dionysos exacts vengeance on the Theban throne, the Johannine Christ offers life to his followers. MacDonald employs mimesis criticism to argue that the earliest evangelist not only imitated Euripides but expected his readers to recognize Jesus as greater than Dionysos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Eucharist #DennisRMacdonald #CarlAPRuck #Dionysus #Bacchic #Jesus #Mysteries #EleusinianMysteries #Demeter #Gnostic #GnosticInformant gnostic informant eleusinian mysteries gnosticism true vine #dionysius mad god ancient greece revisited deity work literary analysis how to work with deities",

    "description": "Professor Steve Mason, Ph.D\nUniversity of Groningen | RUG · Qumran Research Institute\nSteve N. Mason is a Canadian historian of Judea in the Graeco-Roman period, best known for his studies of Josephus and early Christian writings. He was professor of classics, history and religious studies at York University in Toronto. He has been Kirby Laing Chair of New Testament Exegesis at Aberdeen University and works today at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.\nHe is an expert and authority on Josephus Scholarship.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on.

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nProfessor Steve Mason on Amazon:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Steve-Mason/e/B01HVVIDJK%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\n\nFlavius Josephus (c. 37 – c. 100) was a first-century Romano-Jewish historian and military leader, best known for The Jewish War, who was born in Jerusalem—then part of Roman Judea—to a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry.\n\nHe initially fought against the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War as head of Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in 67 CE to Roman forces led by Vespasian after the six-week siege of Yodfat. Josephus claimed the Jewish Messianic prophecies that initiated the First Jewish–Roman War made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. In response, Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius.\n\nFlavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator when Titus led the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the city's pillaging and the looting and destruction of Herod's Temple (Second Temple) soon followed.\n\nJosephus recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70 CE), including the siege of Masada. His most important works were The Jewish War (c. 75) and Antiquities of the Jews (c. 94). The Jewish War recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. Antiquities of the Jews recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity. Josephus's works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Palestine, and provide a significant and independent extra-Biblical account of such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, John the Baptist, James the Just, and possibly Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n\nNEW MERCH:\nhttps://my-store-c28d60.creator-spring.com/listing/GnosticInformant\nAbraxas & Gnosis\n(Coffee Mugs, Tee Shirts, Hoodies, Pants, Hats)\n\n\n\n\n\n#SteveMason #FlaviusJosephus #Antiquities #Gnostic #GnosticInformant interpolation dr. steve mason greek septuagaint gnostic informant",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nThe Eleusinian Mysteries (Greek: Ἐλευσίνια Μυστήρια, romanized: Eleusínia Mystḗria) were initiations held every year for the cult of Demeter and Persephone based at the Panhellenic Sanctuary of Eleusis in ancient Greece. They are the \"most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece\". Their basis was an old agrarian cult, and there is some evidence that they were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenean period.The Mysteries represented the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades, in a cycle with three phases: the descent (loss), the search, and the ascent, with the main theme being the ascent (ἄνοδος) of Persephone and the reunion with her mother. It was a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spread to Rome.Similar religious rites appear in the agricultural societies of the Near East and in Minoan Crete.\n\nThe Mysteries are related to a myth concerning Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility as recounted in one of the Homeric Hymns (c. 650 BC). According to the hymn, Demeter's daughter Persephone (also referred to as Kore, \"maiden\") was assigned the task of painting all the flowers of the earth. Before completion, she was seized by Hades, the god of the underworld, who took her to his underworld kingdom. Distraught, Demeter searched high and low for her daughter. Because of her distress, and in an effort to coerce Zeus to allow the return of her daughter, she caused a terrible drought in which the people suffered and starved, depriving the gods of sacrifice and worship. As a result, Zeus relented and allowed Persephone to return to her mother.\n\nAccording to the myth, during her search Demeter traveled long distances and had many minor adventures along the way. In one she taught the secrets of agriculture to Triptolemus. Finally, by consulting Zeus, Demeter reunited with her daughter and the earth returned to its former verdure and prosperity: the first spring.\n\nZeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever consumed food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds (either six or four according to the telling), which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother for the rest of the year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.\n\nIn the central foundation document of the mystery, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter line 415, Persephone is said to stay in Hades during winter and return to her mother in the spring of the year: \"This was the day [of Persephone's return], at the very beginning of bountiful springtime.\"\n\nPersephone's rebirth is symbolic of the rebirth of all plant life and the symbol of eternity of life that flows from the generations that spring from each other.\n\nKykeon (Ancient Greek: κυκεών, kykeȏn; from κυκάω, \"to stir, to mix\") was an Ancient Greek drink of various descriptions. Some were made mainly of water, barley and naturally occurring substances. Others were made with wine and grated cheese. It is widely believed that kykeon usually refers to a psychoactive compounded brew, as in the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries. A kykeon was used at the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries to break a sacred fast, but it is also mentioned as a favourite drink of Greek peasants.\n\nProfessor Carl Ruck, Ph.D (Harvard) Classicist\nhttps://www.bu.edu/classics/faculty-profiles/carl-ruck/\nCarl A.P. Ruck is an authority on the ecstatic rituals of the god Dionysus. With the ethno-mycologist R. Gordon Wasson and Albert Hofmann, he identified the secret psychoactive ingredient in the visionary potion that was drunk by the initiates at the Eleusinian Mystery. In Persephone’s Quest: Entheogens and the Origins of Religion, he proclaimed the centrality of psychoactive sacraments at the very beginnings of religion, employing the neologism “entheogen” to free the topic from the pejorative connotations for words like drug or hallucinogen.\nwww.entheomedia.net\nEthno-mycologist R.

Emory University\n\nThe Gospel According to Mary Magdalene\nPDF for Gospel of Mary:\nhttps://www.scriptural-truth.com/PDF_Apocrypha/Mary%20Magdalene.pdf\n The Savior said, All nature, all formations, all creatures exist in and with\none another, and they will be\nresolved again into their own roots.\n23) For the nature of matter is resolved into the roots of its own nature alone.\n24) He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n25) Peter said to him, Since you have explained everything to us, tell us this\nalso: What is the sin of the\nworld?\n26) The Savior said There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do\nthe things that are like the nature\nof adultery, which is called sin.\n27) That is why the Good came into your midst, to the essence of every nature\nin order to restore it to its root.\n28) Then He continued and said, That is why you become sick and die, for you\nare deprived of the one who\ncan heal you.\n29) He who has a mind to understand, let him understand.\n30) Matter gave birth to a passion that has no equal, which proceeded from\nsomething contrary to nature.\nThen there arises a disturbance in its whole body.\n31) That is why I said to you, Be of good courage, and if you are discouraged\nbe encouraged in the presence\nof the different forms of nature.\n32) He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n33) When the Blessed One had said this, He greeted them all,saying, Peace be\nwith you. Receive my peace\nunto yourselves.\n34) Beware that no one lead you astray saying Lo here or lo there! For the Son\nof Man is within you.\n35) Follow after Him!\n36) Those who seek Him will find Him.\n37) Go then and preach the gospel of the Kingdom\n38) Do not lay down any rules beyond what I appointed you, and do not give a\nlaw like the lawgiver lest you\nbe constrained by it.\n39) When He said this He departed.\nChapter 5\n1) But they were grieved. They wept greatly, saying, How shall we go to the\nGentiles and preach the gospel of\nthe Kingdom of the Son of Man? If they did not spare Him, how will they spare\nus?\n2) Then Mary stood up, greeted them all, and said to her brethren, Do not\nweep and do not grieve nor be\nirresolute, for His grace will be entirely with you and will protect you.\n3) But rather, let us praise His greatness, for He has prepared us and made us\ninto Men.\n4) When Mary said this, she turned their hearts to the Good, and they began to\ndiscuss the words of the\nSavior.\n5) Peter said to Mary, Sister we know that the Savior loved you more than the\nrest of woman.\n6) Tell us the words of the Savior which you remember which you know, but\nwe do not, nor have we heard\nthem.\n 1) When Mary had said this, she fell silent, since it was to this point that the\nSavior had spoken with her.\n2) But Andrew answered and said to the brethren, Say what you wish to say\nabout what she has said. I at least\ndo not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are\nstrange ideas.\n3) Peter answered and spoke concerning these same things.\n4) He questioned them about the Savior: Did He really speak privately with a\nwoman and not openly to us?\nAre we to turn about and all listen to her? Did He prefer her to us?\n5) Then Mary wept and said to Peter, My brother Peter, what do you think? Do\nyou think that I have thought\nthis up myself in my heart, or that I am lying about the Savior?\n6) Levi answered and said to Peter, Peter you have always been hot tempered.\n7) Now I see you contending against the woman like the adversaries.\n8) But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely\nthe Savior knows her very\nwell.\n9) That is why He loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed and put\non the perfect Man, and separate\nas He commanded us and preach the gospel, not laying down any other rule or\nother law beyond what the\nSavior said.\n10) And when they heard this they began to go forth to proclaim and to\npreach.\n\nIn this video we discuss the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, found among the Coptic Egyptian Nag Hamadi Scriptures in the 19th century.\n\n\nNEW MERCH:\nhttps://my-store-c28d60.creator-spring.com\nAbraxas & Gnosis\n(Coffee Mugs, Tee Shirts, Hoodies, Pants, Hats)\n\n\n#GospelofMary #NagHamadi #MDavidLitwa #Gnostic #GnosticInformant gnostic informant sony bmg music entertainment rca records label 2022 cj wallis geffen",

Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nFor Professor Lester L. Grabbe:\nhttps://www.closertotruth.com/contributor/lester-grabbe/profile\nBIOGRAPHY\nLester L. Grabbe is a retired American scholar and Emeritus Professor of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism at the University of Hull, England.\n\nAs an historian of ancient Judaism, he has authored several standard treatments. He founded and convenes the European Seminar on Methodology in Israel’s History, and publishes the proceedings in the sub-series European Seminar in Historical Methodology. Before retirement, he established and taught for several years a module, Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, and another module, Religious Sectarianism in History and the Modern World.\n\nAn alumnus of Claremont Graduate University, he was a student of William H. Brownlee and frequent guest on both Viking Radio and Radio Humberside to discuss such topics as: the Ten Commandments, the Jewish festivals, the 4th of July, and Nostradamus and the millennium. Grabbe delivered the 2008 Brownlee Memorial Lecture on the topic: Exit David and Solomon? The Current Debate on the History of Ancient Israel.\n\nAt age sixty-five, Grabbe was presented with a Festschrift, a memorial book, by editors Philip Davies and Diana Edelman, containing a collection of thirty essays by his colleagues and friends, offering \"reflections on the practice and theory of history writing, on the current controversies and topics of major interest\". The essays show Grabbe's influence on the field of biblical studies and history.\n\n\nLink for the DEBATE (Pay Per View EXCLUSIVE):\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/jesus-resurrection-tc/\n\n\nNEW MERCH:\nhttps://my-store-c28d60.creator-spring.com\nAbraxas & Gnosis\n(Coffee Mugs, Tee Shirts, Hoodies, Pants, Hats)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Hyksos #Egypt #Exodus #LesterGrabbe #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

Thank you existing Patrons.\r\n\r\nLink for the DEBATE (Pay Per View EXCLUSIVE):\r\nhttps://gnosticinformant--ehrman.thrivecart.com/jesus-resurrection-tc/\r\n\r\nDr. Robert M. Price:\r\nhttps://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/\r\n\r\nThe Pharisees\r\nThe most important of the three were the Pharisees because they are the spiritual fathers of modern Judaism. Their main distinguishing characteristic was a belief in an Oral Law that God gave to Moses at Sinai along with the Torah. The Torah, or Written Law, was akin to the U.S. Constitution in the sense that it set down a series of laws that were open to interpretation. The Pharisees believed that God also gave Moses the knowledge of what these laws meant and how they should be applied. This oral tradition was codified and written down roughly three centuries later in what is known as the Talmud.\r\n\r\nThe Pharisees also maintained that an after-life existed, and that God punished the wicked and rewarded the righteous in the world to come. They also believed in a messiah who would herald an era of world peace.\r\n\r\nPharisees were in a sense blue-collar Jews who adhered to the tenets developed after the destruction of the Temple; that is, such things as individual prayer and assembly in synagogues. They accepted Hellenization and Platonist ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Sadducees\r\nThe Sadducees were elitists who wanted to maintain the priestly caste who adhered to strict Torah Observance. They were thought to be the Sons of Zadok & Aaron, the Levites and Priestly class. The Sadducees rejected the idea of the Oral Law and insisted on a literal interpretation of the Written Law; consequently, they did not believe in a bodily resurrection, since it is not mentioned in the Torah. The focus of Sadducee life was rituals associated with the Temple.\r\n\r\nThe Sadducees disappeared around 70 A.D., after the destruction of the Second Temple. None of the writings of the Sadducees has survived, so the little we know about them comes from their Pharisaic opponents.\r\n\r\nThese two “parties” served in the Great Sanhedrin, a kind of Jewish Supreme Court made up of 71 members whose responsibility was to interpret civil and religious laws.\r\n\r\nThe Essenes\r\nA third faction, the Essenes, emerged out of disgust with the other two. This sect believed the others had corrupted the city and the Temple. They moved out of Jerusalem and lived a monastic life in the desert, adopting strict dietary laws and a commitment to celibacy.\r\n\r\nThe Essenes are particularly interesting to scholars because they are believed to be an offshoot of the group that lived in Qumran, near the Dead Sea. In 1947, a Bedouin shepherd stumbled into a cave containing various ancient artifacts and jars containing manuscripts describing the beliefs of the sect and events of the time.\r\n\r\nThe most important documents, often only parchment fragments that had to be meticulously restored, were the earliest known copies of the Old Testament. The similarity of the substance of the material found in the scrolls to that in the modern scriptures has confirmed the authenticity of the Bible used today.\r\n\r\n#Pharisees #Sadducees #Essenes #RobertMPrice #GnosticInformant",

The retention of the Hebrew form shows that their beliefs may represent the earliest stages of Gnosticism. Hippolytus regards them as among the first to be called simply \"Gnostics\", alleging that they alone have sounded the depths of knowledge.\nThe Naassenes had one or more books out of which Hippolytus of Rome largely quotes in the Philosophumena, which professed to contain heads of discourses communicated by James, the brother of Jesus, to Mariamne. They contained treatises of a mystical, philosophic, devotional, and exegetical character, rather than a cosmological exposition. A very interesting feature of the book seems to have been the specimens it gave of Ophite hymnology.\nThe writer is possibly Greek. He does indeed use the Hebrew words Naas and Caulacau, but these words had already passed into the common Gnostic vocabulary so as to become known to many unacquainted with Hebrew. He shows a great knowledge of the religious mysteries of various nations. For instance, he dilates much on the Phrygian rites, and the whole section seems to be a commentary on a hymn to the Phrygian Attis.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on.

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nProfessor Steve Mason on Amazon:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Steve-Mason/e/B01HVVIDJK%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\n\nFlavius Josephus (c. 37 – c. 100) was a first-century Romano-Jewish historian and military leader, best known for The Jewish War, who was born in Jerusalem—then part of Roman Judea—to a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry.\n\nHe initially fought against the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War as head of Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in 67 CE to Roman forces led by Vespasian after the six-week siege of Yodfat. Josephus claimed the Jewish Messianic prophecies that initiated the First Jewish–Roman War made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. In response, Vespasian decided to keep Josephus as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became Emperor in 69 CE, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the emperor's family name of Flavius.\n\nFlavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and friend of Vespasian's son Titus, serving as his translator when Titus led the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Since the siege proved ineffective at stopping the Jewish revolt, the city's pillaging and the looting and destruction of Herod's Temple (Second Temple) soon followed.\n\nJosephus recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70 CE),[5] including the siege of Masada. His most important works were The Jewish War (c. 75) and Antiquities of the Jews (c. 94). The Jewish War recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. Antiquities of the Jews recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity. Josephus's works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Palestine, and provide a significant and independent extra-Biblical account of such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, John the Baptist, James the Just, and possibly Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n\n\n\n\n#SteveMason #FlaviusJosephus #Antiquities #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

    "description": "https://www.patreon.com/gnosticinformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on. Any amount helps me. Thank you existing Patrons.\n\nIn this video, we discuss how Isaiah's Suffering Servant is about the Nation of Israel. This is a passage that was taken out of context by Christians in order to make this a prophecy about Jesus Christ.  The English translations and other Christian Bibles also change some of the plurality from the Hebrew (Lamo/Lehem) which means \"them/they\" into \"He\".\n\nIsaiah 53 (New International Version) (The Suffering Servant)\n\n1. Who has believed our message\n    and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\n2. He grew up before him like a tender shoot,\n    and like a root out of dry ground.\nHe had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,\n    nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.\n3. He was despised and rejected by mankind,\n    a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.\nLike one from whom people hide their faces\n    he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.\n4. Surely he took up our pain\n    and bore our suffering,\nyet we considered him punished by God,\n    stricken by him, and afflicted.\n5. But he was pierced for our transgressions,\n    he was crushed for our iniquities;\nthe punishment that brought us peace was on him,\n    and by his wounds we are healed.\n6. We all, like sheep, have gone astray,\n    each of us has turned to our own way;\nand the Lord has laid on him\n    the iniquity of us all.\n7. He was oppressed and afflicted,\n    yet he did not open his mouth;\nhe was led like a lamb to the slaughter,\n    and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,\n    so he did not open his mouth.\n8. By oppression and judgment he was taken away.\n    Yet who of his generation protested?\nFor he was cut off from the land of the living;\n    for the transgression of my people he was punished.\n9. He was assigned a grave with the wicked,\n    and with the rich in his death,\nthough he had done no violence,\n    nor was any deceit in his mouth.\n10. Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,\n    and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin,\nhe will see his offspring and prolong his days,\n    and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.\n11. After he has suffered,\n    he will see the light of life and be satisfied\nby his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,\n    and he will bear their iniquities.\n12. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,\n    and he will divide the spoils with the strong,\nbecause he poured out his life unto death,\n    and was numbered with the transgressors.\nFor he bore the sin of many,\n    and made intercession for the transgressors.\n\nSubscribe to Rabbi Tovia Singer:\n@ToviaSinger1 \nhttps://outreachjudaism.org/\nAbout Rabbi Singer\nRabbi Tovia Singer is the Director of the counter-missionary organization, Outreach Judaism.\n\nFor nearly a decade, he was the host of one of Israel’s most compelling radio talk shows and “The Tovia Singer Show,” is a powerful and provocative voice of reason in radio on Israel National Radio on Channel 7 in Israel.

Thank you to all existing Patrons.\n\nDue to a Copyright issue, the Friedrich Nietzsche recording was clipped out.\nFor Context, we used:\n\n \"The Anti-Christ\" Section 5:\n\nWe should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to the death against this higher type of man, it has put all the deepest instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts—the strong man as the typical reprobate, the “outcast among men.” Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of antagonism to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. The most lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his intellect had been destroyed by original sin, whereas it was actually destroyed by Christianity!—\r\nDr. Robert M. Price is a 2x PhD Scholar in New Testament and Theology. ) is an American New Testament scholar. His most notable stance is arguing in favor of the Christ myth theory — the claim that a historical Jesus did not exist. Price is the author of a number of books on biblical studies and the historicity of Jesus.\r\n\n\nhttps://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/\r\n\nA former Baptist minister, Price was a fellow of the Jesus Project, a group of 150 individuals who studied the historicity of Jesus and the Gospels, the organizer of a Web community for those interested in the history of Christianity, and a member of the advisory board of the Secular Student Alliance. He is a religious skeptic, especially of orthodox Christian beliefs, occasionally describing himself as a Christian atheist.\n\r\n\r\nThe Book by Dr. Francesca Stavrakopoulou:\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/God-Anatomy-Francesca-Stavrakopoulou/dp/0525520457\r\nAn astonishing and revelatory history that re-presents God as he was originally envisioned by ancient worshippers—with a distinctly male body, and with superhuman powers, earthly passions, and a penchant for the fantastic and monstrous.\r\nThe scholarship of theology and religion teaches us that the God of the Bible was without a body, only revealing himself in the Old Testament in words mysteriously uttered through his prophets, and in the New Testament in the body of Christ. The portrayal of God as corporeal and masculine is seen as merely metaphorical, figurative, or poetic. But, in this revelatory study, Francesca Stavrakopoulou presents a vividly corporeal image of God: a human-shaped deity who walks and talks and weeps and laughs, who eats, sleeps, feels, and breathes, and who is undeniably male.\r\n\r\n#God #RobertMPrice #GnosticInformant",

    "description": "https://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\nThe Course for Mystery Cults by Professor Litwa is NOW AVAILABLE!!! Click the Link for more Details! (Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nIn this video, we discuss Marcus 'Magus', or Marcus the Valentinian, who is one of the early Roman Church Fathers to perform the Rite of the Eucharist. Marcus also taught that the way of Salvation was through Baptismal Gnosis of the True Angelic Christ-Self. \n\nM. David Litwa, PhD is a Research Fellow, Institute for Religion and Critical Inquiry, Australian Catholic University, Australia.\nwww.Patreon.com/MDavidLitwa\nBooks from M. David Litwa:\nhttps://mdavidlitwa.wordpress.com/featured-books/\n\nMarcus was the founder of the Marcosian Gnostic sect in the 2nd century AD. He was a disciple of Valentinus, with whom his system mainly agrees. His doctrines are almost exclusively known to us through a long polemic (i. 13–21) in Adversus Haereses, in which Irenaeus gives an account of his teaching and his school. Clement of Alexandria clearly knew of Marcus and actually used his number system (Stromata, VI, xvi), though without acknowledgement.\n\nMarcus appears to have been an elder contemporary of Irenaeus, who speaks of him as though still living and teaching. Though we learn from Irenaeus that the Rhone district was a home to the followers of Marcus, it does not appear that Marcus was there himself, and the impression left is that Irenaeus knew the followers of Marcus by personal intercourse, Marcus only by his writings. We are told also of Marcus having seduced the wife of one of the deacons in Asia (διάκονον τινα τῶν ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ), and the most natural conclusion is that Asia Minor was the scene where Marcus made himself a teacher, probably before Irenaeus had left that district; that it was a leading bishop there who resisted Marcus; and that his doctrines passed into Gaul by means of the extensive intercourse well known to have then prevailed between the two countries.\n\nThe use of Hebrew or Syriac names in the Marcosian school may lead us to ascribe to Marcus an Oriental origin. The only grounds, for believing him to be of Egyptian extraction are these:—Sulpicius Severus, and others who give the history of the origin of Priscillianism, tell that one Marcus of Memphis brought the Gnostic doctrines into Spain, from whom Agape and Elpidius learned them. Jerome certainly identified this Marcus with the subject of the present article, his notion bring that Marcosian doctrine, which we know from Irenaeus to have been prevalent in Southern Gaul, naturally passed on to the adjacent province of Spain. It is not quite clear whether Jerome felt the chronological difficulties of his theory, which, however, could be easily got over by supposing that the first Priscillianists were to be regarded as having learned from Marcus, not because they had been taught by himself personally, but because they had learned from men who revered him as the founder of their sect. But since Priscillianism contains none of the points which distinguish Marcus from other Gnostics, it is safer to regard Marcus, of Memphis as a distinct personage.\n\n\nHis system tells of 30 aeons, divided into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Dodecad; of the fall and recovery of Sophia; of the future union of the spirits of the chosen seed with angels as their heavenly bridegrooms. What Marcus added to the teaching of his predecessors was a system of Isopsephy similar to that of the later Pythagoreans, about mysteries in numbers and names. Marcus found in Scripture and in Nature repeated examples of the occurrence of his mystical numbers, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, thirty.\n\nIrenaeus alleges that Marcus abused his influence over \"silly women\" in order to gain both money and sexual favors. He is accused of having used philtres and love charms, and at least one, if not more, of his female disciples on returning to the Church confessed that body as well as mind had been defiled by him. However, it seems that most of his followers claimed to have been elevated by their knowledge and the redemption they had experienced.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant\nPlease Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on.

(Link)\nhttps://gnosticinformant--pursuit4knowledge.thrivecart.com/mysterycults/\n\nValentinus (also spelled Valentinius; c. AD 100 – c. 180) was the best known and, for a time, most successful early Christian Gnostic theologian. He founded his school in Rome. According to Tertullian, Valentinus was a candidate for bishop but started his own group when another was chosen.\n\nValentinus produced a variety of writings, but only fragments survive, largely those quoted in rebuttal arguments in the works of his opponents, not enough to reconstruct his system except in broad outline. His doctrine is known only in the developed and modified form given to it by his disciples, the Valentinians. He taught that there were three kinds of people, the spiritual, psychical, and material; and that only those of a spiritual nature received the gnosis (knowledge) that allowed them to return to the divine Pleroma, while those of a psychic nature (ordinary Christians) would attain a lesser or uncertain form of salvation, and that those of a material nature were doomed to perish.\n\nValentinus had a large following, the Valentinians. It later divided into an Eastern and a Western, or Italian, branch. The Marcosians belonged to the Western branch.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MDavidLitwa\nPlease Consider joining the Patreon of M.

While researching celestial mythology at Brigham Young University, John McHugh stumbled upon the arcane code that is the template for the legends and miracles in all Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic scriptures.\nThis code was embedded in the archaic Mesopotamian belief system that conceptualized the astral sky as the “heavens,” and its constellations and planets as deities inhabiting this divine realm. Celestial tableaux were understood as historical scenes that had once taken place on earth. Mesopotamian astronomers were regarded as magicians, the magi, whose task was to interpret and elaborate secretly on this “Heavenly Writing”― the literal writing of the gods. The Celestial Code of Scriptures is the first book to present and explain this secret Mesopotamian cipher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#JohnMcHugh #CelestialCode #AstralCipher #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

    "description": "“Pascal’s Wager” is the name given to an argument due to Blaise Pascal for believing, or for at least taking steps to believe, in God. The name is somewhat misleading, for in a single section of his Pensées, Pascal apparently presents at least three such arguments, each of which might be called a ‘wager’—it is only the final of these that is traditionally referred to as “Pascal’s Wager”. We find in it the extraordinary confluence of several important strands of thought: the justification of theism; probability theory and decision theory, used here for almost the first time in history; pragmatism; voluntarism (the thesis that belief is a matter of the will); and the use of the concept of infinity.\n\nIn this video, we discuss Pascal's Wager, and if it is a strong argument or not.

    "description": "Tovia Singer is the founder and director of Outreach Judaism, a Jewish counter-missionary organization. It describes itself as \"an international organization that responds directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity.\" Singer cautions regarding congregations that \"are designed to appear Jewish, but are actually fundamentalist Christian churches, which use traditional Jewish symbols to lure the most vulnerable of our Jewish people into their ranks.\" Outreach Judaism was described by J. Gordon Melton in 2002 as an example of \"the current state of Jewish counter-cult activity.\"\nTovia Singer engages in numerous disputes with Christianity including that of Blood Atonement or the Passion of Jesus.\n\nIn this video, we demonstrate beyond all doubts why Christianity is diametrically opposed to Judaism and why Jesus did not fulfill the messianic requirements, let alone be God of Israel.\n\nWe also discuss the Jesus of the Talmud and offer some hot, never before heard takes on the Historicity of Jesus and Joseph.\n\nFor more from Rabbi Tovia Singer\nhttp://www.toviasinger.tv/\nCheck out Rabbi Tovia Singer on Youtube:\n@ToviaSinger1 \n\n#ToviaSinger #Judaism #Christianity #Messiah #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

His most recent appointment was at the University of Agder in Kristiansand, NO, where he was the Senior Researcher and Dead Sea Scrolls Detective.

We also discuss the dating of when Daniel was written, and why we have reasons to doubt the traditional dating of the texts. \n\nDaniel was Hebrew Prophet who lived under Babylonian Captivity during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazaar, and Darius. He writes about miracles that took place during that time period and how he was able to translate the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar as well as documenting his visions of the coming 4 Kingdoms after Darius. He is credited for the correct prophecy of the coming of Cyrus & Alexander the Great.\n\nHowever, as early as the 2nd and 3rd century (common era), and even more in modern times, scholars have noticed that we have huge reasons to doubt that Daniel was written before the time of Alexander the Great. In this video we lay out why we know this.\n\n#DeadSeaScrolls #KippDavis #Daniel #4Kingdoms #4Trees #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

    "title": "Review of Zeitgeist Part One | Dr. Robert M. Price | Christian Parallelomania",
    "description": "Zeitgeist @TZMOfficialChannel  is a Film Series by Peter Joseph that breaks down many political, social and economic issues within current society. Part One of the 1st Film, Zeitgeist: The Movie (2007) is also divided into three parts. Part One is about Christianity & Mythicism. In this video we will be discussing only Part One of the 2007 Film. This movie has been criticized by biblical scholars and historians as being too heavy on parallels between the Jesus story and other Dying & Rising God Myths. This is a term called Parallelomania.\n\nParallelomania is a concept introduced in scholarly circles in 1961 by Rabbi Samuel Sandmel (1911–1979) of the Hebrew Union College in a paper of the same title, where he stated that he had first encountered the term in a French book of 1830, but did not recall the author or the title. Sandmel stated that the simple observations of similarity between historical events are often less than valid, but at times lead to a phenomenon where an author first notices a supposed similarity, overdoses on analogy, and then \"proceeds to describe source and derivation as if implying a literary connection flowing in an inevitable or predetermined direction\". Martin McNamara, MSC (Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy) stated that Sandmel's initial paper has proven to be \"highly influential\".\n\nChristian and Jewish scholars have used the concept in a number of cases and areas. Thomas Schreiner (Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) applies it to over-generalization of the simple use of the verb \"see\" used as a participle to refer to a casual act of observation, to extending its meaning to have deeper spiritual contexts in order to construct parallels. Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner has stated that some portrayals of Aphrahat as someone who cherry picked from Rabbinical literature are based on weak parallels which fall within Sandmel's characterization of parallelomania.[6] Joseph Fitzmyer, a priest of the Society of Jesus (SJ), states the analyses of the Pauline epistles have at times suffered from parallelomania through the construction of unwarranted analogies with prior tradition.\n\nRobert M. Price (born July 7, 1954) is a Mississippian by birth, lived in New Jersey for most of his life, and has recently resettled in North Carolina. After early involvement in a fundamentalist Baptist church, he went on to become a leader in the Montclair State College chapter of the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship. Having developed a keen interest in apologetics (the defense of the faith on intellectual grounds), Bob went on to enroll at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, where he received an MTS degree in New Testament. Billy Graham was the commencement speaker.\n\nIt was during this period, 1977-78, however, that Bob began to reassess his faith, deciding at length that traditional Christianity simply did not have either the historical credentials or the intellectual cogency its defenders claimed for it. Embarking on a wide program of reading religious thinkers and theologians from other traditions, as well as the sociology, anthropology, and psychology of religion, he soon considered himself a theological liberal in the camp of Paul Tillich. He received the Ph.D. degree in systematic theology from Drew University in 1981.\n\nAfter some years teaching in the religious studies department of Mount Olive College in North Carolina, Price returned to New Jersey to pastor First Baptist Church of Montclair, the first pastorate, many years before, of  liberal preacher Harry Emerson Fosdick. Price soon enrolled in a second doctoral program at Drew, receiving the Ph.D. in New Testament in 1993. These studies, together with his encounter with the writings of Don Cupitt, Jacques Derrida, and the New Testament critics of the Nineteenth Century, rapidly eroded his liberal Christian stance, and Price resigned his pastorate in 1994. A brief flirtation with Unitarian Universalism disenchanted him even with this liberal extreme of institutional religion. For six years Bob and Carol led a living room church called The Grail. Now, back in North Carolina, he attends the Episcopal Church and keeps his mouth shut.\n\nRobert M. Price has is 2x PhD & Professor of Biblical Criticism at the Center for Inquiry Institute as well as the editor of The Journal of Higher Criticism. His books include Beyond Born Again,  The Widow Traditions in Luke-Acts: A Feminist-Critical Scrutiny, Deconstructing Jesus, and The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man. Forthcoming titles are The Crisis of Biblical Authority, Jesus Christ Superstar: A Redactional Study of a Modern Gospel,  The Da Vinci Controversy and The Amazing Colossal Apostle.\n\nFor more from Dr. Price:\nhttp://www.robertmprice.mindvendor.com/\n@MythVisionPodcast \nRobert M.

    "description": "The subject of the Star of Bethlehem has attracted much attention and produced many theories about what may have appeared in the skies, marking the birth of Jesus as Christians believe. Details of the celestial event given in the New Testament Bible are vague leaving much room for widely varying ideas. As the Star involves Christian faith, there are valid suspicions that some explanations may have taken liberties to support religious beliefs. That idea is central to one of the more recent publications on this subject. Aaron Adair promotes his book, “The Star of Bethlehem: A Skeptical View,” with the claim that no one can explain the Star. The Star, he says, has no historical basis nor can it even be explained as a miracle.\n- Michael R.

Jung's work has been influential in the fields of psychiatry, anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, psychology and religious studies. Jung worked as a research scientist at the famous Burghölzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler. During this time, he came to the attention of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. The two men conducted a lengthy correspondence and collaborated, for a while, on a joint vision of human psychology.\n\nFreud saw the younger Jung as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his \"new science\" of psychoanalysis and to this end secured his appointment as President of his newly founded International Psychoanalytical Association. Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it impossible for him to follow his older colleague's doctrine and a schism became inevitable. This division was personally painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis.\n\nAmong the central concepts of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the psychological complex and extraversion and introversion.\n\nNietzsche's writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; a genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality and related theory of master–slave morality; the aesthetic affirmation of life in response to both the \"death of God\" and the profound crisis of nihilism; the notion of Apollonian and Dionysian forces; and a characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the Übermensch and the doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, music, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew inspiration from figures such as Socrates, Zoroaster, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\n\n\n#uberboyo #CarlJung #FriedrichNietzsche #Gnostic #GnosticInformant #Neal #Sendlak #NealSendlak #Stef #JamesDowling #JamesPDowling",

    "description": "Patternicity -The tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise\nWhy do people see faces in nature, interpret window stains as human figures, hear voices in random sounds generated by electronic devices or find conspiracies in the daily news? A proximate cause is the priming effect, in which our brain and senses are prepared to interpret stimuli according to an expected model. UFOlogists see a face on Mars. Religionists see the Virgin Mary on the side of a building. Paranormalists hear dead people speaking to them through a radio receiver. Conspiracy theorists think 9/11 was an inside job by the Bush administration. Is there a deeper ultimate cause for why people believe such weird things? There is. I call it “patternicity,” or the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise.\nMichael Shermer, PhD is the founder of Skeptic Magazine.\nhttps://michaelshermer.com/sciam-columns/patternicity/\n@skepticmagazine \n\nAlso featured in this clip is Derek Lambert from @MythVisionPodcast \nhttps://mythvisionpodcast.com/\n\nFor Full Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/wDJNfeLQSmE\n\n\n#MichaelShermer #Skeptic #Patternicity #MythVision #DerekLambert #NealSendlak #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

The war is described in two distinct parts, first (the War against the Kittim) described as a battle between the Sons of Light, consisting of the sons of Levi, the sons of Judah, and the sons of Benjamin, and the exiled of the desert, against Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Amalekites, and Philistia and their allies the Kittim of Asshur (referred to collectively as the army of Belial), and [those who assist them from among the wicked] who \"violate the covenant\". The second part of the war (the War of Divisions) is described as the Sons of Light, now the united twelve tribes of Israel, conquering the \"nations of vanity.\" In the end, all of Darkness is to be destroyed and Light will live in peace for all eternity. The text goes on to detail inscriptions for trumpets and banners for the war and liturgies for the priests during the conflict.\n\nDr. Kipp Davis is a Dead Sea Scrolls Scholar:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBTO34CZcIYGK6Qm2vQ-SMA\n\n\n#WarScroll #DeadSeaScrolls #KippDavis #Gnostic #GnosticInformant",

His reaction is better than I thought it would be. \nA guy like Jim holds no punches and would tell me if this is nonsense.

Killing scientists for 10 centuries straight and calling them alchemists.\nManipulating nations and usurping thrones to install their own puppet rulers. Raking in taxes from colonies and being the Biggest Welfare Kingdom in World History with 0 net exports. Fighting against any progression. Condemning gay people and the use of contraception. \n\nHowever, you Baptists and Evangelicals are not God's people either. You and your obsession with money, private jets, and acting like your persecuted because its a fantasy of yours, even though you are inheriting wealth and live in the richest country in the world and pay NO taxes. \nYou do nothing for the poor and your always worried about politics, and your pockets.

    "description": "Serapis is an Amalgamated God first worshipped by the Macedonian Empire after Alexander the Great divided the Hellenistic World into 4 parts. The Mithra worshippers of the east, Dionysius in the West, and Osiris in the South. But when High Priests of Ptolomy Soter and Mithradates began to put these deities together, Serapis rose as the Chief Deity of the Roman Imperial Cult. Julius Caesar & the Divine Son of God Augustus became the 2nd coming of King Philip & Alexander the Great. But finally, when Judea had one more revolt in them, the Spirit of Truth, Titus Flavius Vespasian & His Son. Who came in the name of the Father. Prophecy of the Jews came to fruition as Flavius saved the Jews from the Wicked Sicarii (Iscariot) Zealots and restored Peace upon the World for the next 300 years. Serapis was the God of Vespasian, and Vespasian was the Mediator between Heaven and the poor & sick. Great Works were done in his name. Constantine even took on the name Flavius which means \"golden\". Thus was born the Christ. Jesus of Nazareth is the total, finalized, amalgamation of Jewish Messianic Promise tied with Roman Imperial Cult Triumph. \n\n\n#Serapis #Flavius #Vespasian #Messiah #Titus #Caesar #Chrestus #Christos #Skeptic #Astrotheology #Religion #Christianity #Mythology #Gnosticism #RomanImperialCult #Jesus #Saviour #Soter #Ptolomy #MythVision #GnosticInformant #Gnostic",

In the age of the internet, they are like a naked drunk person un-aware that they are walking in the middle of the street exposed. They act as though people don't have access to thousands of ancient manuscripts and google translator. So why do I thank them? Because their easily exposed claims of a \"Only Perfect Bible and the rest are Damning Christians to Hell\" was so insane, that it actually caused me to go deeper into investigating Christianity as a whole. Something I might not of done otherwise. \n\nShout outs to Bart Ehrman, Religion for Breakfast, Rabbi Tovia Singer, and whoever else I used as credible sources...
