    "title": "Was the Bible Reliably Copied? | Truth with Tact - Episode 9",
    "description": "Hey everyone, hope y'all are excited for another episode of my apologetics series \"Truth with Tact\"! \n\nIn this video, I will cover a topic that is often brought up when discussing the Bible, this being whether the Bible was reliably copied by scribes over the years. Many in recent years have compared the copying or transmission of the Bible to things like the telephone game, which gives the impression that our modern Bible may not reflect what the authors originally wrote. Many suggest that, whether intentionally or not, significant changes were made to the Bible over the years, such that core doctrines may have been changed. These changes may be so significant that the Christianity practiced today would be entirely alien to what the apostles originally taught. This has often lead to wild speculation about what the Bible REALLY used to say, with some suggesting that the Bible used to teach concepts like reincarnation, spiritual enlightenment, that Jesus had a wife, and that Jesus may have even been opposed to the Old Testament God. This begs the question, how has the Bible been changed over the years, and are the changes that have been made to the Bible significant enough to impact key Christian doctrines? This is what I hope to answer in this video. This episode will therefore discuss copyist errors in Biblical manuscripts, the topic of textual criticism, and we will determine whether what our Bibles say today reflects what the authors originally wrote. \n\nWith all that being said, I hope you enjoy this latest episode of Truth with Tact!\n\nBelow are some timestamps to navigate the various topics covered in this video:\n0:00 Reviewing Truth With Tact so far\n1:50 How did we actually get the Bible?\n7:52 Could the Bible have been intentionally changed?\n12:10 What about unintentional changes?\n14:00 Why are there 400,000 variants in the Bible?\n20:56 Why the age of a manuscript matters\n28:02 How impactful are these 400,000 variants?\n32:02 What are meaningful and viable variants?\n34:58 Do meaningful, viable variants impact Christianity?\n38:14 Is uncertainty an issue for reliability?\n41:17 Isn't the Bible just a translation of a translation of a translation of a...\n44:18 A brief note on the Quran and KJV Only groups\n\n\nTo see the previous videos in this series please see some of the links below:\nhttps://youtu.be/aBfoiIqk4I4?si=cUX10c4lUiD6BZB-\nhttps://youtu.be/7ZTJOS2qO9c?si=XKmxDoccis7MR12O\nhttps://youtu.be/5BWb083UO5E?si=OWUEefjBTVR653O8\nhttps://youtu.be/MEmb-zxtIk8?si=RPx9RjiHFNRCZuMI\nhttps://youtu.be/Mbk-QqJS9nI?si=lDw3EArW1nEqYxG_\nhttps://youtu.be/7ZIyS_CtkSk?si=ac3KxSjNvOkhV2Nt\nhttps://youtu.be/hvPXlvWc6vw?si=yKyJFyeQKQDs0Jhv\nhttps://youtu.be/m_HnnujoT5M?si=6QyMFUqzaOhXmcdA\n\n\nTo see the videos I recommended on the authorship of the gospels, see the links below:\nhttps://youtu.be/C7s22DR9gaI?si=Ium2Ond6T-cMV205\nhttps://youtu.be/GyElet12sQM?si=2XIwIBwUe69Ncmvc\nhttps://youtu.be/DCNCtcMueFk?si=L7y0WXcSWTLedPaU\nhttps://youtu.be/wE-4f7OkDsg?si=hDzaJF8yNY2HNhpv\nhttps://youtu.be/xfvpV6jWGOY?si=0UDb5IrkU9BRKdbG\nhttps://youtu.be/YcifhttviLM?si=vWdnHvRp6mV4_ydy\n\n\nTo see some additional videos I would recommend regarding the reliability of the transmission of the New Testament, see the links below: \nhttps://youtu.be/XmlHYeT8vyc?si=aC_pXFrWAQ1BXVeV\nhttps://youtu.be/G0VE7f-CzOQ?si=iKF2ftxCXI_E13wF\nhttps://youtu.be/05aK7itUvho?si=FtIy4_V2ljSwUbGz\nhttps://youtu.be/KkmLCWeORaQ?si=t_5RWtzD1RZa37a2\nhttps://youtu.be/WclIZwBFhq0?si=yb5cQvMsiZpEjdXW\n\n\nTo see the video I mentioned which discusses how ancient authors may use specific names as citations for their material, see the link below:\nhttps://youtu.be/DCNCtcMueFk?si=L7y0WXcSWTLedPaU\n\n\nWith all that being said, thank you all for watching.

    "title": "Advice for Sharing your Faith (The Columbo Tactic) | Truth with Tact - Episode 8",
    "description": "Hey everyone, welcome to the 8th video in our apologetics series \"Truth with Tact\"!\n\nFor most Christians, we frankly may find it hard to talk about our faith. Many people, I find, have been taught almost all their lives that the two things you should never bring up in conversation are religion and politics. If that's not already discouraging enough, many Christians may not feel equipped to talk about their faith. They may not have all the answers, they may be uncomfortable with more confrontational conversations, or they may not know how to best introduce or approach a conversation about faith. \n\nIf any of these things sound like something that applies to you, don't worry, because in this video we will cover various tactics and things to consider which will help you better share your faith and navigate tricky conversations about religion, morality, apologetics and more. \n\nIf you want to learn how to share your faith in a way that's less intrusive, more fruitful, and in a way that can work even if you don't have all the answers, then this is the video for you. With all that being said, sit back, relax, and enjoy the video.\n\n\nTimestamps are below to better navigate the video's contents:\n\n0:00 Intro and Reading Material\n0:43 Apologetics isn't just about knowledge\n3:44 Hard questions & assertions\n6:46 The value of situational awareness\n14:19 Different people warrant different responses\n19:34 Don't get rage-baited\n19:52 Things to consider when dealing with challenges\n29:16 Who is detective Columbo?\n31:27 Introducing the Columbo tactic\n33:01 What the Columbo tactic accomplishes\n35:07 Another helpful tip\n36:00 Advantages of the Columbo tactic \n40:15 Outro/practicing Columbo\n\nTo see the previous videos in this series, see the links below: \nhttps://youtu.be/7ZTJOS2qO9c?si=BKq2J3V8lQkt6vDv\nhttps://youtu.be/5BWb083UO5E?si=YRY89pO9IfBCZOKH\nhttps://youtu.be/aBfoiIqk4I4?si=Vw6wYuJ1zqdjVUD1\nhttps://youtu.be/MEmb-zxtIk8?si=wPYIwyoAcSBeuYiV\nhttps://youtu.be/Mbk-QqJS9nI?si=hM-L4Wa28zT9Cu64\nhttps://youtu.be/7ZIyS_CtkSk?si=yzOU_tqtrNG6ccC4\nhttps://youtu.be/hvPXlvWc6vw?si=b52y2mSf-xxovXrE\n\nHope y'all enjoy this video, and stay tuned for the next episode in this apologetics series where I will be discussing the reliability of the New Testament!",

    "description": "Happy Easter everyone! He is Risen! Hallelujah!\n\nIn this video, since Christians around the world are celebrating the resurrection today, I will present just some of the historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus. Jesus' resurrection is absolutely central to Christianity. Christianity stands or falls on the reality of the resurrection of Jesus. If Jesus is still dead, so too is Christianity. This of course begs the obvious question, do we have good historical evidence to say that Jesus rose from the dead? Well, watch this video and find out. I think for many, you may be surprised to hear what evidence there is for Jesus Christ's resurrection. \n\nBelow are some timestamps to navigate the various topics covered in this video:\n0:00 Intro\n0:56 What makes Christianity unique\n1:56 My approach\n4:47 The evidence for the crucifixion and empty tomb\n10:10 How we know Jesus' followers thought he had risen\n13:35 How we know former skeptics saw Jesus\n15:03 How we know the gospel was first preached in Jerusalem\n15:40 How we know the resurrection defied expectations\n17:54 How we know the disciples were persecuted\n20:20 But what if Jesus never died?\n23:06 What if the resurrection was just made up?\n30:16 Could it have been a mass hallucination?\n33:14 What about the Islamic explanation? \n36:00 What about Gerd Lüdemann's explanation?\n37:02 The most historically viable theory\n38:50 Why the resurrection is historically likely \n42:31 Christianity is true even without the Bible?\n\n\nFor more videos on the historical evidence for the resurrection, see the links below:\nhttps://youtu.be/5znVUFHqO4Q?si=RQN1YiYm-6HJHCVc\nhttps://youtu.be/0Rtmn5LLM-0?si=DucNyBzto-uXOhlK\nhttps://youtu.be/-ErnJF_nwBk?si=LRJkuw2Wu2JW35L7\nhttps://youtu.be/A0iDNLxmWVM?si=F_3HuZCyXPgjSDYI\nhttps://youtu.be/HdIM8QoD8UE?si=rQR-V8Z_g5cczAqP\nhttps://youtu.be/UWbShiINl4s?si=XqFJeSKES4tvq8m4\nhttps://youtu.be/9VEQWQHYy7s?si=ETeb8RDiailvG30C\nhttps://youtu.be/rffmrioFnBY?si=kfzxsWQREwF2QaLh\nhttps://youtu.be/pwTDuNFAHng?si=AStNI3AJ9tlHSv9r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/wICHji-kh-s?si=bPLRq_UAQC0pkziY\nhttps://youtu.be/Z8lkuuhVkOI?si=l50pJp9L5D1oSyWL\nhttps://youtu.be/G8nksgZerZE?si=aBMHYK-a3RCsav95\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/xk6oCuk7vWg?si=Pq5u_nc6AuxVAKNU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h2VLEl1vX8\n\n\nFor more evidence for the burial and empty tomb of Jesus in particular, see the following videos:\nhttps://youtu.be/zuvp0yy8PcQ?si=xdUj4C_48ju7KNTF\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/C8BU_R7QoYo?si=UuD7EBH23vYZh16Q\n\n\nFor more evidence for the martyrdom of the apostles in particular, see the following videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/BltIwge0LiA?si=SviE_NnRs09fP-84\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/M6_pZV9zXzQ?si=TZUagOz6QrgmN0FU\nhttps://youtu.be/Z6Vqi7Slxdo?si=A5IBqCIjYz05C97J\nhttps://youtu.be/LGsGrfHNBbA?si=UTk5jy9q6gNjlYUB\n\n\nTo see the previous episodes of this series, check out the links below:\nhttps://youtu.be/7ZTJOS2qO9c?si=ZyyKv4lBp-leJbns\nhttps://youtu.be/5BWb083UO5E?si=-zCys8IShpanW-wm\nhttps://youtu.be/aBfoiIqk4I4?si=6cR62t35sjBmH_te\nhttps://youtu.be/MEmb-zxtIk8?si=0MMyWF22WfKPOIoQ\nhttps://youtu.be/Mbk-QqJS9nI?si=woMepuZZjJRojWyy\nhttps://youtu.be/7ZIyS_CtkSk?si=3OPoViYa-j_b2hma\n\n\nTo see the previous video I made on the resurrection, see the link below:\nhttps://youtu.be/RD6aDpBfXpo?si=xfXKcZbaH-XIMk8f\n\n\nThank you all for watching.

    "title": "MORE Arguments for God's Existence | Truth with Tact - Episode 6",
    "description": "Hey everyone, in this video Steve (the cohost of this apologetics program) will discuss various arguments for the existence of God, covering about six to seven different arguments. Now as you can imagine, one cannot cover this many arguments for the existence of God in much detail within a 23 minute timeframe. This video is therefore aimed at simply introducing you to these arguments for the existence of God, and whenever possible I've provided some other videos in the description for you to further dig into these topics. With that being said, I hope you enjoy this latest episode of my apologetics series \"Truth with Tact\" and I look forward to seeing you in the next episode where we'll discuss the historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus. \n\nLike with all my other videos, below are several timestamps to help you navigate the video's contents:\n0:00 Is there a war between science and religion?\n2:28 What can science not explain?\n4:05 The Ontological Argument (St. Anselm)\n6:00 The Anthropological Argument\n8:21 The Argument from Desire (C.S.

    "description": "In this video I go over what was once my least favorite argument for the existence of God: The Moral Argument for God's Existence. While this was once my least favorite argument for the existence of God, I have come to appreciate it more and more as I've really mulled it over. The moral argument argues for the existence of God on the basis of objective moral values, facts, and duties that we ought to follow. If that sounds interesting to you, then sit back, relax, and enjoy this latest video in my apologetics series \"Truth with Tact\".\n\n(Also, if the thumbnail of the video looks different at times it's because I'm trying YouTube's new feature where they determine the best thumbnail out of 3 possible thumbnails.

    "title": "The Fine-Tuning Argument/Teleological Argument for God's Existence | Truth with Tact - Episode 4",
    "description": "In this video I will cover one of my favorite arguments for the existence of God, this being the Fine-Tuning Argument, a type of teleological argument.\nThe reason why this argument is my favorite is because even amongst atheists, it is often widely acknowledged as one of the best arguments for the existence of God. \nTeleological arguments point to the fact that certain things in nature look carefully designed for a particular purpose to argue for the existence of a designer behind them, said designer of course being God. In the case of the fine-tuning argument, it notes that the physical constants and quantities of the universe are fine-tuned for life in a way that is astronomically unlikely to be the case unless some entity fine-tuned them in order to have a universe capable of supporting life. \nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, then sit back, relax and enjoy this fourth episode in my apologetics series \"Truth with Tact\".\n\n\nLike with my other videos, below are some timestamps to help you navigate the video:\n0:00 Why did God make the universe?\n1:27 What are physical constants?\n4:56 Why the universe is fine-tuned for life\n8:04 What are the chances of us being here?\n12:57 How can we explain fine-tuning? \n16:00 What about the multiverse?\n20:31 What is the best explanation for fine-tuning?\n\n\nTo see the last video in this series, which covers the cosmological argument, see the link below:\nhttps://youtu.be/aBfoiIqk4I4?si=wLHsUz6ILDCB8eN0\n\nFor more videos on the fine-tuning argument (including one I've made previously), see the links below:\nhttps://youtu.be/EE76nwimuT0?si=A0Qh3xeh49GCMWn-\nhttps://youtu.be/BId8kdBFHKM?si=-eWk_XGo7F3LZVBy\nhttps://youtu.be/PqjBOSlk_mE?si=0Fk43FtYvF3vT7hA\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/DRz0Q_n4I1E?si=xFvZsI2ovJBUXy6S\nhttps://youtu.be/3Yt7hvgFuNg?si=IoGTy5JXKVk-otfm\nhttps://youtu.be/ZO-QyzsDmps?si=rqr_ZPeplD67Sq9w\nhttps://youtu.be/bGbbWyd4l7Q?si=9qpUY_zUuQslZcNN\nhttps://youtu.be/7iVuMRwi5Wg?si=Twi1SnR9r38wufuv\nhttps://youtu.be/ntdTWREYFJk?si=2yFfb5nDOAwf6zUs\nhttps://youtu.be/0hn-7ckOt-8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/lgTnUBti5ZU?si=VfZmtoLXr4FTZtKa\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/58brbYwN0Q0?si=Tf_tB0xIudS9AvfY\n\nAlso below is a link to the channel \"BeauMaths\" who's some nerd who does math videos:\nhttps://youtube.com/@beaumaths?si=WG_00pXyv1lZVBtM\n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned in this video, there were other physical constants and quantities that were very unlikely to be fine-tuned to allow for the existence of life that I couldn't mention in the video. Here are just a few of them: \n-The ratio of protons to electrons had only a 1 in 10^37 chance of being fine-tuned for life\n-The expansion rate of the universe had only a 1 in 10^37 chance of being fine-tuned for life\n-The strong nuclear force constant had only a 1 in 10^37 chance of being fine-tuned for life.\n-The ratio of the electromagnetic force to gravitational force constant had only a 1 in 10^40 chance of being fine-tuned for life\n-The mass density of the universe had only a 1 in 10^59 chance of being fine-tuned for life \n-Lastly, the amount of dark energy in the universe had only a 1 in 10^122 chance of being fine-tuned for life\n\nThere are other physical constants/quantities that were also unlikely to be fine-tuned for life such as: the electromagnetic force constant, the excess of nucleons to anti-nucleons, and the decay rates of elements. However, I couldn't find exact values that show HOW fine-tuned they are for life. \n\nI should also note, at some point in the video I stated that even if you have 10^500 universes, there is still only a 1 in 10 billion chance that one of them would be fine-tuned for life. This is only true if one excludes the fine-tuning for the distribution of mass and energy at the start of the early universe, the fine-tuning of the amount of dark energy in the universe, the fine-tuning of the critical density of the universe, and the fine-tuning of several other constants and quantities. In short, saying that \"there's only a 1 in 10 billion chance of having a universe with life in it if we have 10^500 universes to work with\" is actually SIGNIFICANTLY low-balling how unlikely it actually is to have a universe with life in it given those conditions. In reality, even if 10^500 other universes existed, it would be almost impossible for one of those universes to be capable of supporting life. \n\n\nWith all of that being said, I hope you enjoy this video, I hope it gives you something to think about, and I hope to see you in the next video in this series, where I will be discussing the moral argument for the existence for God. Thank you for watching, God bless!\n\n\n\n#christian #apologetics #finetuning",

    "title": "The Cosmological Argument/Contingency Argument for God's Existence | Truth with Tact - Episode 3",
    "description": "In this video, we give a brief overview of one of the most common and well known arguments for the existence of God. This also happens to be one of the oldest recorded arguments for the existence of God, being recorded as early as 500 BCE (Before Christ's Era). This argument is of course the Cosmological Argument (specifically the Kalam Cosmological Argument), which is a type of contingency argument. This argument uses the fact that the universe had its origin some time in the distant past to point to the existence of God. If this sounds interesting to you and if you are curious about the evidence for the existence of God, then this may just be the video for you!\n\nBelow are some timestamps to navigate through the video\n0:00 Intro\n1:37 Prayer\n2:16 Where do things come from?\n5:47 Where did the universe come from?\n6:58 The Enlightenment/Age of Reason\n9:22 Evolution\n12:00 Views on the origin of the universe\n14:10 How we know the universe began\n18:10 The uncaused first cause\n19:06 Why is God the best explanation for our universe?\n19:42 Limits of cosmological arguments\n20:16 More resources \n21:47 Cryptid sighting? \n\nAs mentioned in the video, below are several other videos which also discuss the cosmological argument. These provide significantly more detail in areas where more could've been said. For instance, some of these videos provide several lines of scientific and philosophical evidence which helps to verify that the universe began to exist some time in the distant past. If you find that William Lane Craig is slightly overrepresented in these videos, it's probably because he is more or less the modern champion of this argument. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKavDdRVIg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ULF5WixMM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKKIvmcO5LQ\nhttps://youtu.be/6CulBuMCLg0?si=2E0DzLJZCxvYUiEh\nhttps://youtu.be/vybNvc6mxMo?si=I3CuplKyCfMC2-Ha\nhttps://youtu.be/UQwLbDN7amo?si=uvvDw9kU3VuLzjnB\nhttps://youtu.be/FPCzEP0oD7I?si=BSRmFcG3ffhnWeeY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/eYBdleq-9Kc?si=4sLOB_2fuUx652qX\n\nIf you want to see my old video on the cosmological argument (which also discusses the teleological argument/fine-tuning argument, and some teleological arguments based on biology), the link to that is below:\nhttps://youtu.be/0hn-7ckOt-8\n\nIf you want to see some videos that deal with the major objections to the cosmological argument, some of those are listed below: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/DrgSbFhHCmU?si=wxayldFMxwrpRT_0\nhttps://youtu.be/xS6xHagcOd0?si=SQTvX2Q7AgBrp3ji\nhttps://youtu.be/3rX9yTwgHvQ?si=eVukFvkq7nhnkPrS\n\nLastly, these videos are somewhat weird, since they tackle the issue of quantum mechanics, but they still fit with the main conclusions of the cosmological argument:\nhttps://youtu.be/_ie9musGEqQ?si=QaRLZqxB-HvuP4a2\nhttps://youtu.be/iFEBOGLjuq4?si=beXtGc5fWcSO70qN\n\nWith all that being said, I hope you enjoy this video, I hope it gives you something to think about, I wish you all a great day, and stay tuned for the next episode in this series where I'll cover the Fine-Tuning/Teleological Argument for the existence of God. I'd highly recommend it, as it pairs very well with this argument, like how a fine wine pairs very well with... whatever fine wines pair with. \n\n#christian #apologetics #kalam",

    "description": "In this video I focus on the nature of evidence. So we will discuss what counts as evidence, how we can use evidence to come to conclusions, how the scientific method works, and how we come to conclusions in history, science, mathematics, and in law. \nAdditionally, this video will heavily focus on common misconceptions/misunderstandings that skeptics of Christianity have regarding the evidence for the existence of God, the evidence for the truth of Christianity, the nature of God, and the very nature of faith itself. This will include a lengthy discussion of what God is, how we can make sense of miracles, and much, much more. \n\nIf all this sounds interesting to you, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this second episode in my apologetics series: \"Truth with Tact\".\n\nBelow are some timestamps to help you navigate the video:\n\n0:00 Background info\n3:04 What is evidence?\n8:56 The issue with \"proving\" things\n11:33 How do we come to conclusions?\n12:05 Understanding the scientific method\n15:13 Science's 2 most important aspects\n16:41 Can science disprove God?\n21:32 Why miracles are reasonable\n27:37 How should we evaluate miracle claims?\n28:12 How do we know what's true in court?\n30:20 The historical method\n36:52 Our methodology for future videos\n37:38 Is the Bible just fiction?\n39:17 Is faith belief without evidence?\n41:19 Summary \n\nIf you wanted to learn more about the siege of Tyre mentioned in this video, you can see a video I did on the subject linked below: \nhttps://youtu.be/5u_LA7k4rpk?si=KLKWMOvjsoyGLbYM\n\nIf you were curious about that infamous debate between Wesley Huff and Billy Carson mentioned in this video, the link to that video is shown below:\nhttps://youtu.be/F7ngjtT43-4?si=G_-Col6qmGJupJcs\n\nLastly, if you want to see the last episode in this series, the link to that is below as well:\nhttps://youtu.be/7ZTJOS2qO9c?si=hbCPVGExrZ7RrdH3\n\nI hope you enjoy this video.

    "description": "Hey everyone, this video is the first in a series I did with my local church on apologetics. In this series we cover everything from arguments for the existence of God, to tactics one can use when discussing the faith, to how one can use evidence to come to conclusions, and much more!\n\nIn this first episode, we want to cover the basics about what apologetics is. Given that my channel is almost entirely dedicated to apologetics, this has frankly been a long time coming. So if you want to know what apologetics is, what faith is, and how apologetics can be used, then this is the video for you. \n\nLike with all my videos, below are several timestamps to help you navigate the video:\n0:00 What is this series about?\n2:21 Prayer\n3:06 Aims and format of this series\n5:52 A brief intro to apologetics\n7:17 What apologetics are not\n15:06 What is apologetics?\n17:24 Apologetics is about gaining knowledge\n22:39 Are apologetics unspiritual? \n26:16 The importance of a Christ-like character\n33:29 Hope to the hopeless, purpose to the purposeless\n38:41 Apologetics takes skill (wisdom) \n\nIf you were curious on the videos I mentioned regarding the nature of the trinity and the incarnation, I'd recommend the following videos below:\nhttps://youtu.be/jfHFydpznwo?si=B22XMyAIu-I_woCj\nhttps://youtu.be/sUF5OGw9j-4?si=HLe6vgRxrJD8nngJ\n\n\nAdditionally, if you were curious about some of the historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, you can also check out a video I've done on the subject linked below:\nhttps://youtu.be/RD6aDpBfXpo?si=0fJMUkR_qPTO_G4k\n\n\nHope you all enjoy this video, and with any luck this will end up being an ongoing, regularly updated series on this channel.\n\n\n\n\n#apologetics #christian #christianity",

    "description": "Hey everyone, hope y'all are enjoying this Maundy Thursday. In this video I will be assessing the claim that God has literally signed his name onto our DNA via a repeating pattern of disulfide bridges in the DNA. \nIn addition to this, I will also provide all of you with an in-depth look at the structure of DNA and RNA, so that by the time you're done this video, you will be able to better understand the molecules that help encode who you are. \n\nBelow are timestamps to navigate through the different topics discussed in this video:\n\n0:00 Intro/philosophy\n4:59 DNA is a polymer\n7:12 Nucleotides and nitrogenous bases\n13:23 The sugars of DNA and RNA\n15:44 Phosphates and phosphodiester bonds\n19:36 DNA is complementary and antiparallel \n25:17 Hydrogen bonds (H bonds)\n36:36 Summary of DNA's structure\n40:41 Did God sign our DNA?\n46:08 Hershey & Chase's experiment\n57:00 DNA is right handed?\n1:02:46 Where did this claim come from?\n1:07:15 The 3 domains of life\n1:09:26 The unfortunate truth\n1:12:58 So is God not real then?\n\nAs I mentioned at the start and end of this video, if you want to see two videos I've done which look at some of the evidence/arguments for God's existence, those videos can be found below:\nhttps://youtu.be/0hn-7ckOt-8\nhttps://youtu.be/RD6aDpBfXpo\n\nBelow is the link to the channel Beau Maths. As I warned in this video, do not under any circumstances check out his channel, as I don't think extended periods of exposure to that nerd is healthy for anyone:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@beaumaths\n\nAdditionally, if you wish to see the original video of Dr. Rubenstein claiming to have found God's signature on our DNA you can check that out below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArR_UseV7Xk\n\nIf you want to watch that video I made with Beau Maths on biblically accurate angels you can see that below as well:\nhttps://youtu.be/PwX9gsRavQY\n\n\nThis video was unfortunately a fairly long time coming. I was hoping to get this video out by Saint Patrick's day, but the software I used to edit videos actually refused to export the video. So, I basically had to remake the video from scratch with a new editing software, hence why it's coming out today. Sorry for that delay, but I hope you enjoy this video nonetheless. Once again, have a blessed Maundy Thursday, and I hope y'all have a wonderful Good Friday and Easter as well. Remember, Christ died for your sins. His body was broken and His blood was poured out for you. But most importantly, He is risen!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#christian #christianity #science #biology",

    "description": "Hey everyone, I hope you're enjoying this leap-year. I thought it would be fun to upload this video today since it only comes around once every 4 years. Today is also a very exciting day because today is the day I'm uploading the 6th and final episode in my series on the deity of Jesus. Unlike the last 5 parts of this series in which the focus was looking at how the New Testament shows that Jesus is divine, this episode will focus primarily on answering objections that people give to the deity of Jesus. Additionally, we will also look at some of the earliest Christians from between 100-325 CE (sometimes called the early church fathers or ante-Nicene fathers) and see how their writings indicate that from the beginning, Christians have believed that Jesus was God.\n\nIf you haven't seen the last 5 videos in this series, I'd highly encourage you to check them out. The links to those parts can be found below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jfHFydpznwo\nhttps://youtu.be/NlLN5fQESFI\nhttps://youtu.be/Eucpd8L8nnc\nhttps://youtu.be/faKCjU0QQnc\nhttps://youtu.be/iWZAZnniSF4?si=SE1qEPwIcEOC_yqU\n\nBelow is the link to the website in which I got most of my information about the ante-Nicene fathers:\nhttps://www.str.org/w/nine-early-church-fathers-who-taught-jesus-is-god\n\nIf you wanted to check out the videos I mentioned that go into more detail about the church fathers and their comments on the trinity, the links to those videos are shown just below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/Gq1uYD8CzJ8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_2iYSyus5I\n\nIf you wanna see a video that goes into more detail on the concept of \"the Firstborn\" in the ancient near east, I'd highly recommend the video linked below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEI9CUZonAg\n\nIf you wanted to see the sermon I did in which I give an analogy for the trinity, the link to that is below:\nhttps://youtu.be/sUF5OGw9j-4?\n\nIf you wanted to see the video done by \"Red Pen logic\" where he discusses how Jesus could be God even if he didn't know something, the link to that is found below as well:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR6njdO2YJU\n\nLastly but certainly not least, if you want to watch the video answering what Jesus meant when he said \"I can do nothing on my own\", the link to that is found below:\nhttps://youtu.be/LH3eDQgzhIE?\n\nLike in the last 5 videos in this series, there are timestamps below that should help you navigate through the video and the topics discussed therein:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:12 Muslim Claims about the Early Church\n3:55 What do the Church Fathers Say?\n9:07 Early Pagans Show Jesus is God\n9:58 Answering Objections\n12:45 Did Jesus Deny Being Good?\n15:59 How Can God Pray to God?\n18:14 How is the Father Greater than Jesus?\n24:39 Why is Jesus \"the Firstborn\"?\n28:01 How Can an Omniscient God Not Know Something?\n33:45 Why Did Jesus Say \"I Can Do Nothing on My Own\"?\n34:21 The End?\n36:00 What Did I Miss?\n54:25 The End!\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy this video. I cannot express my gratitude that so many people have benefitted from this series, and I hope that those of you watching will benefit from this last episode in the series. I wish all of you a great day, and a happy leap year. God bless all of y'all.",

    "description": "Hey everyone, I hope you enjoy this first video in a series where I attempt to chronicle every reference to the deity of Jesus in the New Testament. Think of this as the closest thing you'll get to a Christmas special this year... I mean it kinda works, this video talks about the deity of Jesus, which is definitely a core element of the incarnation which we celebrate at Christmas. The video even mentions the council of Nicaea, the same council where jolly old Saint Nick himself slapped Arius for blaspheming Jesus... so ya, this is your Christmas special for the year. \n\nAs you might expect, there were quite a number of sections in the Bible that talk about Jesus' divinity, so this will be a relatively lengthy multi-part series. This unfortunately means that this may end up being the last video I make in 2023, but there will definitely be more to come, and in particular more videos in this series come 2024. \n\nWith all that being said, I hope you enjoy this video, and I hope it helps you get a better idea as to why Christians believe that Jesus is God. As seen below there are timestamps to navigate the video and the topics discussed therein:\n\n0:00 The Trinity and Nicaea\n3:40 The First and the Last\n6:30 Jesus was Worshipped\n12:55 What's in a Name?\n19:02 Jesus' Power Over Nature\n20:12 Jesus Forgives People's Sins\n26:02 Jesus, the Judge and Resurrection\n32:00 Who Sends God's Spirit?\n35:05 Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath\n36:17 God Shares His Glory with None... but Jesus\n38:14 Jesus' Unique Connection with God\n39:05 Why did David Call Jesus Lord?\n40:58 Jesus' Omnipresence \n41:56 Jesus the Mind-Reader\n43:45 Outro\n\nMerry Christmas, and remember, Christ is Lord!",

Today we got a very different type of video than my usual for this Halloween/Reformation day special, so I hope y'all enjoy it. Me and my friend will be reviewing various depictions of angels, and - in the spirit of Reformation day -  will be going back to the bible to see whether these angel depictions are as biblically accurate as they claim to be. \n\nMassive shoutout to my boi @beaumaths for helping me out with this video.

This one is a bit different from the last few uploads I've made, at least in part cuz it's probably one of the shortest videos I'll ever make. Additionally, unlike my last few videos which have been excerpts from sermons I've done, this video is a much more heavily edited video, with the editing done by yours truly. As you can tell from my very clearly professionally made thumbnail, this video's editing is going to be leagues above anything else you've ever seen on this platform.

Hope you enjoy this sermon which covers a topic much more rooted in the Bible compared to the last two sermons that I've uploaded to this channel.

    "description": "He is Risen!\nHappy Easter/Pascha everybody! I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\nSince it’s that time of the year again, I thought that it would be appropriate to reupload a sermon I did on this very topic.\nIn this video I hope to show that the resurrection is a historical fact, one that can by proven using several other historical facts that are agreed upon by most (well over 70%) of all historians and new testament scholars (including atheist/skeptical/agnostic scholars). \nBy using the following known historical facts in this video I hope to show that HE’S RISEN:\n\nHorrid Death by Crucifixion\nEmpty Tomb\n‘Sisters in Christ’ Discovered the Empty Tomb\n\nRough Treatment of the Apostles\nIndependent Appearances of Christ to His Apostles\nSkeptics Converted After Jesus’ Death\nExpectations were Defied by the Resurrection\nNearby and Early Preaching in Jerusalem \n\n\nIt should be noted that the details used to prove the resurrection here come from historical facts that virtually everyone in the relevant fields agree upon. This means that anything that is disputed by historians or biblical scholars which could still serve as evidence for the resurrection (such as the Shroud of Turin and numerous passages in the Bible) are not included here as evidence, even if many would agree that they help substantiate the claim that the resurrection actually took place. For this reason the argument presented here is often referred to as the \"Minimal Facts\" argument for the resurrection, as it only uses data that everyone agrees upon, rather than using all data that would support the claim for the resurrection being a historical event.\n\n\nTimestamps for the video:\n0:00 Intro\n0:15 Scripture Reading\n1:55 What is at Stake\n3:25 Evidence for the Resurrection (HE'S RISEN)\n5:40 Jesus Was Crucified \n6:15 Jesus Was Buried in a Tomb\n9:45 Jesus' Tomb was Empty \n12:55 Women Discovered the Empty Tomb \n14:20 Jesus' Followers Claimed to see the Living Jesus\n15:45 Skeptics Converted by the Risen Christ\n17:40 The Apostles Preached in Jerusalem \n20:00 Jesus' Resurrection Defied Everyone's Expectations\n23:20 The Persecution and Martyrdom of the Apostles\n27:00 Alternative Theories to the Resurrection\n27:20 What if Jesus was just Unconscious?\n29:25 What if all of this was Made Up Decades Later?\n31:20 What if the Apostles Lied About the Resurrection?\n34:40 Couldn't Mass Hallucinations Explain the Resurrection?\n38:30 Impostor? Among us?!? Funny???\n40:35 Did the Women go to the Wrong Tomb?\n42:15 Why the Evidence Points to the Resurrection\n47:20 Closing Prayer\n48:05 Benediction and Illiteracy\n\n\nIf you liked this video and want to see more discussions on this subject, I'd highly recommend some of the videos and channels featured below, as they elaborate on many of the topics I discussed here in more detail, they may present evidence I neglected to show here, or they may cite other scholarly sources for further digging into this subject. These videos provided me with much of the inspiration to make this sermon, so I cannot recommend them enough.\n\n\nOther videos to check out on this subject:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_Db4RwZ_M\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5znVUFHqO4Q\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wICHji-kh-s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BltIwge0LiA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6_pZV9zXzQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BU_R7QoYo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8lkuuhVkOI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8nksgZerZE\n\nA Playlist on this Subject:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ErnJF_nwBk&list=PL1mr9ZTZb3TUYymBPce08oyuhnHLLkR_B\n\nAnd once again, happy Easter, He is Risen!

I would highly recommend checking out these videos as I took heavy inspiration from them, and frankly they probably did a better job than I did at elaborating on these topics. \n\nThe Cosmological Argument:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ULF5WixMM&t=0s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKKIvmcO5LQ&t=0s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ie9musGEqQ&t=0s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeKavDdRVIg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrgSbFhHCmU&t=0s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQwLbDN7amo\nhttps://youtu.be/xS6xHagcOd0?si=n0I-f6-Wn1NcBQvn\n\nThe Teleological Argument: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I37dj9cbgUE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yt7hvgFuNg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO-QyzsDmps&t=0s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE76nwimuT0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGbbWyd4l7Q\n\nSome more videos covering how biology points to a creator, as I did not have time to go into nearly as much depth as I would've liked to with this topic:\nhttps://youtu.be/9R7bdVcK0hk?si=7NugI_X0OjhVSL0R\nhttps://youtu.be/iNNDa9DO36w?si=fM27pp8jA3FBOFNs\nhttps://youtu.be/2vTdWBzhPNE?si=VCT0xiSr1-cGNW0h",
