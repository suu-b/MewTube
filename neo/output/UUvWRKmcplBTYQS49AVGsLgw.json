Specifically, we respond to a recent video by @ReasonableFaithOrg.\n\nLike the show? Help it grow! Consider becoming a patron (thanks!): https://www.patreon.com/majestyofreason\n\nIf you wanna make a one-time donation or tip (thanks!): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/josephcschmid\n\nOUTLINE\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:22 Craig’s video\n9:22 Material causality\n18:14 Beginning to exist\n20:05 Big Bang and cosmological models\n33:18 No particular model is probable?\n36:26 Past finitude doesn’t imply beginning\n51:57 Quantum gravity\n55:51 Window shade analogy\n1:00:10 BGV Theorem\n1:17:13 Vilenkin’s paper\n1:26:00 Sean Carroll and Guth\n1:38:12 The fixed Kalam\n1:41:20 Abstract object counterexamples?\n1:51:45 Second law of thermodynamics\n1:55:10 The universe as a counterexample?\n1:57:56 Document! Don’t just assert!\n2:06:45 Conclusion\n\nNOTE\n\nAt 1:15:05, I wanted to summarize the problems with Craig’s use of the BGV theorem. I didn’t provide the most helpful summary in the video, so here’s a summary:\n\n(1) At best, the BGV theorem shows that a spacetime region which has been expanding on average throughout its history could not have been expanding forever. Such an expanding region must have begun its expansion at some finitely distant point in the past. This does *not* imply that all of spacetime *itself* has a beginning because all of spacetime may not have been expanding on average throughout its history. In such a case, the BGV Theorem would be inapplicable to the whole of spacetime itself. In fact, as pointed out in the video, both Guth and Vilenkin explicitly say that the BGV theorem only shows that the *inflation* of the universe has a beginning, it doesn’t show that the *universe as a whole* or *spacetime as a whole* has a beginning.\n\n(2) Recent literature purports to give grounds to doubt the BGV theorem. Whether or not this recent literature is correct, it reveals that this is not a settled issue. Instead, it is an active area of research and debate. Relevant papers here include Lesnefsky et al (2023) https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.044024, Geshnizjani et al (2023) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2023)182, Nomura (2012) https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5550, and Aguirre (2007) https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0571.\n\n(3) The BGV theorem is only a theorem about classical spacetimes. But we probably don’t live in a classical spacetime. We have good reasons internal to the standard model and general relativity for thinking that these theories will be surpassed by a new theory able to incorporate both. So our current understanding of spacetime will be replaced by something else. So the BGV theorem does not apply to the spacetime we live in.\n\n(4) Even if we do live in a classical spacetime, the Malamant-Manchak theorems show that, in all likelihood, we couldn’t ever know enough about the global structure of spacetime to know that *all* of spacetime had a beginning.\n\n(5) Even if the BGV theorem shows that the past is finite — and, as explained above, it does not — we cannot infer that the universe (i.e., the totality of all physical reality) began to exist, for the reasons given in the section of the video entitled “Past finitude does not entail beginning to exist”.\n\nRESOURCES\n\n(1) The video to which we're responding (@ReasonableFaithOrg): https://youtu.be/-Aq9rET8_BE?si=9a3Q5cxkkxjdlIYg\n\n(2) Dan's dissertation, “Cosmic Skepticism and the Beginning of Physical Reality”: https://philarchive.org/archive/DAN_SA-15\n\n(3) Saatsi, “Non-causal explanations in physics”: https://philarchive.org/archive/SAANEI\n\n(4) “No, science doesn’t show the universe began to exist”: https://youtu.be/35tICdYtHsQ?si=oQ-LfJuWjSo6mWYb\n\n(5) Phil’s book, “Battle of the Big Bang”: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo244963115.html\n\n(6) @PhilHalper1's Kalam video: https://youtu.be/pGKe6YzHiME?si=XvhKyGYeEwecvAX4\n\n(7) Phil's video responding to Craig's responses: https://youtu.be/femxJFszbo8?si=TV2fEGjS91K7HB65\n\n(8) My Kalam playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxRhaLyXxXkZzH2YffI32ViTZ73Tu8jSR\n\n(9) Linford, “A modal condition for the beginning of the universe”: https://philarchive.org/rec/LINAMC-2\n\n(10) Linford, “Neo-Lorentzian Relativity and the Beginning of the Universe”: https://philarchive.org/rec/LINNRA-3\n\n(11) Linford, \"Big Bounce or Double Bang?

Consider becoming a patron (thanks!): https://www.patreon.com/majestyofreason\n\nIf you wanna make a one-time donation or tip (thanks!): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/josephcschmid\n\nOUTLINE\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Definitions\n1:48 Trent’s video\n4:24 Are atheists blaming Craig?\n6:05 ‘Should’ implies alternative possibilities?\n8:14 Power to change the future\n8:50 Linguistic incaution\n10:39 Sapolsky\n11:49 Trent’s core argument\n16:11 What’s the difference???\n20:12 Leeway freedom\n24:22 Atheism and reductive physicalism\n25:51 Humans vs. animals\n28:24 Libertarianism and laws of nature\n32:55 Does theism preclude moral responsibility?\n38:56 Luck objection\n42:43 Punishment and moral responsibility\n47:07 Old Testament God = North Korea\n48:53 Clarifying compatibilism\n51:54 Trent contra compatibilism\n54:19 Trent’s second argument\n57:21 Frankfurt cases\n1:04:20 Flickers of freedom\n1:11:02 Resources and conclusion\n\nCORRECTIONS\n\n(1) In the section entitled \"Should’ implies alternative possibilities?\", I contest the idea that 'S should φ' implies 'S could do something alternative to φ-ing'. I think my counterexamples to that idea are correct, but I don't think they actually address Trent's claim in the preceding clip. In particular, Trent's claim was instead that 'S should φ' implies 'S could φ'. Importantly, though, many of my examples can be modified to motivate denying this claim too. For instance, just imagine the boulder-trapping-arm case to be one in which you're compelled *not* to hack off your arm by your psychology (maybe you're very queasy). Still, it seems like you *should* hack off your arm!\n\nLINKS\n\n(1) My Response Videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxRhaLyXxXkaNtpoOwEZm9fuJq423BUrW\n\n(2) My Free Will playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxRhaLyXxXka4SMFOH-KH-hdJoTz6fG5F\n\n(3) My Common Mistakes playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxRhaLyXxXkY8lCiJY7XZFkfBChK1VdMK\n\n(4) The Majesty of Reason: A Short Guide to Critical Thinking in Philosophy: https://www.amazon.com/Majesty-Reason-Critical-Thinking-Philosophy/dp/B086FW6XV4\n\n(5) My Springer book: (a) https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Inertia-Classical-Theistic-Proofs/dp/3031193148/ (b) https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-19313-2\n\nTHE USUAL...\n\nFollow the Majesty of Reason podcast! https://open.spotify.com/show/4Nda5uNcGselvKphtKSKvH\n\nJoin the Discord and chat all things philosophy! https://dsc.gg/majestyofreason\n\nMy website: https://josephschmid.com\n\nMy PhilPeople profile: https://philpeople.org/profiles/joseph-schmid",

    "title": "From Kalam to God?",
    "description": "Must the cause of the universe be timeless, spaceless, immaterial, enormously powerful, and personal? No. Here's why.\n\nLike the show? Help it grow! Consider becoming a patron (thanks!): https://www.patreon.com/majestyofreason\n\nIf you wanna make a one-time donation or tip (thanks!): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/josephcschmid\n\nCLARIFICATION\n\nThanks to commenter Tym Miara for inviting this helpful clarification:\n\nIn the video, I argued that we cannot infer from the Kalam alone that the cause is spaceless. I began by using an example: “if, *for instance*, you’re only showing [in stage 1] that the past must be finite…” Using this example, I explained how we can’t then go on to infer that the cause of the beginning of (metric) time is spaceless.\n\nI intended the points I made subsequently — about the epistemic possibility of there being some sort of space in which the first cause resides, etc. — to generalize to *other* ways of defending stage 1 of the Kalam, including the appeals to Big Bang cosmology. I wasn’t intending to impute to Craig the inference from ‘x causes the beginning of time’ to ‘x is therefore spaceless’. My point was, firstly, that *if* we only show in stage 1 that metric time is past-finite, *then* we cannot infer that the first cause(s) thereof is spaceless; and, furthermore, that the point about the epistemic possibility of some space in which the first cause(s) resides is a problem for *other* extant ways of defending stage 1, not just a way of defending stage 1 which only shows that the past must be finite. I used the finite-metric-past defense of stage 1 as an example to introduce the point which I intended to generalize more broadly.\n\nSo, then, the clarification is that I wasn't intending to say that Craig takes his spacelessness conclusion to be derived from the finitude of the past, though I can understand if what I said suggests that. I’m here canceling any such implicature, and explaining what I was intending to convey.\n\nMy point, instead, is precisely that *none* of the points in Craig's stage 1 case show that the cause is spaceless — even the points pertaining to Big Bang cosmology. They only show, at best, that the cause doesn't exist in the spatial framework of our local spatiotemporal manifold, i.e., the self-contained one that began to expand about 13.8 billion years ago. As I noted in the video, there may be a different space that exists causally prior to the beginning of metric time (and hence causally prior to the beginning of the spatial manifold associated with that metric time) and in which the cause resides. This space may be the same sort of space as our local spatiotemporal manifold's space (e.g., three-dimensional); or it may be some more exotic state space that various philosophers have proposed for the 'location' of the universal wavefunction; or it may be a higher dimensional spatial framework; and so on. The epistemic possibilities are boundless, and Craig — in claiming the cause must be spaceless — illegitimately assumes that none of these are the case. The crucial point is that they straightforwardly undercut the claim that the cause of our local spatiotemporal manifold must be spaceless, i.e., without any space.\n\nAnd, of course, I think it's important to emphasize that Big Bang cosmology doesn't show that the universe, understood as all of physical reality, began to exist; for more on this, see Dr. Linford's dissertation here :)\n\nhttps://philarchive.org/archive/DAN_SA-15\n\nLINKS\n\n(1) The original video from @thoughtology7732: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL3Y7QRPp5k\n\n(2) My Kalam playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxRhaLyXxXkZzH2YffI32ViTZ73Tu8jSR\n\n(3) My Springer book: (a) https://www.amazon.com/Existential-Inertia-Classical-Theistic-Proofs/dp/3031193121/ (b) https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-19313-2\n\nTHE USUAL...\n\nFollow the Majesty of Reason podcast! https://open.spotify.com/show/4Nda5uNcGselvKphtKSKvH\n\nJoin the Discord and chat all things philosophy! https://dsc.gg/majestyofreason\n\nMy website: https://josephschmid.com\n\nMy PhilPeople profile: https://philpeople.org/profiles/joseph-schmid",

    "description": "What is Bayes' Theorem? How is it used in philosophy, statistics, and beyond? How should it NOT be used? Welcome to the ultimate guide to these questions and more.\n\nLike the show? Help it grow! Consider becoming a patron (thanks!): https://www.patreon.com/majestyofreason\n\nIf you wanna make a one-time donation or tip (thanks!): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/josephcschmid\n\nOUTLINE\n\n0:00 Intro and outline\n3:10 What is Bayes’ Theorem?\n4:50 Belief and credence\n14:46 Interpretations of probability\n24:52 Epistemic probability\n28:32 Bayesian epistemology\n30:50 Core normative rules\n33:05 Propositional logic background\n42:32 Kolmogorov’s axioms\n54:25 Dutch Books\n57:25 Ratio Formula\n1:02:03 Conditionalization principle\n1:10:47 Subjective vs. Objective Bayesianism\n1:13:50 Bayes’ Theorem: Standard form(s)\n1:39:25 Bayes’ Theorem: Odds form\n1:53:06 Evidence\n2:09:25 Visualizing Bayes’ Theorem\n2:49:41 Common mistakes\n2:49:53 Base rate fallacy\n2:52:28 Evidence for H vs. Making H probable\n2:53:43 Total evidence requirement\n2:54:58 Fallacy of understated evidence\n2:59:36 Confirmation is comparative\n3:01:07 Evidential symmetry\n3:07:56 Strength asymmetry\n3:11:40 Falsifiability as a virtue\n3:12:27 Likelihood ratio rigging\n3:19:32 Conclusion and Resources\n\nNOTES\n\n(1) The argument I give around the ten-minute mark admittedly doesn't address the view that (i) credences don't exist, and yet (ii) we can still account for the relevant data about our doxastic lives by appeal to beliefs about probabilities. It also doesn't address the view that while credences exist and are distinct from beliefs, beliefs about probabilities suffice to account for the relevant data.\n\nWhile I have independent reservations for these views, it's worth noting them nonetheless. The belief/credence part of the video was mainly an exercise in warming listeners up to talk of credences so they would be more receptive to the rest of the video. It's a necessary preamble to the main event: Bayes' Theorem. I grant that a proper defense of belief-credence dualism — and a proper defense of the overly-basic motivations I sketched at the ten-minute mark — would need to contend with these alternative proposals!\n\nCORRECTIONS\n\n(1) At 52:55, I meant to say that the SECOND claim entails the FIRST while the FIRST does not entail the SECOND. Oops!\n\n(2) Thankfully, the audio improves at 28:32! Remind me to never record a solo presentation using Zoom…\n\n(3) Here's an important clarification about the roommate/magical marker example given around 2:07:00. In the video, I was not clear about the content of the hypotheses in question and how this affects their likelihoods and priors. Here is how I should have spelled out the example.\n\n​Consider two hypotheses:\n\nH1: My friend wrote on my board\nH2: My marker by itself wrote on my board\n\nThe data is:\n\nD: \"Don't forget to take out the trash!\" is written on my board\n\nNow, H1 renders D quite surprising, given that my friend knows all about my diligent habits of taking out the trash, etc. If H1 is true, he would most likely have written something on the board then erased it (since he knows I don't like him touching my board, etc.). And even if he didn't erase it, it would be very odd for him to write this given that he knows I'm super diligent about the trash.\n\nBut H2 renders D far, far more surprising. Of all the possible things the marker could conceivably have written on the board by magically floating upwards etc., only an absurdly small fraction are even coherent, let alone English words strung together to compose an intelligible, grammatical, contextually relevant English sentence.\n\nOf course, H1 has higher prior than H2. But the point made in the video stands, since the likelihood of H1 (i.e., P(D|H1)) is very low, but it's still much greater than the likelihood of H2 (i.e., P(D|H2)), and hence data can still be evidence for a hypothesis even though the data is very surprising on that hypothesis.\n\nLINKS\n\n(1) Want the script?

I don't think so, and here's why.\n\nEDIT [posted on 12/2/2022]: Note that I'm only discussing *Chad McIntosh's* presentation of the argument. I say 'Josh Rasmussen's argument' because I'm simply following Chad McIntosh's attribution of the argument Chad is presenting to Josh. I didn't want to be that guy who says 'well, ackshually, that's not technically how Josh presents the argument.' This note is simply clarifying that I'm not discussing Josh's *own* presentation in his book, which differs in subtle but important ways from Chad's presentation. If I wanted to discuss Josh's *own* presentation, then I'd look directly at Josh's book. I actually have another project underway wherein I directly discuss Josh's own presentation.

Human freedom also explains its punishment and finality: persons in hell have freely developed moral vices that are their own punishment and that make repentance psychologically impossible. So, even though God continues to desire reconciliation with persons in hell, damned persons do not want reconciliation with God. But this moral vice explanation of hell’s finality is implausible. I argue that God can and would make direct or indirect alterations in their character to give them new motivational reasons that re-enable their freedom to repent. Subsequently, I argue partly that it is probable that each damned person will be saved eventually, because there is a potential infinity of opportunities for free repentance. Thus, if the Free Will Explanation’s descriptions of hell and divine love are correct, it is highly probable that each person in hell escapes to heaven.\n \n(9) Keith DeRose, “Universalism and the Bible”, https://campuspress.yale.edu/keithderose/1129-2/\n \n(10) Here are some resources on the dim prospects of offering theodicies without universalism:\n\n(a) Adams, Marilyn McCord (1993). “The Problem of Hell: A Problem of Evil for Christians,” in Reasoned Faith, ed.

    "title": "Moral Arguments for God: An Analysis",
    "description": "\"Without God, all things are permitted.\" Wrong. Here's why.\n\nLike the show? Help it grow! Consider becoming a patron (thanks!): https://www.patreon.com/majestyofreason\n\nIf you wanna make a one-time donation or tip (thanks!): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/josephcschmid\n\nADDITIONS\n\nHere are some additions bolstering my points pertaining to the standard, WLC-style moral argument.\n\nFirst, I didn’t get into many specific theories or accounts as to what grounds the rightness or wrongness (or im/permissibility etc.) of certain actions in a way that doesn’t involve God, but there are boatloads of such accounts. These, in turn, can be used to develop non-theistic metaethical accounts of morality. A small sampling:\n\n(1) Utility: an act’s moral properties could be grounded facts about utility — i.e., facts about what would/wouldn’t maximize well-being [understood perhaps in terms of pain/pleasure, or desire dis/satisfaction, or flourishing/languishing, etc.]\n\n(2) Kantian universalizability: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in facts about universalizability [e.g., whether one could, in performing the act, consistently will that everyone does the act]\n\n(3) Kantian ends-in-themselves: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in whether the act treats someone as a mere means rather than an end in themself\n\n(4) Contractualism: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in whether principles allowing the act would be justifiable to others in a fair decision situation. Put differently (and with a Scanlonian vibe): an act’s moral properties could be grounded in whether the norms or rules underpinning one’s behavior could reasonably be objected to if they were to be agreed upon from an informed and unbiased vantage point.\n\n(5) Virtue ethics: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in whether the act is one a virtuous person would do (or in whether it expresses a virtuous/vicious disposition)\n\n(6) Care ethics: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in whether the act is one a caring person would do\n\n(7) Ideal observer: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in whether an ideally situated observer would approve of the act\n\n(8) Railton’s naturalism: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in objective facts concerning the maximal fulfillment of idealized desires, which are what individuals would want themselves to desire if they had access to all the relevant information\n\n(9) Discourse ethics: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in universalizable presuppositions that underpin discourse between persons (see William Rehg’s work)\n\n(10) Pluralism: an act’s moral properties could be grounded in a plethora of the aforementioned potential grounds for morality OR in particular facts about actions on a case-by-case basis (e.g., gross power imbalances, infliction of pain without consent or benefits accrued to the victim, etc.)\n\n(11) Natural law: an act's moral properties could be grounded in whether it contravenes the ends built into one's nature\n\nMore generally, as Kevin Scharp rightly notes with respect to non-naturalist, non-theistic moral realist accounts of morality, “There are literally dozens of theories of moral values and moral duties that are objective, not naturalist, and make no appeal to gods. For example, G. E. Moore, Sir William David Ross, Christine Korsgaard, Thomas Scanlon, Derek Parfit, Philippa Foot, David Enoch, Russ Shafer-Landau, Rosalind Hursthouse, John McDowell, Jonathan Dancy, H. A. Prichard, Roger Crisp, Joseph Raz, Jean Hampton, and Rey Wedgwood. That’s just a few.” Scharp’s lesson? “Stop assuming that atheists cannot accept that there are objective moral values. All it demonstrates is that you know nothing about ethics.”\n\nSecond, some links:\n\n(1) Moral argument playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxRhaLyXxXkaUcAQpHXN9ZNF2RxZLe7U_\n\n(2) Phil Disquisitions, \"Craig on Morality and Meaning\": https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2013/02/wl-craig-on-morality-and-meaning-series.html\n\n(3) I elaborate on one of Morriston's criticisms of WLC's moral argument here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwpqf2wZkwtZsyGI80uJMtZrY-4Am-XWKLUMYIGkElI/edit?usp=sharing\n\n(4) 100+ Argument Resource Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qWHRyegTNlBXC9Bupxl2ZSmEUTeXvi0KEeg0W0VW288/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOUTLINE\n\n0:00 Intro\n3:15 Generic Argument\n20:21 Abductive Argument\n23:47 The Normative Implications of Evil\n25:36 Evil as Privation of Good\n29:25 Horrendous Evils\n33:08 Universal Moral Beliefs\n35:42 Sidgwick and Kant\n40:04 A Kantian Argument from Adams\n45:13 Oderberg on Cosmic Justice\n49:02 Layman’s Moral Argument\n53:15 Need for Divine Aid in Being Moral\n1:00:00 The Moral Gap\n1:04:11 Duty to Promote the Highest Good\n1:07:40 Objective Obligations and Duties\n1:12:53 Argument from Conscience\n1:16:22 The Intrinsic Harmfulness of Wrongdoing\n1:17:53 Moral Knowledge\n1:25:02 Apprehension of Objective Norms\n1:25:58 Altruism: Schloss\n1:28:20 Altruism: Pruss",

    "title": "12 Design Arguments: An Analysis",
    "description": "From the complexity of the biological world to the fine-tuning of the universe, design arguments are among the most powerful arguments for God's existence. In this video, I assess 12 such arguments.\n\nLike the show? Help it grow! Consider becoming a patron (thanks!): https://www.patreon.com/majestyofreason\n\nIf you wanna make a one-time donation or tip (thanks!): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/josephcschmid\n\nNOTES\n\n(1) There are several responses to fine-tuning arguments (FTAs) that I didn't mention in the video. The reason is because I simply haven't researched them in enough depth to have a strong view on them. For instance: (a) some philosophers mount the multiverse hypothesis in response to FTAs; (b) some philosophers and scientists question whether there even is fine-tuning; (c) some philosophers and scientists argue that FTAs suffer from the problem of non-normalizable probability measures; and (d) some philosophers and scientists argue that FTAs suffer from the the problem of old evidence. I haven't adequately researched these to have views on them. (My research focus lies more in cosmological and ontological arguments -- sorry!)\n\n(2) Philip Goff has recently argued (in Scientific American and Capturing Christianity) that the multiverse objection to the FTA commits the inverse gamblers fallacy. I don't think this is correct for several of the reasons spelled out in philosopher Neil Manson's recent Philosophy Compass article on the multiverse, FTA, and the inverse gambler's fallacy [here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KWsPQ3IulpPFqnE2I4gAIlSrtR8pQrA5/view?usp=sharing ]. James Fodor also discusses Goff's criticism in a recent video [here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQxCZrFJjso ].\n\nMore generally, I highly recommend Neil Manson's work criticizing the FTA. You can find his papers at https://philpeople.org/profiles/neil-a-manson\n\n(3) I don't think the objection to FTAs appealing simply to the observation selection effect works. This is why I didn't discuss this objection in the video.\n\n(4) A perceptive viewer of my original video raised an objection (in personal correspondence) to my/Manson's criticism of FTAs concerning the near-infinitude of ways God could actualize the good of conscious, moral beings without a finely-tuned physical universe. The objection was that my/Manson's criticism would, if successful, equally (and absurdly) undermine Luke Barnes' hypothetical 'awesome theological argument' in which we infer design from the fact that the stars spell out the first fourteen verses of John. This objection invited me to clarify and modify my original point in the video. Specifically, the criticism is best understood as a Draperian appeal to understated evidence. I articulate the newly understood criticism in the following 8-minute voice message that I sent to this perceptive viewer: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZtJ-w51pyCcQe2rKMIhJVx3EUIIuaYhW/view?usp=sharing\n\n(5) For more on the problem of teleological evil, see @EmersonGreen's excellent video on it: https://youtu.be/S8W9E_YvmFw\n\n(6) Regarding the skeptical theistic criticisms of the FTA, I recognize that there are different versions of skeptical theism, and that some of these may be more prone to conflict with natural theological arguments like the FTA than others. Eg, John DePoe’s positive skeptical theism promises to preserve the force of such natural theological arguments. Whether it ultimately delivers on that promise is a topic for another episode! :)\n\nRESOURCES\n\n100+ Argument Resource Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qWHRyegTNlBXC9Bupxl2ZSmEUTeXvi0KEeg0W0VW288/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOUTLINE\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:52 Aquinas’ Fifth Way\n3:53 Design in Biology: Origin of Organic Life\n9:30 Chandler’s Divine Intervention Argument\n14:24 Design in Biology: Organic Structures (Paley)\n19:40 Pruss’ Analogical DA\n22:36 Design in Biology: Information\n25:26 Tennant’s Argument from Cosmic Teleology\n29:57 FTA by Elimination\n38:56 FTA by Bayes\n1:09:59 Collins on the FTA\n1:10:17 Collins’ Fine-Tuning for Discoverability\n1:13:08 Perceiving Design\n\nLINKS\n\nMy website: https://josephschmid.com\n\nMy PhilPeople profile: https://philpeople.org/profiles/joseph-schmid",

So, this note is a clarification that resolves this apparent conflict, and I apologize for the unclarity in this regard. A clarification could come in one of two ways, and I'm fine with either: first, we could say that an actual infinite is more precisely defined disjunctively as either infinite *number* of things [and so a collection of definite and discrete elements etc.] OR an infinite *quantity*. Second, if we instead leave the definition of 'actual infinite' unchanged, we could modify my claim that 'an infinite intensive magnitude is an actual infinite' to the claim that 'an infinite intensive magnitude is still a concretely realized infinity, and it, too, will possess (at least many of) the problematic aspects of infinity that people like Craig adduce.' Note that nothing of substance in my point in the video would be lost on either clarification, and so my original point stands.",

But I would like to make an important clarification about this.\n\nHere's what I was thinking. At minute 53 in his discussion with Malpass, Anderson says that “divine thoughts don’t have propositional content”.\n\nI take this to imply that divine thoughts aren’t about propositions. So, God’s thought that ‘Paris is the capital of France’ is not about Paris’ being the capital of France, ie, the meaning expressed by the aforequoted sentence. What, then, is it about? It can’t be about itself, since Anderson had—just prior to the time stamp above—denounced the self-reflexivity that engenders infinite regress. But if God’s thought that ‘Paris is the capital of France’ is not about Paris’ being the capital of France, and if it’s also not about itself, I took this to imply that God’s thought here isn’t about anything. (What’s any other plausible candidate for what it’s about? Cheeseburgers?)\n\nIn essence, I understood Anderson’s claim to imply, by clear and innocuous inferences, the claim that God’s thoughts aren’t about anything.\n\nNow, in retrospect, I should have been more cautious in what I said. I should have said that Anderson said God’s thoughts have no propositional content, and that this pretty clearly (read: clear to my mind) entails that they aren’t about anything. And so I apologize for not being as clear as I should have and thereby suggesting something Anderson did not explicitly say.",

This is correct in one sense, incorrect in another sense. It is correct insofar as Audi explicitly discusses the relationship between EIT and the second law, and he actually thinks the second law gives some reason to think EIT is true. He says, e.g., on p. 6 that \"I think the most we\nget from entropy is a reason to think the EIT is true, but not an\nexplanation of why.\" And since he thinks EIT gives some reason to think EIT is true, this is why I said he rejects an argument to the effect that EIT and the second law are incompatible. So what I said is mostly correct. The sense in which it's incorrect is as follows. Strictly speaking, Audi doesn't address any specific argument from the second law to the falsity of EIT, and consequently he doesn't go on to say something like 'I reject the/a argument from the second law against EIT'. So my claim is mostly correct, but also slightly incorrect. But I've corrected and clarified things now!",

For one can consistently hold both (a) and (b) and employ them both to argue against (the possibility of) an infinite past.

The link will be placed in the description of the latest video in that series.\n\nNote on defining 'classical theism': there is some controversy over how to define classical theism. It's going to be difficult to find unanimous support for certain theses across all traditions (e.g. Eastern traditions like (strands of) Hinduism, Eastern Orthodox and Palamite traditions, Islamic and Jewish traditions, Western Christian traditions, etc.). The definition of classical theism I use (which follows classical theist scholars like Rogers, Brower, Grant, Bergmann, Dolezal, Stump, and so on) is broadly situated in the tradition following Augustine, Boethius, Lombard, Maimonides, Anselm, Aquinas, etc. and on through contemporary thinkers like Kate Rogers and W. Matthews Grant. I focus less on versions/variations of classical theism found in (e.g.) Scotus, Palamas, and so on. [Though, note that the vast majority of things I say in this series of videos apply mutatis mutandis to such variations.]\n\nAnd the usual links:\n\nMy book: https://www.amazon.com/Majesty-Reason-Critical-Thinking-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B086G7KS52\nMy website: https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/",

Buckle up for a discussion than which no greater discussion can be conceived.\n\nLink to our document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Rz55LYtSHxDVPwxCpOgZDenwOuHoXBc2UBsTrQ0l6Y/edit?usp=sharing \n\nOUTLINE\n\nIntroduction to Tyron and Ontological Arguments 0:00\nAnselm’s OA 10:21\nDescartes’ OA 53:27\nPlantinga’s Modal OA 1:01:30\nBest part of the video 1:07:14\nPlantinga’s argument and symmetry breakers 1:09:27\n\nARGUMENTS\n\nAnselm’s OA\n\n\"GOD\" = That than which a greater cannot be conceived\n\n1. “GOD” is understood. (Premise)\n2. If “GOD” is understood, GOD exists in the understanding. (Premise)\n3. Even if GOD exists only in the understanding, it can be conceived to exist in reality. (Premise)\n4. GOD is greater if it exists in reality than if it exists only in the understanding. (Premise)\n5. It is impossible to conceive of something greater than GOD. (Premise)\n6. If GOD exists in the understanding, then GOD exists only in the understanding or in the understanding and in reality. (Premise)\n7. Therefore, GOD exists in the understanding. (From 1 and 2)\n8. Therefore, GOD exists only in the understanding or in the understanding and in reality. (From 6 and 7)\n9. Therefore, GOD can be conceived to exist in reality. (From 3 and 7)\n10. Therefore, if GOD exists only in the understanding, then it is possible to conceive of something greater than GOD. (From 4 and 9)\n11. Therefore, GOD does not exist only in the understanding. (From 5 and 10)\n12. Therefore, GOD exists in reality. (From 8 and 11)\n\nDescartes’ OA\n\n-----Simple reconstruction\n\n1. A perfect being, by definition, has every perfection.\n2. Existence is a perfection.\n3. Therefore, a perfect being has existence (i.e., exists).\n\n-----Elaborate reconstruction\n\n1. Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive (understand, apprehend) to belong to the nature or essence of a thing does belong to its nature or essence.\n2. Whatever belongs to the nature or essence of a thing can be truly affirmed of that thing.\n3. Therefore, whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to the nature or essence of a thing can be truly affirmed of that thing.\n4. I clearly and distinctly perceive that existence belongs to the nature or essence of a supremely perfect being.\n5. Therefore, existence can be truly affirmed of a supremely perfect being (i.e., a supremely perfect being exists).\n\nPlantinga’s Modal OA\n\n1. There is some possible world where maximal greatness is instantiated. (Premise)\n2. If so, then there is some world where a being has maximal excellence in every world. (Premise)\n3. If there is some world where a being has maximal excellence in every world, then the being has maximal excellence in every world. (Premise)\n4. If some being has maximal excellence in every world, then it is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent in every world. (Premise)\n5. Therefore, some being has maximal excellence in every world. (From 1-3)\n6. Therefore, some being is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent in every world. (From 4 and 5)\n7. Therefore, some being is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent in the actual world.

    "description": "Does classical theism entail that gratitude to God is unfitting or inappropriate? I’m joined by Dr. Marcus Hunt to discuss this very question in connection to his recent article published in IJPR.\n\nArgument Outline\n\n(1) If someone cannot be benefited, then they cannot be a fitting target of prepositional gratitude.\n(2) The God of classical theism cannot be benefited.\nTherefore,\n(3) The God of classical theism cannot be a fitting target of prepositional gratitude.\n\nFor premise (1):\n\nStep 1: A necessary condition for prepositional gratitude is a desire to benefit one’s benefactor.\nStep 2: A desire to benefit a benefactor is fitting only if it is metaphysically possible for the benefactor to be benefited.\n\nFor premise (2):\n\nStep 1: Classical theism (in particular, divine impassibility) entails that God is perfectly blessed.\nStep 2: If God is perfectly blessed, then nothing could possibly benefit God -- God has all possible benefits necessarily and ‘already’ (as it were).\n\nCurious to learn more about this argument?

    "title": "Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom",
    "description": "Is God’s comprehensive foreknowledge of the future incompatible with free will? Let’s see where reason takes us.\n\nHere’s another argument that I didn’t cover in the video but which will be of interest to y’all:\n\n(1) It is not under your control that God believed 1000 years ago that each of your actions would occur.\n(2) Necessarily, if God believed 1000 years ago that each of your actions would occur, then each of your actions occur.\n(3) If P necessarily entails Q, and P is not under your control, then Q is not under your control.\n(4) So, the occurrence of each of your actions is not under your control.\n(5) If (4), then you are not free.\n(6) So, you are not free.\n\nThis argument is interesting. I would probably challenge premise (1). It is *precisely because* you are free in each of your actions that you *are* in control of past facts specifying what your free actions will be. In other words, while you don’t cause the past to be how it is, there’s a kind of counterfactual dependence of the past on your choices: *had* you chosen A instead of B, God *would have* foreknown that you chose A.\n\nHere’s another example. Presumably, it was true before you were born that you would read this sentence today. And — by the same kind of reasoning that would presumably motivate (1) — this truth is not under your control (since you didn’t even exist to causally influence the past). And, moreover, this truth necessarily entails that you *do* in fact read this sentence today. So, it would follow from all of this that you are not free in reading this sentence! And we didn’t even need to invoke God’s foreknowledge here. All we needed was a truth prior to your birth.\n\nSurely, then, the argument has gone wrong somewhere. I suggest — as I did in the case of the foreknowledge argument — that it’s simply false that you have no control over truths prior to your birth. Rather, it is *precisely because* you are free and in control of your present actions that you thereby have control over truths prior to your birth. The explanation of your actions doesn’t flow *from* the past truth *to* your actions; rather, it’s the opposite. Your actions *explain* the past truth. Don’t put the cart before the horse.\n\nWebsite: https://www.majestyofreason.wordpress.com/ \nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Majesty-Reason-Critical-Thinking-Philosophy/dp/B086FW6XV4/",

    "title": "From Contingency to God? | Steven Nemes",
    "description": "Steven Nemes joins me for a cordial discussion on a potential path from contingent being to the God of classical theism.\n\n~\n\nI wish to add some clarifications on my response near the end of the video, as I could have been clearer concerning the thrust of my response.\n\nSteven's argument against the (live epistemic) possibility of a composite necessary being roughly proceeded as follows:\n\nComposite beings are always a mixture of two distinct principles: a principle of intelligibility (which is, of itself, universal and not tied down to any concrete particular) and a principle of individuation (which is, of itself, particular and indeterminate). Because neither of the two principles demand that they be combined with one another, there must be some extrinsic cause or principle which accounts for their unity.\n\nI have three primary responses to this that I did not sufficiently disentangle in the video:\n\n(1) In the case of a metaphysically necessary being (e.g. the neo-classical theistic God of Bill Craig, Ryan Mullins, and co.), it's *precisely because* it is a metaphysically necessary being that its principle of intelligibility and principle of individuation are necessarily conjoined or united with one another. That need not be explained in virtue of some extrinsic cause -- it's explained in virtue of the being's metaphysical necessity. We would presumably only need a causal explanation if the composite being were such that its two principles are merely contingently united. But that wouldn't be the case for a necessary composite being. And we cannot derive contingency from mere composition, since from the fact that x and y are distinct, it doesn't follow that they could come apart, or that one is accidental to the other, or that they are separable, or that they are possibly absent from reality. For instance, the properties having a radius and having a circumference are distinct but nevertheless inseparable, non-accidentally related, necessarily co-instantiated, and so on.\n\n(2) It seems question-begging to claim that ‘neither of the two principles demand that they be united with one another’. This is *the very question at issue* -- namely, whether there could be a being with distinct parts/principles but which is nevertheless such that its distinct principles demand that they be conjoined and necessarily instantiated in reality.\n\n(3) Not in and of itself a response to the argument, but something worth bearing in mind: the argument relies on heavy metaphysical background assumptions that many philosophers deny.\n\nNote that these considerations are NOT the end of the discussion, and that Steven himself will have responses, I'll have responses to his responses, Steven... and so on. Hopefully this gives a taste, however, of the complexities involved!\n\n~\n\nFor Steven Nemes' work, check out his Academia page! https://fuller.academia.edu/StevenNemes\n\nFor my work, check out my book and blog!\n\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Majesty-Reason-Critical-Thinking-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B086G7KS52/\n\nBlog: https://majestyofreason.wordpress.com/",

    "description": "Interested in God's existence? Theism? Atheism? Thomism? Creation? Panentheism, pantheism, and Spinozism? The origin and cause of the universe? Russelian monism? Causal finitism? We have just the discussion for you.\n\nThanks to Dr. Felipe Leon and Micah Edvenson (from Crusade Against Ignorance channel) for joining me to discuss Felipe's argument from material causality against creation ex nihilo.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\nNear the beginning of the video, Felipe used the term 'classical theism' to describe people like Plantinga, Swinburne, and co. This is an incorrect usage of the term. But this is a mere terminological issue. He means 'traditional theists' or 'orthodox monotheism'. He doesn't mean to pick out the Big Four attributes characterizing classical theism: immutability, simplicity, impassibility, and timelessness.\n\nHe just means that the theists to which he refers affirm the omni attributes, monotheism, God's perfection, God's necessity, and God's causally originating and sustaining the universe ex nihilo. An alternative understanding of the term doesn't warrant not listening. It was a wonderful conversation.\n\nAlso, his target is ex nihilo creation. It's \"classical theism*cvc*\", i.e. classical theism plus classical view of creation. So, it doesn't really matter (in the present context) whether or not he gets immutability, timelessness, and so on correct. What matters is his characterization of ex nihilo creation, since that's his target. So, pointing out a misapplication of 'classical theism' with respect to something other than creatio ex nihilo is not quite relevant. His target is any view according to which there is creation ex nihilo. The specifics about the Divine nature are tangential.\n\nI do want to stress, of course, that I disagreed with Felipe's use of 'classical theism'. Classical theism, as I use it, is meant to expressly pick out orthodox monotheism plus the Big Four: immutability, simplicity, timelessness, and impassibility. I would have preferred that he used 'orthodox monotheism' or 'traditional theism'. But the reason I didn't dwell on it or correct it in the dialogue was because (i) it's a terminological issue, and more importantly, (ii) it is irrelevant to his argument, since his argument has nothing to do with the Big Four but is instead aimed at ex nihilo creation.\n\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Majesty-Reason-Critical-Thinking-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B086G7KS52/",

    "title": "Dr. Graham Oppy on the Nature of Arguments (With Existential Inertia as Bonus)",
    "description": "In this video, I chat with Dr. Graham Oppy, professor of philosophy at Monash University, about the nature, purpose, and conditions of success for arguments. We also talk about Feser's Aristotelian proof and existential inertia. Those who wish to pursue these matters further can read \"The Normative Status of Logic\" (SEP).\n\n~\n\nI have a number of corrections and clarifications to make for what I said between 1:45:45 and 1:47:03.\n\nFirst, I am simply reporting what *seems* to me to be Feser's attitude toward his premises. I do not claim this is the only possible or rational interpretation of Feser's level of confidence or certainty. I cannot know Feser's own doxastic states, and I want to renounce any psychologizing of his doxastic states that I may have implied in what I said in this clip.\n\nSecond, there is evidence for my claims about Feser's thinking his premises are demonstrably certain. At the end of his Five Proofs, Feser writes:\n\n\"A third problem with [an objection previously considered] is that those who raise it often misunderstand what classical theists like Aquinas mean when they say that God’s existence can be “demonstrated”. What is meant is that *the conclusion that God exists follows with necessity or deductive validity from premises that are certain*, where the certainty of the premises can in turn be *shown via metaphysical analysis*. That entails that such a demonstration gives us knowledge that is more secure than what any scientific inference can give us (as “science” is generally understood today), in two respects. First, the inference is not a merely probabilistic one, nor an “argument to the best explanation” which appeals to considerations like parsimony, fit with existing background theory, and so forth, but where some alternative explanation might in principle be correct. Again, it is instead an attempt at a strict deduction to what follows necessarily from the premises.\n\n[...]\n\n[T]he argument can successfully be defended against *all* objections claiming to show that the conclusion does not really follow or *that the premises are doubtful*. Now, that has been accomplished in this book with respect to the proofs just mentioned, from all of which it follows that God exists.\" (p. 307) [Emphasis mine]\n\nThis shows rather forcefully Feser's attitude towards his arguments, and -- at the very least -- my interpretation in the clip is not an uncharitable one. Feser then ends his book with the following:\n\n\"Quod erat demonstrandum.\" (p. 307)\n\nDenotatively, this means 'that which was to be shown'. In fact, however, the connotation is extremely strong, often connoting a decisive proof or demonstration of something. Traditionally, it's placed at the end of formal mathematical proofs whose conclusions follow from indubitable premises and axioms. Its use in philosophy also traditionally signifies an indubitable, certain, demonstrable proof. Consider, for instance, Spinoza's Ethics (1677). Spinoza frequently used it at the end of his philosophical arguments in such a book. It's no coincidence, moreover, that the style and system of the book are, as Spinoza says, \"demonstrated in geometrical order\", with axioms and definitions followed by propositions.\n\nThird, regarding the 'real debate' quote. Here is Feser's full quote:\n\n\"That is a confident claim, I realize. But natural theology, historically, was a confident discipline. A long fine of thinkers from the beginnings of Western thought down to the present day... have affirmed that God’s existence can be rationally demonstrated by purely philosophical arguments. The aim of this book is to show that they were right, that what long was the mainstream position in Western thought ought to be the mainstream position again. The real debate is not between atheism and theism. The real debate is between theists of different stripes... and begins where natural theology leaves off. This book does not enter into, much less settle, that latter debate. I will be satisfied if it contributes to getting us back to the point from which the deepest questions can be addressed.\" (p. 15)\n\nAt the *very least*, it is not an uncharitable or wild interpretation of this passage that Feser thinks his arguments establish that the real debate is not between atheism [atheists] and theism [theists]. That is to say, his arguments at least purport to remove atheists from the real debate. This is how Oppy (and countless others) naturally read it. And Oppy's interpretation was accepted into publication in Religious Studies -- showing that it isn't a wildly implausible or uncharitable reading.\n\nFourth, it's undeniable that there is -- at least on occasion -- condescension and demonstrable certainty within Feser's attitudes toward at least some of his arguments. Simply pick up his \"The Last Superstition\" to confirm this (Feser himself advertises the book as very polemical).\n\n~\n\nBook: https://www.amazon.com/Majesty-Reason-Critical-Thinking-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B086G7KS52",
