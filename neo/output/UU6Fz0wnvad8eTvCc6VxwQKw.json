    "description": "00:00 - Introduction\n00:51 - Who were the last Greco-Roman pagans?\n07:49 - What was Europe's last pagan state?\n14:15 - Who were the very last pagans in Europe?\n21:50 - Conclusion\n\nWho were the last polytheists in Europe, who clung on latest to worshipping the old gods before Christianity conquered the continent?\n\nI approach this question in three different ways.\n\nFirst we explore the first Greco-Roman pagans, the last worshippers of those gods who so deeply defined classical civilization. The last of these pagans were incredibly late, and far later than I had anticipated.\n\nThen we go to the dark forests and frozen lakes of the Baltic to investigate Europe's last pagan state, a sprawling medieval empire which ultimately triumphed over its Christian foes.\n\nFinally we investigate the last polytheists of all, a journey which will take us to a frozen land of craggy peaks and reindeer herds, punctuated by chanting under the midnight sun.\n\nThis video is a great starting point for exploring the forgotten religious diversity of the great European continent.\n\nSources\n\n\nClassical paganism\n\nCatherine Nixey, The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World\n\nMani pagans - Romily J H.

    "description": "00:00 - Introduction\n00:46 - Netjerikhet / Djoser and Imhotep and their step pyramid at Saqqara\n03:56 - Sneferu's slip-ups - the Meidum Pyramid, the Bent Pyramid, the Red Pyramid\n08:04 - Khufu, Hemiunu, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the workmen's village of Gerget Khufu\n12:32 - The Decline of the Pyramid Age: Khafre, Unas and the Pyramid Texts\n15:13 - Conclusion\n\nFor centuries, people have asked: who really built the pyramids?\n\nWere they the work of lost technologies, superhuman engineers… or even aliens?\n\nIn this video, we explore the real human story behind the Great Pyramids of Egypt. It's a story of trial and error, ambition, mistakes, problem-solving, and thousands of ordinary people whose lives shaped one of history’s greatest monuments.\n\nIn part to debunk whacky conspiracy theories, this video looks at the actual evidence left behind by the pyramid builders themselves.\n\nSuch evidence includes everything from statues of architects, food scraps from the worker's village, the state of workmen's bones and the many failed attempts and botch-jobs littered throughout the pyramids' history.\n\nWe’ll follow the journey from Djoser’s first step pyramid, through Sneferu’s three chaotic attempts — the Meidum pyramid, the Bent Pyramid, and finally the Red Pyramid — and see how their mistakes paved the way for Khufu’s Great Pyramid. These monuments weren’t built by aliens or lost civilizations, but by thousands of skilled artisans, labourers, farmers, overseers, quarry workers, cooks, brewers, and administrators working together.\n\nThe pyramids endure not because they were made by perfect beings, but because they were made by humans: determined, ambitious, and sometimes hilariously flawed.\n\nIf you’re curious about:\n– how the pyramids were really built\n– what life was like for the workers\n– why the Egyptians changed from step pyramids to true pyramids\n– what the Old Kingdom kings were really like\n– or the human side of ancient Egypt…\n\n…this video is for you.\n\n#ancienthistory #ancientegypt #egypt #history #archaeology",

In this strange and witty dialogue between a master and his servant, every course of action is proposed and then rejected, leaving death as the only solution.\n\nBut is the text really about despair or is it a satire on power, inequality, and contradictory wisdom?\n\nAlong the way we’ll uncover:\n\nThe Babylonian roots of existential thought\n\nParallels with the Book of Job and Mesopotamian wisdom literature (Ludlul bel Nemeqi)\n\nConnections to modern philosophy, especially Albert Camus and The Myth of Sisyphus\n\nDoes the Dialogue of Pessimism contain the world’s earliest philosophy of meaninglessness  or the world’s first dark comedy?

Far from the “big-brained European ancestor” of Piltdown Man, this tiny skull revealed that humanity’s roots were far more humble - and far more African.\n\nThe Taung Child (Australopithecus africanus) walked upright, had a small brain, and died at the talons of an eagle. Its discovery forced us to rethink what it means to be human, and even today, we are still grappling with its implications.\n\nAlongside the Makapansgat pebble, a 3-million-year-old stone carried by Australopithecus because it looked like a face, the Taung fossil shows us that the line between “human” and “animal” is far blurrier than we once believed.\n\nThis video explores the story of the Taung Child, the Piltdown hoax, and how these fossils continue to challenge our assumptions about intelligence, sentience, and the kinship we share with the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\nIf we truly absorb the lessons of the Taung Child, it might just change how we see the world, and how we treat the animals we share it with.\n\nSources\n\nChoi, C.Q.

What does that tell us about their society? And how did society change in the build up to the coming of civilization in the Uruk period, one of the most decisive periods in the entirety of human history.\n\nThis is a journey that will take us from the savannahs of prehistory, to the buzzing salt-marshes of the Sumerian Gulf Coast to the furnaces and work-gangs of the world's first great city, Uruk.\n\n In learning about the invention of ugliness, we will not only deepen our knowledge of history, but reflect on the appearance of the modern world.\n\nThis isn't one to miss!\n\nSources\n\nGrossman and Hindman, 'Rethinking Halaf and Ubaid Animal Economies - Hunting and Herding at Tell Zeidan (Syria)', https://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_2013_num_39_2_5528\n\nOates, Joan, 'Prehistory and the Rise of Cities in Mesopotamia and Iran' in The Cambridge World Prehistory -  https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-world-prehistory/prehistory-and-the-rise-of-cities-in-mesopotamia-and-iran/C049EF0676EF7C77E916915259227303\n\nKriwacszeck, Paul, Babylon: Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilization, 2010.\n\nUbaid Culture in Mesoptoamia https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/ubaid-culture-mesopotamia#:~:text=Ubaid%20society%20appears%20to%20have,of%20trade%20and%20craft%20specialization.\n\n#history #mesopotamia #archaeology #pottery #ancienthistory",

Or, in a truly mind-blowing twist, could it be a stunning and extremely rare creature from the forests of Central Africa...\n\nIn this video, we dive into the interconnected ancient world, exploring the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire, trade routes stretching from Egypt to India, and the fascinating role of exotic animals in ancient courts.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - The Strange Carving at Persepolis\n01:08 - Ancient Persia - the most underrated civilisation\n03:19 - Possible Animal Candidates: Giraffe, Nilgai, or Okapi?\n09:35 - The Astonishing Implications of an Okapi in Persia.\n\nWas Persia more advanced than Greece?\nUnlike the way Hollywood depicts the Persian Empire (think 300's weird mutant hordes), history tells a different story. The Persians ruled the largest empire the world had ever seen, stretching from the Balkans to India, with sophisticated infrastructure, art, and trade networks.\n\nThe Okapi Theory: An Impossible Journey?\nThe okapi, a secretive giraffe relative from the Congo rainforest, was unknown to the Western world until 1901. But could it have made its way to 5th century BC Persepolis? The evidence is tantalizing.\n\nWhat does this tell us?\nThis ancient mystery highlights the astonishing global connections of the past. From the rainforests of Africa to the palaces of Iran, the ancient world was far more interconnected than we often imagine.\n\nJoin the discussion! What do YOU think this animal was?

    "description": "00:00 Introduction\n00:46 Background to the Harpist's Song of King Intef\n01:33 Why was Middle Kingdom literature skeptical?\n03:57 The Harpist's Song of King Intef\n07:46 A dialogue between a man and his ba\n11:18 Ozymandias\n13:41 Conclusion\n\nWe often visualise Ancient Egypt as deeply religious civilization, obsessed with the afterlife. They created pyramids, mummies, and elaborate burial rites all designed to secure eternal life. But did Ancient Egyptians doubt their own religion? Did they question the existence of an afterlife they could not see, hear, or touch?\n\nThe answer is a resounding YES.\n\nIn this video, we uncover two astonishing texts that prove ancient skepticism existed over 4,000 years ago. These texts challenge the idea that all Egyptians blindly believed in the afterlife, revealing a YOLO philosophy, which feels startlingly modern.\n\nWe will discuss -\n\nThe Harpist’s Song from the Tomb of King Intef - A Middle Kingdom lyric that dismisses the certainty of an afterlife and encourages people to enjoy life while they can.\n \nA Dialogue Between a Man and His Ba - A heart-wrenching debate between a man and his soul, where the man longs for death, but his soul warns him that the afterlife may not be what he expects.\n\nThese texts challenge the traditional image of Ancient Egypt as a land of unwavering faith. Just as in today’s world, people in ancient times grappled with doubt, fear, and the uncertainty of what happens after death.\n\nJoin us as we explore history’s earliest skeptics and uncover how their words still resonate today.\n\nSubscribe for more deep dives into ancient history, religion, and philosophy!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, give it a like and share your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSources\n\nToby Wilkinson, Writings from Ancient Egypt\n\n#AncientEgypt #History #Skepticism #Atheism #EgyptianMythology #Afterlife #Philosophy #Religion",

    "description": "What did the Anglo-Saxons think of the Romans? This video dives into the relationship between Roman Britain and the Anglo-Saxon era, exploring ancient ruins, Old English poetry, and the echoes of an empire long gone.\n\nWhen we imagine Roman times in Britain, we think of grandeur—heated bathhouses, mighty legions, and sophisticated cities. But after Rome’s fall, the Anglo-Saxons inherited a land of crumbling ruins. How did they interpret the vast, abandoned Roman baths and towering stone structures that dwarfed their wooden mead halls?\n\nThis question is beautifully answered in The Ruin, an Old English poem from the Exeter Book, which contemplates the decay of Aquae Sulis (modern Bath). Through the lens of this poem, we see how the Saxons both admired and mourned the lost wisdom of Rome.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\nThe transition from Roman rule to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms \n\nHow the Saxons preserved and interpreted Roman history and myth\n\nFranks Casket – A treasure trove of Latin and Germanic culture\n\nThe collapse of Roman civilization and the return to pre-Roman ways\n\nThe Ruin – A haunting poem about lost empires and the passage of time\n\nDustceawung – The Anglo-Saxon concept of meditating on impermanence\n\nPrimary sources\nCrossley-Holland, Kevin, The Anglo-Saxon World: An Anthology, Oxford World Classics, 2009.\n\nSecondary Sources\n\nEstes, Heidi, “Ruined Landscapes” in Anglo Saxon Literary Landscapes, https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt1zkjxx3.6 \n\nDoubleday, James, “The Ruin: Structure and Theme”, The Journal of English and Germanic Philology 1972, https://www.jstor.org/stable/27706243 \n\nWickham, Chris, The Inheritance of Rome: A History of Europe from 400 - 1000, 2009.\n\n#anglosaxon #oldenglish #romanempire #romanbritian #history",

    "description": "00:00 Introduction\n01:02 The background and causes of the English Civil War\n07:55 Charles I and the Divine Right of Kings\n09:36 The Trial of Charles I\n14:16 The Execution of Charles I\n\nThe execution of Charles I remains one of the most shocking, surprising, and seismic events in British history—and history as a whole.\n\nOn January 30th, 1649, King Charles I was executed after a fiery and perfunctory trial, marking an unprecedented and deeply unpopular moment. This act, driven by a small group of army officers and Parliamentary radicals, sent shockwaves through the nation and across Europe.\n\nCharles I had led the Royalists through the First and Second English Civil Wars, ultimately paying the price with his life. His reign had been defined by religious tensions, political strife, and bloodshed, culminating in this dramatic and bloody conclusion.\n\nYet, the most surprising and moving part of the execution of Charles I was after his execution speech, the king’s actual final words, recorded by the Bishop of London, William Juxon. On that bitterly cold January morning in 1649, Charles' final moments revealed a profound and lasting insight into his character and our innate humanity.\n\nIn this video, we explore the significance of Charles I’s final words, the history surrounding his execution, and how it continues to resonate in the story of the UK and beyond.\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nThe court proceedings and execution of Charles I - https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A40615.0001.001 \n\nSecondary Sources\nDe Lile, Leanda, The White King: Charles I, Traitor, Murderer, Martyr, 2018\n\n#history #englishcivilwar #kingcharles #historyfacts #execution #historystories",

On the 16th December 2024, this Monday, news broke of a Somerset Bronze Age massacre from the Mendip Hills. The victims, found in a limestone shaft in a cave system called Charterhouse Warren, reveal one of the most shockingly violent examples of cannibalism in prehistory.\n\nCharterhouse Warren is not unique. 3km away is a much older example of cannibalism, from Gough’s Cave, where people fashioned human skulls into cups. At a site called Herxheim in Germany, archaeologists unearthed the remains of up to 1000 people hacked up in ditches, their bones bearing clear marks of butchery and cooking.\n\nHow do we make sense of this? Why did people practice cannibalism, both in prehistory and history? And what does this say about human nature and ethics?\n\nJoin me as we explore all of these questions, and do subscribe for more ruminations about the past.\n\n#archaeology #prehistory #cannibalism #history #bronzeage #historystories \n\nSources\n\nBoulestin et al., Mass cannibalism in the Linear Pottery Culture at Herxheim (Palatinate, Germany).

In this detailed video essay, reviewing Tom Holland’s acclaimed book Dominion, I explore the deep impact of Christianity on Western and global history while ultimately concluding that Tom overestimates Christianity’s impact and ingenuity.\n\nTom Holland, co-host of The Rest is History podcast, makes a strong and thought-provoking case for Christianity being a major revolution, he goes too far. Can Christianity truly be responsible for every major moral and intellectual advance in the West over the last 1700 years?\n\nIn this video essay, I explore the history of Christianity through the themes of violence, slavery, charity, women, and science, while drawing comparisons with the planet’s other great civilisations like the Islamic world, India, and China. I argue that while Christianity has been undeniably influential, compassionate ideologies have flourished in all corners of the globe, and key advances in political equality owe much to the Enlightenment rather than Christianity alone.\n\nWhether you're a fan of The Rest is History, a generic past-oriented boffin or someone exploring the intersection of religion and morality, this video offers a sensationally fair-minded and titillatingly well-written perspective.\n\nTopics Covered:\nChristianity and compassion\nComparisons with Indian religions, Islam and Daoism.\nThe Enlightenment's role in human rights and equality\nChristianity and Slavery\nA critical take on Dominion by Tom Holland\n\nIf you enjoy discussions about history, religion, and philosophy, don’t forget to like, subscribe, and share your thoughts in the comments!\n\n#tomholland #therestishistory #christianity #history #videoessay #philosophy #religion #slavery \n\nSources\nAli, Omar, ‘Book Review: Dominion, by Tom Holland’, https://www.brownpundits.com/2020/07/26/book-review-dominion-by-tom-holland/ \n\nAugustine, City of God, trans Philip Schaff, https://web.archive.org/web/20130725190746/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AugCity.xml&images=images%2Fmodeng&data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&tag=public&part=all\n\nSara M.

    "description": "00:00 Introduction\n00:23 The Funny\n00:27 The Funniest Man in Ancient Egypt: Amasis II\n06:48 Herodotus gets trolled about source of the Nile.\n07:52 The lewd deserters\n08:36 Beans, beans the musical fruit\n10:16 The Profound\n10:38 Ancient Egyptian inventions\n11:28 The massive ancient world\n11:56 The migration of cranes\n12:24 The Karabel Relief\n13:50 The Nasamones and Congo pygmies\n15:58 Ancient Egypt's culture\n16:04 Nile flood versus Greek rainfall agriculture\n16:33 Nile delta fishermen and mosquito nets\n17:31 Ancient Egyptian dinner parties\n18:26 Herodotus on the Pyramids, the Labyrinth and colossal statues of Amenemhat III\n20:36 Egyptian folk scepticism towards power\n21:29 Rhampsinitus and the tomb robber\n24:21 Shebitku/Sethos and the field mice\n25:28 Psamtik III and the Persian conquest\n27:09 Conclusion\n\nThis is the second part of a two part investigation of Herodotus’ account of ancient Egypt. Part one is here - https://youtu.be/AaIVpXGHYmA?si=3Dcu5alusilbdgkJ \n\nWho knew that Ancient Egypt could be so funny and profound? Today we explore how Herodotus’ Histories gives us an extraordinary portrayal of the japester pharaoh Amasis II, and fills us with joy at many humorous stories from ancient Egyptian history and folklore.\n\nAs well as having a good belly laugh, we also explore the more wise, touching and insightful stories from Herodotus, including his thoughts on iconic landmarks like the Labyrinth and pyramids, as well as the incredible fact that he has access to information that stretches from Russia to the Congo.\n\nIt is bracing deep-dive into ancient Egyptian culture, history and religion and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nSources\nHerodotus, The Histories, trans.

You speak only of what you have lost.\n09:02 No one walks for a second time at the place where a lion has eaten a man.\n10:52 A dog said to his master: \"If my pleasure is of no importance to you, then my loss should not be either.\"\n11:23 Tell a lie and then tell the truth; it will be heard as a lie.\n12:38 Fate is a dog walking always behind a man.\n13:05 A dog which is played with turns into a puppy.\n14:03 Conclusion\n\nMesopotamia, the land of the two rivers, is the font of civilization. Here is where writing itself, the ability to convey information over miles and millennia, was invented, where monumental ziggurats were raised out of mud and clay, and where kings and councillors politicked and prayed while much of the rest of the world were hurling rocks at one another.\n\n(I jest, Stone Age hunter gatherers were actually very cool and sophisticated.)\n\nArguably the apogee of Mesopotamian culture and power comes with the Assyrians (the study of Mesopotamia is called Assyriology after all), and no Assyrian monarch was more formidable or learned than Ashurbanipal.\n\nThe Library of Ashurbanipal was one of his crowning achievements, dug out of modern Mosul in the 19th century, containing tens of thousands of cuneiform texts rich with myths like the Epic of Gilgamesh, which changed our understanding of the Bible for good.\n\nBut, most interesting to me, are the collections of Mesopotamian proverbs unearthed from the Library of Ashurbanipal, which are so relatable and resonant with the modern day. These truly do represent the oldest wisdom in world history.\n\nI hope you like this video and consider subscribing and supporting the channel, thanks!\n\n\nSources\n\nMark, Joshua J, Ashurbanipal’s Collection of Sumerian and Babylonian proverbs.

Part Two coming soon...\n\nWhat was Ancient Egypt like? It can be hard to know sometimes, as so many Ancient Egyptian sources are focused on the conquests of pharaohs or religious and funerary rituals. What about daily life? Folk customs and culture?\n\nEnter Herodotus, one of the most fascinating, shocking, outrageous and hilarious sources on Ancient Egypt, but also one of the best. Ancient Egyptian history would not be the same without Herodotus’ marvellous Histories - he isn’t called the Father of History for nothing. Herodotus gives us insights into Ancient Egyptian civilisation like no other.\n\nWhat he wrote about, from Ancient Egyptian religion, to festivals, battles, myths, daily life and customs, will make your jaw drop for its bizarreness and the immense colour with which he describes this long-dead civilisation. By untangling Ancient Egypt’s mysteries, secrets and obscurities, perhaps we can come to better understand our culture too.\n\nHerodotus and Ancient Egyptian culture are unpacked here by Matthew Chalmers, of The Liberator Youtube channel, who received a masters degree in Egyptology from the University of Cambridge and is passionate about history, philosophy and culture. \n\nPlease like, comment and subscribe, especially to get your hands on Part Two.\n\nSources\nBurkert, Walter, Greek Religion, trans.

In fact, the Minoans weren’t even Greeks, but ancestors of the shadowy Stone Age peoples of the Aegean, and as such their lineage spans back into the dense fog of prehistory.\n\nThe gifted craftsmen and artists of Minoan civilisation created many a masterwork. But one, in my opinion, stands above all others - and that’s the Pylos Combat Agate. A tiny, minute sealstone, a mere 3.6cm long, the level of detail on this object is plainly stunning.\n\nIn fact, it's downright mysterious. How was it made, how could such fine details be put into such hard stone 3500 years ago? What tools were used? Was magnification involved? Mystery upon mystery floats around this object - all of it complicated by the fact that it wasn’t discovered in ancient Minoan Crete at all, but on the Mycenaean Greek mainland, at Pylos. What was the relationships between Minoan and Mycenaean? Was it Minoan vs Mycenaean or were they buddies? We'll also explore the question - is Minoan Greek?\n\nIn this video I explore the spellbinding, ancient culture  of the Minoan civilisation through the prism of this extraordinary object. I invite you all to subscribe, and let's get a conversation started in the comments. Much love.\n\nSources\n\nHomer, The Iliad, Boox XI, Kline, A. S.

    "description": "00:00 - Introduction: Animal Life in Ancient Rome\n00:15 - Animals and the Colosseum: Gladiatorial Games\n02:27 - Modern-Day Animal Bloodsports\n02:54 - Roman Perspectives on Animals\n03:09 - Wolves in Roman Culture\n03:33 - The Role of Dogs in Roman Society\n04:42 - Anthropocentrism in Ancient Rome\n05:52 - Lions in the Arena: The Ultimate Symbol of Power\n07:38 - Romans Who Opposed Animal Suffering\n08:57 - Hypocrisy Then and Now: A Historical Perspective\n09:50 - Animal Suffering in Today’s World\n10:30 - Bloodsports vs. Animal Farming: Ethical Considerations\n11:35 - When Dying Elephants Made the Roman Mob Cry\n13:25 - Conclusion: Reflecting on Animal Rights\n\nWhen we think of the Romans, gladiatorial games and brutal Colosseum spectacles often come to mind, where countless animals were slaughtered. But was Roman society as heartless towards animals as we imagine? This video explores the nuanced views Romans held towards animals, their involvement in bloodsports, and the unexpected moments of compassion that sometimes surfaced.\n\nWe’ll also compare these ancient practices to modern-day animal cruelty and discuss how our attitudes towards animals have—or haven’t—evolved.

    "description": "00:00 - Introduction: Exploring History's Greatest Names\n00:40 - Xenophon: The Legendary Greek Historian and General\n08:28 - Mansa Musa: The Wealthiest Man Ever?\n11:31 - Pertinax: The Roman Emperor With an Abrupt Reign\n14:47 - Sheshonq I: The Pharaoh Who Conquered Jerusalem\n19:10 - Tiglath-Pileser III: The Assyrian Conqueror and Reformer\n\nHistory is filled with incredible figures, but some names stand out more than others. In this video, I dive into five of the most fascinating names from ancient history, from the Greek historian Xenophon to the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III. While my bias toward ancient history is clear, there’s a lot to appreciate about these historical figures - although honourable mentions must go to more modern folk like Manley Power and Engelbert Humperdinck.\n\nJoin the conversation in the comments—what are your favourite historical names, and why?
