    "description": "Goethe's novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, was Napoleon Bonaparte's favorite novel. In recent years it has become the subject of memes, and the \"sensitive young man\" archetype. How are we to understand this puzzling development? What is the connection between the Caesarist strongman and the hopeless lover? In this episode, we'll consider the historical background of the work: its inspiration in the story of Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, the \"fever\" that swept Europe following its publication, and its controversies. We'll analyze the novel and try to understand Goethe's character as something more than simply a victim of unrequited love. And we'll consider Napoleon's meeting with Goethe and their conversation about the story, as well as some of Goethe's comments about it in conversations with Eckermann.\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #goethe #faust #werther #napoleon #sensitiveyoungman",

According to Burke, Nietzsche's insights have proven incredibly valuable in this field, and by drawing on Nietzsche's conceptions of drive, we can improve our chances in making transformative life changes.

    "description": "Episode #122 of The Nietzsche Podcast. Part 2 of 3. Under the sign of the Vicious Circle, Nietzsche attempts to inaugurate a conspiracy. But how can this view of the Eternal Return - as part of his project of the revaluation - square with the \"high tonality of the soul\" in which it was first revealed? Pierre Klossowski argues, convincingly, that the Eternal Return makes all meaning and goal into an absurdity, offering a picture of a world in which nothing can be completed, and everything that is accomplished must be re-accomplished. Nietzsche's later use of the Eternal Return in order to fight gregarious values and win a victory on the side of the healthy impulses can only be a conscious deception. Following the \"prejudices of his sentiments\", Nietzsche forgets the inherent goallessness demanded by the Return, and seizes upon the powerful sign of the vicious circle, to pursue a great and arbitrary goal.\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy",

The valetudinary states that dominated Nietzsche's life are reinterpreted in a radical way, with Klossowski's assertion that Nietzsche oftentimes saw thought as a source of suffering, and sided with the \"attacks\" of his body against the conscious, rational agent. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy",

And yet, centrism remains a dirty word in online discourse, connoting a type of establishment position that favors the status quo. Pf Jung joins me to discuss his philosophy of \"radical enlightened centrism\", which opposes the status quo while drawing on ideas from both fringes. Also, a correction: at one point in the conversation I claim that Australia has a mandatory civil service, but this is actually incorrect. I got this confused because of a conversation I recalled between myself, an  Australian and a German, in which we talked about mandatory civil service (which Germany has) and mandatory voting (which Australia has), but Australia does not have mandatory civil service.\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ#nietzschephilosophy \n\n#philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #plato #socrates #kant #schopenhauer #rousseau #heraclitus #spinoza #pascal #epicurus #thucydides #montaigne",

We discuss Nietzsche's friendship with Jacob Burckhardt, and how Burckhardt's view of history can inform our understanding of Nietzsche's divergence from him. We also consider Goethe's four ages of intellectual culture, and Nietzsche's echo of Goethe in his history of European nihilism, and how he comes to differ from Goethe, Schopenhauer and all his influences in his proclamations about history, in which the Overman shall transcend the cyclical, unchanging stagnation of human history by changing the nature of man himself. Finally, we consider what the hazard of modern poetry means for us in the present day, what each figure's answer to this divorce between symbol & real means, whether they succeeded or not, and what we can learn from them. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #goethe #poetry #schiller #faust #science #philosophyofscience #aesthetics #martinluther",

Once unified in eucharist, the symbolic and the real are now separate spheres of the human mind, and while it initially seemed that art and science might benefit by this separation, in the long run, both have ended up poorer thereby. In this episode, the two-part finale of season five, we will discuss Luther & Zwingli, and their dispute about the holy communion; Goethe & Schiller and their argument about the difference between the idea and the experience; and Goethe's avoidance of tragedy and what this says about the \"hazard of modern poetry\".\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #goethe #poetry #schiller #faust #science #philosophyofscience #aesthetics #martinluther",

We also psychologically analyze the left and the right from the Nietzschean standpoint, consider how many of the alternatives are magical thinking, and finally discuss the history of revolutionary movements and how they always have to draw upon the past. \n\n00:00 Who is 1Dime?\n03:16 What Even Was Neoliberalism?\n07:08 Neoliberalism as a Zeitgeist\n10:22 Left-Wing and Right-Wing Variants of Neoliberalism\n16:38 Postmodernism and Its Critics\n25:14 The Material Basis of Social Progressivism\n41:00 Rethinking Left vs Right\n47:24 The Limits of Conservatism\n50:50 The Gender Political Divide\n01:08:50 The Geneology of “Wokeism”\n01:27:03 Capital and The State\n01:42:06 How Radical Change Historically happens\n02:04:17 Marcuse, Social Democracy, and the question of communism\n02:16:50 Nietzsche's Political Philosophy\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #ancientgreece #greece #greekphilosophy #plato #socrates #christianity #gnostics #gnostic #gnosis",

    "description": "The Nietzsche Podcast, episodes 85 and 86. This video was previously published in segments on Youtube, in which each individual Pre-Platonic philosopher was given their own video. On Spotify, it was published in the form of two longform episodes. I've decided to reissue the video as a supercut, combining the entirety of those episodes into one giant lecture on Nietzsche's interpretation of the Pre-Platonic philosophers. Enjoy! \n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #ancientphilosophy #greekphilosophy #heraclitus #thales #anaximander #anaxagoras #empedocles #parmenides #democritus \n\nPhilosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks is one of the more obscure texts in Friedrich Nietzsche’s corpus. There are many good reasons for this: it is unfinished, and ends abruptly; it was never published; and it concerns subject matter that is not as immediately accessible as Nietzsche’s more popular writings. You will not find his major concepts in this work – such as the will to power, or the critique of metaphysics - except insofar as those ideas appear in the background, inchoate, unnamed… not yet fully formed. In Nietzsche’s interpretation of the Pre-Platonic philosophers of Ancient Greece, we find the starting place for his later philosophical career. The inspiration for many of those great ideas, can arguably be found in his exegesis of these extraordinary figures from the Hellenic world, from the 6th to the 4th century BC. In this series we’ll consider Nietzsche’s view of Thales, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles & Democritus. Because the essay was unfinished, and ends abruptly at Anaxagoras, we will incorporate material from Nietzsche's lectures on the Pre-Platonic philosophers, and use this material exclusively for his interpretation for Empedocles and Democritus.

We also talked about Neal's personal journey through the Christian faith into his own idiosyncratic spirituality, and an attitude that he describes as a balance of Gnosticism & agnosticism; he views a life of Gnosis (knowing) as essentially a life of skepticism in which one demands to know for oneself and reject all inherited dogma.

    "description": "Watch me spend more time than the entire length of Abigail Thorn's video explaining why it is a superficial hit piece based on strained, bizarre arguments and outright false information. There are many \"creative omissions\" in Philosophy Tube's video, \"Was Nietzsche Woke?\": rather basic information about Nietzsche's life and his ideas is left out that would completely one's view of the information presented. In this rebuttal, we'll look at the statements in Nietzsche's own published works in Human, All Too Human (1878), Daybreak (1881), The Gay Science (1882), Beyond Good & Evil (1886) Ecce Homo (1888) & Twilight of Idols (1888) as well as selections from Nietzsche's letters, his essays, and unpublished notes assembled in Will to Power. Philosophy Tube's video relies almost entirely on secondary sources and clearly does not derive from a direct engagement with the actual texts. While I actually have read all of the primary source material, I also reference the following secondary sources in this video:\n\nThe Legend of the Anti-Christ: A History by Stephen J. Vicchio (2009)\n\nNietzsche, Philosopher, Psychologist, Antchrist by Walter Kaufmann (Fourth Edition, Princeton University Press, 1974)\n\nNietzsche's Women: Beyond the Whip by Carol Diethe (2013, De Gruyter)\n\nI was also informed in my study by the biographies provided by Krell & Bates, as well as Curtis Cate and the work of Charlie Huenemann. Stephen Hicks' book, Nietzsche and the Nazis, while I disagree with it on many points, was also helpful in elucidating the difference between Nietzsche's view of Christianity versus that of the Nazis. Also, Robert Solomon helped contextualize the common views around eugenics in 19th century Europe. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophytube #abigailthorn #woke",

This book begins with the first passage to contain the saying, \"God is dead\", and Nietzsche then uses the metaphor of \"the shadow of God\" to refer to the falsification of our understanding of reality as a result of thousands of years of metaphysical error. These errors may in fact be essential for life itself, but Nietzsche's project is to find a way to philosophize that penetrates beyond them. This is, paradoxically, an experiment with the \"will to truth\", a more sincere valuation of truth-in-itself than has ever before been risked, and at the same time an attempt to entangle philosophy with art, deception, feeling, subjectivity & physiology. \n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy",

Tolstoy poses the problem of art, the reason why art must justify itself. Criticizing the existing conceptions of art's value, he puts forward his own theory as to art as communicative, then attacks what he considers to be the self-absorbed art of the upper class and the counterfeit art that has captured European culture. Eventually, Tolstoy comes to the conclusion that true art is aimed at the Christian vision of the unification of man. This is the conclusion of the second leg of season five.\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #tolstoy #russianliterature #art #aesthetic #aesthetics",

    "description": "In this episode, we consider some of the philosophically insightful sections of Nietzsche's lectures on rhetoric & the Sophists. In particular, we examine the figure of Protagoras, of whom we have little information, but who is credited with establishing the Sophists as a philosophical school focused on rhetoric. The latter half of the episode concerns the Platonic dialogue named for Protagoras, the \"great speech\" of Protagoras contained within, and the somewhat puzzling dispute between Protagoras and Socrates on whether or not virtue can be taught. \n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #ancientphilosophy #greekphilosophy #protagoras #rhetoric #sophism #sophistry #sophist #plato #socrates",

    "description": "Creating a listicle of Nietzsche's ideas is always problematic, but thankfully Nietzsche occasionally provides us with one. In his notes, collected in Will to Power, Nietzsche records his \"Five Nos\": five ideas that he roundly rejects, and positions his philosophy as a struggle against. You will not find a more straightforward statement of Nietzsche's philosophy anywhere in his corpus. This passage remains fairly obscure, so join me in exploring this hidden gem that explains Nietzsche's philosophy in negative terms.  \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy",

We then discuss Anti-Oedipus and some of the core concepts, such as the Deleuzian reinterpretation of desire and the unconscious, and the body without organs. Then, as a tribute to the late, great David Lynch, we attempt a Deleuzian intepretation of Eraserhead, which of course is impossible, because both Deleuze and Lynch would agree that the interpretation of signs and symbols as a theater of the unconscious is always a misinterpretation; or, as Lynch puts it, the talking is all up there on the screen. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #davidlynch #eraserhead #antioedipus #oedipus #oedipuscomplex #deleuze #guattari #postmodernism #psychoanalysis #marx #marxism",

While I have addressed Jordan Peterson's misunderstandings of the \"God is dead\" aphorism, or his bungling of Nietzsche's view of truth, here we address one of his most often repeated distortions of Nietzsche's philosophy. According to Jordan, Nietzsche said we can create our own values, but, in fact, this is impossible.\n\nI break down Jordan's misreading into four sections: 1) Jordan doesn't understand what Nietzsche means by \"values\"; 2) Jordan doesn't understand what Nietzsche means by \"creating\" values, 3) Jordan's problems with the \"creation of values\" fail, largely due to these misunderstandings, 4) Values do not need to be created by the Overman. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #religion #christianity #philosophyofreligion #apologetics #atheism #debate #newtestament #greekphilosophy #carljung #jung #lexfridman #jordanpeterson",

While most think of alchemy as charlatanism, the promise to \"turn lead into gold\", this is far from the truth, and fails to grapple with the immense scientific, spiritual and cultural impact that alchemy has had on Western civilization. The psychologist Carl Jung was perhaps an unexpected figure to attempt to unriddle the symbols and imagery of the alchemical texts. Nevertheless, Carl Jung's volume, Psychology & Alchemy attempts to do just that, putting forward the idea that the alchemical texts are a treasure trove of psychic projection, and unconscious communication with the self. Join me for part one of our deep dive into the Jungian interpretation of alchemy, where we will learn the basic concepts of alchemy, the stages of the alchemical work, the alchemical correspondence thinking as regards the substances they worked with, and the psychological interpretation by which Jung makes sense of it all. \n\nEpisode art: Henry Waniek - Alchemy",

    "description": "Among the 19th century forerunners of existentialism are Friedrich Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard. While there is much that divides these two thinkers - one is atheist and the other a Christian, one seeks faith in Fate and the other in God - there are some curious similarities between these two great minds. Kierkegaard is a Christian against Christianity, critiquing the easy optimism or sordid resignation that passed for the Christian faith during his time. Kierkegaard was driven by a desire to become a missionary within Christendom, to make everything harder, and push the ordinary Christian to see faith a paradoxical struggle. The Christian is called to live an absurd life, with impossible hopes, out of the knowledge that nothing is impossible with God. In this episode we discuss Kierkegaard's life, the background of his ideas during the first authorship, and the analysis of Abraham in Fear & Trembling. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #kierkegaard #pascal #knightoffaith #leapoffaith   #pascalswager #religion #christianity #philosophyofreligion #apologetics #atheism #debate #existentialism",

    "description": "Cioran is notorious as the depressive philosopher par excellence. While figures such as Schopenhauer, Ligotti and Benatar have advanced logical arguments for their pessimistic outlook, Cioran's work is completely missing any such justification for his depressive feeling for life. Instead, his work is a lyrical outpouring of his inner life. In this episode we're taking a look at his first and most infamous book, \"On the Heights of Despair\", written during a bout of insomnia. As his translator, Zarifopol-Johnston argues, the book was an attempt to preserve Cioran's real self by \"killing\" a literary version of himself. We explore this interpretation of Cioran's work: that it is a means of coping with the madness and sorrow he finds within himself, through lyricism. \n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #atheism #pessimism #insomnia #cynicism #poetry",

    "description": "Mynaa's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@SharperPenImageConsulting\n\nA Halloween episode of Untimely Reflections. In this episode, Mynaa and I discuss The Repairer of Reputations, the first story in Robert Chambers' collection, The King in Yellow. Concepts in Chambers work contributed to the creation of the 'weird fiction' genre, and remain influential on media today - including the King in Yellow, the notion of a book that can drive you mad, and names such as Carcossa and the Hyades. We've delved into the topic of madness quite thoroughly on the podcast recently, so it only seemed fitting to continue the discussion through to the Halloween episode. Our topics include a broader discussion of madness and society, the unreliable narration of the protagonist, how his delusional fantasies reflect his political madness, the \"lethal chamber\" and its meaning, and much more. HAPPY HALLOWEEN!",

While I'd originally planned this for the second leg of the season, we're interrupting The Gay Science readthrough for the sake of the holiday, and because this story brings together many of the elements that we've discussed so far this season, namely: madness, the horror of science, the gulf between appearance and reality, and the Dionysian reaching out from ages past to disturb the modern world.

Donna Tartt's novel The Secret History is a loveletter to Greek tragedy, that begins with a dedication from Nietzsche and Plato. Central to the story is the concept of the Dionysian, and the attempt of the main characters to experience the Dionysian. Richard Papen's fatal flaw is his \"morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs\". His undying quest for a beautiful aesthetic life leads him to become part of an elite clique of students at Hampden College in Vermont. All six of them are under the sway of a charismatic and mysterious professor named Julian Morrow. After his friends accidentally kill someone while attempting a modern-day bacchanalia, Richard finds himself drawn into their crime, as he does everything he can to help them cover it up. This year becomes the defining event of Richard's life, and the story is his retelling of this 'secret history' of how he became what he is. We will examine the novel's use of truth and appearance, and how the Dionysian in this story serves as a \"pure fire of being\" which burns away the false appearances of the characters in order to unify their appearance and essence, and force each person's nature to draw its final consequences. \n\n #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #nietzsche #ancientgreece #greektragedy #greekdrama #tragedy #thebacchae #dionysus #dionysian #euripedes #donnatartt #thesecrethistory",

The Bacchae is a parennially popular Greek tragedy that portrays the coming of Dionysus to Greece. The Dionysian strikes Hellas like a wave of madness, and the play is full of miracles, illusions and other violations of the natural order. Often interpreted as a play about the conflict between religious experience and established dogma, or between the old order and the new, The Bacchae continues to fascinate because of the many layers of meaning that belie any easy analysis. We'll briefly discuss Nietzsche's opinion of Euripedes, and the ways in which Euripedes innovated the tragic form. Then we'll dive into the text and analyze the themes of the play. \n\n#historyofpsychology #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #nietzsche #ancientgreece #greektragedy #greekdrama #tragedy #thebacchae #dionysus #dionysian #euripedes",

Michel Foucault is one of the most influential philosophical thinkers of the 20th century. He remains a controversial figure, but undoubtedly he had a profound impact on the way we think about mental health and mental illness up to the present day. In this episode, we take a deep dive into his work, Madness & Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason, based on his dissertation. In this work, Foucault charts a history of how madness was perceived and experienced in the western world, exploring the changes in understanding of insanity from the Middles Ages, to the Renaissance, to the Classical period (17th & 18th centuries), to the 19th century creation of the mental asylum, and finally to the foundation of psychoanalysis. \n\n #historyofpsychology  #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #nietzsche #psychology #michelfoucault #foucault #postmodernism #neomarxism #criticaltheory #marxism #communism #capitalism #westerncivilization #theenlightenment #enlightenment #ageofreason #reason #insanity #madness #mentalhealth #mentalillness",

Aeschylus' Oresteia is the only extant trilogy of Greek drama. Alongside the Parthenon, the Oresteia is considered one of the two greatest 'monuments' to the Golden Age of Athens. In this trilogy - The Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides - Aeschylus dramatizes a rite of passage from savagery to civilization. Over the course of the narrative, the ancient law of blood is overcome by a new civic law, sanctioned by the gods. The word \"justice\" (Dikê) is used more often in the Oresteia than in any other Greek tragedy. Through these verses, we witness a struggle from the hazy, mysterious world of archaic Greece, governed by gods who behaved capriciously and unpredictably, into the clarity of civic life, in which human beings are empowered to make the contextual decisions of governance. \n\nMichael D.

Today we're examining the speech of Peter Sloterdijk, given on the centennial of Nietzsche's death, and transcribed into the essay entitled, \"Nietzsche Apostle\". Sloterdijk puts forward the theory that languages are fundamentally an instrument of 'group narcissism' by which the group recognizes one another and celebrates themselves. However, with the Reversal effected by St. Paul, the function of language becomes self-lowering rather than self-celebrating. Nietzsche's radical use of language is to reclaim the prideful and self-celebratory use of language, and provide us with a 'Fifth Gospel'.\n\n#historyofpsychology #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #nietzsche #sloterdijk #petersloterdijk #philosophyoflanguage #language #thomasjefferson",

Having witnessed the horror of the world wars, and the ongoing apocalyptic danger of the Cold War, Jung attempted to explain why it was that societies sometimes went mad. This is how Europe experienced the outbreak of The Great War: as mass insanity. Why would free people gravitate towards cult-like tyrannies? How could ordinarily moral and reasonable people perpetrate acts of unthinkable violence? And how could our constitutional democracies remain susceptible to these outbursts, if we are so committed to principles such as freedom and human dignity? For Jung, the only answer is self-knowledge, but that is the one thing that modern society is making impossible. \n\n#carljung #psychology #historyofpsychology #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #nietzsche #freud #sigmundfreud #jung #jungian #archetypes #theshadow #shadowwork #ww1 #thecoldwar",

He was considered for a Nobel Prize in literature about half a dozen times, through he never won. His works were adapted into films, which received international acclaim. He wrote modern No plays which were performed all over the world, in Europe and America. He is known for his provocative style, his romanticization of death and of warrior culture, and for his political radicalism. Mishima desired to return Japan to a pre-WWII samurai culture, ruled under the absolute authority of a divine emperor – and yet, his writing incorporates influences not only from traditional Japanese literature, but from writers from the west: Rilke, Wilde, Batailles, Klossowski, and, of course, Friedrich Nietzsche. From the time he was 19, when he first picked up a copy of Birth of Tragedy, Mishima had a lifelong fascination with Nietzsche. In this episode, we consider the major philosophical ideas in his combination of confession and criticism, Sun and Steel: the unity of art and action, the corrosive nature of words, and necessity of a 'beautiful death' to truly affirm one's existence. \n\n#mishima #yukiomishima #nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #historyofphilosophy #psychology #existentialism #samurai #japan #japanesephilosophy",

In this video, we discuss the comments Goethe that made about Hegel, and the numerous interactions between the two men: such as when Goethe invited Hegel over for lunch in order to see what his daughter-in-law would say about him. She concluded that he was either brilliant or a madman. Goethe also asserted that Hegelian philosophy and its ponderous, complex language was ruinous for one's writing style when adopted as an influence. This tension culminates in a conversation at a tea party when Hegel, who has a tendency to monopolize the conversation, is finally shut down by Goethe, who coins a wonderful phrase: \"Those made ill by dialectics would find healing in the study of nature.”\n\nBuy my book: https://www.blackrosewriting.com/biographymemoir/theritualmadnessofrockandroll\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #goethe #hegel #hegelianism #faust",

    "description": "THIS IS THE END: An Audio/Visual Collage\nA collection of moments: sounds and sights from the final Destroyer of Light tour. We traveled to the West Coast in April of 2024, for a three week run of shows. I captured our last time out on the road on video. Also included are some brief interviews with the band members, asking them to reflect on their past experiences.\n\nWe decided to end this band of 12 years sometime around the beginning of this year. Our bassist told us that he was moving to Atlanta, and the three original members gathered and discussed the future. Everyone was on the same page: rather than seek out a 5th person to play the bass, we would instead end the group. This is not a sad development, nor is there any drama or in-fighting involved. It's just that things have run their natural course and there is nowhere else to go from here. Our last tour was incredibly well-received and many people told us that we \"couldn't\" quit. On the contrary, it is best to go out now before we do really start to resent the project and the demands it makes on us. We all have other projects to focus on. Steve is in Temple of Love, Mike is in Cortege, Penny and I are in Slumbering in. It's time to let this thing die; and if it ever was of any real importance to anyone, I suppose we'll only find out once it is dead.\n\nThank you to all the bands we performed with: Viuda, Acid Spitter Traumatone, Sonolith, Psalm, Blast Flashes, Dark Crone, Qaalm, Gigantum, Empress, Bongfather, A.S.O.M.C., Die Like Gentlemen, Skulldozer, Breath, Dream Circuit, Suicide Forest, Ghorot, Shadow & Claw, Harvest of Ash, Octopus Tree, To be Astronauts, Gurney, Mold, Phantom Black, Sun & Stone, Medicine Horse, DustLord, Ghost Hollow, Direwolf, Pig Sticker, Pool, Lotus Lords, Sons of Gulliber, Temptress\n\nThank you to everyone special, who helped the tour happen: Brian Moy, Sara & Morgan, Tom & Russell, The Tannises, Jerry Colca, Kelsey Wilson, Carson (of Ghorot), Zach & Teresa, Kyle & Nico Williams, Book Ann, CT & our brothers in RWAKE, our brothers in Pallbearer, and everyone else who made our final run unbelievably amazing.

I attempt to distill the central message of Nietzsche's philosophy, and explain how this interpretative framework helps elucidate new angles to many of his important ideas. This episode is my final word on Nietzsche's philosophy, considered in its totality, as the podcast transitions away from our focus on the primary sources in Nietzsche and into interpretations of Nietzsche and Nietzsche-adjacent material. A love letter to the fans and a last hurrah into exegesizing Nietzsche, incorporating topics from throughout the season and with callbacks to the earliest episodes.

Each of these eight is paired with another thinker, a choice which is intentional and intended to reveal something about each pair. These eight are: Epicurus and Montaigne; Goethe and Spinoza; Plato and Rousseau; Pascal and Schopenhauer. In this episode, we will examine each one of these pairs in order to determine what similarities and what differences Nietzsche is attempting to elucidate in counterposing them. In comprehending each of these pairs, we can come to a full understanding of the early development of Nietzsche's thought, and see the way in which he was in dialogue with the ancients. The method of this passage hints at the way in which all of us can orm a relationship to Nietzsche in a similar fashion.

The completion of our analysis of Ecce Homo. In this episode, we consider Nietzsche's reviews of his own books, and argue that it presents a creative narrative of Nietzsche's life: Nietzsche as a tragic figure. Nietzsche mythologizes himself and the circumstances of his great works, dabbling in exaggerations and lacunae - but nevertheless providing an invaluable interpretation the significance of his entire career, and commentary on the development of his thought. With Nietzsche's comments, we can construe his life's work into an early period, an affirmative period that begins with his middle works and culminates with Zarathustra, and a critical period that characterizes his later work.",

The laboriousness of 'notebook psychology', in which one strains and squints and spies on reality, could not be further from this natural discernment based on what one is given. In this episode, we explore exactly what Nietzsche means by this distinction. Once again, it is tied in with his differentiation between the artistic and the theoretic. Through Twilight of Idols, Nietzsche remarks on psychology and his approach to it, suggests that it is found in literature, and suggests that some men who claim to be psychologists are really just head cases. Join me as we consider these ideas at a leisurely pace. \n\nEpisode art is Satan Resting on the Mountain by Gustave Dore.",

    "description": "Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nCarl Jung contributed to psychoanalysis in an important way, but that contribution to the field is inseparable from his engagement with Nietzsche. Jung derived a wealth of insights from Nietzsche’s work, and his psychological state that deteriorated into madness. Jung’s central hypothesis is that Nietzsche was possessed by an archetype. Such archetypal inflation was the result of a deep imbalance within Nietzsche’s psyche, springing from his rejection of the spiritual.\n\n#nietzsche #thenietzschepodcast #philosophy #philosophypodcast #psychoanalysis #psychology #carljung #jung",

Jung acquired the reputation of being a mystic, and put forward ideas that pushed the boundaries of psychoanalysis. This is a crash course in Jung’s most important ideas: projection, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. In this episode, we go in-depth on the major archetypes that Jung describes. These are subpersonalities that exist in every human unconsciousness, which will manifest insensibly in one’s desires, and find themselves projected by the subject into the external world.",

In his view, the French leftists who utilized Nietzsche’s work centered Nietzsche to their own detriment.

As Professor Hicks is a critic of postmodernism, I decided to ask him about Nietzsche's connection to postmodern thought. We discussed chapter one of Beyond Good and Evil. Is Nietzsche a postmodernist, and to what extent did he influence them? How do we explain the moral differences between Nietzsche and the postmodernists? We also discussed some topics related to objectivism and Ayn Rand. How does Nietzsche's epistemology and ethics differ from that of Ayn Rand? Professor Hicks articulates the case for the foundationalist view, and we finished the conversation by discussing the state of the academy as he sees it, and the future of philosophy.\n\n#philosophy #philosophypodcast #nietzsche #postmodernism #aynrand #individualism",

    "description": "Patreon: https://patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSigmund Freud (1856-1939) said of Nietzsche that he had \"more penetrating knowledge of himself than any man who ever lived or was likely to live.\" In spite of this, Freud always denied that Nietzsche was an influence on his thought, in spite of his multiple references to Nietzsche in his early work. While Freud certainly drew from Nietzsche's ideas, he was an original thinker in his own right, who followed on the same path of inquiry as Nietzsche, but with the tools of empirical research and the within the scientific spirit of psycho-analysis. Freud comes to believe that the driving force of human life is libido, a sexual impulse, and that the stages of psychosexual development determine the health or pathology of one's adult life. Central to his analysis of human psychology is the Oedipus Complex, and his notion that the superego emerges to suppress it. In this episode, we also discuss the Id (Unconsciousness), the faculty of repression, the concept of cathexis, and the meaning of dreams. In spite of the ways in which Freud has been marginalized in recent years, in his work we find an extraordinary thinker who built upon Nietzsche's ideas, and truly managed to change the entire paradigm of psychological thinking. \n\n#nietzsche #freud #freudian #psychology #psychoanalysis #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #oedipus #thenietzschepodcast",

    "description": "The Nietzsche Podcast, episode 88, \"The Case for the Crucified\".\n\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\nAmong Nietzsche's critics, René Girard is perhaps unique. Girard's understanding of human civilization and the origins of human culture is that it is based on ritual, collective violence against a scapegoated individual - and he argues that Nietzsche is one of the only thinkers hitherto who understood this. Nietzsche's famous formula - Dionysus versus the Crucified - is the title of Girard's critical essay on Nietzsche. He does not quibble with Nietzsche's framing of the situation, but rather with Nietzsche's conclusions. While Nietzsche takes up for the side of Dionysus, Girard stands on the side of the Crucified, arguing that Nietzsche was fundamentally wrong to lament the ascendance of Christianity and to yearn for a return to the Dionysian. In the course of Nietzsche's defense of Dionysus, he put forward moral theories that were \"untenable\", and become increasingly \"inhuman\". Among the many commenters of Nietzsche, both disciples and critics, it is rare to find a figure like Girard, who recognizes Nietzsche's brilliance, but totally condemns his legacy. Join me today to learn about the life of Rene Girard, his theories of mimetic desire and scapegoating, and the impassioned case he puts forward for The Crucified. \n\n#renegirard #girard #nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #historyofphilosophy #greekphilosophy #frenchphilosophy #christianity #atheism #religion #religiousphilosophy",

Not only does this fragment contain one of my favorite quotations of Nietzsche's, it represents his continual grappling with the meaning of Ancient Greek culture. In particular, we discuss the importance of \"relations of tension\" in Nietzsche's earlier work: art versus science, culture versus the state, history versus forgetting, and of course, science and wisdom. Both are drives to knowledge, and the tension between them created philosophy in the tragic age of the Hellenes. Science is characterized by logical, objective, specialized knowledge, whereas Wisdom is defined by Nietzsche as a tendency for illogical generalization, leaping to one's ultimate goal, and an artistic desire to reflect the world in one's own mirror.",

It was also the 6th episode of The Nietzsche Podcast. It has never before been uploaded to Youtube, and I decided to make it a video with visual elements. In retrospect, there are some rough edges to this episode, and some things I might have done differently. Nevertheless, I think it remains a solid effort in conveying the full nuances of how Nietzsche regarded Socrates. It was not hatred, nor unqualified admiration. Nietzsche criticized Socrates, and saw him as a sign of society’s decline, and yet he also sees himself in the image of Socrates. \n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=5nTQubi9QU-HDP8pNzEKaQ\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\n#nietzsche #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #socrates #greekmythology #greekphilosophy",

For the last nine years of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s life, Johann Peter Eckermann journaled about their conversations together. Goethe was a celebrity at the time, and destined to be remembered as perhaps the greatest writer of the German language, certainly of the 19th century. Eckermann, on the other hand, was a farmboy with a talent for copying - whether it was the artwork of Ramberg or the poetic style of Korner. When he met Goethe, who was in his seventies at the time, the young Eckermann looked up to him as the greatest of poets, and wanted nothing more than to record all of his wonderful memories with Goethe. In this work we find no narrative arc or rigorous structure, but simply a series of thoughts and feelings. It is a portrait of Goethe rather than a story about him, and offers a fascinating view into a different time and place.",

But in sharp contrast with thinkers such as Pascal, Spinoza's arguments for God are crafted with an attempt of logical precision. In fact, Spinoza structures his arguments as geometric proofs, and considers the only serious philosophy to be a truly mathematized philosophy. In his Ethics, Spinoza gives us a comprehensive system that describes God, Nature, everything. \nNietzsche says of Spinoza, \"I have a precursor! And what a precursor!\" While he was critical of Spinoza, Nietzsche acknowledged the ideas of Spinoza as profoundly influential on his thought. And yet, Spinoza's work remains famously difficult. Where he fits in to the Western philosophical canon is not readily apparent. Rarely is he portrayed as a great opponent of any one philosopher or school, and it seems that he lacks true antipodes. He is grouped among the three great rationalists, along with Descartes and Leibniz - even though these three come to radically different metaphysical conclusions, and bear little resemblance to one another aside from this one classification of their epistemological stance. And since Spinoza's philosophy is so voluminous, its ideas interrelated and comprehensive, approaching Spinoza and having some idea of where he stands within the discourse is difficult for the average reader. In this episode, we'll consider Spinoza's life and work, and then consider the ways in which his life parallels Nietzsche, and the ways in which his life influenced Nietzsche. \n\nEpisode Art: Samuel Hirszenberg - Excommunicated Spinoza",

At a glance, there is a wide gulf that separates the two, and seems to place them at irreconcilable odds. Pascal was a devout Christian, whose philosophical works concern the Christian faith: his most famous argument is the wager, which is a kind of apologetic device for bringing people into the faith. Nietzsche, on the other hand, carries out a philosophical project which is anti-Christian. He says he has no taste for faith in God, and that this faith is an indelicacy among thinkers. \nToday, we will examine Pascal's life, and the basics of his philosophy. Then, we will compare these two malcontents of the Enlightenment. Both question the supremacy of human reason, and offer an alternative to the materialistic concerns of a secular society. Both were men afflicted with ill health, and who struggled with mental illness. But they come to completely contrasting views in their assessment of life. In spite of this, there are ways in which Pascal's influence may have lasting importance for understanding Nietzsche. In Daybreak, Pascal is a stand-in for Christian hatred of mankind, who may have shaped Nietzsche's psychological analysis of Christianity. And in the eternal recurrence, we arguably find a variation on Pascal's Wager. While Pascal urges us to bet on God, Nietzsche's invitation is to bet on the world. \n“The Only Logical Christian”: Nietzsche’s Critique of Pascal by Brendan Donnellan, available on JSTOR: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469656557_oflaherty.12?seq=10",

The personal seal of Montaigne read, “What do I know?” For Montaigne, doubting was no less pleasing than knowing, and he exemplified the philosopher’s proclivity to inquire about every proposition. In his work we find the forerunner of not only skepticism, but Descartes’ methodology of doubt and empiricist bent of Bacon. He is the inventor of the essay, a man who called his own mind “wandering and diverse”, and who wrote candidly about life, ethics, and the classics. He is a man of contradictions, who disparaged book-learning but whose works are abundant with quotations. In this episode, we’ll consider his essays, Of the Education of Children, Defense of Raymond Sebond, Of Friendship, and That Philosophy is to Learn to Die, as well as take a brief peek into a handful of others. Join me in exploring the man Saint-Beauve called, “the wisest Frenchman who ever lived.”",

    "description": "In this second part of our exploration of Deleuze, we go straight into the Deleuzian understanding of ressentiment, and the significance of Nietzsche's distinction between ressentiment and the bad conscience. Deleuze's interpretation is predominantly psychological/physiological, and he sees the origins of ressentiment in the \"inverted image\" produced by reactive forces. Ressentiment therefore does not emerge from a historical power relationship, but from the disruption, degeneration or failures of the active force of memory to regulate the reactive consciousness and unconsciousness. Deleuze describes four forms of nihilism in Nietzsche: negative, reactive, passive and active, and we'll examine how they progress and relate to one another. Towards the end of the talk, we'll consider the camel, lion and child but with fresh eyes, given all that Deleuze has established. Of chief concern is how the triumph of reactive forces can be reversed, and the great becoming-reactive that characterizes human history turned into a becoming-active. This episode will not make much sense unless you've listened to the first part, in episode #79, as the concepts contained here depend on an understanding of active and reactive, sense and value, genealogy, and differential metaphysics, all of which are covered in that episode.",

Andrei Georgescu is an old friend of the show. He's a writer, a graphic designer, and a podcaster. A few months ago, he published an essay called, \"Seedless Flowers: Artificial Intelligence and Creativity Fetishism\", in which he analyzes the public reaction to art created by artificial intelligence, and the popular prejudices about creativity. Artists tend to believe that creativity is something which has to come from a being with a soul, treating it as a magical happening that is somehow beyond the material reality. A.I. art challenges that viewpoint, demonstrating the possibility of creativity coming from a collection of metal and wires. We discuss the \"ugly duckling\" theory of art, in which we value the effort that went into the piece over the final product or the quality of the piece. Such ideas compel us to dismiss beautiful works that were produced or aided by artificial intelligence, while holding up sub-par works as 'true art'. Our conversation about art takes us into my theories about art as communication, the origins of linguistic communication, the possibility of mapping the logical structures of languages. Towards the end of the episode, we take a look at the passage of Nietzsche's from The Gay Science, entitled, \"The Genius of the Species\", and argue over the importance of consciousness.\n\nEpisode art: Prayer by Andrei Georgescu",

In this episode, we're going to consider Deleuze's work, Nietzsche and Philosophy. In the words of Deleuze, the opposition to Hegel runs through the entirety of Nietzsche's work as its cutting edge. Nietzsche's philosophy is truly 'against the dialectic': as Nietzsche's work is perspectival and pluralistic, which represents the only significant challenge to the dialectical mode of thought. In contrast to dialectical labor and seriousness, Nietzsche's way of thinking affirms difference. Nietzsche asserts that being is not premised on negation, but affirmation, in which each force asserts its difference and enjoys that difference. In Deleuze, we find a new systemization of Nietzsche, in which Nietzsche's critique of morality, religion and the sciences can be reconceptualized as part of a struggle on Nietzsche's part against the triumph of reactive forces. Deleuze offers us a new language for discussing and understanding Nietzsche's work, and a radical re-evaluation of the eternal recurrence and the will to power. In this first part of our two-part series on Deleuze, we're going to consider Nietzsche's anti-Hegelianism, Deleuze's interpretation of sense, value & genealogy, the concepts of active and reactive, Nietzsche's typology, the metaphor the dicethrow, and the eternal return considered as a Nietzschean theory of time.",

In this episode, we’ll break down Hegel’s phenomenology, the dialectic, and the Hegelian understanding of desire. Our concrete entrypoint into the thought of Hegel is his famous chapter, The Master-Slave Dialectic. Deleuze argued that Nietzsche’s work constitutes a rejection of Hegel: his master and slave morality can be read as a direct rebuke to Hegel’s interpretation of this very same power relation. In order to prepare for our reading of Deleuze, we’re going to first tangle with Hegel on his own terms, and understand the very different way in which he approaches the questions of consciousness, morality and perspective. In researching this episode, Nathan Widder’s lectures on Hegel and Deleuze were very helpful, as was Justin Burke’s lecture on Hegel.",

Pirsig, like Nietzsche, saw himself as a modern-day Sophist, and part of his work was the rescue of the Sophistic school from the ill repute visited upon them by the Socratics. Perhaps more expansively, Pirsig devotes his philosophical work to the question, “What is quality?”, drawing on the Greek concept of arete, or excellence. His philosophical ideas do not come to us through a dispassionate treatise, however, but through an autobiographical novel. Pirsig was treated with electroshock therapy, leaving him with a new personality, and the feeling that the person he once was is dead: he merely happens to carry the blurry memories of another man. While on a motorcycle trip with his son, Pirsig struggles to unify the dichotomy between classical and romantic, between substance and form, between the two personalities within himself, and between himself and his son. This work remains one of the most important philosophical contributions to American literature in the 20th century, and hopefully today I can show all of you why this work of “pop philosophy” is one of my favorite books, and one to which I regularly return.",

Similarly to Socrates, Nietzsche gives a defense of himself and his career: a defense against being “mistaken”, or “misunderstood”. Like Socrates, who came with a special mission for Athens, Nietzsche comes with the greatest demand ever made of mankind. Central to our analysis is the physiologism of Nietzsche, and the rejection of idealism in favor of brute reality. The physiological is reinterpreted as the root cause of the psychological, and Nietzsche uses his life as the basis and the chief example of how the body determines who one is fated to become. Nietzsche expresses a profound gratitude even for his illness: that which allowed him to gain a subtler eye, to overcome pity, to recognize pathologies.",

In a society that distrusted irony and regarded it as a form of dishonesty, Socrates uses the art of persuasion in a manner that is anti-persuasive: a brilliant irony that few of his judges would have understood, and resented if they had. While Nietzsche’s later period is characterized by savage criticism of Socrates, Nietzsche describes Socrates as a heroic conqueror of death, in his lectures at Basel. Today we’re going to dissect the rhetoric, the irony, and the deeper significance of Socrates’ famous defense at his trial: the act of commitment to virtue in spite of the consequences, in defiance of the conventions of society and the sentiments of the majority.

In the course of this biography, using Nietzsche as our concrete example, we discuss the abstract meaning of the Camel, the Lion & the Child, and where I see these transformations appearing in the course of Nietzsche's life and thought. We've covered Nietzsche's biography in many previous episodes, often focusing in on a particular time or event in Nietzsche's life: Nietzsche's wandering throughout Europe (episode 2), the headstone he bought for his father (episode 4), the departure of academia and break with his friends (episode 24), the complex relationship with Wagner (episodes 36-37). Rather than examining any one part of his biography in granular detail, we're going to try and take in the entire picture, and see to what degree we can say that the Camel, the Lion & the Child are stages in Nietzsche's own story. Central to this analysis is Nietzsche's great struggle with the \"problem of life\", as put forward by Christianity, Schopenhauer, and the Socratics. Their solutions always incline towards a rejection of our nature and the submission of life to reason, virtue, or asceticism. Nietzsche's long quest is to discover an affirmation of life and desire, in contrast to the need to 'redeem' life from suffering. This mirrors his long struggle with an illness that tormented him throughout his life. Nietzsche's project culminates not in a condemnation of life on these grounds, but in his embrace of a life of agony.",

While this was another short run, a short jaunt with Slumbering Sun proceeded it by a single day - meaning that after I returned home from a week of shows in North Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, I departed for a day's long drive 24 hours later. The road took us through Mississippi, where we stayed with a very old friend and former bandmate of mine, who moved there from Austin - we saw many old friends on this tour, people who we hadn't seen for years, or who we only encounter when we travel to the Southeast. Then, six shows - most of which were successful, two of which were incredible, and one of which was a disappointment. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful time overall, and faced no major pitfalls, no broken sideview mirrors, no catastrophic engine failure. While I wasn't planning on compiling another such video for this tour, it happened automatically. Oftentimes, I saw something unusual or funny and simply started filming. This was the result. As per usual, it is made up of shorter clips, and very little forethought went into the overall structure or \"narrative\". In some sense, these videos just assemble themselves. \n\nA WARM THANKS TO: \n\nCain & Scarlett, Dwayne Jones, Sam Stolte, Kelly Hester of Kelly's Death Pickles, Richard Britto, Amos Rifkin, Ian & Ale, Fuzzstock, Boggs Social Club, The Goat, The Square Mug, Born Free Pub, Loosey's, Will's Pub, Smoke Mountain, Gnarcoosee, Dirtwitch, Captive Frame, Gauchais, Thunderclap, Antagonizer, The Hound, The Pinx, Buzzards of Fuzz, Rae and the Ragdolls, Black Cat Rising, Turbo Gatto, Mamma Bear, Demiser, Ares Kingdom, Deceased...",

Language facilitates the “abbreviation” of the most common sentiments and experiences, which is part of the process of joining a people together as one. The person whose experiences, thoughts or feelings are individual & peculiar will necessarily find himself unable to communicate them to others, and will be thrust into solitude. Much of the final aphorisms concern this eternal struggle between the rule and the exception, one of the themes of the work. Nietzsche ultimately muses that even the precious, wicked thoughts he has offered us throughout the work are but a pale imitation of the thoughts during their spring: for all thoughts are events, fleeting experiences, a physiological process within a living being. All the philosopher can do is catalogue their aftermath, or display the frozen remnants that linger in their memory. This section also contains multiple remarks on pity, and the prose poem, “The Genius of the Heart”. An exegesis of this poem can be found in episode 39.\n\nEpisode art: Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian (detail)",

    "description": "The first half of the final chapter, “What is Noble”. We cover the concepts of the order of rank, pathos of distance, the origins of civilization and morality. The master/slave morality is formally introduced, and Nietzsche gives several remarks supporting his aristocratic radicalism. But, shortly thereafter, he pivots and begins describing nobility and plebeianism as states of the soul rather than a matter of inheritance. Nietzsche challenges us to overcome the simplicity of Rousseau’s view of nature, or the Lockean/Kantian optimism about civilization. In Nietzsche's words, truth is hard - and whatever our idealism, we should be honest with ourselves, at least up to the point of admitting what the essence of life truly is: in his estimation, will to power.

This chapter is of particular importance for understanding Nietzsche’s reconceptualization of the philosopher, and how such a figure stands in relation to the academic. The philosopher’s essential character is not that he employs reason, but that he exercises the value-creating power of mankind, whereas the scholar is merely a “philosophical laborer” who exists in service of the dominant values structure. Nietzsche critiques the modern worldview of positivism (“scientism“) for its misunderstanding of the primacy of values, leading to its failure to examine its underlying value judgments.

    "description": "AN AUDIOVISUAL COLLAGE\n\nsleepy summer 2023\n12 Shows / in Six states / with 25 Artists / Average Temperatures of 1000 F \n\nThis year, we set out on our first tour as Slumbering Sun. I was incredibly nervous, as underground touring can be an emotional rollercoaster, and I had no idea what to expect. While Destroyer of Light's first tour was relatively successful, all things considered, we did a lot of things wrong on our first outings. I like to think I've learned from earlier mistakes and pitfalls, and that I've become pretty adept at rolling with the punches as they land. I was prepared for financial disaster. Still, it's a lot harder when it's your baby, your booking, your money backing the project. It felt like we had to make it work, so we could prove to ourselves that the momentum shown by this new project was real. \n\nThe love and support we received was unbelievable. We attained a kind of success on a first outing that I couldn't have ever dreamed of. People regularly used the terms like \"beautiful\" and \"gorgeous\" to describe our music. We've taken to calling ourselves \"post metal\", or \"post doom\" for this very reason. Some said it was life-changing, some told us they cried. \n\nWe got a write-up in a local Tulsa culture column on the show there, where the author in attendance had this to say:\n\n'Vocalist James Clarke possesses a haunting croon reminiscent of Ozzy and Peter Steele of Type-O-Negative. The labyrinthian architecture of their song structures slowly revealed increasing ingenuity, but remained a solid foundation for heads to bang upon. Hearing the morose yet lush melodics was like stepping right into the oils of “Et in Arcadia Ego.” Their lone cover song was a funeral dirge mashup of Neil Young’s “My My Hey Hey,” and Black Sabbath’s “Into The Void,” and was a fractal of their overall aesthetic.'\n\nWe were supported by fellow musicians, family, and very good friends on this run. Without them, our success would have been impossible. These are people who fed us, housed us, and willingly gave us their cut of the door take. These are the other bands who brought their fans and friends and made us feel welcome in their city. And these are the artists and craftsmen who helped us realize our vision. \n\nInfinite love.

There were technical difficulties that have since been resolved. We’re back on track and next week’s release will be on Tuesday again. The ascetic values of the saint are premised on self-denial. It was this self-denial that caused the saint to become a great mystery, who stood in judgment of the powerful people of the world. They suspected that the saint knew something they didn’t, as this miraculous being who transformed from evil to good. Good became synonymous with the otherworldly and the unsensual, and this image became most powerful in the hands of the extraordinary person who has turned out a failure in life. The person with great creative potential who is taken over by the power of self-denial becomes the most dangerous among the ascetics, and over centuries of this religious neurosis dominating the European mind, the result has been the modern man.\n\nEpisode art - Anguliamala humbled before the Buddha\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #history #historyofphilosophy",

True free spiritedness represents a fundamental commitment to hardness and independence of spirit. This makes the philosopher opposite the scholar in terms of his virtues. This total individuality necessitates that there are some truths that are inexpressible or peculiar to the point that they cannot be shared: they must be ”masked”. We finish by looking at the first two sections of part three, “What is Religious”. We consider how N’s method so far brings him to regard religion as another field of study regarding the human soul (its knowledge and conscience), and how this section is an application of his psychological method. He considers what is meant by the religious pathology as part of his ongoing critique of Christianity. \n\nEpisode art: Henri Lievens - The Wild Hunt of Odin\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #thenietzschepodcast #historyofphilosophy #morality #psychology",

Nietzsche reconceptualizes thinking and willing as inseparable, and declares psychology to be the route to the deepest questions.

John and I gush over our mutual love of Tarantino, and his pick for his favorite among Tarantino's films may surprise you. Other topics include the best ways to show rather than tell about a character's inner turmoil, the theory of drives and how it plays out in John's stories, and what it is that makes Stephen King so damn good. I included quite a bit of banter at the end where we continued talking long after I'd planned on ending the conversation, but most of it was interesting and genuine so I left it in. John's overarching commitment in his work is to realism: in honestly portraying the brute reality as he sees it, without trying to sugarcoat or hide the truth. So glad to have had John on the show, and we can add him to a number of interesting characters with very different life paths who have joined us on Untimely Reflections. \n\nJohn's website: https://johnhuntfiction.ca/ \n\nJohn on Amazon: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/John-Hunt/author/B01MUHIIOA?ref=ap_rdr&store_ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true John on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@johnhuntfiction2537\n\nEpisode art: Caspar David Friedrich - An Artist In His Studio Contemplating A Moonlit Street From His Opened Window\n\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #horror #literature #thenietzschepodcast #philosophypodcast",

    "description": "RSS: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/RF2bpbRnEAb\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nUntimely Reflections #18 of The Nietzsche Podcast\n\nIn this conversation, my friend Quinn and I dare to journey into one of the most labyrinthine passages ever to come from Nietzsche's hand: the 1873 fragment, Zeitatomenlehre, usually translated as the \"Time-Atom\" or \"Time-Atomism\" Fragment. Providing a description of this passage in any concise way will be about as impossible as summarizing this conversation, and our interpretations of it, but at the very least, I will offer that this essay is a radical re-evaluation of how we could consider reality, in which the underlying spatial nature of our thought is challenged. Nietzsche follows philosophically in the footsteps of the Pre-Platonic figures, and makes a daring attempt at a metaphysics so outlandish that there is nothing else like it in western thought. We approached this conversation knowing that figuring out the passage is very difficult, and decided to work through it as best as possible - although I think Quinn had it down more solidly than I did. While this conversation bears no relation to the overarching topic of this season, that's perfectly fine, since I've wanted to do this episode for a long time, and it makes sense for it to be \"out of time\" or \"out of tempo\" with the rest of the season anyway. I would actually put a warning label on this conversation to suggest that if you're new to the podcast, this might be too much to follow. For previous episodes that may help in approaching this one, check out episode 5 in season one and episodes 45 & 46 in season two. \n\n#philosophy #philosophypodcast #nietzsche #thenietzschepodcast #historyofphilosophy #metaphysics",

    "title": "Philosophers of the Future - Nietzsche Podcast Season Three Finale",
    "description": "In this episode, I attempt to sum up the relevance of Nietzsche's political insights to the modern day, insofar as his challenge to our values becomes an entrypoint for us to begin the work of revaluating our values. In this piece, I argue that Nietzsche's goal for his readership is for them to find freedom in the unity of their beliefs and actions, and acceptance of humanity and the natural world for what they are rather than what we'd like them to be. Nietzsche invites us to a trusting acceptance of all that is necessary in the world, such that we may not live with the burden of having to morally condemn mankind, nor the human condition. He stands forever with the realism of Thucydides against Plato. Whether accept Nietzsche's prescriptive statements or not is irrelevant to whether we have taken seriously his contentions in the realm of values, and whether we can discover any motivating principles for humanity outside of the will to power. Nietzsche's challenge to us spurs us to consider what consequences such a shift in values might entail. At the end, we return to some of the concepts from the very beginning of the podcast, and examine how Nietzsche's view of politics and history is another manifestation of this same 'world acceptance' (or, 'amor fati') that is demanded by the abolition of the true world. Or, how Nietzsche characterizes his free spirits as 'tempters and attempters', those who experiment with the strange, wicked, and questionable questions. This is the path he lays out for the philosophers of the future, and as we are now in the time when the crisis of nihilism seems to be coming to a head, I assert that we ourselves are the philosophers he was speaking to. However you answer these questions of value, Nietzsche demands that we follow our own path, and adopt only those truths to which we have a right. The philosophers of the future will therefore be accustomed to solitude, and to a sense of distance from his fellow men. We are the types who enjoy \"wandering in forbidden country\", which is the way Nietzsche defines his understanding of philosophy in Ecce Homo. Every philosopher who takes it on themselves to be a creator and self-legislator is already their own revaluation of values. The time is noon.\n\nThank you to everyone for supporting the podcast! Here's to a wonderful season three! A very special thank you to all of my patrons. I wish to express the deepest love and gratitude to you, and my delight that so many have connected in such a deep way with the podcast.

    "title": "The History of European Nihilism (The Nietzsche Podcast #71)",
    "description": "What does eternal recurrence mean in the historical sense? Nietzsche invites us to explore that question in his raising of the Problem of Science, and the notion of conflict as central to life. Today, in the penultimate episode of the season, we'll take a look into a section from Will to Power called \"The History of European Nihilism\", in which Nietzsche takes on the history of Europe from the perspective of his cultural/moral analysis, and charts the history of the descent into materialism as it played out in Enlightenment Europe. In his Pre-Platonic lectures, Nietzsche suggests a parallel between the project of Greek philosophy, and the progression that played out in the centuries of the Enlightenment. The Pre-Platonic Greeks experimented with materialist philosophy, eventually culminating in the atomism of Democritus and the arrival of Socrates, the ultimate logician - soon, the values of their traditions, and their long-held superstitions came to be questionable. The values of the society were undermined, and a crisis of nihilism set it. Nietzsche believes that this played out over the course of several centuries in Europe: in the form of the Reformation, then the scientific dawning of the Enlightenment rationalism with Descartes at the forefront. He comments on many of the figures we have covered this season, such as Kant, Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and others, as manifestations of the spirit of their times, who signified shifts or turning points in the European psyche. He reimagines Kant as a sentimentalist towards the concept of duty, a twin spirit with the moralistic Rousseau, who rebelled against the self-legislating rationalism of the 17th century and instead opted to be guided by feeling. \nNow, in Nietzsche's 19th century, he sees the ascendance of a more honest yet more gloomy period of European thought. The animalian in man is fully uncovered and embraced, and man becomes understood as a historical creature. This has dire consequences, bringing on the dissolution of society and the disbelief in all past metaphysical and moral comforts. But, as a result, the European psyche has the opportunity to enter a period of \"Active Nihilism\", and overcome the previous dogmas as part of a revaluation of all values. In spite of his predictions of coming great wars, Nietzsche is hopeful that the conditions of decay will lay infinite possibilities before us for the future. Contrary to many who warn of degeneration or decadence, Nietzsche cleaves to the conviction that with decay comes new growth, and that periods of dissolution are always periods of great creativity. This is, somewhat paradoxically, one of the more hopeful passages of Nietzsche, which acquiesces both to his belief in eternal recurrence, as much to the hope for something new in the future.\nEpisode art: George Frederic Watts - Hope\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #philosophyofhistory #kant #hegel #hegelian #rousseau #romanticism #enlightenment",

We find, in fact, that many of Nietzsche's powerful insights on self-knowledge, self-control, and the search for truth come from this same military school of life. Nietzsche celebrates war and warriors throughout his work, most notably in passages of book one of Thus Spoke Zarathustra which often beguile first time readers coming at Nietzsche's work from a humanist or existentialist bent. How could a philosopher of intellectual freedom and independence tell his audience to \"die in battle and squander a great soul\"? How could he say that a war is not made just by the cause, but the cause made just by the war? Could Nietzsche actually have been pro-war? As a matter of fact, views on war that were on the whole positive were not uncommon in the 19th century, and Nietzsche is no exception to this. Of course, with Nietzsche, it goes deeper, insofar as the influence of Heraclitus and his conception of strife as a creative force inspired Nietzsche. In his view, all the world is war, and every aspect of existence is a manifestation of this unceasing conflict. This war exists on the physical level, on the social level, within our ideas, and within ourselves. Life itself is a bella omnium contra omnes, the war of all against all. With this war as the revealed character of the phenomenal world, Nietzsche argues for accepting war as a fact of life: even as its fundamental character. \nEpisode art: Nietzsche in his military uniform, circa 1864\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #historyofphilosophy #history",

    "description": "Nietzsche Podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=-iOIzgNfTo-3EWlK7h7jPA\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nNietzsche described Napoleon as \"a type of atavism\" - a throwback to an earlier age, and quipped that he, not unlike Rousseau, also sought after a “return to nature”. Nietzsche and Rousseau have mutually opposed perspectives on what nature is, however, and Nietzsche is quick to note that Napoleon was not simply a 'going back', but a 'going up'. To understand why Nietzsche thought the way he did about the figure of a Napoleon or a Caesar, we will recapitulate to the entire Nietzschean understanding of the cycles of history, consider aphorisms from across his career, and examine how Goethe's conversations with Eckermann influenced Nietzsche in this respect. I intend to argue that Nietzsche meant the Caesar figure, the 'non-theoretical genius', to be a replacement for the Messiah figure in Christianity. Rather than salvation in the spiritual, abstract sense, the redeemer of man is an individual who exercises power in the physical world. All of the ideas considered this season culminate in order to explain this aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy, commonly dismissed as 'great man worship'. What we find instead is a phenomenon that Nietzsche believes to be natural, objective, and unavoidable. While this is one of the most difficult ideas of Nietzsche's to tangle with, I think we're better off for comprehending his position in this respect. \n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #history #historyofphilosophy #napoleon",

    "description": "“RETURN TRIP\" is a narrative audiovisual collage of footage taken during the 28 days that Destroyer of Light was on the road with Temptress touring the eastern half of the United States. The footage amounts to a few minutes per day, with some locales, shows and events receiving more coverage than others for a variety of reasons. While I love and support all of the bands that performed with us on the road, it was not always possible to take footage of them all - for example, I was sick for much of the tour, and sometimes had to sleep before our time on stage. In some cases, other band members took footage. \n\nBut, in another sense, I enjoy the randomness of it: that, in other words, the snippets of life that appear here are only those in which chance converged such that I had a camera ready to shoot and something happened which was worth recording. The bands that appear are not therefore chosen in any kind of discerning process: it is simply those bands which I had the opportunity to shoot and felt I could get a decent clip out of. Some shows aren't recorded at all, either because of practical circumstances, or because I just wasn't feeling it. Sometimes the only clips I got of a really awesome band didn't make them look/sound good, so I just left it out. That's the reality of shooting while in the midst of a tour. The approach by which this collage was made does not always result in the clearest visual or audio quality for the live show, but one does not always get the clearest visual or audio quality at a live show either. \n\nThese are just snippets of things that happened: short bursts of experience which for us are now crystalized into memory, and I've tried to string them together in a way that honestly represents our experience on this trip in the most condensed form possible. Much is left out, and no hour long or even twelve hour long movie could convey what the month-long experience is like. \n\nAll copyrighted music that appears in the video is only there because it is what happened to be playing on the radio or in the background somewhere as the video was taken. As this is an attempt at an honest, unadulterated record of what was going on in my life for these 28 days. These are simply the sights and sounds happening in my life. \n\nThanks to Kelsey & Jerry Colca for additional footage.

    "description": "Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0s9QcNrr1ezk65v5oUO9Wf?si=nx98yDeCRsytml-eW6w_XQ\n\n“He who says organization says oligarchy.\" With these words, Robert Michels advances his sociological theory of what is called the iron law of oligarchy. Whenever human beings arrange themselves into a social group, the structural realities of organizing human beings for coordinated action result in minority rule. Far from asserting this as a reality that we have overcome with democracy, this pattern obtains just as strongly in democratic structures of power as in others. Robert Michels lived from 1876 to 1936, wrote several books, and taught sociology and economics at university - including at Basel, where Nietzsche also taught. Michels' arguments are particularly compelling because he began his political career as a socialist and worked within the socialist parties in Germany to advocate for economic reform. However, he soon began to perceive that the structure of the party itself had created another oligarchy within it, and that the leaders of the party seemed to naturally drift from the interests and perspectives of the workers at large. While we might expect such dynamics within monarchist or conservative parties, it was the revelation of this tendency within the leftist parties that disturbed Michels and compelled him to change his approach to politics. If even the avowedly socialistic and revolutionary political parties were destined to become oligarchic in their structure, then this surely points to something inherent to the human social structure that inevitably produces oligarchic rule. Today we're diving into his work, Political Parties, and exploring whether there is good evidence for the iron law of oligarchy. \n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #politicalphilosophy #politics #oligarchy #socialism #politicaltheory",

    "description": "The Nietzsche Podcast: https://anchor.fm/untimely-reflections/episodes/67-Michael-Parenti---The-Assassination-of-Julius-Caesar-e1v5n83\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nWe've now heard Fustel de Coulanges' understanding of the disturbances in Ancient Rome as revolutions brought on by changes to their religious belief structure. We've considered Machiavelli's fawning historical interpretation of Rome, through Livy, as a people who were more virtuous than any other, and maintained that virtue by subjecting themselves to privation and hardship, and who fell into unrest when they strayed from virtue. And we've now heard Turchin's view, that the unrest of the Roman Republic was created by structural-demographic factors. Now, we hear the people's history of Ancient Rome, from Marxist-Leninist Michael Parenti, whose view I wanted to include because it was so different from any other in how he views Julius Caesar and his role in Roman history: as a reformer and liberator of the people, killed by an entrenched oligarchy who wished for nothing other than to hold on to their wealth. Parenti walks through the history of the Late Republic as a history of increasing excesses of the nobility, which was then challenged by people's tribunes and other attempts at reform. In all cases, the nobility put down the reformer, but Caesar was different because he was only assassinated after he'd managed to succeed, and to redistribute the land and the wealth. The legitimacy of the senate was forever shaken, for Caesar was forever the people's champion, and it was thus that it required a civil war afterwards, and only the man who most successfully presented himself as Caesar's heir was able to win and secure order once again - even if he was not revolutionary that Caesar was. Parenti attacks the view of the 'gentleman historians' of Great Britain, and throughout history, who have viewed Rome as a true republic, with democratic representation. Instead, Parenti makes the case that Rome was ruled by a closed-off patriciate who cared for nothing other than their own wealth, and were even willing to undermine the health and stability of their empire in order to extract more. Caesar was the incarnation of this popular uprising into one man, who was willing to break all of the limitations and decorum the nobility had put into place as a means of ensuring that nothing ever changed. Caesar, rather than a tyrannical villain who was justly killed by Brutus, the \"noblest Roman of them all\", Parenti portrays Caesar as a tragic hero, who was the only hope for saving the republic and achieving justice. \n\n#nietzsche #michaelparenti #marxistleninist #marxism #philosophy #philosophypodcast #historyofphilosophy #ancienthistory #ancientrome",

    "description": "The Nietzsche Podcast on Spotify: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/7AxYeE3Bjzb\n\nSupport us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nPeter Turchin has continued the work of Ibn Khaldun, by elaborating upon Khaldun's hypotheses and testing them against the wealth of historical data that we now possess. By means of a structural demographic analysis of historical empires, Turchin has worked for years to generate mathematical models in order to explain the trends that seem to recur in every complex society. Now, with the data of 10,000 years of human activity on the group level, it may be possible to finally move beyond the preliminary, pseudo-scientific steps of the discipline of history, and proceed into a truly mathematized phase. This is the discipline that Turchin calls \"Cliodynamics\", after the Muse of history of Ancient Greece. His intention to leave behind the anthropological and archaeological studies that characterized history in the past, and bring mathematics into the field so that we can begin to make predictions. The reason why many have been so resistant to this development is our belief in free will, and the unpredictability of human action. Turchin thinks that this is a mistake, because while individual decisions are often unpredictable at the individual, granular level, at the level of entire populations or demographics, human beings become rather predictable. Quite in line with the cyclical view of history postulated by Plato, Thucydides, or Nietzsche, Turchin brings the math to demonstrate the truth of their ideas: that, in the realm of human history, all returns eternally. For our sources today, we're primarily using Turchin's books: War and Peace and War, Ultrasociety, and a brief dip at the end into the overall idea of Ages of Discord, as well as some references to Secular Cycles by Turchin and Nefedov. We'll also include a number of quotes from Roman historians Livy, Plutarch and others, as we examine the period of the Roman Republic, the chaos of the Late Republic and the transition to the Principate, as explained by Turchin's structural-demographic theory. This should be fun, given that we've already considered these events somewhat through the eyes of Machiavelli. Now, we can approach the subject with more rigor. In my view, Turchin is following in the traditions of these thinkers, but developing their work further. Episode art is Thomas Cole's now famous \"Destruction\" piece of his cycle, \"The Course of Empire\". \n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #peterturchin #cliodynamics #historyofphilosophy #history #ancienthistory #ancientrome",

But what we find in his Muqaddimah is a theory of cyclical history, in which many of the key principles of Nietzsche's political philosophy would find agreement. Ibn Khaldun was a historian from North Africa whose work sought to explain why it was that the same pattern seemed to repeat ad infinitum. The Bedouin desert tribes would overwhelm one of the settled cities of the Mediterranean, from time to time, then establish a new city there. For a time, the culture of the new city would be like that of the Bedouins in the desert. But, eventually, a sedentary culture set in, over the course of several generations, and the inhabitants grew complacent, became incompetent, and eventually found themselves overthrown by another desert tribe, and the process would then repeat. In his studies, Khaldun arrives at the concept of asabiya, or the capacity for collective power, which can be very useful for a Nietzschean perspective on social power structures. This concept of asabiya means, literally, 'group feeling', and describes the extent to which the individuals feel themselves to part of a unified, coherent group, and are thus able to act as instruments of the group, and coordinate their actions as a team. Asabiya increases in harsh conditions, and declines in conditions of luxury, and thus the cycle of empires is set into motion - \"This is how God proceeds with His creatures.\" \n\nJust as Nietzsche suggests the idea of all things returning eternally, Khaldun's writing brings this idea into the historical and political sphere. But Ibn Khaldun is significant because he presents this not only as a poetical idea, but as a pattern based on observable facts. There are many, many observations and anecdotes in the Muqaddimah, and we will not be able to cover it all, so we shall focus on the points most relevant to the ideas covered this season. This will be our first journey into a work outside the Western Canon, into one of the most important thinkers of the Near East. Join me in exploring the dynamics of history, as we jump into the basic ideas of the Muqaddimah. \n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #historyofphilosophy #ibnkhaldun #muslimphilosophy #arabphilosophy #history #middleeast",

    "description": "Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/29XzcD8imPWBNwV1hQSwFg?si=6eD86aJ8S_S8NLKJsvoAaQ\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nWe've considered two out of the three main strands of 20th century political thought: capitalism and socialism. Fascism is the third, and it is both the most and the least important of the three to consider. I consider it the least important because fascism was defeated, and relegated to the fringes, and honoring its existence with a critique seems like a waste of time. On the other hand, when it comes to Nietzsche, it becomes particularly important to address because of how Nietzsche was tarred with the associations with the fascists, and blamed for their crimes. In this episode, we explore the reasons for this, including his sister Elisabeth, Nietzsche's association with Wagner, Nazi philosophers like Baumler who tried to reshape Nietzsche's ideas to his fit own, and critics like Ernest Newman who took the Nazi claims on Nietzsche uncritically. In fact, when we look to Nietzsche's letters, and many statements he'd made over the years about his break with Wagner, that the ideas of German nationalism and anti-semitism were repugnant to him - he goes so far as to say that it is opposed to his entire way of life. As such, we take a particular focus in this episode on addressing anti-semitism. Even though anti-semitism is not essential to all forms of fascism, the same patterns of harnessing the envy and resentment of the average, precarious person and giving him an evil enemy to fight can be seen in its example. We find that Nietzsche's philosophy is opposed to any essential idea of race, and that those who believed in such things often appealed to mystical or metaphysical claims about the races as descended from pure, separate species from an ancient Golden Age - such as the occult beliefs of the Thule Society. And finally, even against Mussolinian ideas of state-worship, Nietzsche exists in stark contrast, as we call to mind his concern of the state becoming the ends rather than a means, and the \"iron-clamp\" crushing down and stopping all productions of culture. For Nietzsche, the state is \"the coldest of all monsters\", and it is a lie when it claims to represent or stand for the people. This episode is unique among these three excursions into 20th century political thought in that it is the only one of the three where we'll seriously examine Nietzsche's life, yet again, and his personal relationships, since none of this can be understood without the story of Elisabeth Nietzsche.\nAs sources, I've used Umberto Eco's Ur-Fascism essay in order to ground what we're talking about as regards fascism, and we'll look at some ways in which Nietzsche and he agree in condemning fascism, but some ways in which Nietzsche's ideas run astray of Eco's standards.\nI've also used Stephen Hicks' book, \"Nietzsche and the Nazis\", and some of the materials available on his website. We look at five ways that Hicks sees Nietzsche as opposed to the Nazis, and five ways they could be seen as similar. I disagree with Hicks on many points, though I feel his work to be valuable.\nI also cite Kaufmann's biography of Nietzsche at many points (albeit without providing page numbers), and even use Rob Solomon's introduction to Nietzsche, \"What Nietzsche Really Said\", for one quote.\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #politicalphilosophy #socialism #capitalism",

    "description": "This week on Untimely Reflections, we answer the age-old question... who is whinier and more triggered, the left or the right? The right gave a strong showing for the \"Nietzsche Contra Capitalism\" episode, lots of salt. The lefties have their work cut out for them, but I think they can beat them if they try.\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE\n\nNietzsche's critique of capitalism is in fact inextricably bound to his critique of socialism. What he finds beneath both approaches to managing human economic affairs is the utilitarian value structure and the view of the human being as homo economicus. Socialism, rather than the solution to capitalism, is the necessary end of the same internal logic, and further seeks to cut off avenues for man's will to power as we labor under the mistaken assumption that by reducing suffering we will maximize pleasure. The closer we proceed to an idealized, painless society, the more our individuality is smoothed over. Increasingly, the only avenue for the expression of power is through the only remaining hierarchical structure: the state. Originally created by mankind to be a means, the state becomes the ends. In a twisted irony, the likes of the socialists and anarchists - who desire above all for a classless, stateless society - bring forth an all-powerful state as the means of doing this, and become consumed by it.\n\nA neat aspect of the episode order here is that we're covering Nietzsche's political thought in a rough chronology - meaning that, while we might jump around from place to place, and occasionally grab a quote from Beyond Good & Evil, we're moving from the second and third book of Human, All Too Human into covering a lot more material from Daybreak, while still drawing on sources from elsewhere in the middle period. The next episode - Nietzsche's critique of fascism - covers around the same period, in terms of the letters and statements he made about Wagner and Elisabeth during his breaks with them, in addition to drawing on passages from throughout his work. \n\nIan Wright's article, \"Capital as a Real God\": https://ianwrightsite.wordpress.com/2020/09/03/marx-on-capital-as-a-real-god-2/\n\nThomas Brobjer's studies showing that Nietzsche knew Marx: https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110170740.298/html\n\nMy essay on Star Trek (please note, this was written some time ago, and I am planning a re-write for a reading of it, so there may be some fat on there that needs to get trimmed off): https://untimely-reflections.blogspot.com/2021/05/neverending-frontier-star-treks.html\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #historyofphilosophy #politicalphilosophy #socialism #capitalism #utopia",

Silly cover images and slogans aside, this week we'll consider one of the most peculiar aspects of Nietzsche's political thought: his non-Marxist critique of capitalism, which is mostly found in Human, All Too Human, Books II and III. Since Nietzsche is writing during an experimental period in his thought, he's willing here to entertain thoughts which might not have interested him during his later career. He's willing to give advice to democrats on the best ways to preserve their system against the excesses of capital, for example, or to explain to the rich how their lack of virtue is the very thing that will bring on the revolution against them. Ultimately, Nietzsche's argument centers on the idea that capitalism implies socialism, as both ideologies are founded on utilitarian principles which will drive them towards this end, so long as the value of utility is unmoored from any other concerns: moral, spiritual, national, or individual. I begin the episode with an overall criticism of capitalism based on Nietzschean principles, then we study the textual evidence for these positions and the ways in which Nietzsche considers 'the property question' to be the most dangerous of his time - for remedying it is itself dangerous. The only paths he sees open for society to continue, and survive what he believes to be a cataclysmic movement towards socialism or anarchy, are the following surprising measures: for the wealthy to rediscover virtue, for the institutions of democracy to ban the parties and expel the rich and the destitute from governance, to nationalize the financial sector, and for mass production to yield to a guild or trade union system. \n\nI'm sure this episode will anger most extremists: i.e., the Marxists and the libertarian capitalists. To those free spirits who haven't a care for orthodox opinions, for whom this episode really belongs, join me, and explore the Nietzschean criticisms of capitalism.\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #philosophypodcast #capitalism #socialism #politicalphilosophy",

We’re picking back up with Nietzsche’s middle period, starting from his work in Human, All Too Human. In a chapter from this work, Nietzsche addresses himself to the ideas of Rousseau, Machiavelli, Thucydides, and Plato. He attacks democracy and egalitarianism, but treats them ambivalently, as a resistless force that cannot be stopped and with which the free spirit must make his peace. He treats war as essential for mankind, but acknowledges the ways in which a European peace would advance civilization. Above all, he rejects the Kantian notions that free expression of all would improve society, and equally so rejects the Rousseauian notions of abandoning the Enlightenment advances in art and culture. While this chapter lays the groundwork for Nietzsche’s later politics, it is a fascinating time of experimentation that is difficult to contextualize without seeing the entire picture of his development.

    "title": "Immanuel Kant’s Perpetual Peace (The Nietzsche Podcast #60)",
    "description": "The Nietzsche Podcast, episode 60.\n\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=36NgLnVZRGCX89yNV8tydg\n\nThis episode concerns the least celebrated aspect of one of the most celebrated philosophers of the European Enlightenment: Kant’s politics. Immanuel Kant is responsible for launching the thread of philosophic inquiry known as German Idealism. At the time, perhaps Kant was merely trying to address the skepticism of those such as Hume. Nevertheless, his philosophical attempt to delimit the bounds of reason - to reveal to humanity what we can, in fact, know by use of our reason - launched a revolution in philosophy. It continues through Hegel, Fichte, Schopenhauer, and, yes, Nietzsche. We have avoided a comprehensive episode on Kant’s philosophy because that would require not an episode, but a podcast, and have limited our inclusion of Kant to a few important aspects insofar as they’ve related to past topics. While Kant’s politics are generally considered among his lesser contributions to the philosophical world, I will advance the case here that we see his ideas reflected in the political ideologies of the modern world: his political optimism, his belief in reason as a governing principle, and his belief in perpetual peace. While Rousseau may have been about as far apart from Nietzsche as possible while sharing his romantic orientation towards history, Kant and Nietzsche are diametrically opposed in terms of their starting principles. Kant is arguably a match for Rousseau in terms of Nietzschean antipodes, but as to which is more opposed to Nietzsche than the other, I’ll leave that to the audience to decide.\n\n#philosophy #philosophypodcast #nietzsche #thenietzschepodcast #history #historyofphilosophy #kant #immanuelkant #politicalphilosophy #categoricalimperative #perpetualpeace",

While on that run, we got a call for a show opportunity opening up for Mac Sabbath, the famous McDonald’s themed Sabbath cover band, all the way up in Memphis. Since we’d already be in that area for shows booked in Tulsa, Fayetteville, Dallas and San Antonio, we added Memphis to the beginning of the run.

While both have been called romantics, we find enough nuance to consider both something beyond this - and yet, Rousseau & Nietzsche agree in finding problematic the supposed “progress” of the modern world, and both turn their gaze back to the time before civilization to contrast with modern life. But where Nietzsche sees a war of all against all, Rousseau sees a state of natural happiness. Rather than a “going back” to this natural utopia, as Rousseau’s philosophy is sometimes described, instead Rousseau’s project is an indictment of the injustice of civilization and the goal of remedying this injustice. For Rousseau, man can only be made free once again if society is brought into accord with the general will - the underlying will of the populace at large. In this, harmony between the individual and society is achieved, and true democracy realized. There is hardly any figure who receives more scorn from Nietzsche than Rousseau, but because Rousseau is eerily similar to Nietzsche in many respects, learning the basics of his politics is essential to understanding Nietzsche.

I asked him about his attempt to harness both the philosophy of Nietzsche with that of Carl Jung, since there are some contradictions between their thought that keep them from being easily reconciled. We discuss Jordan Peterson, why we both liked him once upon a time, but why he has, perhaps, 'lost it'. And throughout the conversation, Stef gives his vision of the \"Promethean West\" - that European civilization is fundamentally based on aiming for the stars, unlocking the secrets of the universe, inventing and innovating, stealing the fire from the gods. His thesis is that many young people have lost this fire, and his goal is to kindle it again. \n\nI understand from reading some of the comments that Uberboyo might be a controversial figure for whatever reason. I found him to be a compelling speaker and to have a good grasp of Nietzsche's ideas, and much of what he said didn't seem divisive or intentionally controversial, at least to me. Hopefully we're all mature enough to tolerate opposing viewpoints on this podcast, especially given that the next guest will bring some critical theory into the mix, and I don't want to hear any (bad faith) griping from the other side either. Some of the patrons have said this was one of the best conversations so far, so I hope the audience at large will enjoy it also. \n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #carljung #jungianpsychology #historyofphilosophy #philosophypodcast #philosophers #jordanpeterson #ancientgreece #ancienthistory #christianity",

    "description": "Today, we discuss one of the most important works of political philosophy of all time, Machiavelli's Il Principe - The Prince. This book was composed while Machiavelli was in exile, after having served the city of Florence for thirteen years as a diplomatic official, but by the time of its authorship reduced to the role of an obscure private citizen. In this work, as Nietzsche characterizes it, Machiavelli takes us along at a brisk allegrissimo through matters of the most grave seriousness, maintaining sobriety and good humor the whole way through. His intended audience is a leader who could found an Italian nation-state. Accordingly, he makes a distinction between republics, hereditary monarchies, and the kind of monarchy that such a unifier of Italy would inevitably have to create: the new monarchy. He writes without concern for the questions of legitimacy, natural rights, or the progress towards a political ideal. Machiavelli instead concerns himself with the practical challenges of establishing a new state. He looks not to the future, but wishes to emulate the example that lies in the distant past, in the form of Rome. His hero, Cesare Borgia - a tragic figure who played the game of thrones rather well, but still lost - was similarly held by Nietzsche as an example of a great individual. In our examination of why Machiavelli admired Borgia, we find an important key to Nietzsche's understanding of Europe's moral-psychological past, and the revaluation of values that took place during the Italian Renaissance, only to be thwarted by the arising of Luther and the Protestant Reformation.\n\n#philosophy #history #historyofphilosophy #renaissance #italianrenaissance #nietzsche #politicalphilosophy #politics #philosophypodcast #philosophers #italianphilosophy",

    "title": "Machiavelli’s Discourses on Livy (The Nietzsche Podcast 57)",
    "description": "Support me on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nIntroduction to Machiavelli’s political philosophy. We will consider Machiavelli’s legacy, and the enduring debate as to the significance of Machiavelli’s work. Is he strictly an amoralist, concerned with political power as solely a “force” to be considered in the scientific sense, or does he have a political project of his own that must inform our interpretation of him? To answer these questions, we will take the unorthodox step of beginning with his Discourses on Livy. As always, there is some truth to both these approaches, as Machiavelli holds republics above monarchies, and seeks for the means of achieving a state with liberty for its citizens. But he attains his greatness in political theory insofar as his own political concerns are always approached within a sober, realistic theory of power. In the Discourses, Machiavelli comments on the history of the Roman Republic, in his view the greatest state ever to have existed, since it endured the longest while allowing its citizens the most liberty. For Friedrich Nietzsche, heavily influenced by Machiavelli, the important lessons to be learned from him are his realism, his attention to longevity, his critique of the church and of the Christian religion, and the need for the ruler to profess and foster the religion of the people even if he does not believe it himself. In Machiavelli, Nietzsche finds a political theory so laudable that he would suggest in his noted that “pure Machiavellianism” is transcendent and superhuman - a path to elevating humanity.\n\n#machiavelli #machiavellian #politicalphilosophy #politics #history #ancienthistory #ancientrome #historyofphilosophy #italianphilosophy #italianrenaissance #renaissance #philosophy #philosophypodcast #nietzsche",

However, since the Dionysus v/s The Crucified idea is so central to understanding Nietzsche, I thought it warranted its own video. \n\nThis is the final episode of our series on Schopenhauer, and the episode where we will finally draw some general conclusions, not merely about Schopenhauer’s philosophy or his life, or how he influenced Nietzsche - but rather about Nietzsche’s philosophical project itself and how Schopenhauer helped him discover the true opposition at the heart of his work. Nietzsche has been called a romantic during his early period, owing to the influence of Schopenhauer and Wagner. Nietzsche has also been called a pessimist, because of his cynicism about our will to truth, for example, his critiques of morality, and his predictions of the collapse of our values structures in the wake of the death of God and thus the rejection of a divine origin or teleology for man. In this episode, we’re looking at writings from 1886 and 1887, where Nietzsche looks back on his intellectual development , and tells us in his own words how he grew to differ from the romantic pessimism of his influences. Through this understanding of his fundamental differences with Wagner and Schopenhauer, Nietzsche gained a clear idea of that which he opposed in current society, and that which he felt was needed or lacking. His discovery is another useful skeleton key for his work: the Dionysian as the life-giving spirit of transformation that man can discover by again spiritualizing the animal drives, and all that is Christian as the symbol of the denial of life and the turn towards nihilism. Through the formula of Dionysus v/s the Crucified, Nietzsche discovered what Schopenhauer lacked, and what his own task was in philosophy: to search for “a pessimism of strength” that could harness the penetrating, heroic honesty that Schopenhauer modeled, and put it into the service of life.\n\n#nietzsche #schopenhauer #pessimism #philosophy #nihilism #dionysus #christianity #atheism #cynicism #philosophypodcast",

Nietzsche derives from the Sophists, such as Thucydides, his preference for realism over idealism in geopolitics, and the \"practical justice\" of examining every viewpoint on its own terms, and according to what would serve the advantage or disadvantage to that perspective. From Epicurus, he derives the \"anti-politics\" of praising withdrawal from the world, and the intellectual or philosophical class acting based on a pathos of distance in which they remove themselves from mass politics and from quotidian concerns. Finally, he inherits from figures such as Theognis a desire to way a cultural battle against democratic or egalitarian values. Rather than becoming political in terms of practical political action in his own time, Nietzsche sets his sights to the long-term, beyond any one regime, country, or people, and attempts to provide a timeless argument for hierarchy and aristocracy. This is \"Nietzsche's Contest\" in the philosophical arena: the war for his ideals, which he feels to be the most powerful, most life-enhancing, and thus most deserving in the political sphere, to triumph over the zeitgeist of democratic moralism. Our main sources today are the fragment, \"The Greek State\", and the essay, \"Homer's Contest\". This will serve as a kind of recap and conclusion to our focus on the Greeks, bringing an end to this antiquarian section of the season. Next week will serve as a bridge into the political concerns of the Enlightenment, by examining the ways in which one author of Enlightenment Europe, dear to Nietzsche, was influenced greatly by the political history of Rome.\n\n#ancientgreece #ancientrome #ancienthistory #history #philosophy #historyofphilosophy #nietzsche #philosophypodcast #philosophers #plato #socrates #politicalphilosophy",

Epicurean philosophy is hedonistic in that it holds pleasure to be the highest good, but Epicurus drew completely different conclusions than that of blind pleasure-seeking. In truth, Epicurus views the most important task of life to be the removal of pain or distress, and concludes in the ideal of an austere, simple, hidden life: the life in “The Garden”.\n\nNietzsche made numerous interesting remarks about Epicurus throughout his literary canon. After studying the basic outline of his life and ideas through Diogenes Laertius, we’ll read some of Nietzsche’s interpretations and critiques of Epicurus. Even though Epicurus can be seen as a forerunner to utilitarianism, in him Nietzsche finds a great man and a precursor: a man who loved life, dealt with the world in real terms, and who “created the heroic-idyllic way to philosophize”.\n\n#ancientgreece #nietzsche #ancienthistory #history #philosophy #philosophypodcast #epicurus #epicurean",

Where he sees cowardice in Plato, Nietzsche sees courage in Thucydides, as well as the “practical justice” of allowing all the parties a fair representation of their viewpoint. Thucydides, for Nietzsche, is the epitome of the Sophist tradition, which he contrasts with the moralism of Socrates and Plato. In this episode, we discuss The History of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides’ great contribution to world literature and history.\n\n#ancientgreece #nietzsche #ancienthistory #history #thucydides #peloponnese #athens #sparta #thisissparta #philosophy #plato #philosophypodcast #philosophylecture",

Plato’s Republic is one of the most important works of classical philosophy, and also one of the most infamous. In this episode we examine a series of questions concerning Plato: is the Republic a work of ethical philosophy only, or must we read political implications in it?; is it a utopian work?; is Plato responsible, as Popper charges, for the horrors of the 20th century?; finally, what was Nietzsche’s response to the politics of Plato? While the episode involves an introductory discussion of the major ideas of the work, our focus is primarily on the issues that would have interested Nietzsche and which would concern us in studying the politics of antiquity. \n\n#ancientgreece #nietzsche #plato #platonicmind #socrates #history #ancienthistory #politicalphilosophy #politics",

Theognis was a Greek aristocrat from a Dorian city-state, famous for his poetry which survives only in fragments. For millennia, he was regarded as a gnomic poet, whose works were intended to impart moral lessons. In his study of Theognis, Nietzsche combats this view, and argues instead that Theognis was only perceived as a moralist in the post-Socratic zeitgeist. What Nietzsche finds instead is a passionate man who wrote poetry at all seasons and occasions of life, and who spoke for an aristocratic ethos that was collapsing during the democratic revolutions of Greece. In this essay, among the earliest works of Nietzsche, we find the beginnings of his own identification with the old social order of Greece, and even his implicit criticisms thereof. Pictured in the art is the two-headed god, Janus. \n\n#ancientgreece #nietzsche #philosophy #ancienthistory #theognis #poet #ancientworld #history #philosophers",

    "description": "Support us: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nVisit us on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=cacCxMMPSDuvGV03hHA2qw\n\nNuma Denis Fustel de Coulanges (1830-1889) provides us with the most in-depth account of the ancient religion upon which the city-states of Greece and Rome were founded. While the Hellenes later believed in concepts such as reincarnation, the division of body and soul, and gods that ruled over whole empires, Coulanges asserts that in their earliest days - hundreds or thousands of years before the periods for which we have written documentation - the Indo-Europeans believed that the dead continued to live on in the same body, underground. These dead ancestors became gods in the imaginations of the early Hellenes, bound to the land and the object of a secret worship carried out only by their descendants. Alongside these peculiar beliefs was the practice of keeping a sacred hearthfire in the center of the home - the home being the temple of the domestic religion. This fire was regarded as a literal god, real and living, who blessed the household so long as they kept the fire burning and pure, and would curse them if they did otherwise. Coulanges builds his case by following the clues remaining from the days of this worship - such as strange contradictions in the holy books, and rituals and hymns which did not reflect the beliefs but pointed to something more ancient. It is from these beliefs - alien and incomprehensible to us today - that the social order of the city was formed, and the laws that governed the cities written. Thus, we paradoxically find that the ancients were both completely foreign to us - and yet even we today preserve odd relics of this old belief.\n\nWhile Coulanges' seminal work, The Ancient City, is nowhere found in Nietzsche's library, and thus it is likely that Nietzsche never read it, it is indispensable for understanding the perspective of the ancient Hellenes. Since we're going to be covering a great deal of Hellenic thought in the coming episodes, we're going to preface all of it with a crash course in the development of their religious beliefs - for, as Coulanges argues, it is according to these beliefs that the political reality was shaped.\n\n#ancientgreece #philosophy #nietzsche #ancienthistory #history #greece",

In this episode, we give an unvarnished look at the aristocratic radicalism that forms up the foundation of Nietzsche's political philosophy. While many interpreters and commenters on Nietzsche have dealt with his radical politics  by ignoring it altogether, by regarding Nietzsche as anti-political, or by interpreting it all away, we will instead begin by taking a hard look at Nietzsche's politics and see if we can come to an understanding of why he held this perspective. As with all things Nietzsche, his political views begin with Hellenic Greece. What we discover, in the course of this examination, is that Nietzsche's political philosophy, antithetical to our modern morality though it may be, is intertwined with his broader philosophical ideas. In this episode, we will cover the concepts of the order of rank, and the pathos of distance. \n\nVisit us on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=pWS6iAnNTpGxWbCTdbsv-w\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #ancientgreece  #politicalphilosophy",

    "title": "Cartesian Dualism",
    "description": "In this episode, I'm reading a chapter of my book, Unconscious  Correspondences. I considered an episode on Cartesian Dualism, but realized I'd already said everything I needed to say, in a chapter in this book. Rather than repurposing the same content into a new form, why  not just read directly from the book? As Nietzsche tended to do  when introducing his own earlier works, I shall do the same. I will  introduce this essay: \"Body and Mind: The Life and Meditations of Rene  Descartes - A Polemic\" with, \"An attempt at self-criticism\".\n\nThis  essay has its flaws, and belabors the point a bit too stringently at  places. In retrospect, I made some very overgeneralized claims about  academia and modern attitudes towards Descartes that one could easily  challenge. I should also say that these claims derived from personal  experience with my own professors, and the professors of many of my  friends. Descartes was always taught as being \"basically a secret  atheist who didn't believe the religious stuff at all and included it  just to please the church.\" Not only did one of my own professors say  some version of this, I heard this from others, attending different  universities. This always struck me as odd, because the central  premises of his Meditations on First Philosophy are completely derived  from Christian presuppositions, which are simply taken from theology and  put into philosophical language. Thus, I challenged: whether Descartes  was truly a departure from past philosophy (Plato, of course, sets up  figures to raise assertions and Socrates to raise skeptical  objections/doubts); whether Descartes was actually an atheist or a deist  (or whether we could understand him within the assumption he was a  Christian, perhaps a Rosicrucian); whether our own interpretations of  Descartes have to do with our embrace of the \"mind as self\"  ego-consciousness (thus leading us to be confused and embarrassed by  Descartes' invocation of God as the ultimate certainty). While I wrote  in a way that was somewhat clumsy in my eyes now, and while I may have  spent too much time in a detour talking about the background historical  context in which Descartes emerged, I feel these challenges are raised  in a forceful and meaningful enough way to be useful for people to think  about. https://app.thebookpatch.com/BookStore/unconscious-correspondences/3fe82dc3-d4ac-4d61-81c3-9ce9a7abe483\n\n#philosophy #descartes #ithinkthereforeiam #cogito #nietzsche #dualism",

Nietzsche urges us not to interpret him as giving us a definitive way of life to follow, but furthermore does not wish us to seek for a state of finality, rest, or utopia. The great experience of noontide is the perception that one is truly halfway between animal and that which is super-human, and that transformation into something greater is possible: that we can overcome our previous limitations that we believed once were set in stone. \n\nThe episode concludes with a thank you to the fans, a teaser of what is to come in the podcast.

    "description": "Taken from The Nietzsche Podcast, episodes 45 & 46. Support the show on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nDescent into Materialism: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7aVrBcFJKWsyadfBb7eRs9?si=Gfa9CycwRVCw2pyV5lwmMA\n\nThe World as Will to Power, and Nothing Besides!: https://open.spotify.com/episode/503yax92LGMunGozMvinop?si=GDlH1NUETUqKBEqbaTfVXQ\n\nIn this episode, we revisit the Pre-Platonic lecture series given by Nietzsche at Basel, the notes for which were assembled and translated by Gregory Whitlock. These lectures detail Nietzsche’s views on the first philosophers of Ancient Greece, and how they demonstrated that the spirit of scientific investigation is a manifestation of will to power: to bound the boundless within the understanding of reason, by appeal to as few possible starting principles. Nietzsche believes that the Pre-Platonic philosophers - Thales, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and others - represented the descent from an understanding of the world as controlled by a personified heaven, into something explained by natural forces. The end result is materialism: matter as explained by matter itself and its properties or laws. This is powerful and dangerous as an innovation. Materialism offers the greatest utility, but precedes a slide into nihilism. Many of Nietzsche’s insights in his interpretation were influenced by the philosopher of science, Friedrich Albert Lange. In this episode, we examine the relation of Nietzsche to Lange, their view of the Pre-Platonics, and then analyze each figure individually to see how each fits in to Nietzsche’s narrative of the unfolding of scientific thought in Greece. Rather than a mere historical curiosity, Nietzsche finds the Greeks to express the same driving tendency that underlies science in our own time.\n\nOn our second excursion into Nietzschean science, we’re studying Nietzsche’s two most celebrated figures in science: one from Ancient Greece and another from Enlightenment Europe. In Democritus, Nietzsche sees the zenith of the materialist project in Greek philosophy, opening the way for a mathematical atomist description of the world, carried on by the Pythagoreans. In Boscovich, he finds a continuation of this project, centuries later - to describe the world by one force or law, and account for the problem of motion in a way that rejects Kantian or Newtonian appeals to God, or Spinozistic teleology.\nWhat comes out of this inquiry is an understanding that Nietzsche may have construed the will to power as a physical reality from the very beginning. From this perspective, will to power is the answer to the problem of motion; it is the inner, “intelligible character” of matter; it is the qualitative expression of what Boscovich’s unified field theory offers us in quantitative terms. This episode culminates in a look at some of Nietzsche’s more extreme or puzzling statements in his notes where will to power is discussed as a very real physical principle. Pictured in the episode art are Democritus and Boscovich.\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #schopenhauer #spinoza #physics #boscovich #historyofscience #history  #democritus #heraclitus  #anxagoras #lange #materialism #science",

    "description": "Support the show on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\n\nMuch had been made of Nietzsche’s predictions of the coming nihilism. As a result of the death of the Christian God, Europe is bound for a crisis of values, in which nothing can any longer give us a goal beyond ourselves and our own happiness, and people search for this meaning or justification in all sorts of other spheres of human life: morality, reason, history, and utility. Ultimately, however, since we have so thoroughly devalued the physical world of experience, we find no such meaningful answer to the problem of life. That we have devalued life in order to justify life was a masterstroke of Christianity, so long as we had a transcendent authority to look to: a higher sphere to justify the material sphere. But now, we are left only with the burdens, the curse on existence, the “in vain”. As the will cannot aim at nothing, the ultimate consequence is the pursuit of happiness for the greatest number. Rather than this passive, incomplete nihilism, Nietzsche dreams of an active nihilism, and a strength of will to cut through the meaninglessness into a true revaluation. Come explore the meaning, causes and consequences of nihilism with me! \n\nEpisode art: Gustave Dore - Satan’s Fall to Earth\n\n#philosophy #nietzsche #nihilism #christianity",

    "title": "WAGNER & NIETZSCHE - What Really Happened",
    "description": "Taken from episodes 36 & 37 of The Nietzsche Podcast. Support us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nAfter meeting Wagner by happenstance in 1868, Nietzsche began a ten-year friendship with the older man, who was a rising star in the music world, on track to becoming one of the most famous living composers. Nietzsche was himself a fan, and described the chain of events leading to his friendship with Wagner as a kind of \"fairytale\". Soon, Wagner embarked upon the idea of a music festival that would serve as a cultural spearhead for the movement Wagner wished to create in Germany. The town was settled upon: Bayreuth. Construction began on a new theater house to accommodate the festival. Nietzsche aided Wagner in founding it. The first year was a financial disaster but an artistic success, reverberating throughout Europe. But the young Nietzsche left the festival troubled, reporting in a letter that it was then he decided to retreat into the mountains of Interlaken, where he composed the first third of Human, All Too Human.\n\nNietzsche writes, in his personal correspondence, and in his reflections in Ecce Homo, of the liberating freedom he felt when he left Bayreuth and moved up to the Alps, and how this turning away from Wagner represented a completely new chapter in his life. Indeed, the break corresponds with Nietzsche's departure from academia, and his uprooting of his entire established life, up to that point. Where Wagner was once a trusted friend, mentor, and likely surrogate father-figure for Nietzsche, he begins to write with utter scorn against the old composer. We'll examine the biographical aspect of the break. For the remainder, we consider Nietzsche's charges in The Case of Wagner, and Nietzsche Contra Wagner - works written/compiled in 1888, a time of retrospection for Nietzsche - that Wagner capitulated to everything that Nietzsche despised, that he was ultimately a world-despairing Christian, and that maybe Wagner's transformation was not even genuine. That he was, at heart, nothing more than an actor. As a man with an immense artistic power, he debased music by using it simply as a means of moving people's feelings, while never truly challenging or subverting German culture. Music became sick - yet another form of mere entertainment, another enhanced, rarefied sense pleasure of the late-stage of a society. Whereas once Nietzsche believed Wagner to be perhaps the opponent of modernity, he now writes of him as modernity personified: the epitome of the decadent artist who loses himself in the crowd.\n\n#philosophy #nietzsche #wagner #richardwagner #schopenhauer #classicalmusic #romanticism #opera",

    "description": "Taken from episodes 41 & 42 of The Nietzsche Podcast. \n\nSupport the show on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nGoethe is perhaps the most widely-celebrated author of German literature, and Faust is his most famous tale. While the historical Doctor Faustus had always been portrayed as an essentially evil man, who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for greater power, Goethe reinterpreted the story into a wager between Faust and Mephistopheles, and set it against the backdrop of a metaphysical wager between God and Satan. Faust, as protagonist, stands not for evil, but for the spirit of ceaseless striving. Having mastered all the faculties of the university, and attained the zenith of knowledge available to mankind, Faust feels his lifelong quest has been for naught. He declares: \"...for all our science and art / we can know nothing, it burns my heart\". His restless heart sees Faust turning to magic and conjuration in order to break past the boundaries of science, morality, or even common decency - in his neverending quest to pursue knowledge and achievement. This path leads him straight to Mephisto, who offers Faust a deal that he cannot refuse.\n\nWe’ll discuss the philosophical themes of Faust, and how they influenced the thought of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Then, Goethe's place in literature and a brief summary of his life and work, as well as the background of the work in question, Faust. We'll then examine in detail some of the scenes and monologues from the first scenes of the play: from Heaven's Prologue to the scene in Faust's study where the deal is struck. \n\nAfter the wager is agreed upon between Faust and Mephisto, the two set off to explore the world. Mephisto takes Faust out drinking in Leipzig. Then, Mephisto procures for him a youth potion from one of his earthly servants - a witch - that takes thirty years off of Faust's life, restoring him to perfect youth. Then, while on their travels, Faust meets a young girl named Gretchen, by happenstance, and decides he must have her, forcing Mephisto to help him in this endeavor. Most of the rest of part one then deals with this storyline as it unfolds: the \"Gretchen Tragedy\", in which an innocent, devout young woman falls in love with a charming, mysterious stranger - only to have her heart broken, her family destroyed, and her life ruined. In his endless quest for new experiences, Faust is willing to take on all pain, all pleasure, all triumph, all calamity. But what about when Faust brings tragedy onto others? And what if it is the very woman he loves who suffers the most because of his actions? \n\nWhile part two of Faust is impossible to summarize, we'll then do our best of covering that material, and then, of course, the masterful final scene of the play, written more than fifty years after the first lines were first put to parchment. Goethe's Faust ultimately reveals to us the story of Faust's entire life, and thus could only be written over the course of a lifetime by Goethe. Join me in exploring this great work of world literature, which seeks to redeem the dissatisfied, wayward aspect within the Enlightened mind.\n\nEpisode art: Philipp Winterwerb - Faust in his Study\n\n#philosophy #goethe #faust #nietzsche #schopenhauer #religion #enlightenment #poetry",

    "description": "Support me on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nEmerson – Never have I felt so much at home in a book, and in my home, as – I may not praise it… it is too close to me... The author who has been richest in ideas in this century so far, has been an American...\" (Nietzsche)\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson is one of the most influential minds in America, as a leading figure in the Transcendentalist movement that emerged during the mid-1800s, a personal friend and strong influence on Thoreau, and a preacher outside of any church or dogma. Emerson believed that what he called \"Historical Christianity\" had rendered the Christian religion a dead faith. Rather than educating men's spirits as to the meaning of their individual strivings and sufferings, or relating the wisdom of the Bible to their actual lives, preachers merely uttered moral sentiments and taught their flocks by rote. After departing the Harvard Divinity School, Emerson lectured all around America for 25 years. He was part of the Lyceum movement, which aimed to bring such philosophical lectures to general audiences - transmitting philosophy to the people, rather than just those within academia. While Emerson has sometimes been portrayed as an 'easy optimist' with a positive message, he was a man of intense feeling whose life was marred by tragedy. His answer to the suffering of his life was to transmute it into a sincerely personal and individual spirituality, and an understanding of all life as expressions of one divinity: The Over-Soul.\n\nThe link between Emerson and Nietzsche is one that is oft-overlooked, even now. Some have called this a kind of perennial oversight, an absurdly repeating blind spot in approaching Nietzsche. Perhaps this is because the two men have as many differences as they do similarities. And yet, when we look within Nietzsche's journals and letters, and even within his published works, the influence of Emerson is made stunningly clear. Throughout the episode, we examine how concepts such as the personal v/s the impersonal, the use and abuse of history, the celebration and acceptance of all life's circumstances, the use of a monistic principle to explain all life - were all part of Emerson's philosophy as much as Nietzsche's. Both men were, in Emerson's coinage, \"children of the fire\": the souls who perceive the beauty of the divine fire underlying all life and existence, and give it voice in poetry, philosophy, and song.\n\nInterview with Robert D.

    "description": "I documented our March/April 2022 tour of the West Coast, our first in over two years.\n\nThis is the day-to-day reality of touring. Driving, loading and unloading gear, finding a place to sleep, and watching lots of bands. And, of course: disaster, malfunctions, and catastrophic engine failure. This is simply a series of experiences that I managed to capture and that are now frozen in time. Hopefully, I've created a compelling enough story out of it all. It is not professional or neat around the edges. It was shot chronologically, in the stress and chaos of the moment, often to the consternation of my bandmates, and thus I had to simply work with what I had while editing. For better or for worse, it is now the record of what happened on this remarkable adventure. \n\nThe tour began with mishaps; our opening show, which was supposed to be with Monolord, one of my favorite bands, was neutered… Monolord’s van broke down and they couldn’t make the show. We salvaged the show by combining it with the inside show, and, according to the people at the venue, it was one of the best events of South by Southwest and the surrounding weeks. Not only this, the first two road shows, in Dallas and Oklahoma city, failed to work out. At the last minute, we booked gigs in Arlington and Tulsa. Somehow, we overcame every obstacle, but the tour kept throwing them. Then, things got even more interesting. \n\nThe realities of the tour meant that I was unable to film any of our live sets - I can’t play guitar and shoot footage at the same time - so I’ve relied on the footage that others sent to us when it comes to documenting our own performances. This means that these clips are few and far between, but this is probably so much the better - since watching us play, over and over again, would get repetitive. Instead, there is much more of all the bands that I saw and managed to get a decent snippet of.\n\nI don’t know if this can really convey the actuality of the touring experience: and of course it must be said that all tours are very different and have a different vibe based on where you go and the collective emotional state of the band. This one was, somehow, in spite of all hardship, blessed by a collective attitude of sunny optimism, bordering on naive foolishness. I count it as one of the best tours we've done.\n\nINCLUDES MUSIC by: Steve Colca's Hysteria, Dystopian Mess, pt. 4, 5, & 9\n\nSPECIAL THANKS to: Christian & Temptress, Firebreather, Greenbeard, Amplified Heat, Red Mesa, Sorxe, Wallower, XTRA Large Guns, Formula 400, Mezzoa, Dizz Brew, Brother Strange, Genocide Junkies, Dustlord, In the Company of Serpents, Celestial Wizard, Eternal Witch, Crop Killer, Kvasir, Sick, Worry, Kalakuta, Haxa, Sonolith, Hudu Akil, Ritual Noise Abuse, Stricken, Sara & Morgan, Buddy Hachar, Ryan Tarby, The Colcas & The Tannises, The bar staff at The Quarry, Giant Palouse Earthworm, Valley View Automotive, and AAA.",

    "description": "\"Without music, life would be a mistake.\" It's commonly known that Nietzsche was a sort of 'musical philosopher' - in fact, it was a feat he aspired to quite openly - but a glance at Nietzsche's thoughts on music reveals that he was so enamored with this form of artistic expression as to have once suggested that music lays at the very heart of reality. Only through music, Nietzsche argues in Birth of Tragedy, can we directly experience the primordial pain and contradiction of reality. Here we will touch on the major points of Nietzsche's engagement with music: his love of Wagner and eventual break from him, the cultural problem he wished to solve, and the perception that music was not just another type of art or entertainment but a geist that could reshape hearts and minds, or even whole societies. Even as his admiration for Schopenhauer and Wagner waned, the love of music - and exaltation of music to the highest importance in his philosophy - remained consistent, even to the bitter end of his life. BONUS SEGMENT: I also set aside a half hour to talk about my experiences returning to the world of underground touring. In the latter part of the episode, I recount the events of my recent outing with my band, Destroyer of Light, on the West Coast of the United States.\n\nEpisode art: Francis Coates Jones, \"Music\"\n\nYunus Tuncel's Lecture Notes, \"Nietzsche, Music and Silent Suffering\": https://www.nietzschecircle.com/Silent_Suffering.html\n\nCharlie Huenemann's book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EL4T2I/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1",

    "description": "Support the show at Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nJoin me in a discussion of passage 109 of Daybreak: \"Self-Control and Moderation and Their Final Motive\". In this passage that we've oft referenced but not yet attempted a deep dive of, Nietzsche outlines six ways of dealing with the \"vehemence of a drive\". As Nietzsche considers the self to be governed by impulses, some of which are competing, we should not expect that we can simply command ourselves with a voluntarily governing ego, or somehow will ourselves into having willpower. He also rejects the Christian abdication of responsibility: i.e., that every person is inherently sinful and shall only find perfection in the next life, and therefore all men must simply yield to the grace of God. For Nietzsche, the picture of the human condition is akin to that of William James: we are bundles of habits, and every little nourishment or denial of a habit either enhances or diminishes it. This is the way that drives make war against one another within the psyche: by drawing in more nourishment for themselves at the expense of the others. The question of self-control then becomes a question of how to consciously bring about the nourishment or diminishment of one's impulses. Today's episode covers the practical question of \"giving style to one's character\".\n\n\n\nArt: Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard Pass, 20 May 1800/Musee de l'Histoire de France",

    "description": "The second part of The Nietzsche Podcast’s discussion of The Overman, episode 33. \n\nSupport the show on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nIn the second of our examination of the Overman, we'll examine a passage I'd originally planned to look at in respect to the eternal recurrence of the same events: The Convalescent. This chapter of Thus Spoke Zarathustra deals with both of these grand doctrines of Nietzsche - the Overman and the eternal return - and provides, in some sense, the means for understanding both in relationship to one another. It may seem, from a surface reading of Nietzsche's ideas, that the Overman represents some goal in a literal future, which would seem to contradict with the doctrine that \"all returns, eternally\" and every life repeats endlessly, contained forever within itself. How can the value in life be cast off into a distant future, while at the same time invested within this life? This is the contradiction Nietzsche faced because it is a contradiction in the very essence of the quest for meaning: we find meaning only in spending our lives in the service of something greater than ourselves, in the very quest to bring forth that \"something greater\"; and yet, at the same time, the brute fact of mortality and the sole existence of this world and this life as the total reality necessitates that we must be able to find value in our lives as they are, never to see that \"something greater\" that they may or may not give rise to. We must therefore live in such a way that we recognize becoming, and seek to overcome ourselves, but must also simultaneously find eudaimonia within ourselves as we are. This paradox of finding meaning in an atheistic universe is overcome with the resurrection story of Zarathustra himself, who lies dead for many days before rising again to gain a realization of the secret, underlying harmony of the eternal return and Overman ideals.\n\nJoin me in making \"The Convalescent\" a new passion play for we philosophers of the future! \n\nA review of Rohit Sharma's book that covers the major points discussed in the episode, with citations: http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/jns/reviews/rohit-sharma-on-the-seventh-solitude.-endless-becoming-and-eternal-return-in-the-poetry-of-friedrich-nietzsche",

    "description": "Support us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nThis is the last great concept of Nietzsche's that we have not yet covered on the podcast. With all of the background context that we've collected over the first season and the first part of this one, I feel we're now ready to confront the pinnacle of Nietzsche's philosophy, the highest ideal, and the most sacred value: the Overman. Contrary to popular belief, the Overman is not a figure that has ever existed within recorded history: Zarathustra says that Caesar, Napoleon, Frederick the Great, Goethe, Socrates, Jesus, or whoever else you may have had in mind as a candidate for Overman, were all found to be, in the end, \"human, all-too-human\". Zarathustra is also, according to his own sermons, not the Overman himself, but merely his prophet (which would seem to rule out Nietzsche himself as an Overman, in spite of what some have claimed). Zarathustra insists: \"Never has there yet been an Overman\" - the concept is an ideal image that must ever recede into the future, in order to spur us on to greater and greater things. Lest one take this for a biological concept, or a literal race of future super-humans which Nietzsche is prophecying,even here, we must say that the text defies this interpretation: Zarathustra only speaks of the Overman in the singular, individual form, and speaks of its meaning in terms of creating value in our own lives, today. The meaning, apparently, is not in literally bringing forth overmen, but in living our lives in such a way as to \"prepare the earth\" for the Overman. \n\nHow do we square the circle of the future-arriving Overman with the non-progressive view of history? How do we understand the Overman in relation to his opposition, the Last Man? What do both represent? Is the Overman an answer to Nietzsche's quest to elevate man? And if so, how? Is it to be taken as a symbol, a metaphor, an allegory, or what? Join me in this long awaited episode when we tackle all of these difficult questions by diving deeply into the text itself. Today we concern ourselves mostly with the first two books of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and especially the prologue.",

This is Nietzsche’s charge, in his later work: what we imagine drives the philosopher, the “will to truth“, is instead a sublimation of the will to power. The philosopher seeks to experience his power in an abstract realm of the intellect, where he can seek for higher and higher goals. But where does this assessment leave the philosopher? If a pure, disinterested drive to knowledge is not what is behind the goals of philosophy, then can we really credit the philosopher with attempting to render a picture of universal existence? Is it a paradox to say that relativism is universal? Is it still truth-seeking if we question the very activity of truth-seeking?

    "description": "Support us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nWho is the artist? Where does art come from? What is the future of art? Doing a comprehensive view of Nietzsche’s take on artists is probably too big a topic for any one episode, so here we will concern ourselves primarily with these questions, the answers to which all involve the idea that the artist is a sort of alchemist of the psyche, who works with the raw material of the soul in order to channel, redirect, heighten or deaden one’s inner feelings. The artist thus emerges from the type of the priest or the saint, who worked with the feelings of guilt and resentment. The artist is the type who emerges from the restrictions of a given religious mindset and dares to work his artistic magic outside of any institution or dogma. Is the artist therefore a benefit to society and culture, and a rebel against the rigidness of religion? For Nietzsche, it’s not that simple, because of the fundamental problem that art deceives. It draws its power from its incompleteness, its willingness to represent reality in accordance with drives or passions instead of facts, and ultimately dwells within the realm of deception. As Nietzsche himself is both an artist and a philosopher, he feels this contradiction therefore within him. Alas, the great philosopher, Nietzsche, is only fool, only poet! \n\nLecture on the scientific contributions of alchemy by Walter F.

The Symposium is one of the most popular Platonic dialogues, which considers the topic of love, and the nature of the god Eros, who represents love as a metaphysical or divine force. While those who have only a passing familiarity with Nietzsche may be surprised to hear that the pitiless philosopher was enamored with a conversation about the finer points of love and romance, in fact, Plato's Symposium is rich with insights that had a profound impact on Nietzsche. Central to the conversation in the Symposium is the understanding of the power of love - for love, as with all things the Greeks perceived as forces within the psyche that pushed or motivated mankind, is evidence of a divine influence that grips human beings and makes its will upon us felt.",

    "description": "Support the show on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\nThe eternal return, also known as the eternal recurrence, is one of the most famous ideas of Nietzsche, but one of the most difficult to comprehend. How could this philosopher who made it his business to attack every provisional truth, point out the perspectival nature of our world-picture, and dare to suggest that we abolish the metaphysical world beyond... make the proclamation that our lives, exactly as we live them, are eternal? There are many interpretations of this doctrine - ranging from the classification of eternal return as a thought experiment, all the way into mystical territory - but one thing is made crystal clear by Nietzsche's own words: he held that it was the hardest challenge one could put before themselves, akin to facing the greatest stress, or fighting the toughest opponent. Embracing eternal return means the ultimate revaluation of life and the natural world as imminently good and worthwhile. Those who are unable to do so will find this doctrine crippling, or so Nietzsche predicts. Thus, he puts this mysterious teaching into his work in the form of fables and in the teachings of his prophet, Zarathustra. Nietzsche founds his answer to the \"problem of life\" - that is to say, the problem of the value of a human life, within a mortal, human existence finding some kind of transcendental value - upon the basis of this central idea, of the eternal return.

    "title": "NIETZSCHE’S THE ANTICHRIST (1888): In-Depth Analysis - The Revaluation of All Values",
    "description": "A deep dive into The Antichrist by Friedrich Nietzsche. Taken from episodes 22 & 23 of The Nietzsche Podcast. \n\nThe Antichrist (1888) is one of the last books Nietzsche wrote before losing his sanity the next year. It serves as the culmination of a decade or more of Nietzsche's thoughts on morality, Christianity, and the need for a revaluation of values. This project - of finding or defining a new set of values by which man could live - was something about which Nietzsche was deeply ambivalent. On the one hand, some sort of moral direction is required for ascending life. It is essential that the philosophers of the future find some means of pushing their way through the stage of relativism, or \"active nihilism\". But such a project would be to ignore the contingency of all our moral beliefs; worse yet, by outlining a new values-structure, Nietzsche will have to think and work systematically. But Nietzsche's thinking is by its nature anti-systematic. As a result, numerous contradictions come to the forefront in his philosophical outlook, not all of which are neatly resolved.\n\nHowever, what we find as key to understanding the work is the opposition we discussed in the previous episode: of Dionysus v/s The Crucified One. The opposition is between the Dionysian morality of which gives a rough sketch, based on life, overcoming and will to power, and the Christian morality which is defined negatively and as the decline of all of these things. He uses this opposition to illuminate the true nature of the Christian religion and to argue for the values that he finds to be badly needed by the modern man. In the course of this moral revaluation, Nietzsche gives a theory of decadence: how empires behave during their decline and collapse. His various considerations lead him to the conclusion that all of the most cherished productions of our society, our highest values, our human ideals, art, philosophy, music, education, and our whole morality - are products of decadence, and thus of weakness. He thus calls into question the value of abstract thinking, and indeed the value of our faculty for conscious thought. \n\nUnlike most critics of the Christian religion, Nietzsche devotes very little time to the refutation of the arguments for Christianity's truth, or the supposed evidence for the historicity of Jesus. Instead, Nietzsche is laser-focused on the effect of the Christian doctrine of pity, and its character as a totally life-denying force. Jesus, for Nietzsche, is the ultimate life-denying figure: the apotheosis of pity. Through his torture and death at teh hands of the Romans, which he does not resist, he became a mimetic example for the spread of this moral contagion. \"Resist not evil\" is, in Nietzsche's argument, the entire key to the doctrine of the gospels, and the explanation Jesus' profound difference from other gods - even from the God of the Old Testament. Because he was so extraordinary, even the later Christians never measured up to Jesus' complete defiance of the natural world. \n\n\"An instinctual hatred of reality\" is how Nietzsche describes Jesus. Rather than a \"hero\", Jesus does not fight, resist, or oppose. He lives in the immanent knowledge of his salvation. \"The kingdom of heaven is within you\". The later message that was spread was a corruption of this way of life only ever attained to by Jesus. The effect that this religion of pity had on the hearts of the cruel, European barbarians, meanwhile, was to harness their cruelty and turn it inward. With the rejection of all value in the external world, only the internal has meaning. With no external fights, the only fight of any importance becomes the fight against one's own sin. This fight endlessly multiplies the suffering of the world and makes it ever more questionable and worthy of denial: the follower of Christ yearns for some release to this tension, some relief from the endless suffering he lives within. As bleak as all of this sounds, contained in this message, Nietzsche's own \"gospel\" as it were, or good news, is that if pity is only added on to life, ersatz - that means it is possible that it can be removed. Through this revaluation, maybe we can finally be free of the weakness that has crippled the once strong and beautiful psyche of humanity.\n\nAlan Watts on Jesus: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JEr8UTnlY5E\n\nHilary Putnam on Quine and Ontology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhHIVEN839s\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #christianity #atheism #dionysus #paganism #morality #bookreview",

    "description": "At the deepest foundations, Nietzsche believes that mankind moralizes from the same underlying, driving force that is behind all life: the will to power. We will explore just what the will to power means, which Zarathustra says is synonymous with the process of self-overcoming. We will then examine how it is that the will to power produces our second-order drives, such as the will to truth, or the drive to obey the community's morality. We'll conclude by examining the practical applications of Nietzsche's level of \"moral meta-analysis\", how we can use this analysis to turn a critical eye to different world-historical moral systems, and, finally, what this understanding will to power means for our lives.\n\nThis episode draws on the arguments of Walter Kaufmann from his book, Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.

    "description": "This week, we approach one of the most infamous ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche: the dual-prehistory of the morality we follow today. Throughout his career, Nietzsche had an inkling that the origins of our moral ideas did not follow a clean, neat pattern -- a single course of development from a single origin. Rather, we have inherited moral ideas that come from different and competing values structures. Even within a single heart, Nietzsche writes, these two opposed origins sometimes make war with one another, which is Nietzsche's attempt at explaining one of the reasons why we experience states of dividedness and moral dilemmas. In this episode, we'll compare some of his earlier work towards answering this question, found in Human, All Too Human and Beyond Good & Evil, then proceed to tackle the first essay of Genealogy of Morality, which is his most rigorous and famous attempt at wrestling with this topic.",

Even without realizing it, we take for granted the moral prejudices of our own times. For better or worse, language and the cultural software we inherit both play a role in shaping our thought. For all these reasons, philosophers of all ages have fallen victim to habitual errors: of beginning from the conclusion, of inverting the effect and cause, in assuming that if something gladdens the heart, it must be true. In this episode, we’re doing a deep dive into the Nietzschean method for understanding habitual errors in philosophical thinking. With the toolkit Nietzsche provides, we can dissect the propositions of philosophers, religions and cultures. Our main targets in this episode will be Kant and Schopenhauer, Nietzsche’s influences and treasures of German philosophy — but after all, one repays a teacher badly if he remains a student only!",

And supposing that we cannot do without history, are there uses for it which are helpful? Are there uses which are harmful? Today we take a deep dive into the Untimely Meditations essay, On the Use and Abuse of History for Life. In this essay, Nietzsche reveals his love of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the famous German playwright and author of Faust. This essay is a statement of Nietzsche’s allegiance to one side of German culture - embodied in the likes of Goethe and Schopenhauer - against another thread spun out of the tradition of German Idealism, represented by Hegel. In Goethe, Nietzsche finds the all-important maxim that all learning must be in the service of quickening one’s activity and enriching one’s life.\n\nEpisode art: Clio, by Gentileschi Artemisia (1632).

    "title": "François de la Rochefoucauld’s “Moral Maxims” and influence on Friedrich Nietzsche",
    "description": "It's another episode about a Nietzsche influence. This time, rather than talking about a philosopher from Ancient Greece, we found one from the Ancien Régime: Francois de La Rochefoucauld, the author of the Moral Maxims. Like fellow French philosopher Jean de La Bruyère, La Rochefoucauld is \"a man of one book\". The Maxims - a volume that is about sixty pages in length - is his sole contribution to the Western philosophical canon. Yet, solely on the basis of this work, Voltaire praised La Rochefoucauld as the greatest master of language since the revival of letters. We'll briefly consider Rochefoucauld's life as a background for his work, study a few central epigrams and his prefaratory essay on self-love in order to lay the groundwork of his thought, compare his ideas to those of Nietzsche's, then take a quick look at a selection of his epigrams of my own choosing. La Rochefoucauld's style was to write in very short epigrams, often merely a sentence-long. The content of his work is concerned with a number of themes, among them: self-love as the explanation of all human action; the rule of thumb that our true motives are usually concealed from ourselves; that our virtues are often merely our vices in a disguised form. Thus, La Rochefoucauld has the distinction among Nietzsche's influences, insofar as he influenced Nietzsche both in style and substance. Ironically, the author of the Moral Maxims may have been an immoralist to prefigure Nietzsche. After all, he was one of the first psychologists... and isn't psychology inherently a vice?",

    "description": "In this clip from Untimely Reflections conversation series on The Nietzsche Podcast, #8 with Hans-Georg Moeller, Keegan asks the professor about the kneejerk reaction that many are sure to have about his assertion that our society is switching from a culture that uses authenticity as a means of building the self to a culture that uses profilicity, or the curation of public profiles. Because of the assumptions that are part and parcel with our language, we naturally will believe that the \"real self\" is the \"authentic self\". Professor Moeller's answer involves a consideration of the ways in which traditional societies viewed the self, which was not within the authenticity model, using the example of the differing ways in which an authentic versus a sincerity culture views art. \n\nCarefree Wandering: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnEuIogVV2Mv6Q1a3nHIRsQ\n\nThe Nietzsche Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE",

    "title": "Schopenhauer & Nietzsche: Overcoming Pessimism",
    "description": "A deep dive into the influence of Schopenhauer on Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche talks at great length about the inspiration he took from Schopenhauer in his essay, \"Schopenhauer as Educator\", which is the topic of the first part of this video. Nietzsche pondered the question: \"How can human life become transcendentally valuable without the divine?\" . He saw nature, as Schopenhauer did, as driven by blind willing, and did not necessarily see consciousness as an elevation beyond this blind willing, in and of itself. Schopenhauer, in his life and thought, gave Nietzsche the insight that man is not redeemed by knowing alone, but by an act of redirecting the will. Man is elevated by the example of the \"sincere men who have cast out the beast\", the artists, saints and philosophers - who represent the world in concepts, and use discipline to overcome or sublimate their impulses.\n\nThe second half of the talk concerns Nietzsche's criticisms of Schopenhauer. Deeper than this, Nietzsche felt himself to have a fundamentally opposite evaluation of the world from Schopenhauer. \"How differently Dionysus spoke to me!\" he wrote, as he reflected in the late 1880s of his early association with the \"romanticism\" of Wagner and the \"pessimism\" of Schopenhauer - but says that he realized he was looking for something far different from what either of his mentors sought. Nietzsche, through his study and admiration for Schopenhauer, eventually learned to overcome Schopenhauer, and overcome pessimism, and set him on his quest to find a way to spiritualize and affirm life.\n\nTaken from episode 20 of the Nietzsche podcast: https://open.spotify.com/episode/3m1jZmvaI3XacmdDFsIaxb?si=8200a07b6d7440de\n\nAnd from episode 21 of the Nietzsche podcast: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6V2sH2pe6E21DEZbYgW1qT?si=e975ffe8f59b416a\n\n#schopenhauer #nietzsche #pessimism #philosophy #meaningoflife",

    "title": "Nietzsche’s Critique of Free Will EXPLAINED: Why Nietzsche exchanged “moral responsibility” for Fate",
    "description": "A key to comprehending many of Nietzsche's core ideas is rarely talked about, or sometimes willfully ignored: Nietzsche's rejection of free will and embrace of fatalism, or what he called the \"love of fate\". In Nietzsche's view, the conception of free will that is most common is that of viewing ourselves as an ego-consciousness, that acts as a voluntary and autonomous governor over the body and its drives. This view of the self is incorrect in Nietzsche's view, because the ego-consciousness is not master over the drives, but created from their raw material, as a \"surface and skin\" which often does more to conceal the true causes of our actions than to reveal it. The conscious motive as the cause of our actions (themselves mere effects) is what Nietzsche identifies as one of his \"great errors\" of thought in Twilight of Idols. \n\nOn the other hand, there is the noble view of one's freedom, which comes from possessing power and the ensuing experience of seeing one's will realized in its aims. From this experience of freedom in a physical, material, political sense, man extrapolated to the idea of libertarian free will. However, Nietzsche is careful to distinguish this impulse to believing in free will from the impulse which comes from a very different source: Christianity. This is all the more common basis for freedom of the will these days: the conviction that we are minds driving bodies, an uncaused cause which presides over decision-making, independently of the age or culture. In short, the idea that everyone has true moral choices over which they deliberate in a truly independent way. The sentiment behind this sort of free will, in Nietzsche's view, is the desire to hold people accountable for their actions: to make human beings \"morally responsible\". It is through this doctrine that great errors of thought tyrannized over men's minds for millennia. \n\nAs Nietzsche writes in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he dreams that one day man may be delivered from revenge. The alternative to this way of thinking is amor fati, the love of fate: embracing one's life exactly as it is and as they have lived it, and affirming it. While no one authors himself, he may still choose to love what has been authored by nature and by existence. In this in-depth talk drawn from episode ten of the Nietzsche podcast, Keegan explains all of this, and more.\n\nListen to the episode on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6xLub4g8qD29E0ncFybIYf\n\nSupport the show on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections\n\n#nietzsche #freewill #philosophy #determinism",

As Nietzsche was fond of saying, however, all the main points of his philosophy are covered at one point or another in his Zarathustra — and so this week’s episode takes its name from a passage in Zarathustra, wherein the titular character says “there is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy”. \n\nThe Nietzschean view of the self is that the body and its instincts are primary, in contrast to the Enlightenment view of the mind as primary. For Nietzsche, the rational consciousness is a narrator which merely gives an after-the-fact explanation. The true person is the body and its unconscious, irrational drives. This view of the self subverts many of our presuppositions about the power of reason, and about man’s free will. \n\nEpisode art: Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, courtesy of Wikimedia commons.",

But, when it comes to Nietzsche, I’m afraid that he’s responsible for more distortions and damage to the popular understanding of Nietzsche than anyone else in recent memory. Rather than using the metaphor of God’s death in a “sorrowful” manner as Peterson suggests, Nietzsche saw the death of God as a beautiful opportunity for free spirits, and welcomed it on that account. Even though God’s death will lead to horrifying developments, like the collapse of the moral values system of the West, there is the possibility for us to overcome the old values and create something new. In many respects, Peterson harnesses Nietzsche’s ideas for the exact opposite purposes intended by Nietzsche himself. \n\nOverall, the message is to try reading a damn book for once, and not to get your ideology from the internet.",

    "title": "NIETZSCHE on TRUTH: What JORDAN PETERSON gets WRONG",
    "description": "Did Nietzsche believe that “Truth ought to serve life”? In fact, in Nietzsche’s works, we find a very different and more nuanced view, in which Nietzsche argues that truth in and of itself is usually harmful to life, and that lies may be needed to support life instead. What public intellectuals such as Dr. Jordan Peterson get right about Nietzsche is often his understanding of the truth as a value contingent on human flourishing, and as referring only to a world of phenomena. But the fatal error in the formulation that “truth ought to serve life” is that the health or life-giving nature of a claim doesn’t actually make it “truer”. In fact, for Nietzsche, the truth value and the life-giving value of a statement must be assessed separately. Oftentimes we find that the truth is harmful to life, and what is life-giving is a lie.\n\nIn spite of this, Nietzsche writes that we must search for a life “as a means to knowledge”, and that the Great Liberator for himself was the idea of a life as an experiment and an adventure in truth-seeking. “Here the ways of men divide: if you wish to strive for happiness and peace of the soul then believe. If you wish to be a disciple of truth, then inquire.”\n\nLearn about all this and more in this episode (episode eight) of the Nietzsche podcast. We cover Nietzsche’s thoughts contained in the essay On Truth and Lies in an Extra-Moral Sense, Human, All Too Human, The Gay Science, Beyond Good and Evil, and some of his unpublished notes found in Will to Power. We also briefly discuss Von Helmholtz and the Neo-Kantian movement in the German sciences. \n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE?si=JsItoVxJRh2XVWvzm9lQcA\n\nSupport us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/untimelyreflections",

This event is the Death of God, one of Nietzsche's most important ideas and one which lays the groundwork for understanding his thought, and where he saw himself in the context of Western Philosophy. While it is often the case that great attention is given to the infamous passage entitled, \"The Madman\" - and we'll spend a good amount of time on this passage in this very episode - this particular story is only the first step into the many implication's of God's death. And, of course, we will not be able to get through the episode without addressing ourselves to the elephant in the room, one Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, who has suggested that the Death of God was a sorrowful event for Nietzsche. On the contrary, Nietzsche celebrated the myriad possibilities laid open for humanity, for all the dangers that this entailed, such as the civilizational descent into nihilism.\n\nThis episode's art is Diogenes by Dutch painter Jan Victors (1619 – 1679)\n\n#nietzsche #godisdead #jordanpeterson #philosophy #atheism #religion",

    "description": "In this episode, we discuss the character of The Wanderer. The Wanderer appeared in multiple Nietzsche works, mainly during the period from Human, All Too Human, through The Gay Science. Evidently Nietzsche identified himself with this character. The wandering that Nietzsche did throughout Europe, and while hiking the Alps, paralleled the metaphor of 'philosophical wandering' in Nietzsche's work. We'll also discuss a potential inspiration for Nietzsche, in the motif of \"wanderers\" in German culture. The significance of philosophical wandering as Nietzsche's approach to philosophy is that Nietzsche's project ends up looking very different from that of most other philosophers. Episode art is Caspar David Friedrich's Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer.\n\nVisit us at Anchor, here: https://anchor.fm/untimely-reflections\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0ZARzVCRfJZDCyeKjvIEfE\n\n#nietzsche #philosophy #history #existentialism #morality #religion #atheism",

    "description": "Welcome to The Nietzsche Podcast! In this first episode, we introduce Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), through the passage, \"How the True World Finally Became a Fable\", from his book, The Twilight of Idols. In this passage, Nietzsche sketches the history of a particular error in Western philosophy: the error of metaphysics. Nietzsche establishes himself as an anti-metaphysical philosopher, who is against all doctrines of a \"True World\" that lies beyond our own. In this episode, we touch upon the ideas and historical context of Plato, Descartes, Kant, Schopenhauer, and others.
