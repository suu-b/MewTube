The entire class is available for free on the BibleProject app at https://classroom-beta.bibleproject.com/introduction-to-the-hebrew-bible.\n\nHow can we read the Old Testament and understand the meaning its ancient authors intended? \n\nThese two simple ideas are at the core of the process.\n1. The Old Testament is an ancient text.\n2.  A text is intentional literary communication. \n\nWe interpret every text we read through the lens of our mental storehouse, or the \"encyclopedia\" of words, ideas, images, and stories stowed in our memories. But the biblical authors have their own encyclopedias from which they produce texts. So if we want to understand the authors' intended meaning, we will adapt our “encyclopedia of reception” by learning about the authors' “encyclopedia of production.” Dive into this class session with Dr. Tim Mackie and start developing tools for encountering the Old Testament on its own terms.",

When we study this chapter, we can discover how the writers of the Bible understood the structure of the world and its origins \n\nIn Hebrew, the word for \"earth\" ('erets) typically means land rather than a globe or sphere floating in space. The raqia' is the solid dome above the land that holds back the waters above, and the creation of the raqia' creates a place where life can flourish.

    "description": "After Jesus’ disciples receive the Holy Spirit, they become God’s temple and the physical embodiment of Jesus on Earth. The New Testament writers show us that followers of Jesus carry the responsibility to live as royal priests forward into eternity, reclaiming the lost calling God gave humanity to represent him and rule the world on his behalf. And the story of the Bible ends where it began: in a garden with humans serving and ruling as God’s royal priests forever.\n\n#BibleProject #Priest #RoyalPriest\n\nFor more information on The Royal Priesthood, check out the following resources:\n\n-The Royal Priesthood Study Notes: https://tbp.xyz/priesthoodnotes\n-The Royal Priesthood Script References: https://tbp.xyz/priesthoodscript\n-The Royal Priesthood Podcast episode: https://tbp.xyz/priesthoodpod\n-The Royal Priesthood Blog post: https://tbp.xyz/priesthoodblogpost",

Why do you call seraphim \"snakes\" instead of \"burning ones?\"\n\n3. (13:06) Wasn't The Satan named Lucifer? Where did the name \"Lucifer\" come from?\n\n4. (19:22) Why do you say \"The Satan\" instead of just \"Satan?\" Why did translators leave out the \"The\" when translating the Bible?\n\n5. (24:42) When the world was created, God said it was \"good.\" Why did you say The Satan brings creation back into chaos and death in the video?\n\n6.

It was meant to comfort and/or challenge God's people. \n\nJohn says he was exiled on the island of Patmos, where he saw a vision of the risen Jesus standing among seven burning lights. The image, adapted from Zechariah 4, is a symbol of seven churches in Asia Minor. Jesus addressed the specific problems facing each church, and warned them that a \"tribulation\" was upon the churches that would force them to choose between compromise and faithfulness. In the midst of persecution, Jesus calls the churches to faithfulness.\n\n#BibleProject #biblebookoverviews #prophecy #revelation #endtimes #apocalypse #newtestament #revelations #secondcoming #eschatology #biblevideo #biblevideos #bookofrevelation",
