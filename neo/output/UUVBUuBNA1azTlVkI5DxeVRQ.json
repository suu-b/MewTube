It's also about his faith in Jesus and how knowing God and trusting his Word motivated him to give up worldly riches.\n\nRecorded on 5/22/22",

Moderated by JD Bauman.\nwww.eaforchristians.org\n\nTalk: 1:15 - 28:17\n\nQ&A:\n\nQuestion 1: 28:42 Do you think personal changes, like going zero-waste or electric cars, useful? Or just not effective enough for time and money?\nQuestion 2: 30:13 How can a pro-growth strategy for climate change address the christian aims of justice, meaning, the impacts on the poor and the west's historic emissions?\nQuestion 3: 31:46 What role, if any, can EA play in for-profit innovation in climate change mitigation?\nQuestion 4: 32:23 God asked us to be good stewards and to cultivate and tend for the earth. Why should we pursue growth, which usually means more humans in a worse earth?\n________\nDr. Dominic Roser is a senior lecturer at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Ethics and Human Rights of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.

    "title": "How Should Christians Think about Existential Risk? | Brian Green |Effective Altruism for Christians",
    "description": "This talk is about how Christians ought to approach existential risks (e.g. nuclear disaster, catastrophic global pandemics, etc.).\nThe speaker's views aren't necessarily the views of EACH but are intended for discussion to help Christians in EA make up their own minds.\n\nThis talk was hosted by EA for Christians. \nwww.eaforchristians.org\n\nTalk: 0:00 - 16:20\n\nQ&A:\n\nQuestion 1: 16:43 Even if humans have the freedom to sin grievously, should Christians be at least less concerned about existential risk compared to secular effective altruists? Esp. given the biblical end times.\nQuestion 2: 18:30 Dominic Roser argued that longtermism, if stretched too far in time, is presumptuous. Then where is the line? Decades, centuries?\nQuestion 3: 20:51​ Given that only a few people will ever be in the position of launching a nuclear missile, what can the average person do to avoid existential risks?\nQuestion 4: 24:54 Some Christian seem to define near existential risks scenarios as bringing about the second coming. Should we be worried that avoiding existential risks avoids God’s plans?\nQuestion 5: 27:28 Would you agree that Christians have stronger reasons to fight anthropogenic risks than natural ones?\nQuestion 6: 29:44 To what extent has past research on global pandemic risk helped during the covid crisis? Should we just optimize for existential risks at and when they arrive?\n\n________\nDr. Brian Patrick Green is the director of technology ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. His work is focused on the ethics of technology, including AI and space exploration. \n\nHe is also a member of the Safety-Critical AI working group at the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society.\n\nOriginally given on April 24 2021 at the EA for Christians 2021 Conference",
