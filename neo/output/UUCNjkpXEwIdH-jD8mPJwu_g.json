    "description": "At 43:43, I realized that my comments need clarification. I believe that Mary would receive this prayer through Christ's power over heaven and earth and her Son would ultimately bring it to the Father. I'm being very specific here, because I believe it is God the Son who mediates between man and God the Father over something like \"mercy\" and \"forgiveness\". She would lovingly pass along this request of mine to the One who pleads my cause before the Father (1 John 2:1). I am simply glad that her motherly intercession was in the process. She would pray/speak to God (the Son) and God (the Father) would receive it. I think this is also the best way to understand the quote at the end: the saints, who have experienced Theosis/Christosis, bring my prayer to God and it is God the Son who pleads my case to the Father. Christ is absolutely essential in this process, because the saint on their own has no \"pleading\" power before The Father. That's the power of the Son. \n\nAs I mentioned in the video, we all speak shorthand when we are comfortable or think our surrounding context would make sense of a specific comment. I hope that people will understand what I meant there just as Gavin had corrected me on the meaning of his comment \"Typology isn't fulfillment.\"\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/intellectualcatholicism\r\nPodcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/intellectual-conservatism/id1550879909 \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/intellectualcatholicism\r\n\r\nSuan Sonna is a Baptist convert to Catholicism who is dedicated to curating the best Catholic intellectual content on philosophy, politics, and theology.

    "title": "The Final Episode of Intellectual Conservatism: How the Incarnation led me to the Catholic Church",
    "description": "The doctrine of the Incarnation is not only my favorite Christian belief but the one that played the largest role in my conversion to Catholicism. The Incarnation shows us that humanity and divinity are not permanently at odds. Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. He is a divine person, the Word, who became incarnate. The Incarnation, of course, does not confuse or mix humanity and divinity. Jesus is nevertheless one perfect reality (3:42), as He is truly God and truly man without that being a contradiction in terms, without calling into question His divinity and His humanity, perfectly accomplishing our salvation. \n\nFor even His death tore the veil in the temple, signifying that heaven and earth were no longer infinitely divided. His resurrection prefigures our own hope of one day conquering death by being made like Him and by being partakers of the divine nature. The Catholic Church is often accused of saying of humans what should only be said of God - \"infallibility\", \"immaculate\", etc.  However, these critiques demonstrate a misunderstanding or even an implicit denial of the Incarnation. God has shared His own divine life with humanity through His Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Catholic Church is simply the logical conclusion of the Incarnation. \n\nI have been blessed to have led Intellectual Conservatism. I submitted to the authority of scripture and Christ in high school when I converted from being progressive to a pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, and natural law conservative Christian. I once again submitted everything to the Lord in college when I realized that He built the Catholic Church 2,000 years ago. I prayed that God would give me fresh eyes to look at the evidence, to remove any prejudices against Catholicism, to make me humble like a child. My conversion cost me so much, but I gained everything by finding the fullness of what Christ intended. The Catholic Church is so much greater than I could have ever imagined. \n\nI am entering the Dominican Order, because I believe that Christ can complete the human soul. I have fallen so deeply in love with the Church that I want to discern how I can serve Christ's bride forever. I have fallen so deeply in love with Christ that I want to sacrifice everything that I am for Him.",
