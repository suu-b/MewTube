Please go check out his channel.\nGive him some LOVE and SUB! \n\nThe fascists are destroying the world and atheist/skeptic creators, when they \"play nice\" with them are sleeping with the enemy and betraying the values they claim to have. \n\n@MindShift-Brandon  Brandon is too smart to not see the problem with his love fest for Alex. \n\nThe message of Jesus was simple: Non-Jews are \"dogs\" (that's the N-word of the day, folks) and he came for \"his\" people, not the dogs (the \"others\").\n\nRead Luke 19:27 and see the plan Jesus has for non-believers, also Rev 19.\nIt's GENOCIDE. Jesus' plan is no different than any other totalitarian genocidal manic.\n\nWanting Jesus or Christianity to be \"true\" and finding any \"goodness\" in Christianity is to accept evil and to promote evil.\n\nChristianity is EVIL. \n\nChristianity is bad for humanity.\n\nThere is NOTHING redeeming or good about Christianity. It's like cancer or small pox.",

Being there EVERY DAY.\nNone of this \"hiddenness is good\" because of \"reason, reason, reason.\"\n\nLiving for someone means:\n\nMaking them breakfast. \nChanging their diapers. \nPlaying with them. \nHolding them. \nListening to them.\nNot being silent.\nPretty much being the opposite of the example we find in the writings about the supposed Christian God. \n\nF the Jesus and the donkey he rode in on. \nHe is weak. \n\nWe who reject human sacrifice as a means to pay for our responsibilities are strong. \n\nTo god-men and their self-proclaimed representatives, I say, “f@#K you, I won’t do what you tell me!”\n\n\nHey All! \n\nIf you've wondered where I've been, well, raising a baby and writing novel. \nBut daunting tasks.\n\nI can't do much YouTube stuff these days, but I'm still around, still check out comments, and I hope to do a little more with updates on Stephen and the amazing adventure of being one of his parents.\n\nFYI: He has the BEST mom in the universe.

Help fight bigotry.\n#exchristian #deconstruction #atheist #apologetics \n\n In the last installment of this series, I talk to Triboulet @nowthatsdebatablepodcast ​\n\nFor this discussion, I asked creators to view a short video I made for them to understand where I was coming from and my questions about the topic. To skip the intro, go to 7:55 where the interview starts.\n\nWhen each of the other full interviews release, those videos will be listed here:\n\n@pocketlocker86 \nhttps://youtu.be/ApBa5ceSE28\n@StanGreyTRQ \nhttps://youtu.be/bYeVj92hQG0\n@BlackNonbelieversInc\nhttps://youtu.be/0AtGdZwMr_U\n@ichapod \nhttps://youtu.be/bVwwrRL9Mnw\n@VolcyThoughts \nCynthia McDonald https://linktr.ee/camglamming\n@BlackAtheistRants \n@BlackFemaleAtheist \n@nowthatsdebatablepodcast\n\n\nThe video that I made in response to the ahistorical nonsensical (and racist, in my view) claims of Mike  @InspiringPhilosophy and Than @ExploringReality responding to @maklelan  be found here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/unoMvayYG3s\n\nEssentially Mike and Than argue that Black Americans should be thankful to Christians for \"ending slavery\" and that \"Christianity\" was the primary and driving force behind abolition. \n\nOf course in order to sell this racist bigoted garbage, they have to lie, gaslight, and pretend to be intellectuals. \n\nDon't buy it. \n\nWe can see they're lying by simply going to primary documents and reading about history, something the know the vast majority of their sheeple audience simply will not bother with doing. \n\nIn my research I discovered even I was saying things that were wrong because I've been so conditioned by American schooling and Christian teaching, for example Wilberforce, when he argued for \"abolition\" the thing he was arguing for was the end of the transatlantic slave trade. \n\nAbolition to Wilberforce was ending the slave trade, the word was used to argue for the end of the slave trade, not the ending of slavery, something he did want, but didn't fight for directly, as he knew Christians would not end slavery without going incrementally. \n\nThe other realization during my studies, and I've barely scratched the surface, is that it was Quakers who were the first to argue for abolition (and they influenced people like Wilberforce). \n\nSo saying \"Christianity\" ended slavery is like saying Christianity did X --- X being anything like teaching that the wine really turns to the blood of Jesus or that proper worship happens on Saturday morning or any issue that Christians are divided on. \n\nSee?\n\nYou don't say \"Christians teach that speaking in tongues is an important part of worship and a sign of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,\" you say that \"Pentecostals\" teach this thing, so likewise, if you're going to be accurate, you cannot say, \"Christians ended slavery.\"\n\nOr that \"Christianity\" was the primary force for abolition.\n\nYou must say something like \"Quakers were instrumental in the abolition movement.\"\n\nAnd if you want to be really accurate, just add, \"and they were fighting a Christian majority, most other denominations in fact, who believed and taught slavery was God's design and  not a sin.\" \n\nChristians today who rightfully hate slavery are in opposition to most Christians in most of history as well as the clear teachings in their own Bible.",

But many on the left care little for nuance. We are angry. And rightfully so. But anger often blocks reason and rationality.\n\nPeople don't fit into boxes. And assuming the worst will always make you miss the best. We have to learn how to reach across the aisle. We have to learn how to speak to the hearts and values of others -- not just those who think like us. \n\nWe have to get smarter if we want to grow our numbers.\n\nMy response is that we are growing our numbers, but not through capitulation and unity and hand-holding, but by aggressively arguing for reality over fantasy.",

It's off topic here so I'm not gonna link all the creators and music videos as this video's purpose isn't to critique the music, it's about how we can see how genre is used, how nods, references, call-backs, etc., and how the best writers (this includes those who wrote the gospels) build their work on the work of previous talent.\n\nIt's been that way since the dawn of civ, people, Jesus wasn't unique in any way beyond specifics, in being born to a virgin (done before many times) to dying and rising (done a bunch of times) to miracles and wise sayings, there aint nothing new under the sun.",

From his early days as a male stripper to transforming himself into a bestselling author, speaker, and advocate for redefining relationships. In his twenties, Rob lived a lifestyle that many would envy, but he soon realized that there was more to life than the glitz and glam. He embarked on a journey of personal growth and discovery, which led him to become a leading voice in promoting traditional values within modern relationships.\n\nRob's book, \"Why Waiting Works,\" has received widespread acclaim for its insights into the practical benefits of saving sex for marriage. His YouTube video, '10 Reasons Not To Have Sex Before Marriage,' once held the #1 spot worldwide.\n\nHis new mission is to defend the biblical case for polygamy.  Rob is one of the leading voices in the space and his content delves deep into it’s potential to bring about profound positive changes in our world. One of his more recent videos, “5 Reasons Why Christian Men Should Pursue Polygamy” has been getting attention and raising eyebrows from Christians all over the world.\n\nRob's Website:\nhttps://www.robbkowalski.com/\nTo apply for coaching:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6HM5GGi6Np-n5reh6ZFpEzDi091JheVDVFRDcZNIVc4ztyQ/viewform\n\n\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

    "description": "#christiantheology #christianity #apologetics #atheismwins \n\nSupport the channel here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/michaelbeverly\nMy links:\nhttps://michaelsbeverly.com/\n\nTwo current controversies raging on social media among Christians are clear proof that one of two things must be true:\n\nA. Christianity is a man-made concept and like politics, it divides, destroys, and leads to bigotry and hatreds\n\nB. Most Christians are deceived, wrong, evil, and leading people away from the \"true\" God and perhaps into hell, and the \"saved\" are a tiny minority\n\nThe first controversy is between Gavin Ortlund @TruthUnites and conservative Christian author, Megan Basham, who recently released a book called Shepherds For Sale.\n\nNote the irony in the Gavin's channel name.\n\nIn these two videos, Gavin responds to Megan and her followers:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-3ClEkfP8pM?si=kaowSt56GDED2A99\nhttps://youtu.be/LPUlwF379yA?si=-kHFL8zCoxNQmGov\n\nThe next controversy surrounds friend of the channel, @MikeLiconaOfficial who has come under a vicious attack by fundamentalist @DrBillRoach  who accuses Mike and his supporters of being liars, slanders, and reading between the lies, agents of Satan.\n\nBill Roach's diatribes can be seen here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aQ1DNeDmWr8?si=jjchiurpYWStKUaE\nhttps://youtu.be/L14YyT9M-mc?si=q-rt6tPJ9XaeJkQ3\n\nOne thing is abuntantly clear with all these accusations and hatred flying around:\n\nChristians disagree on every issue and yet have the audacity to tell us they've got a truth claim we outsiders should pay attention to because our lives depend on it.\n\nSorry, Christians, I'll pass on your offer to join your Club of Hatred. \n\nThanks, but no thanks.",

He teaches Old Testament and biblical interpretation and is passionate about helping students grow in their confidence handling the whole Bible as God’s message.\n\nWe're discussing his new book, Modern Genre Theory: An Introduction for Biblical Studies, Zondervan Academic, July 2, 2024 which can be found here on Amazon:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Modern-Genre-Theory-Introduction-Biblical-ebook/dp/B0CMQ9JGS9\n\nAs a sidebar, I might not be finished reading the book in time for the stream, but I am reading it, and it's super facinating. It's also (with a few exceptions that are over my head) readable and relatable and I'm enjoying his style whereas he uses examples from his own life as analogies to teach part of the lesson. \n\n\n\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

    "description": "#apologetics #counterapologetics #christians #atheists \r\n\r\nSupport the Channel here:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/michaelbeverly\r\n\n\nMyOneBlack Friend (MOBF) was born, raised, and educated in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  He attended Ball State University and moved to California in the 1990s to pursue a career as an actor and writer.\n\n  That did not work out at all.\n\n MOBF had a day job that paid much better than the pittance he earned being a movie and TV show extra, and thankfully, his former boss and mentor encouraged him to pursue a career path in finance.  \n\nThat worked much better.  \n\nSwitching from creativity to facts and figures got MOBF to think more critically about the religion that he grew up with. \n\nAlways curious about people of all faiths, MOBF studied several religions alongside some of there adherents and even was baptized in the ocean near Manhattan Beach, California.  After the water dried off, MOBF continued to attend Bible studies, but eventually left that church because it felt too much like a cult.  \n\nA friend from his improv classes introduced him to a New Thought Ancient Wisdom congregation where he attended for several years.  The same friend challenged MOBF on his biblical theology and that caused MOBF to pursue a more serious study of the Bible and he was nearly an Atheist by the time he got past the Tower of Babel. \n\n His reading continued and the New Thought Ancient Wisdom church kept his faith in some kind of god going for a few more years.  Eventually, all of those wonderful loving people in the congregation were not enough to sustain his faith – and no gods volunteered either.\n\nMOBF eventually made his way from god to pod – podcasting that is and is a co-host of “Hot Program” that broadcasts on several platforms including YouTube Sundays at 12:30 Pacific and 3:30 Eastern.  In 2023, MOBF married his Christian sweetheart and she’s probably wrong about the god thing, but too good to pass up otherwise. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also streams regularly with @pocketlocker86  \r\nA sample here:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/8C7xrQ4IdVQ?si=dq_66BtRpqUpYaBJ\n\n\r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

Loftus, a former minister turned atheist, argues we would all be better off if we viewed any religion--including our own--from the informed skepticism of an outsider, a nonbeliever. \n\nFor this reason he has devised \"the outsider test for faith.\" He describes it as a variation on the Golden Rule: \"Do unto your own faith what you do to other faiths.\" \n\nEssentially, this means applying the same skepticism to our own beliefs as we do to the beliefs of other faiths.\n\n Loftus notes that research from psychology, anthropology, sociology, and neuroscience goes a long way toward explaining why the human race has produced so many belief systems, why religion is culturally dependent, and how religion evolved in the first place. \n\nIt's important that people understand these findings to escape the dangerous delusion that any one religion represents the only truth.\n\nAt a time when the vast diversity of human belief systems is accessible to all, the outsider test for faith offers a rational means for fostering mutual understanding.\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

None. Zero. Zip.\n\nThat it's worthless as evidence is only the stench of this steaming pile of dung that is Wallace's backstory.\n\nWhy does Christianity, if it's true, require lies to sell it? \n\nWhy don't Christians take a stand for uncompromising truth and integrity? \n\nWhy are Christian friends of Jim afraid to step up and denounce his fraud? \n\nI, for one, am convinced that Christianity is false. Wallace is further proof that I'm correct. \n\nIf it's true, if it's clearly and obviously true, it shouldn't require slight of hand liars and frauds to convince people of its veracity. \n\nIf you're a struggling Christian, or a struggling ex-Christian, there is help:\nhttps://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/\n\nYou're not alone.\n\nMany of us here on YouTube have come here to share our stories and to help others like you, you're not alone, friends.",

A. in History and Philosophy.\r\n\r\nHis experience with NT scholarship mostly pertains to Pauline scholarship over his Christology and eschatology.

At the age of 19 he attended Simpson College, now Simpson University, where he received a B.A. in Biblical Literature with a Christian Education minor. After graduation he worked at Simpson’s library as a Librarian Technician for six years.\r\n\r\nHis dream was to become a Biblical scholar and study the Bible he did, yet coming from a Fundamentalist world and watching the controversy of Thomas Gundry’s commentary on Matthew in which he used redaction criticism was unbecoming of an Evangelical.\n\nAs a result, the drumbeats of many to oust Thomas Gundry from his teaching position and from the Evangelical Theological Society because of his commentary on the Gospel of Matthew. Kim knew that this was not the path for him to take.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Kim left Simpson University to work for his uncle as a software developer. Today he remains a software developer, and his passion for the Bible has not ceased. \n\nThat passion caused him to spend eight years writing his book How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication, which as its name implies it describes how the Book of Revelation was written.\n\r\nCrazy beliefs that Kim Lewis held:\r\n\r\n·         The belief that I had the entirety of scripture figured out.\r\n\r\n·         Evolution is a lie. The usual tropes just are not as sophisticated as today.\r\n\r\n·         Original Sin is not in the Bible.\r\n\r\n·         Inerrancy of scripture and the many mental gymnastics involved with the belief.\r\n\r\n·         Young Earth Creationists until the age of 50.\r\n\r\n·         The rapture is the which occurs prior to the second coming.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nToday he is an atheist.\r\n\r\n\r\nBook:\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/How-John-Wrote-Book-Revelation/dp/1943325006\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWant to create live streams like this?

The problem is that they expect a \"parallel\" to be an exact match, instead of what they really are, copies of mythemes, tropes, conventions, and scenes.\n\nIs the modern teen-vampire bestselling novel, Twilight, not based or inspired on Bram Stoker's work, because the vampires depicted in Forks aren't the same as those written about in Dracula? \n\nNo, of course not. We know Stephenie Meyer was influenced by vampire lore and didn't invent the idea herself. Obviously.\n\nSo when we see parallels in the Gospels and Acts to Euripides, why should we create a double standard for analyzing how fiction is created? \n\nWe should not. \n\n\"But it's not fiction,\" the Christian apologist claims.\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" I answer. \"Then why does it copy fiction over and over?\"",

The writer of Mark was trained in classical Greek writing and OF COURSE he was familiar with HOMER, just like if you wanted to become a (popular) thriller writer today you'd be familiar with Dan Brown and James Patterson.\n\nSo, did the scene in Mark 5 really happen?\n\nOdds are no, it's a fictional account of Jesus doing some stuff that is heroic, like Odysseus (only better). To think otherwise is to imagine a boat load of coincidences (pun intended) AND also to think Jesus sailed across the \"sea\" (really a lake) just to heal this madman and then get right back into his boat again. It's convenient, sure, to think this, but real life isn't so neatly packaged (like fiction is).\n\nReference:\nMythologizing Jesus: From Jewish Teacher to Epic Hero\nThe Homeric Epics and the Gospels of Mark\nboth books by Dennis R MacDonald\n\nNOTE:  This trailer is meant as ENTERTAINMENT and not a highly researched doctrinal thesis, any mistakes are my own, and should not reflect on others' work and/or any of the conclusions or theories found in MacDonald's work.\n\nShout out to @MythVisionPodcast for helping to make this material more broadly recognized.",

I didn't want to be glib, and also, in question one, Braxton Hunter asks the question, then pontificates why all the answers will be wrong, lol, so I've taken the time to address his points after answering his question.\n\nHe writes in the description of his video:\n\"I'm genuinely interested in the answers atheists will give.\"\n\nI'm not sure if I really believe this, but I'll take him at his word. If a believer genuinely looked at the reasons a rational atheist isn't a believer, they'd become a non-believer as well. \n\nThere isn't good sound logical reasons to be a Christian, only emotional and culture ones (i.e. most Christians, like most Hindus, Muslims, Mormons and the like got that way via childhood indoctrination).\n\nMost apologetics is designed to reaffirm Christians, rather than convince anyone that the claims are true.\n\nI'm looking to build up more creative work and videos, if you've got some speciality or interesting story and you'd be interested in doing a live stream or other colab, please email me.",

    "description": "A Christian couple explains why we should accept the existence of a creator deity due to the Kalam Cosmological Argument. Following up on a critique done by YouTuber, Prophet of Zod, I decided to dive a little deeper into the flaws of the arguement they present as well as why I agree with Zod, they are pretending to be free-thinkers.\n\nThe Aristotle \"prime mover\" arguement found a home in the Islamic Golden Age, but it's current popularity is largely due to the influnce of apologist William Lane Craig.\n\nIlm al-kalām (Arabic: عِلْم الكَلام, literally \"science of discourse\") is usually foreshortened to kalām, and is generally speaking, the philosophical study of Islamic doctrine ('aqa'id).\n\nLinks to the three videos that inspired this one are here:\n\nOriginal video: https://youtu.be/4xqQ6GdUkCc?si=FBnNpUPptKgjmWEI\n\nZod's response video: https://youtu.be/L19Yt64GQqU?si=hhyCf3VsM4uajhvM\n\nChristians, Tanner and Mary, respond to the response: https://youtu.be/ZFMVGI6bs3c?si=N-kViQobcgxfkFlm\n\n@ProphetofZod \n@summerbrookstudents \n\n#apologetics #christianity #kalam #quantumphysics #quantummechanics #atheist #atheism #freethinking",
