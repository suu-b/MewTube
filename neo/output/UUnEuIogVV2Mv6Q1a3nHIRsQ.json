    "description": "\"The problems with short intro philosophy video.\"\n\nProfessor Moeller is teaching a course on Kant. He was searching things about Kant on YouTube to see what would come up. \n\nAnd Professor thought he came across a very bad example of a short introductory philosophy video from Philosophy Tube, a very famous YouTuber, whom I (\"the producer\") previously actually watched before exams for reviewing purposes, or even as a main source of learning introductory philosophy. I am curious to know how bad can this 5 minute video be.\n#philosophy #kant #philosopher\n\nTherefore, we decided to make this video, hope you enjoy it! \n\nA following up video:\nCommodification of Philosophy: Professors vs Influencers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RmJO2IwHek\n\n(video mentioned):\nThe Problem with Sam Harris' \"Morality\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GRV3zE6dMI\n\n(Beginner's Guide to Kant's Metaphysics & Epistemology | Philosophy Tube):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaYVQMpkTYQ&ab_channel=PhilosophyTube\n\nKant's Philosophy | Why we Need a New Enlightenment:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0nkLovWA1M\n\nKant’s Ethics: Homophobia, Child Killing--and Derek Chauvin:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrB5XN_Qw_0\n\nDr Hans-Georg Moeller is a professor in the Philosophy and Religious Studies Program at the University of Macau.\n\nPS: We understand Philosophy Tube has changed to a new identity and name. This happened a day after this video had been out, we could not foresee it. \nAnd in this video, we are commenting on the content of an old but still very popular video from Philosophy Tube (in which, philosophy tube still identified as a man and OLLY), we are trying to address how a short popular philosophy explainer video can sometimes have many problems.",
