Grab a copy here: https://amzn.to/4bLU2uu\n_______________\nDo you long for an intimate relationship with your Creator, but He seems elusive? Perhaps it is because something utterly essential is missing—the fear of the Lord. Don't let this frighten you. Fearing God is very different than being afraid of God. It's the key to everything... including leaving a legacy for the generations to come. \n\nHoly Fear is not a topic you'll hear much about these days. But if you want to build a faith that stands strong through troubled times, you cannot afford ignorance. \n\nIn this sermon, I invite you to take a fresh look at what it means to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Why? This healthy, holy, and largely forgotten virtue is the uncommon path to a more fulfilled and fruitful life.\n\nGet my book “The Awe of God” on Messenger International: https://store.messengerinternational.org/products/the-awe-of-god\n__________________\nChapters: \n00:00 - Opening Prayer \n__________________\nStay Connected: \nFollow me on Facebook →https://www.facebook.com/JohnBevere.page\nFollow me on Instagram → https://www.instagram.com/johnbevere/\nFollow me on Twitter → https://twitter.com/JohnBevere\n__________________\nFor information on my books, resources, speaking schedule, and more, visit JohnBevere.com",

    "description": "Welcome to the Bait of Satan 30th Anniversary live event! \nEVENT SPECIAL: Get The Bait of Satan book & get the audiobook + course as bonuses: https://store.messengerinternational.org/products/the-bait-of-satan\n___________________\n\nThe Bait of Satan exposes one of the most deceptive snares Satan uses to get believers out of the will of God--offense. This trap restrains countless Christians, severs relationships, and widens the gulfs between us. Jesus said, \"It is impossible that no offenses should come” (Luke 17:1). So many Christians carry offense through life, completely unaware that they are giving the enemy an open door to wreak havoc.\n\nYou can't control everything that happen to you in life—but you can always choose your response. Will you hold onto bitterness, anger, and resentment, or will you embrace the better way of forgiveness and all that it leads to? One road leads to death. The other, to life. Choose the narrow way and don't take the enemy's bait! \n____________________\nStay Connected: \nFollow me on Facebook →  / johnbevere.page  \nFollow me on Instagram →   / johnbevere  \nFollow me on Twitter →   / johnbevere  \n__________________\nFor information on my books, resources, speaking schedule, and more, visit JohnBevere.com\n\nMusicbed SyncID: MB01CUWPGWSDZLL\nMusicbed SyncID: MB012Q9HVOOBAQ9\nMusicbed SyncID: MB01REQA6PBTXKO\nMusicbed SyncID: MB011FHUJKSC3ZF",

I want to speak to the fear many are feeling.\n\nIsaiah 8:11 says, the the Lord has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else thinks. He said, don't live in dread or in fear of what they fear. He said instead make me holy in your life. He says, if you do this, I will keep you safe.\n\nIf you walk in the healthy fear of God, you are promised by our Creator to to remain safe.\n\nEmbracing a holy fear of God can free us from all earthly fears and anxieties. That's why I wrote The Awe of God. If you haven't yet gotten a copy, I encourage you to read it. I truly believe this message will change your life as it did mine.\n\nLet's see the people of God free from the fear that so many others are walking in!\n\nAmazon now has the best deal I've seen at almost 50% off.

    "description": "Watered-Down Gospel Driving People From Christ - It's Time to Reset\nHave diluted half-truths replaced the full force of Scripture? This video explores how the modern church has drifted from biblical foundations - and the devastating impact it's having.\n\nI address topics like:\nHow a simplified \"sinner's prayer\" distorts the meaning of salvation\nThe danger of widening God's message just to draw bigger crowds\nThe essential role the fear of the Lord plays in following Christ\nThe need to preach ALL of God's truth - not just palatable parts\nHow churches must reset to restore power and purpose to the gospel\n\nThis is a wake-up call for the church to return to the pure, unfiltered truth of Scripture - in all its power and mystery. When we fully revere and submit to God's Word, lives are radically changed. Souls are set on fire for Christ again!\n\nThe time is now to reset. To once again proclaim God's unmatched majesty that demands awe and obedience. Come rediscover the life-altering force of the unedited Gospel. Revival awaits!\n\n#johnbevere #johnbevereteaching #johnbeveresermon #johnbeverestudy #bestsermon #topsermon #godwhereareyou #wildernessseason #findingpurpose #yourcalling #findingcalling #yourdestiny #pursingholiness #freefromporn #freefromlust #freefromanger #theaweofGod \n\n__________________\n\nStay Connected: \nFollow me on Facebook →https://www.facebook.com/JohnBevere.page\nFollow me on Instagram → https://www.instagram.com/johnbevere/\nFollow me on Twitter → https://twitter.com/JohnBevere\n__________________\nFor information on my books, resources, speaking schedule, and more, visit JohnBevere.com",

With more than 100 years of combined ministry experience, they share hard-won lessons and wisdom to equip you not only to stay in the race, but to run it well.

We will be rewarded for our work individually, as each of us have been given different callings and responsibilities with the purpose of impacting lives for eternity. John reveals how God does not reward as man does. He rewards according to righteous works of obedience—which include how we build the kingdom and how we influence individual lives.\n\nWant more content like this?

    "description": "Our ability to build the kingdom is entirely based upon our obedience to the Holy Spirit because we can do nothing of eternal value unless it is by the grace of Jesus Christ. We can build apart from God’s Spirit, yet that labor is worthless in the light of eternity. It will be burned up at the Judgment Seat. John teaches that at the Judgment Seat of Christ, we’ll not be judged according to what we did, but according to what we were called to do. Because only acts of obedience will guarantee that our labor is not in vain.\nWant more content like this?

    "description": "Everyone will face judgment one day, including Christians. No one is exempt. It will surely come for all people. Sadly, numerous individuals in the church are unaware that they will give an account of what they’ve done during their short stay on earth. John addresses the erroneous idea that all future judgment is eradicated by salvation. Indeed, Jesus’s blood cleanses us from the sins that would have kept us from the kingdom; however, it does not exempt us from the judgment of how we conducted ourselves as believers, whether good or bad.\n\nWant more content like this?

Those who lack this foundation will surely slip into the fear of man, and we ultimately serve who we fear. John teaches on the importance of cultivating the fear of the Lord in our life—which includes a holy awe of the judgments of Christ.\n\nWant more content like this?

Because it is one of His elementary teachings, Jesus discussed hell frequently, much more often than the subject is mentioned from pulpits today.

John discusses how the teaching of hell is an essential component for preparing people to receive the gospel.\n\nWant more content like this?

    "description": "Have You Been Chasing the Wrong Things? Rediscover the Life-Giving Pursuit of Holiness.\n\nIt's so easy to unconsciously drift into chasing empty things instead of pursuing God's holiness. We gravitate toward what \"feels good\" instead of what aligns with Scripture's correction and guidance. Before we know it, we're far off course, chasing fleeting distractions rather than lasting fruit.\n\nIn this teaching, I uncover the dangers of drifting into chasing ungodly things. You'll rediscover what God says about righteous pursuit and get back on track with passionately chasing holiness.\n\nI'll provide practical ways to stop chasing distractions and realign your heart to chase God's presence and righteous living. You'll walk away inspired, equipped and refocused on joyfully pursuing holiness above all else. Don't settle for chasing temporary things. Rediscover the abundant life waiting for you in the godly pursuit of holiness!\n\n#johnbevere #johnbevereteaching #johnbeveresermon #johnbeverestudy #bestsermon #topsermon #godwhereareyou #wildernessseason #findingpurpose #yourcalling #findingcalling #yourdestiny #pursingholiness #freefromporn #freefromlust #freefromanger #honorsreward\n\n__________________\n\nChapters: \n\n0:00 - Opener: Good and Evil\n9:09 - What Is Our Reference Point of “Good”?\n14:11 - Drifting Away\n17:47 - The Word of God Is under Attack\n24:12 - 2 Different Aspects of Holiness\n36:08 - Keeping His Commandments\n39:10 - Give God Your Whole Heart\n42:36 - Closing Prayer\n\n__________________\n\nStay Connected: \nFollow me on Facebook →https://www.facebook.com/JohnBevere.page\nFollow me on Instagram → https://www.instagram.com/johnbevere/\nFollow me on Twitter → https://twitter.com/JohnBevere\n\n__________________\n\nFor information on my books, resources, speaking schedule, and more, visit JohnBevere.com",

    "description": "When God wants to separate us unto Himself, He sometimes has to remove us from the other voices that influence our lives. In Scripture, He physically did this with people like Moses, David, Paul, and John the Baptist. It was during these wilderness seasons that He produced holiness in them, the holiness enabled them to see God, and through seeing God they were marked for their calling. It was what God revealed to them in the wilderness that enabled them to be who God created them to be, and it will be the same for us.\n\n\nWant more content like this?

    "description": "During dry seasons of the soul, the greatest temptation is to run to worldly things for comfort—television, social media, food, and much more—but we must choose to turn instead to God. This requires us to dig wells within ourselves, persevering in worship, prayer, and meditating on God’s faithfulness. Despite the trials of dry times, these habits will refresh us and enable us to become rivers of life wherever we go.\n\nWant more content like this?

    "description": "God gives promises to each one of us, but His plan to fulfill them will require faith, which means His fulfillment isn’t going to look like what makes sense to us in the natural. We must surrender our natural understanding and plans to follow His leading, because only His leading will fulfill His promises the right way. If we work in our own strength, we will produce a fulfillment that actually wars against God’s intended purpose.\n\nWant more content like this?
