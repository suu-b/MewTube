    "description": "This video differs quite dramatically from my usual ones. Here, I am reading a full story from A Thousand and One Nights entitled \"The City of Brass\", which fits in well with the Halloween theme of today!\n\n\nI have shortened the tale slightly, for example by removing the whole story that the Jinn in the pillar tells about the way he ended up there. A story that includes a Lord of the Rings-style war between the King/Prophet Solomon, with jinn, birds and reptiles on his side, and the forces of evil. Which is of course.. awesome, but was cut to keep the narrative coherent.\n\n\nAlso keep in mind that this tale, AND its translation, is quite old and thus can feature some statements that appear offensive to some.\n\nAll music is my own, some of which you can find here: https://open.spotify.com/album/41mTdTektb2f7O2pHz26WU?si=gqiel8IISpCydPT3hlXWpQ&utm_source=copy-link\n\n\n\nYou can read the whole translation I used here: https://www.bartleby.com/16/701.html\n\n\nSupport Let's Talk Religion on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/letstalkreligion\nOr through a one-time donation: https://www.patreon.com/letstalkreligion\n\n\n#CityofBrass #ArabianNights #Halloween",

    "title": "\"On the Supreme Identity\" by Emir Abd el-Kader",
    "description": "Emir Abd el-Kader (or Abd al-Qadir) al-Jazairi has become a very famous figure. He is a national hero to many Algerians, and fought the French colonial invasion as a military leader.\nHe was later awarded medals from several European countries for his humane treatments of enemy prisoners and his sheltering of Christians who were being attacked in a riot in Damascus.\nBut one side of Abd al-Qadir that not many know about is his strong affiliation with Sufism and the school of Ibn 'Arabi. In this video I present an excerpt from his book \"Kitab al-Muwaqif\" where his adherence to the school of \"Unity of Being\" or \"Wahdat al-Wujud\" is especially apparent.\n\n\nCredit for videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXutBrd9vrM&t=66s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ0iKbYq6UA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX10ow9cs4c&t=46s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ24Jv78PHU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f58FvaXwGLQ",

    "description": "This is the first part in a new series I'm trying out where I will present religious texts (or parts of texts) that are interesting or noteworthy.\n\n\nThis one features the \"Great hymn to the Aten\", an ancient religious text in devotion to the god \"Aten\" that was allegedly written by Pharaoh Akhenaten during the tumultuous era known as the \"Amarna period\" when the old pantheon of gods was seemingly temporarily replaced with a single, universal God of the sun (or more, precisely - light).\nIt is for this reason that Atenism is sometimes considered the first monotheistic religion in the world, which would make this hymn one of the first religious expression of monotheism ever.\n\n\nIt also just happen to be very beautiful, aside from being historically significant.\nWhat do you think of it? Let's discuss in the comments.\n\nTranslation used: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/amarna/belief.html\n\nVideo used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFSjLNlZITg",

    "description": "In this first short documentary, we explore the ritual called \"Vårblot\" performed by \"Assembly of Forn Sed Sweden\", a religious group in Sweden following the pre-christian tradition known as \"Asatru\".\nMany of the ancient pagan traditions and religions have become increasingly popular in the last few years, and this is just one of many such congregations.\n\nWe would like to extend our warmest thanks to Henrik Hallgren, Per Lundberg and Assembly of Forn Sed Sweden for welcoming us and being so nice.\n\nPlease visit the official website of Forn Sed Sweden: https://www.samfundetfornsed.se/\n\nLet's Talk Religion facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/letstalkreligionchannel/\n\nAbout Forn Sed Sverige (from their website):\n\nThe organisation Assembly of Forn Sed Sweden was founded in 1994, under the name Swedish Asatro Assembly. (Our new name was ratified in the annual allthing in spring 2010.) Since 2007 are we a registered religious organisation in Sweden.\n\nThe Assembly of Forn Sed aim to make Forn Sed a living spiritual alternative for people in current society. Our purpose is not to recreate an ancient religion the way it might have been a 1000 years ago and we are not engaged in historic theatre. We live in Forn Sed today and continue to develop forn sed as a spiritual expression adapted to current society. This is done through blot and other types of ceremonies, by releasing books and other printed materials, and by creating common meeting places for people with an interest in nature spirituality.\n\nThe organization of the Assembly of Forn Sed Swedish is open and democratic. Each year we hold Allthing that all members are welcome and where the most important decisions are made. At the Allthing the board is elected, tha we call the råd, that execute and lead the Assembly during the year. The Assembly also has appointed godthies and gydjas, that have the function of supporting members in their practice of Forn Sed.\n\nThe Assembly of Forn Sed Sweden does not have religious dogma. However do we have a strongly expressed value system that has a basis in humanitarian and democratic view on life and that acknowledge all humans as equals regardless of gender, origin or sexual preference.The Assembly and her members shall also uphold religious tolerance in a multicultural society. Each and everyone that share these values are welcome in the Assembly of Forn Sed Sweden.",
