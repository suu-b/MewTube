I was not sure whether I should post this interview or not. My hope is that it can evoke and encourage someone else who could support his claims with compelling evidence to come forward.

Instead, the term used is Yam Suph, meaning Sea of Reeds. \n\nTierney Peprah, author of Conspiracy to Erase a Nation, brings forth her views on this misinterpretation. On this interview on Something Nice with Dinano, you will learn something that might inspire you to search the Bible and dig deeper into Ancient Hebrew manuscripts and their meaning.\n----------------------------\nIn the Hebrew Bible, \"Yam Suph\" refers to the body of water where the Israelites crossed during the Exodus, often translated as \"Red Sea\" or \"Sea of Reeds,\" though the literal meaning is \"sea of reeds\".",

Kunle Aderemi of Kunle Ministers asks this critical question as he delves into some of the old manuscripts from Ancient times. \n\nThe Book of Enoch chapter 105 reveals something interesting, during the birth of a child of one of the Patriarch's (Lamech the son of Methuselah) of the days of old, a child is described and is said to not have looked like other children. What does this mean, the child described a white reddish and looking like aliens with eyes so beautiful unlike other children.\n\nHe also looks at the land allocated to some of the descendants of a great Bible patriarch.

As a young boy he had many questions, and remembers asking his teacher, 'why are people saying they discovered Africa, when there were people living there all along?' He never got a satisfactory answer and this spurred his interest in African history.\n\nHe has since written a book, and did research on various issues including the Israelites Exodus from Egypt to Canaan, the promised land. He says if we read the Bible with understanding we would realise that it is an African book, about African People, their God and their customs.\n\nAfrican traditions and the Bible go hand in hand. He says many untruths and lies have been told to deceive the people of God, this can also be seen in how the world map is illustrated, it is upside down!\n----------------------------\nHere is the Link to Yahunde Batakane's book: https://a.co/d/el0e2uQ",

His journey of finding the truth of the Bible that made him aware of his identity began in the 70s. He says the truth that he found in his spiritual journey revealed that he is a son of Judah, one of the 12 tribes of Israel.\n\nHe argues that being born in a place or geographical location does not make you a person of that nation. Ben Yehuda says nationality is linked to your roots, \" Being born American doesn't make you an American, one needs to find their true identity.\"\n\nHe is passionate about his identity as an African Hebrew Israelite. Pointing to the scripture for guidance, he says many of our problems in today's world stem from not knowing who we are and not knowing what our purpose is. This interview will help you get to a place of questioning what you have always known and hopefully drive you on a quest to find your true self in God (Yah).\n\nEnjoy. \n\nPlease LIKE, SHARE, COMMENT & SUBSCRIBE.",

We talk about different issues from The Sabbath, the reason behind using the King James Version translation of the Bible and I also ask Bishop Nathaniel about his view o the Trinity.\n\nHe says the suffering of black people is a result of them not keeping the 10 commandments as the chosen people of God. Bishop Nathanyel insists that their mission is to gather the 12 tribes of Judah and unite them ahead of Jesus Christ's coming.\n\nHe continues to say, christian churches are liars and are using the Bible to deceive believers. Bishop Nathanyel was on a visit to South Africa for a week honouring an invitation from the local branch of their movement, or nation as they prefer to be called.\n\nThis is one of those conversations that speak for the decolonizing of christianity and it won't sit well with everyone, but the truth of these believers needs to be told from their perspective. What we have always known to be factul nd truthful from our vantage point is not always the whole truth.\n\nBe Kind, Be Thoughtful and Be Open to other Views, even though they might challenge your Truth.\nBe Blessed.\n----------------------------\nTo find out more about Israel United In Christ, visit their website: \nhttps://israelunite.org/",

They believe the Bible is the word of God, they also believe Jesus is the Messiah, a black man from Africa and they observe the Sabbath as prescribed by the Creator in the Bible.\n\nSomething Nice with Dinano hosted the Bishop of the nation, Nathanyel and Deacon Malachi in Johannesburg South Africa to find out what their movement is about.\n\nThey claim the people currently occupying and dominating Israel are fake Jews (Jewish, meaning like the Jews)and they say the Bible describes them as the devil. Bishop Nathanyel says whatever he says is not his personal opinion but Bible based truth. \n\nIsrael United in Christ leadership is on a visit to South Africa to spread their message to the lost tribes of Judah.\n\nWe delved in the Word of God to find out if their claims are Bible based.

    "description": "#ThomasSankara #WiseQuotes #Quotes #AfricanRevolution \n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/somethingnicewithdinano?sub_confirmation=1 \n============================== \nThomas Sankara QUOTES on the African Revolution is a collection of quotes from Africa's greatest leader, Thomas Noel Isidore Sankara. \n\nA revolutionary, visionary, leader and artist. Sankara came into power in 1983, and changed the then French Colony from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso -\" Land of the Upright People\" in 1984. His term in office brought about meaningful change in what was then known as one of Africa's poorest countries. \n\nThis video is made of a collection of his quotes from the Book, Thomas Sankara Speaks. Sankara's politics, governance and people skills continue to be a shinning light for many leaders to this day. Some of the changes he brought about in his country were unprecedented for the time. \n\nIn the video he speaks on different topics including Imperialism, Feminism, Foreign Aid, the Revolution, the role of Soldiers and the people in a revolution and what needs to be done to take the African people and the continent forward. \n\nA strong feminist and advocate for self-sufficiency, Sankara stood by his word and was truly an upright leader who put the interests of the people and his country first. \n============================== \nCopyright info: In no way, shape or form am I intending to infringe rights of the copyright holder.

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and IOHK was hosting the spave and spoke on a number of things inclung the importance of reading, an interesting business he is investing in called, Collosal. Now this company Collosal intrigued my mind, these guys plan to revive the mammoth by 2027. Interesting right? But what about the ethical issues?\r\n\r\nAnother issue that has made an impression on me is a book I started reading recently: Lost in the Himalayas - the story of James Scott, an Australian medicine student who was lost in the Himalayas of Nepal for 43 days without any food! He survived to tell the tale, attributing his faith in God, his Love for his family and karate training as his driving forces towards survival. \r\n\r\nReading this book revived my interest in books, and this year I am planning to read more books, maybe a book every month. Talking about books, I gave away a couple of books on the channel, as a christmas gift and the winners have not claimed them....if they do not get back to me by the end of the month we will have to find new winners.\r\n\r\nI am excited about this year and plan to grow this channel to greater heights.\r\n\r\nWhat are you reading lately, let me know in the live chat or comments below.",

    "description": "#MapongaJoshua #JoshuaMaponga #TheGospelAccordingToMaponga #DecolonizingChristianity #AmaBishop #BishopJoshuaMaponga #Africa #SouthAfrica\n\nIn this interview titled Joshua Maponga on Africa and the Bible, Christianity & Western Culture, philosopher, academic, theologian, social commentator and public speaker of note Joshua Marara Maponga III revisits some of his thoughts on how Africa and the Bible relate. \n\nThis collection of soundbites from his last interview on Something Nice with Dinano, is a selection of a few clips where he focuses on how Africa and Africans relate to God of the Bible, what informs their spirituality and their connection with their ancestors. He brings forth certain claims on how Africans present themselves before God, saying Africans do not worship ancestors, but they do acknowledge them whenever they pray.\n\nHe continues to emphasize his assertion that Africa's relation with God precedes colonization and the advent of christianity, citing different African names for God as a way of showing that these people have been having communion with God.\n\nThe Gospel according to Maponga is about Africa and how Africa links with the history of the Bible and in his understanding, Africa plays a significant role in the Bible and prophecy, but because of how the gospel was presented to the continent by the Europeans, these African related truths have been neglected.\n\nBishop Joshua Maponga says Africans believe in a monotheistic God. Maponga is not only a theologian but is also a prominent commentator on news in South Africa and the African continent.\n\nFor the full interviews, see links below:\nJoshua Maponga on Getting into Ministry, Questions on Christianity & the Bible | PT 1 https://youtu.be/lbgC686njvU\n\nJoshua Maponga on His Message for Africa & where He Stands with the Bible | PT 2 https://youtu.be/ULW7sHGNAvM\n\nJoshua Maponga - Find Your Truth | African Theology https://youtu.be/hwK7_f5_8Z8",

The world, Africa and South Africa are going through a global crisis brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Africa there is a need for vaccines but the continent is failing to provide facilities to manufacture them.\n\nIn South Africa there is civil Unrest and those in leadership seem to be reacting instead of being proactive to the situation at hand. Molapo offers advice to those in power by giving practical steps to problem solving and troubleshooting a situation of crisis,  so that one can rise to the occassion.\n\nHe says leaders are revealed during a time of crisis.

    "description": "#SomethingNicewithDinano #LandReform #Colonialism #KingHintsa #Bambatha #EWC #SouthAfrica #LandDispossession\n\nPerforming Artist and Land Activist, Masello Motana has taken the fight for land in South Africa to new artistic levels. Her dramatic depictions of key historical moments in the dispossession of blacks from their land is profound and artistically captivating. \n\nIn this interview with Something Nice with Dinano, Masello vividly paints the cruelty of colonialism in Africa and the history of land dispossession in South Africa, from an Artists perspective. Masello Motana is an actress,singer and street performer in South Africa who is not afraid to challenge the status quo through her art.\n\nOne of her recent works, The Three Beheaded Kings focuses on the murder of Kings, Hintsa, Bambatha and Luka Jantjie. She held a demonstration outside a public hearing where South Africa was embarking on land hearings on the proposed changes to Section 25 of the South African constitution. \n\nThe proposed changes seek to give government the powers to expropriate land without compensation (EWC). \n\nMotana also did a dramatic interpretation of a \"court case\" where Luka Jantjie was tried for refusing to move from his ancestral land.\n\nIn this conversation, Motana also looks at some of the laws that cemented the fate of black people as they were forcefully removed from their spaces.\n\nThe conversation on land is important in Africa as the continent continues to deal with the effects of colonialism stemming from the removal of many native African people from their homes. \n\nRecently in Namibia, the German government has committed to pay reparations for the brutal genocide of the Herero and Nama people in the southern African country. South Africa and Namibia have a lot in common on the issue of land dispossession as the two were previously ruled by the notorious apartheid regime of South Africa.",

When he accepted Christ in his early teens, he wouldn't have believed you if you said one day, he would be ixhwele or igqirha (sangoma). Infact he would have dismissed that thought without flinching. But as he grew in his knowledge of Christ, he continued to have many unanswered questions. \n\nThe questions led to more reading and knowledge seeking until he reached a point where christianity didn't resonate with him. He left the Adventist church, but saw himself coming back as it was the only thing he knew. Unfortunately his soul was not at peace as he realised that, going to church didn't come naturally anymore, it felt forced until he decided, this christianity \"is not for me.\"\nFrom there he had dreams and started learning about African origins and spirituality, he later answered his calling to become iXhwele - Sangoma.\n\nHe tells his story in such an engaging manner. This is part 1 of a two episode interview. In part 2 he talks about his African Tradition beliefs and what it means to him.\n\nThe interview is about him leaving Christianity for spirituality.",
