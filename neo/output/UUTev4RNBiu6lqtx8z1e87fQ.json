I was pleasantly surprised by the camaraderie we developed over this conversation. We start off trying to explain some of the trickier mechanisms that showed up in the \"Nanobot\" video, like what the heck is a rotaxane and a Brownian ratchet? There's some really cool physics going on stemming from the fact that the nano-world is controlled by very different kinds of forces than our big world. From there we talk about creativity and where ideas come from as a scientist or artist, how to build connections between scientific disciplines, how to tell a good story with science, and of course everyone's favourite question: WILL THE NANOBOTS KILL US ALL??? I had a great time in this conversation, so I hope you enjoy it and here's to many more!",

CalTech cosmologist Sean Carroll and I sat down over Skype and spent an hour chewing through some of the deepest questions of physics.. and then some! Things like.. Why does time run forward? Is matter fundamentally made of particles or waves? (Hint: It's waves. Waving fields, like stretched rubber sheets.) How can we understand the bizarre symmetries of the nuclear forces? What's the right interpretation of quantum mechanics, and why does it seem to work at more levels of analysis than it has a right to? Why do we say that the Many Worlds hypothesis is actually simpler than alternatives? Is there a bottom layer to reality? Does \"turtles all the way down\" make sense? How should we think about systems arising from the complexity of physics, like chemistry, biology, psychology, philosophy, morality? Can you get an \"ought\" from an \"is\"? Why does matter bend space-time? And why do so many physicists seem to hate philosophy?",

It was my first full-length show and an amazing experience. We sang, we laughed, we looped.. we talked about the sleeping dragon of the scientific unknown, the inherent goofiness of physics, strange acronyms from CMB to AdS/CFT. On-stage reunions of old a capella group-mates and TV co-stars were had. We plumbed my catalogue of harmonious science, from the first \"dun dun duns\" of \"Rolling in the Higgs\" to my upcoming dinosaurian bird ballad. We sang of times entropic, gravities bohemian, neutrinos massive and microwaves cosmic.

I skyped with Yale professor of ornithology Richard Prum just before releasing my latest video, and it was a super cool conversation. Here we start off pondering why birds are so fascinating, and talking about the ways in which, weirdly, birds are more like people than a lot of mammals are. Then we get into the evidence for birds being the descendants of reptilian dinosaurs: Their bone structure, their mating habits, and the feathers that originated back before T-Rex. We also talk about how our understanding of oviraptor went from sneaky egg their to communally caring dad.  Then we talk about how beauty emerges as a result of choices, both in birds and in flowers. Then we get into the tubular evolution of feathers, before returning to choice in the form of the sometimes-disturbing sexual practices of ducks and and the more cultured bowerbird dating scene.\nFinally, we get into how a young person might become part of the next generation of great ornithologists, why minds matter in evolution, and why some dissident and reckless voices in science are crucial to its survival!\n\nMore Richard Prum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao7Q8kOqjfs",

It was my first full-length show and an amazing experience. We sang, we laughed, we looped.. we talked about the sleeping dragon of the scientific unknown, the inherent goofiness of physics, strange acronyms from CMB to AdS/CFT. On-stage reunions of old a capella group-mates and TV co-stars were had. We plumbed my catalogue of harmonious science, from the first \"dun dun duns\" of \"Rolling in the Higgs\" to my upcoming dinosaurian bird ballad. We sang of times entropic, gravities bohemian, neutrinos massive and microwaves cosmic. I wanna do it again.",

there\n\n1 jump\nIn radial redshift\n1 slip\nOf spectral lines\nThey'll see if I can show them the sines\n\nPish tosh\nGreen men\nTake five\nTake ten\n\nJust a little cash guys\n\nBudget's tight\nDon't fund this trash guys\n\nI can take a hint\nBetter face the facts\nSecond-hand'll have to do\n\nEww\nAll you planet hunters at the bottom\nYou've got fact & fantasy entwined\nFinding planets except they haven't got one\n\nWell they gotta be forming readily\nWhen you think about it given we've got nine\n\n1 jump\nA blip in the spectrum\n1 shift of meters per second\n1 graph of period power\nThey laugh but I'm not sour\n\nHere goes\n18 months of data\nCross & correlate it\nAll I gotta do is run\n\nPish tosh\nGreen men\nAh don't mind them\nIf only they'd look closer\nWould they see a pure void\nNo sirree\nThey'd find out\nThere's worlds galore\nTo see\n\nMake way for Pegasi\n51 Pegasi\n\nFirst was a world\nRound an old pulsar\nThat's true\nBut the news\nIs a sun-like star\nWith wobble\nToo quick & precise\nTo be designed\nNo fluke not a spot\nIf you like it hot\nYou're gonna love this find\n\nPegasi 51b\nPlanet discovered\nOrbit traced\nEvery 4 days\nHot as can be\nIts order-Jupiter size\nWas something of a surprise\nEspecially given its star's proximity\n\nPegasi 51b\nIt's a new era\nTo detect\nExoplanets\nSoon there'll be three\nAs planet pulls on its Sun\nIt shifts the stellar spectrum\nThat's how we found 51b Pegasi\n\nHow'd a planet get so close in orbit\nCause I thought you needed ice to form it\nDid it later undergo some strange migration\nStar too small to be so long-pulsating\nAnd too old to be so quick rotating\nIs there any other good interpretation\n\nThis will certainly help with our funding\n\nWe got your funding\nWe got your funding\n\nGot a surface of 1200 C\n\nIt's treacherous\nSo treacherous\n\nIf in time this new breakthrough feels mundane\nPlanets are common\n\nThat's proof\nOf the truth\nI've been telling you\nThis is no mean anomaly\n\nPegasi 51b\nPlanet uncovered\nRound a far\nMain sequence star\nSpectral type G\nWe know its mass to be high\nHalf Jupiter by sine i\n\nIt's 15.61 pc from home\nAnd it shakes our faith in how planets are formed\nAnd its star is in Pegasus\nGive it an A and thus\nLabel the planet as b\n51 Pegasi\n\nPlotting Doppler shifts is glacial-pace\nAnd that astrometry never prevails\nBut baby you're in luck cause\nUp in space\nYou got a planet-finder never fails\n\nYou got the power of statistics now\nYou got a view without an atmosphere\nSo no more nights spent locked up in your tower\nAll you gotta do is wait right here\nAnd I say\n\nKepler the planet-searcher\nGot a dip, no 2, no 3\nWe just measure brightness\nPlot it out & that's transiting photometry\n\nWhen your stars do this\nAnd your curves displace\nThen your star's got this\nTransiting its face\n\nThen you hit compute\nAnd lookie here\n\nYou get good diameter data\nFrom that dip\nAnd orbit distance from the length of year\n\nWell now we need this tale supported by\nA ground observer with a good Échelle\nWe got 2000 planets certified\n2000 more that only time will tell\n\nBut let's take em all, plot em out\nAnd find out if we're really all alone\nIs there a rocky world we've found no doubt\nThat orbits in the habitable zone\nLike home?\n\nKepler the planet searcher\nGot an Earth 452b\nPart of a throng\n40 billion strong\n\nThere ain't never been a field\nClever as the field\nThere ain't never been a field\nBetter than the field they call\nExoplanetology\n\nI can show you a world\nA shining shimmering planet\nFound concealed in the band-shifts\nOf the closest star in sight\n\nI've found hope in the skies\nAnd facing wonder I wonder\nCould the sine wave discovered be\nA planet fit for life\n\nA whole new world\nA new fantastic point of blue\nPlaced in that narrow zone\nWhere water flows\nMidway tween cold & steaming\n\nA whole new world\nIts sun a faint, reddish hue\nCould
