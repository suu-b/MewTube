    "description": "This debate features Cliffe Knechtle responding to challenges from Hebrew Israelites on one of Christianity’s most foundational claims. The discussion starts with Christmas and quickly moves to a deeper issue. Can the eternal God take on human nature, live as a man, and experience death?\n\nCliffe argues that Christianity does not rest on church tradition or holiday dates, but on the claim that God entered history through Jesus Christ. The conversation turns to Scripture, human limitations, and whether God choosing humility contradicts or confirms His nature.\n\n@matanevenoff - Full Podcast with Cliffe",

    "description": "Was Jesus born on Decemeber 25th? \nThis debate challenges the claim that Jesus is just another recycled myth, no different from figures like Mithras or Horus. The student argues these pagan gods were born of virgins, crucified, and resurrected long before Jesus, raising the question of why Christianity should be trusted at all.\n\nCliffe Knechtle starts with a key correction. The Bible never says Jesus was born on December 25th. That date is a later church tradition, not a biblical claim. From there, he addresses the larger historical issue. The Gospels were written in the first century by eyewitnesses or those closely connected to them and were quoted by early Christian leaders within decades, not centuries.\n\nUnlike pagan stories that describe symbolic or spiritual resurrections developed long after the fact, the Gospels make a clear historical claim. Jesus physically died and physically rose from the dead. The real question is not the holiday. It is the identity of Jesus.\n\nConnect with us on social media for more inspiring content!\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/biblecomesalive/ \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@biblealive\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BibleComesAlive/\nThank you for watching!\n\nCommentary on content sourced from @GiveMeAnAnswer YT\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOM3KK0YIds&t=91s\nFair Use Notice:\n\nThis video contains material whose use has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

    "description": "Cliffe Knechtle engages an agnostic moral skeptic who raises one of Christianity’s hardest questions: if God is loving and all-powerful, why does He permit tragedy, injustice, and innocent suffering? From personal loss and natural evil to the suffering of children, the challenge cuts to the heart of faith itself.\n\nThe conversation explores free will, the problem of evil, and whether God’s character is truly worthy of obedience. The student also presses Cliffe on Old Testament violence, divine judgment, and whether submitting to God’s authority makes moral sense when suffering exists. Cliffe responds by drawing from Scripture, including the Book of Job, the nature of human freedom, and the meaning of the cross arguing that Christianity presents a God who does not stand distant from suffering but enters into it.\n\nConnect with us on social media for more inspiring content!\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/biblecomesalive/ \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@biblealive\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/BibleComesAlive/\nThank you for watching!\n\nCommentary on content sourced from @GiveMeAnAnswer YT\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIg6Qs-aXc&t=5s\nFair Use Notice:\n\nThis video contains material whose use has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

But there’s always been one lingering question: Why won’t he just say he’s a Christian?\n\nCritics say he dances around it. He analyzes Jesus, defends Scripture, speaks about God—but never outright claims the title “Christian.” Many see it as dodging. Others view it as intellectual honesty.\n\nIn this clip, George Janko asks what everyone’s been wondering. Instead of backing away, he leans in: “Would you say you follow Jesus Christ?”\n\nWhat follows is one of Peterson’s most vulnerable and revealing moments on faith, labels, and the pressure to declare allegiance.\n\nFull Podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-tSCYf7yVY&t=7815s \n@GeorgeJanko @GeorgeJankoShowClips \n\n#JordanPeterson #Christianity #Faith #Jesus #GeorgeJanko #BibleAlive #Jubilee",

I do what I hate.”\nThat’s not defeat. It’s the beginning of honesty.\nAnd honesty is the first step toward freedom.\n\nWe are not saved because we win every battle.\nWe are saved because Jesus already won the war.\n\nThe cross wasn’t for the righteous. It was for the wretched.\nFor the ones who cry out, “Who will rescue me?”\nAnd the answer echoes through eternity—Jesus Christ.\n\nYou’re not disqualified because you struggle.\nYou're not too far gone because you're still fighting.\nIf anything, the fight is evidence that the Spirit of God is in you.\n\nFull video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnuR0AYlIcs",

The conversation dives deep into the nature of free will, the meaning of life without God, and whether evolution and science make faith irrelevant.\n\nCliffe pushes back with clarity and conviction, arguing for a God who loves, but does not force Himself on anyone — even into eternity.\n\nThis is one of the most engaging and layered dialogues you’ll find on campus — tackling morality, identity, science, and ultimate meaning.\n\n👇 Join the conversation in the comments.\nDo you think hell disproves a loving God?\n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Intro\n0:55 Is America Killing Religion?\n2:49 Science and Religion\n6:25 Evolution has design?\n8:51 God has a Gender?\n9:33 God doesn't love me\n11:15 What is Hell?\n14:35 Purpose without God?\n\nConnect with us on social media for more inspiring content!\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/biblecomesalive/ \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@biblealive\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nContent sourced from @GiveMeAnAnswer YT\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OkGC7TpOhc\nFair Use Notice:\n\nThis video contains material whose use has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

    "description": "In this intense exchange, Cliffe Knechtle debates a history scholar who challenges the core of Christianity. The scholar questions whether Jesus was truly divine, arguing that history doesn’t support the claims of the Bible. But things take an unexpected turn when he tries to strike a deal—proposing that both he and Cliffe investigate the religious beliefs of Amazonian tribes to compare them to Christianity.\n\nCliffe calls him out on the game, pushing back on the assumptions and historical methodology. What follows is a deep discussion on faith, evidence, and cultural perspectives. But in the end? They shake hands and make a deal, leaving the debate on an unexpectedly respectful and thought-provoking note.\n\n📖 Topics Covered:\n✅ Does history prove or disprove Christianity?\n✅ Are Amazonian tribal religions just as valid as Christianity?\n✅ How do we determine truth in religious beliefs?\n✅ Did Cliffe outmaneuver the history scholar, or did the scholar expose a flaw in Christian arguments?\n\n📢 What do you think?

    "description": "A routine pizza delivery took a shocking turn when 25-year-old Nicholas Bostic spotted a house engulfed in flames in Lafayette, Indiana. Without hesitation, he rushed inside, discovering four children and a family friend trapped in the burning home. Racing against time, Bostic led the kids to safety, but one child was still inside—a six-year-old girl. Braving the smoke and heat, he navigated the house by sound, locating the child and leaping from a second-story window to ensure her survival. Though injured, Bostic’s heroic actions saved the entire family.\n\nIn moments of crisis, God often uses the most unexpected people to fulfill His will. This father called the delivery man an angel sent by God—a reminder that divine intervention can come through the hands of ordinary people willing to act selflessly. Was Nicholas Bostic sent by God at just the right moment?\n\nMatthew 25:40\n“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\"\n\n#FaithInAction #GodIsGood #MiracleRescue #JesusSaves #UnexpectedHero #Christianity #BibleAlive #GodsPlan #Hero #ViralNews #HopeCore #Jesus",

Known for her intricate woodburning art, Diana was finishing the back of a Jesus portrait when she noticed something unexplainable: a negative image of Jesus appeared on the back of the thick wood panel.  \n\nWhat makes this event even more remarkable is that the wood was too thick for the burning process to have transferred through to the other side, leaving many questioning whether this is a miracle or an incredible coincidence. The image bears a striking resemblance to the Shroud of Turin; a centuries-old linen cloth believed by many to bear the negative image of Jesus Christ.\n\nDiana shared this discovery on TikT0k, where her video (@dianarockssunshine) quickly gained attention for its mysterious and awe-inspiring nature.  \n\nWhat do you think of it?\n\nDiana YT- @dianawatt1623 \n\n#Jesus #Faith #Miracle #ShroudOfTurin #Christian #Woodburning #DivineInspiration #hopecore",

While many expressed rightful anger and grief, one father, Robert Rule, chose to reflect God’s call for forgiveness, extending grace to the man who caused unimaginable pain. This act of forgiveness, rooted in Christian faith, reminds us of Jesus' teaching to love our enemies and forgive as God forgives us.

    "description": "In this compelling debate at Texas State University, Christian apologist Cliffe Knechtle and renowned atheist Matt Dillahunty confront one of life’s biggest questions: Is belief in the Christian God rational? Cliffe, a respected Christian pastor, argues for God’s existence using evidence from the Big Bang, DNA as a sign of intelligent design, and the historical resurrection of Jesus. He contends that humanity’s search for meaning and love points to a divine creator, making faith in Christ a logical choice.\n\nMatt Dillahunty, former president of the Atheist Community of Austin, brings a critical perspective. He challenges the credibility of religious claims, arguing that advancements in science provide evidence-based answers, making faith in God unnecessary and irrational. This engaging conversation dives into topics like the cosmological argument, the meaning of life, and historical evidence for Jesus.\n\nWhether you're a believer, skeptic, or curious observer, this debate will make you think deeply about faith, reason, and the evidence for God. Comment below on which argument resonated with you the most!\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n0:28 Opening statement: Cliffe\n8:43 Opening statement: Matt\n16:53 Does God exist?\n29:14 What do you live for?\n35:48 Accept Christ through testimony?\n\nWelcome to Bible Alive, your online destination for spreading the word of Jesus Christ and exploring the profound teachings of the Bible.

The discussion challenges common misconceptions about atonement and forgiveness, while addressing questions of hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and morality. Throughout the debate, Knechtle emphasizes God’s justice and love, showing why the sacrifice was necessary to uphold both.\n\nBe sure to watch the full debate to see how Cliffe handles other challenging questions about faith, sin, and morality, and comment below with your thoughts!\n\n\nWelcome to Bible Alive, your online destination for spreading the word of Jesus Christ and exploring the profound teachings of the Bible.

Cliffe Knechtle, a Christian apologist, argues in favor of God's existence, pointing to moral absolutes and historical evidence, such as the resurrection of Jesus Christ, as foundations for faith. Matt Dillahunty, a well-known atheist advocate, challenges these claims, emphasizing the need for empirical evidence and questioning the reliability of religious testimonies. Key topics include whether objective morality requires a divine source, the validity of miracles, and whether testimonies alone can prove extraordinary events. The debate also examines how personal experiences, such as alleged miracles, are interpreted differently by theists and skeptics. This lively exchange provides deep insights into Christian and atheist worldviews, making it a thought-provoking discussion for anyone interested in philosophy, theology, and the nature of belief.\n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Intro\n0:24 Meaning of life\n15:55 Is there life after death?\n24:20 How can you explain love?\n\nWelcome to Bible Alive, your online destination for spreading the word of Jesus Christ and exploring the profound teachings of the Bible.
