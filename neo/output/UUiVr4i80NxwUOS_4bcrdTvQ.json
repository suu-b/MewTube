    "title": "Revisiting the Christmas Narrative After My Deconversion!",
    "description": "Everything has been quite a bit abnormal this year, I thought it might be cathartic to take some time to really understand this Christmas tradition that has been a part of many of our lives.\n\nThis year I will be celebrating without my Mom \nI don't think she cared about the religious aspect of Christmas, but for her it was about treasuring her family and wanting to give her four kids more happiness than she herself had.\nFor me, Christmas is about finding warmth and love- while it's beautiful, but also dark and cold outside. The religious aspect doesn't mean anything t\no me anymore, but the memories of our culture's evolution.\nThe tree is the main symbol of Christmas, yet it has nothing to do with Christianity.\n\nIt's my hope that we can evolve away from needing fake meaning and towards finding meaning in what we know is real, and truly ours.\nI think it might enrich the memories we have of experiencing Christmas as former Christians to understand what really was behind the Christmas Story.\nThat is, the narrative of Jesus' birth.\n\none thing ive learned through my research is It seems that many, if not all, Bible stories were written to push an author's propaganda and therefore we must suspect that it's popularity very well may be attributed to its usefulness in spreading propaganda more than it's historical accuracy or objective truth value.\n\nLet's take another more mature look at these stories now that we're free from pressure to interpret it a certain way.\n\n\n\n#nativitystory #deconstruction #bible #atheism #christmas #christianity \n\n\n\n\n\n0:00 intro\n2:15 Christmas Story Authors\n8:49 Luke's Narrative \n11:02 Don't Ask Questions \n15:50 Matthew's Narrative and Prophecy Fulfillments \n27:03 Contradictions\n28:30 Closing Thoughts",

    "title": "My Deconversion Story: Realizing the Bible is an Etiological Myth",
    "description": "One thing that began to strike me as I was deconverting from Christianity is how so much of the Bible made more sense as an etiological myth than as a historical account. \nAn etiological myth is a story created to explain the origin or cause of something — such as a natural phenomenon, or a human custom.\nThe word comes from the Greek aitia (αἰτία), meaning “cause,” and logos (λόγος), meaning “account” or “story.” \nSo an etiological myth is literally a “story of causes.”\nBecause humans are hardwired for cause and effect, when they didn't know the cause of something, they would often formulate a story to explain it.\nThis helped early people make sense of the world and to orient themselves within it. \nInstead of explaining things through natural laws or biology, they explained them through narrative and the actions of a God.\nGod served for them as a placeholder concept to account for the phenomena they observed in the universe.\nFor them, it turned chaos into a narrative that could be passed down through their culture to immediately convey the thoughts and values they wanted to transmit.\nThrough studying ancient people group's etiological myths we gain a great insight into their psychological needs at the time, \nwhat scientific questions were pressing to them, and what morals they wrestled with, as they strived to build their society.\n\n#deconstruction  #atheist #exchristian #myth #mythology",

    "description": "Every generation inherits the same impossible question: If God is good, why does the world hurt so much? No doctrine has inspired more sermons, more justifications, or more silent doubt than the problem of suffering. From the battlefield to the hospital bed, from the cries of the hungry to the slow decay of nature itself, existence unfolds as if mercy were a rumor rather than a law. Yet billions still believe in a loving, intervening Creator — a being said to know every pain, possess every power, and will only good. It is this image of a tri-omni God — omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent — that collapses under the weight of reality. For if such a being exists, then the world as it is cannot be explained; and if the world as it is, exists, then such a being cannot. This dissonance lies at the heart of faith — and it is here that Christianity’s most comforting claim becomes its deepest contradiction.\n\n\n0:00 Presenting the Problem of Suffering \n8:00 Introduce the Apologists\n8:47 Complaints Against God\n15:45 God Prioritizes Freedom \n20:03 Heaven and Ultimate Justice \n26:05 Character Building \n31:56 The Mystery of God's Plan \n35:20 Conclusion \n\n\n#atheism #exchristian #deconstruction #agnosticism #philosophy #problemofevil #christianity",

    "description": "Today I'd like to focus on the specific harm that is done to young girls by a Christian society.\nI feel it's worth focusing on now as Christianity isn't necessarily growing in numbers- but is growing in power.\nHaving grown up steeped in Evangelicalism, I do have a lot of firsthand experience to reflect upon.\nChristianity claims to be a moral force, a sanctuary from the dangers of the world. \nBut what if the true danger lies not outside its walls, but within? \nWhat if, instead of protecting young girls, it erodes their dignity by placing the brunt of the blame for humanities fall on their shoulders?\nWhat if it chips away at their agency, and teaches them to see themselves only through the eyes of those who would control them?\nThis is the reality I lived for many years, and Countless girls are still living it. \nAnd when Christianity must choose between preserving its power or protecting a young girl, it tends to choose the preservation of its own power.\nThis video is for my daughter, and For the young girl I once was—whose agency was denied, whose innocence was treated as currency, whose self-worth was tethered to obedience. \nAnd for every girl still being silenced, blamed, or sacrificed on the altar of religious power.\nIf we want a place where girls and women are truly loved and respected we have to create it ourselves, as it is not found through the Abrahamic religions.\nJust as extreme Muslims have done when given power in Islamic Theocracies, American Evangelicals are trying to bring about a Christian theocracy and remove societal protection of women's independence.\n\n#deconstruction  #deconversion #atheist  #christianity #exvangelical #exchristian #trump  #epsteinlist  \n\n0:00 Introduction \n3:08 Women as Pets\n8:46 Relationship Confusion \n13:10 Women are seen as Dangerous \n18:27 Promise of  Protection is a Lie\n23:20 Preserving the Predator \n27:00 Christian Ways Dominating Government \n27:14 Epstein Cover-up \n30:40 Wrap-up",

    "description": "If you are drawn to an intense religion, that may be a red flag that you have some psychological work to do in order to meet your own needs in a beneficial way.\nYou may even be suffering from a neurotransmitter imbalance that is worth addressing, or maybe you've attached yourself to some ideas that aren't serving you well.\nBecause, I do believe that in a healthy and balanced mental state, the Christian message will be off-putting and should not resonate.\nThis isn't to say we don't benefit from humility and being able to acknowledge our flaws and challenges,\nBut to accept the Christian message of total depravity and that every inclination of our hearts is wicked should not feel right to our psyche- we should be able to sense that manipulation.\n\nThe church has become quite powerful in society and works hard to keep people in an unempowered and vulnerable state.\nHow we feel about ourselves is also a large determinant of how we feel about others, so a broken, unreasonable view of ourselves can manifest as harm to self and others.\nLikewise, if you are beginning to doubt the religion and are beginning to judge it by your own personal standards, I think that is a sign of personal growth.\nDealing with issues such as stress and anxiety properly, helps to lessen the need for escape through addictive drugs and reduces cravings for such.\n\nSolving real-life problems I think is a huge antidote to the withdrawal of Christianity. also creativity, and expressing oneself.\n\n\n#exvangelical #deconstruction #deconversion #atheist #dopamine #addictionrecovery",

    "description": "A couple of Christian proselytizing men knocked on my door today and we got into a long discussion about the Bible and the harm it has been causing. \nThey said surely people want to discuss all of the havoc we are seeing in the world and the country today.\nAt one point in the conversation one of them made the claim that the we are a Christian nation, and I said well that explains why so much of it is falling apart now and we are so divided. \nI warned him how the Bible is a dangerous book, and that's when the other man said \"but look how amazing and beautiful this world is.  Isn't it ungrateful for you to not recognize God and worship him for it?\"\nI told them there is nothing tying together all of this (pan) with the Bible. There is no legitimate reason to believe whoever wrote the Bible also created all of this. \n\nThere are many holy books making the same claim, yet none of them actually have evidence of their claim so they demand faith.\nBut faith leads us with no way to determine truth other than feelings impacted by cultural influence.\n\nAnd since this world is so fascinating and in many ways beautiful, majestic, seemingly authoritative in the way it can destroy lives with a storm or a famine, makes it all the more important for us to attribute it to the correct source, even if it's just a process.\n\nOf course when there is something really amazing, many are going to want to claim credit and demand praise for it.\nIt's up to us to decipher which claim is true.\nAnd what sounds very suspicious is someone claiming they heard from the being who created this and he wants you to worship him and live your life for him, obey this hierarchy and vote this way and that everything good you feel is his invisible holy spirit.\n\nCompared to seeing fossil and DNA evidence and being told we all emerged from a natural process, but maybe we don't know exactly what happened before that but we are willing to refine our understanding.\n\n#atheist #deconstruction #exvangelical #deconversion #christianity #bible #Evangelizing",

    "title": "Viewing Christianity as an Addictive Drug",
    "description": "More and more, I find it fitting—and even necessary—to view Christianity not as a path to truth, but as a socially accepted drug. \nLike addictive substances, it offers a sense of relief, belonging, and emotional high—particularly appealing to those already suffering psychologically. \nJust as opioids dull pain without solving its source, Christianity wraps spiritual-sounding language around deep emotional wounds, redirecting attention from the self and real issues to a glorified deity and of course, those who claim to represent it. \nThe popular idea that we all have a “God-shaped hole” inside of us doesn’t actually address psychological distress—it exploits it. \nIt primes vulnerable individuals to seek comfort not through self-understanding or healthy coping mechanisms, but through surrender to a system that first convinces them they’re broken.\n\nToday we’ll explore the provocative theory put forth by Dr. John Hunter in his book *Manufacturing Mania*, \nwhich argues that Christianity manipulates the same neurochemical systems as recreational drugs—and, in some cases, \nmirrors the altered states of mania and delusion found in mental illness. \nWe'll examine how religious highs, conversion experiences, and the euphoric boldness attributed to the “Holy Spirit” often resemble dopamine surges induced by substances like cocaine and meth, or the grandiosity found in manic episodes. \nWe'll also look at how programs like Alcoholics Anonymous often swap one addiction for another—trading chemical highs for religious ecstasy, with Jesus as the new drug of choice.\n\nseeing Christianity as a drug helps me wrap my head around what is going on in people and to see the nuance in how it's overall harmful, \nand vulnerable people get hooked on it to escape problems in reality- while it is also exploited by many to gain power and wealth. \nAnd it definitely helped me in understanding the feelings I had during praise and worship. which was the final thing I needed to deconstruct in my deconversion journey\n\nBeing done with religion is much like I imagine recovering from any addiction would feel, once you are freed from it's control over you, \nyou look back and see how harmful it was and are able to reflect upon the highs without being fooled by them again. \nNow I know that the feeling of God's presence was merely chemicals in my brain- Perhaps God is just dopamine, after all.\n\n#Neuroscience #addiction #mentalillness #mentalhealth #AlcoholicsAnonymous #Christianity #deconversion #deconstruction #atheism #drugs #religion #dopamine #cocaine #nicotine #meth #Exvangelical #Evangelical #exchristianity #philosophy \n\n@aDoseOfReason\n@JoelReadsBible\n\n\n0:00 intro\n4:19 Essence of Christian Teachings \n11:10 Dopamine \n14:24 How Dopamine Plays Into Christianity \n31:02 Mania Triggers and Drug Use\n34:40 How This Discredits Christianity \n38:00 Concluding Thoughts",

It served as a theological explanation that helped unite the Jews and Gentiles under Roman rule, who already viewed animal sacrifice as a barbaric practice. This just makes so much more sense as an explanation than that it was the plan of an objectively moral God from the very beginning. \n\nWhy would God change his views on blood sacrifice so drastically that he was willing to have suffer a painful crucifixion, so they wouldn't have to do it anymore? He could have just made death not a requirement for forgiveness, from the beginning. Then the Hebrew people could have become more civilized even sooner. God missed an opportunity to show timeless, objective morals.

But when you look further back to where our desires came from, we realize they all come from our subconscious mind which through evidence we see is clearly dependent on the physical state of our minds which was fully formed by factors outside of our control. Such as our early life environment and genetics. Thus, we can't truly blame or credit people for the way they turn out. And obviously, Christianity is based on fully blaming people for their beliefs and actions as if a deep moral shame can be warranted. Even through Christianity itself, we see that God has ultimately pre-ordained who will be saved and who will be severely punished.\n\n0:00 intro \n2:15 Levels of will\n5:40 Texas Tower Sniper example \n8:43 Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex \n11:50 Mental illnesses are relevant \n16:00 Myth of the immortal soul\n19:50 Devastating to Christianity \n22:07 Narcissistic endeavor \n22:50 Suffering on earth\n24:10 Jesus on judging\n25:00 Why this is a good thing\n27:30 Parenting\n28:01 Wrap-up\n\n\n#philosophy #christianity  #atheism #freewill #deconversion #exvangelical #judgement #mentalhealth",

    "description": "Should we surrender all of the accumulated knowledge we have in modern times and just allow ancient, unverified texts to override our moral values and dictate the way we live our lives?  \nDo women really not have anything of value to contribute to men outside of sex, homemaking and childrearing? Do you really want your daughters to get passed up for promotions to men every time because they aren't allowed to have authority over a man, and be completely dependent upon a person born with a penis in order to make a decent living?",

    "description": "At some point, we may recognize that we are nearing the end of our journey through life. When that moment arrives, we must confront who we have become and reflect on how we have navigated the circumstances we were given. This moment of introspection resembles the concept of the day of judgment in Christian mythology, except in this scenario, the real judge will be your own inner critic.",

    "title": "IS BELIEF IN GOD REALLY A MATTER OF MORALITY?",
    "description": "This video calls into question the assumption that belief is a matter of morality, and therefore warrants moral judgement. Through the Christian belief system, the sole determinant of the quality of our afterlife depends on whether or not we believed in and accepted Jesus as the son of God. Those who disbelieve are considered filthy rags. Believers are seen as morally good, while apostates will be rightfully punished. But is this just a manipulation tactic to get people to believe something which doesn't have enough evidence in and of itself to warrant belief? We will take a closer look at what factors play into our beliefs, where the blame for genuine disbelief ultimately lies, and the implications on the Christian faith if it is found that belief is not a matter of morality.\nbeccayoley@gmail.com",
