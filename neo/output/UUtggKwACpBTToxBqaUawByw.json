The Self-Published Fantasy Blog Off (SPFBO), the contest founded by author Mark Lawrence to shine a light on self-published fantasy, is in its tenth year, giving us SPFBOX (the \"X\" being for Roman numeral 10)! My team is one of ten judging teams reading a total of 300 books, with 30 going to each team. Each member of my team read six books and picked one as a semifinalist. My task was to read all five semifinalists from my team and determine which is our team's finalist, which will in turn compete against the other nine finalists to determine the winner of SPFBOX. In this video, I discuss the five semifinalists with my team members before revealing our team's finalist! \nVaughn Roycroft's blog: https://vaughnroycroftblog.com/\nMatt: @geauxreadbooks \nAbel: @bookswithabel \nSam: @SamHarrison2099 \nBrian: @BrianBell7 \n\nThe books on Amazon:\nSouth Breaks by Hannah Steenbock: https://www.amazon.com/South-Breaks-Winds-Destiny-Book-ebook/dp/B0B5MW7FLR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2W04NHZTV19MT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EfD7u_hlyR2Ca2iDDntKnlVEyj3-_6suvA11nbKUULiNfKRb2kRGeXygEWClGb9OgN0XDPOWJXt74rgTp1ziyRZXcuToIJLAN8DIGx82BTV1gwMhz26pHQVhKfyZBrIm-k5sjf0bF0cLWl56evs-1S0HXCUXDvDJ0AQ2fhM7pQce9AJIkhMjICLz6mdS3K2M3SLKw7lFaLquw9NVVnmm0zYS3J8VGwWvKshYjOsVp90.ATakyi2OYJBecIQcuyBgururXACfn6hanXxBbO721L0&dib_tag=se&keywords=south+breaks+hannah&qid=1729993588&sprefix=south+breaks+hannah+%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-1\nTrollgrave by Alex Bradshaw: https://www.amazon.com/Trollgrave-Alex-S-Bradshaw/dp/1838352422/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2KK4ZSH7JE5SM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IrSQcs5k3sLKpaCbjU1tU9G954PJxaIFF0z0FuqvmwI.rXVhRws__gR8ms2yOTDSNdU7X7nsKnexX_-gDTieKqg&dib_tag=se&keywords=trollgrave&qid=1729993671&sprefix=trollgrave%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-2\nThe Sunset Sovereign by Laura Huie: https://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Sovereign-Dragons-Memoir/dp/B0CN2WFH4T/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=4JA9YPQHYAIS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1WmiNe5GHpXEIkNJ9yb_SZ9_y9QGAl9s5IY8bKawMsI.REVD-v61yDUDzbXnOxutwTTdmIXOpg57915NTGSK0Ac&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+sunset+sovereign+a+dragon%27s+memoir&qid=1729993760&sprefix=the+sunset+sover%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1\nSoulstealer by El McInerney: https://www.amazon.com/Soulstealer-fantasy-adventure-El-McInerney/dp/1738430510/ref=sr_1_1?crid=340F9W00WBM14&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ydyzocgL0MqbImdent3dwY3-gxzYN_UAfMGxp8WoQKY.J-ESAlqEOf-Y8B1xWWo9KJ1VuqUaHb5HAKCDEC97PfM&dib_tag=se&keywords=soulstealer+el+mcinerney&qid=1729993821&sprefix=soulstealer+el%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-1\nThe Tenacious Tale of Tanna the Tendersword by Dewey Conway and Bill Adams: https://www.amazon.com/Tenacious-Tendersword-Chronicles-Champion-Galdifort/dp/B0CYH9TCJJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5GC7KDTJLD4C&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IXy2Met9v6pCfWCLwmdTYA.khC0V3XSIyEsWFO7eFmYTjKGXXT0oaNUKVKMm_RVweQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+tenacious+tale+of+tanna+the+tendersword&qid=1729993901&sprefix=the+tenacious+tale+of+ta%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-1",

    "description": "@Ian Ravnskjold has done it again! Having composed the music for the cover reveal of The Way of Edan, he has now written a medieval-style piece inspired by the Song of Folcwalda, which appears in Chapter 7 of The Way of Edan: A Dawn Attack (pages 114-115 in the paperback). The Song of Folcwalda is in the style of Old English Poetry, meaning it is alliterative, associative, full of kennings, and concerned with elder days as well as courage as a response to life's fleetingness, among other things. Check out Ravnskjold's channel for plenty more medieval music, including Viking, Celtic, tavern style, and more! \n\nThe Lyrics to the Song of Folcwalda:\nFierce was Folcwalda, the flinger of rings,\nWhen he wended his way, he wielded his folk,\nTo the banks of the broad one, the blue Theodamar.\nOver meadows they marched, from the mother of kingdoms,\nFrom the homeland of heroes, the hallowed Ellorlond.\nUnbarred he his breasthoard and brandished his spear,\nThe ranks he rallied, his rede he made known.\nTheir shields they shook, from sheaths sprang swords,\nBright were the battle-flames, the blades all keen,\nWhen cried out their king, he kindled their wrath:  \n“Listen! Loaned is this life, not long are we here,\nEre death claims his due, in darkness enfolds us.\nThe rings come to rust, and rest takes the warriors.\nThe hawk flies not home, the horses are silent.\nThe ground will eft guard both the gold and the silver.\nThe sword of the soldier in sorrow abandoned  \nLies shattered in shards, its sheath now empty.\nHushed is the harp, and the hall stands idle. \nFriends are fleeting, family will perish.\nWhere have they wandered, the ones who came before?\nWhere linger the lost, the line of our folk?\nIn the mirk of the mound are a man’s longest dreams,\nE’en bold ones will bow, barrows will hold them.\nBut glory is granted ere the ground claims their bones\nTo the fearless who flee not from fate’s mighty grip.\nEre death ends his days, man’s deeds make his name.\nThen go forth to win fame, folk of my heart!”",

Central to the topic is the concept of the tightrope that epic fantasy writers walk between a style that is too archaic and affected and a style that is too contemporary and mundane. By walking that tightrope, writers of fantasy can help bring alive worlds where transformation takes place.",

In fall, the air is crisp and clear: name a book with a vivid setting!\n2. Nature is beautiful… but also dying: name a book that is beautifully written, but also deals with a heavy topic like loss or grief.\n3. Fall is back to school season: share a non-fiction book that taught you something new.\n4. In order to keep warm, it’s good to spend some time with the people we love: name a fictional family/household/friend-group that you’d like to be a part of.\n5. The colorful leaves are piling up on the ground: show us a pile of fall-colored spines!\n6. Fall is the perfect time for some storytelling by the fireside: share a book wherein somebody is telling a story.\n7. The nights are getting darker: share a dark, creepy read.\n8. The days are getting colder: name a short, heartwarming read that could warm up somebody’s cold and rainy day.\n9. Fall (luckily, it’s my favorite season) returns every year: name an old favorite that you’d like to return to soon.\n10. Fall is the perfect time for cozy reading nights: share your favorite cozy reading “accessories”!\n11. Spread the autumn appreciation and tag some people!\n\nThe End of the Year Book Tag: \n1) Are there any books you started this year that you need to finish?\n2) Do you have an autumnal book to transition into the end of the year?\n3) Is there a new release you're still waiting for?\n4) What are three books you want to read before the end of the year?\n5) Is there a book you think could still shock you and become your favourite book of the year?\n6) Have you already started making reading plans for next year?",
