The choice is yours because, as Catherine Deneuve said, you can't have both.

For pretty self-explanatory reasons, the 2022 report chose to only include statistics on patients aged 18-19 whereas the 2020 report included data on patients aged 13-19. The 2022 report makes it seem as if the number of labiaplasty patients has gone down when, actually, going off the footnotes data is only included for 18-19 year olds. The 2022 footnote reads: “While patients under the age of eighteen may access plastic surgery procedures under physician guidance and with the approval of a parent or guardian, this is atypical and the majority of cases within this data set are focused on the ages eighteen to nineteen years” (p.p.20).

    "description": "Try Rocket Money for free: https://RocketMoney.com/kidology \n\nVIDEO DISCLAIMER\nRecently, there's been a lot of conversation and debate around \"safe spaces\" and who is allowed in them on the basis of...profiling people. I do want to emphasise (as I say in the video) that I am not saying that people who cosplay their minority status aren't minorities. I think their is a recent glamorisation of being part of particular minority identities/demographics that really isn't true to the lived experiences of most minorities inhabiting those identities/demographics. It's \"trendy\" to be oppressed for some of these minorities but, for most, it either isn't trendy or is something they are indifferent to in their day-to-day lives. This has bizarre ramifications when it comes to how minorities are perceived, treated, lumped together and \"tokenised\" not just by everybody else but especially by cosplaying minorities who increasingly prove themselves incapable of appreciating the very things they are allegedly fighting for: an appreciation and respect for diversity, difference, tolerance and the humanisation of individuals. It's disappointing that we're going down this path and I hope that, sooner rather than later, we change course.

    "description": "Men are lost and we need to not only talk about it but care about it. Too much discourse on the matter, particularly from the Left, tends to see it as a non-issue or something that men should just \"get over\". The Right also tends to see men as worthless if they don't fit into the cookie-cut traditional definition and confinement of masculinity; something that is impossible for most men to achieve in this day and age. In their own way, they've abandoned men and are keeping them preoccupied with conspiracies and scapegoats rather than dealing with the real issues at hand. One thing that the legacy of Nelson Mandela has taught me is that we get nowhere in wishing the same kind of suffering and harm to our adversaries. Men's health impacts us all. So, let's have a conversation and be as empathetic as possible.

    "description": "~ Chapters ~\n0:00 INTRODUCTION\n\n4:56 PART I - THE CURRENT SITUATION\n- 9:17 Political dogma | Macro vs. micro issues \n- 11:10 Postmodernism and its existential crises \n- 13:33 Lazy politics vs. labour \n- 25:08 It's always harder for The Left \n\n25:58 THE RIGHT'S ADVANTAGE\n- 25:58 Nostalgia\n- 27:04 Honesty \n- 32:41 Whiteness (as is)\n- 33:39 Diverse membership criteria\n- 35:36 Populism \n\n39:45 PART II - THE ONLINE LEFT\n- 39:45 Cliques | Politics as friendship vs. politics as business\n- 44:23 Alienating the working class\n- 49:29 Andrew Tate | The Online Left vs. \"ordinary people\" \n- 58:56 \"Abstract people\"\n- 1:04:15 That \"VICE Debate\" \n\n1:08:36 A CONCLUSION?\n\n~ A note of caution ~\nJust in case you are wondering, *I am apolitical.* I do stay very politically informed, primarily due to my own curiosity and interest. However, I do not participate in politics nor vote strategically. This is purely because of my context - I am a minority with very little socio-political power yet my human rights are sufficiently protected under EU and international law. I am not conservative nor right-wing. I am anti-neoliberalism as it manifests itself contemporarily; but I can appreciate its theoretical value. Perhaps, some day or due to circumstance, I will engage in politics; however, at this point in my life, I do not care for it. \n\n*This video is purely analytical.* Please do remember that.\n\nI adore you all, lefties and righties alike💋.\n\n~ Definitions ~\n✦ THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM - https://twitter.com/kidology_co/status/1608568753230602241 [This is based purely on theory re. North America and N. Europe] *Neoliberalism, for instance, historically is more to the right; however, I would argue that its prevalence since c.1979 has shifted its ideas and appeal more centre-left\n✦ THE LEFT - Encompasses political ideologies centred on egalitarianism and social equality (e.g., social equity via social reform) | Influenced by critical theories of society and socio-political identities | A belief in relatively expansive government role and influence in achieving social progress\n✦ THE RIGHT -  Political ideologies that place civil rights and liberties at the centre of decision-making | Minimal government intervention in the lives of individuals/families/federal states/communities |  An observance of natural laws re. morality, social hierarchy based on merit/divine rights/tradition/history to direct and order society and culture | Anti-communism \n\n~ Primary sources are fully referenced throughout the video ~ \n*NB. Just because some of these sources have acted as resources it does NOT mean that Kidology condones or is promoting what has been said.

    "description": "❝Good luck to our super moderator Zahra Bahjawi for her three midterms this week! Kat2123 did an absolutely fantastic job, but we sure did miss Zahra!❞\n\n❝SOME INTERESTING COMMENTS FROM THE CHAT❞\n* “I think parasocial relationships just allow us to present a better and less disappointing side to other people over what would occur in real life, more fake and shallower but it feels nice.” (yusuf) \n* “I think it’s bad because as a Gen Z I feel like it’s slowly replacing in-person communication because it puts a band aid on the wound of loneliness.” (Venus) \n* “…I love that the internet provides me outlets for discourse on my niche topics of interest. I have real life friends, but no one to watch Drag Race with me and pick it apart, lol.” (Kait Why)\n* “While parasocial friendship is really amazing, ghosting is what has made me not depend too much on virtual friendship.” (Jaehoon Jung) \n* “My life is kind of sad…Too many relationships with streamers who will never learn anything about me.” (pedro luiz)\n* “I’ve found that parasocial relationships can be a good way to lessen the influence of social determinism on the viewer. In getting ‘acquainted’ with, say, filmmakers, writers, musicians, one gets to see and feel other ways to live and consider the world. Coming from a small town in France, these ‘relationships’ have truly made me encounter ideas and ways of being that I would never have encountered in “real” life.” (Spilman)\n* “yes” (The Relyk)\n* “Most of my social interactions with friends are through a group chat…which actually turned pretty toxic and took a toll on my mental health. I had to back myself away from it which was difficult.” (digitaleyez)\n* “…As somebody with chronic pain, parasocial relations have been so important to me to connect with others in similar situations.” (Kerrie O’Neill) \n* “I honestly wonder if we will ever get to the point that we can describe different texting styles like we describe dialects.” (Kata) \n* “Cannabis is herbal alcohol, ew.” (Samurai Yun)\n* “Kidology talking about Chomsky is literally proving how discourse, and being exposed to it, is a positive force in education.” (Noah Brown)\n* “I want to be a professional parasocialite.” (Jerry Vang) \n* “I saw that video of Miss Simon and it had a hint of mean-spiritedness. Disagreeing is fine but that was a bit much tbh.” (Wendy B. Screen)\n* “…I’d like to ask if voting would be considered parasocial and if it is, how does it affect it?” (lucas)\n* “I think of relationships as a sort of energy exchange. The exchanged energy needs to be in balance. And that can only happen when it is well defined. All relationships should be well defined.” (Chaos Joerg)\n* “I wish both mental and physical health could be considered a human right.” (indrinita)\n* “TikTok therapy is like fast food.” (Jerry Vang) | TikTok is the new therapy it seems.” (Jamaal Clarke)\n* “…I think it’s very commendable how Max [MrGirl] just wants people to radically advocate for themselves in such a far-from-social-norm way. Such a shame people cannot seem to read him properly.” (magicalflyingNEMO)\n* “Is having pets also kind of parasocial?” (vivvy)\n\n❝READING SUGGESTIONS | CONTENT MENTIONED❞\n* http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/horton_and_wohl_1956.html (Mass Communication and Para-social Interaction by Donald Horton and R.

    "description": "The first 1,000 people to use the link or my code kidology will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare: \nhttps://skl.sh/kidology05221\n\n•┈•• TIMESTAMPS ••┈• \n0:00 Introduction \n1:55 Skillshare sponsorship \n4:51 Liam Neeson Revisited\n16:18 \"Thinking\" in the internet age \n24:28 Thought crimes \n\n•┈•• SUGGESTED LIAM NEESON FILMOGRAPHY •┈••\n[Liam Neeson is not one of my favourite actors - he's good-looking but his films aren't really my cup of tea - but he is definitely good in some lesser known projects]\n\n→ Silence (2016) - The novel by  Shūsaku Endō got me onto this film. There's a 1970s film adaptation which I personally didn't like so much. Definitely read the novel - it is exceptional and a fascinating history. Based on actual events, the film follows two Jesuit priests in the 17th century who go to Nagasaki in search of their mentor Cristóvão Ferreira (played by Liam). Their mission is to locate him and to convert and protect Japanese converts under ruthless persecution. They discover that their mentor has renounced his faith. A very philosophical and psychologically tormenting film. Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield had exceptional chemistry. I loved it!\n \n→ A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014) - I am a big fan of the book series by Lawrence Block and I absolutely loved this film adaptation. It isn't for the faint-hearted and it didn't do very well by Hollywood standards, but I thought the aesthetic and tone was very true to the book (The Sins of the Fathers by Lawrence Block).\n\n→ Schindler's List (1993) - Again, read the book titled 'Schindler's Ark' by Thomas Keneally. It is based on the true story of German industrial magnet Oskar Schindler (played by Liam) who morphed from an immoral businessman profiting off cheap labour and NSDAP ideology into remarkably using his 'clout' for exceptional good. This is definitely necessary reading and watching!\n\n→ Kinsey (2004) - Based on the life of the infamous Alfred Kinsey played by Liam Neeson.\n\n→ Before & After (1996) - This is a family drama and really brings into question whether family comes before morality. Liam plays the father of a teenaged son who is accused of a terrible crime. \n\n→ Ordinary Love (2019) - This is just an absolutely beautiful and wholesome film. It's very sad but it's truly touching to see what a real and ordinary marriage can look like between two people who are exclusively dependent on one another for meaning and love. \n\n→ Michael Collins (1996) - If you want to learn about modern Irish history, this is a great place to start. And it starred Alan Rickman so...\n\n→ Widows (2018) - Viola Davis can do no wrong and she was exceptional in this lead role. Her interviews about the mixed marriage she portrays alongside Liam Neeson are fascinating and handled with such sophistication and insight. The cast is exceptional and the overall concept (no spoilers!) is genius.  \n\n→ The Good Mother (1988) - \"The Good Mother explores feelings and beliefs about children's exposure to adult sexuality and challenges society's growing reliance upon courts to settle complex private and ethical matters\" (Wikipedia). I watched this when I was a teenager alongside watching 'Kramer vs. Kramer' (1979). If you're interested in the evolution and dilemmas of the American family court system, these are some unforgettable films to watch.\n\n→ Home (2006) - This is a documentary film all about the concept of \"home\" as it applies to New York's A-Lister residents, most of whom have Irish roots.\n\n→ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018) - This is a Western anthology film. The cinematography is just mesmerising. Although pretty funny, it is very dark and reflective. \n\n* Atlanta (2016 - ) - Aside from Liam's cameo in the latest episode of season 3, this series is brilliant. If you like Donald Glover and/or Childish Gambino, this series is scripture. \n\n•┈•• SOCIAL MEDIA •┈••   \nTwitter - @kidology_co\nInstagram - Kidology.co\nPatreon - Kidology\nEmail me! - kidology.co@gmail.com",

    "description": "NB. Having compared Shannon's typical video content to her latest video upload, I would argue that she is working with a legal team based on the legal jargon and style of argument she used. The difference in tone, semantics, and video style demonstrated to me that her video is likely intended for more than just a regular monetised upload to YouTube: It is a legal document which she can use, quite effectively, in proving that she has been defamed. Her video, in my opinion, was NOT made for her YouTube audience or for Emily Artful which explains why it has gotten the overwhelmingly negative response that it has.\n\nNB. I am not a lawyer! And, no, I don't watch Law & Order. I just read a lot and am obsessively analytical. This video was made for my own amusement more than anything else. \n\nNB.

All these events occurred in the span of no more than 15 months and represent why children should NEVER be on the internet. The YouTube adoption community has a lot to answer for, and this story is a perfect example of how harmful it can be. Nikki and Dan decide to adopt internationally, then to adopt domestically, then to foster domestically, and then to conceive naturally...all within a 12 month timeframe. There are so many undertones here of what has recently happened on Nikki Phillippi's channel (i.e., the announcement of their family dog Bowser being put down). Nikki's interpretation of biblical scripture, her use of conspiracy theories, and her saviour complex are explored in detail here. \n\nThis took a lot of research and time, so I apologise for any potential mistakes in captions and dates. Any mistakes identified will be corrected immediately and acknowledged below. \n\nThank you for watching! Subscribe and like if you enjoy this kind of thing.
