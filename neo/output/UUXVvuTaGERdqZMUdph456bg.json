    "title": "From an infinite regress to a necessary foundation",
    "description": "I uncover an idea that has been hidden in the battle of ideas. It took me a long time to see this clearly myself. While I have understood for a long time that the existence of a *necessary foundation* of the world is consistent with an *infinite regress* of causes, I didn't see so clearly how an infinite chain of causes actually makes the existence of a necessary foundation all the more pressing. \n\nQUESTIONS:\n\nIf you have questions about why I propose that the probability of continued existence diminishes without a necessary foundation, you might find this link helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GyNcuI4p6c\n\nADVANCED:\n\nYou might recognize Aquinas' distinction between two types of regresses: (i) an *accidentally ordered* (horizontal) regress across time, vs. (ii) an *essentially ordered* (vertical) regress at any given time. Some philosophers have argued that even if the regress of accidentally ordered causes is infinite, still, there must be a first cause in the chain of essentially ordered causes. In this way, one could are that a necessary foundation is compatible with an infinite horizontal regress.\n\nHowever, I wish to say something further. In fact, Aquinas' distinction is irrelevant to my proposal. For even if both types of regresses (horizontal and vertical) are infinite, that does nothing to remove the possibility of, or need for, an ultimate explanation of existence. After all, a universe that is infinite along *any* line of dependence is still a universe, and no universe is explained solely by its causal lengths. By contrast, a necessary foundation (whether itself infinite or not) can provide the ultimate explanation of all contingent causal lines, whether those lines are essentially ordered, accidentally ordered, or ordered in some other way.\n\nARGUMENTS FOR A NECESSARY BEING:\n\nSee http://joshualrasmussen.com/",

    "title": "Problem of Evil: Moral Argument (4 of 4)",
    "description": "Here is a more technical unpacking of the argument, followed by responses to some objections:\n\nM = \"there is a moral standard\" \nG = \"there is a perfectly good foundation\"\n\n1. There is evil.\n2. If there is evil, then there is a moral standard (moral truths) that distinguish between good and evil.\n3. Therefore, M\n4. Probability of M on G = 1.\n5. Probability of M on ~G is less than 1.\n6. ∴ M supports G.\n\nThe probability is epistemic, understood as rational degree of expectation.\n\nObjections:\n\nQ1. If the foundation were evil, that would equally entail M. \n\nReply. That's consistent with the conclusion.  Consider that *every* data is entailed by infinitely many hypotheses, yet we obviously don't infer that no data supports *any* hypotheses. For example, genetic similarities support biological evolution, yet this same data is also entailed by the hypothesis that a supernatural demon created all species with their genetic similarities.\n\nMoreover, there are asymmetries between good and evil:\n1. A standard that distinguishes between good and evil is itself good, not evil.\n2. Evil always depends on something good. For example, evil actions require some knowledge, but knowledge is an intrinsic good. Evil actions involve exchanging a greater good (like a relationship) for a lesser good (like temporary pleasure), which implies that there is already good.\n\nIn short, you can't have evil without something good (such as a moral standard), but you can have good prior to all evil.\n\nO2. M is already maximally likely with or without G.\n\nReply. We need to distinguish prior from posterior probability. M's posterior probability may be maximal on your moral experiences, but *prior to* all moral facts, its probability is far from maximal. Compare: the fact that 2 + 2 = 4 may be certain to you, but it is not thereby certain that 2 + 2 would equal 4 were there no mathematical truths. \n\nNote that *a priori* probability -- a probability you can sense a priori -- is not the same as *prior* probability.\n\nTaking a step back, the hypothesis that there is a perfect being is relatively simple and has high predictive power. It predicts, among other things, that there are both necessary rules of proper reasoning -- logic -- and necessary moral laws. It is interesting that reality should \"happen\" to have necessary truths, including truths about how persons should behave. While these necessary truths may trivially have an objective, non-epistemic probability of 1, it is far from trivial that there are necessary truths at all. Reality just happens to include necessary truths that are expected to exist if there is a perfect being. This is strange and striking. It gets even more striking when we consider that reality just happens to include the right parameters required for the existence of *moral communities* who can apprehend moral laws. \n\nThe argument is reinforced by a certain Russellian paradox of propositions expressed in plural quantification. The paradox arises from the premise that purely Platonic propositions would automatically exist for any xs. But that’s impossible, for there can’t be a proposition about all and only the propositions that aren’t about themselves, since such a proposition is about itself if and only if it is not -- a contradiction. The best solution to this puzzle of which I am aware is that propositions exist explanatorily posterior to mental activity. This result makes the existence of necessary moral propositions all the stranger, absent a perfect mind.\n\nThis argument is a seed. In your hands, you can develop this seed in a variety of ways.",

    "description": "As a philosopher, I like to understand the ROOT of things. As I observe our political conversations and fights, I think I see a root of the problem: we have felt *devalued* in these debates. Respect has been broken. \n\nIt is time to transform our conversations by building a foundation of respect. Truth matters, but truth flow is interrupted by broken respect. We have the power to break these barriers and *reverse* political polarization. It starts with a decision: make the people who disagree with us feel valued. Then we build the foundation for positive cultural transformation.\n\n....As an addendum, I'd like to share a place where I personally struggle with the implementation of my proposal. It occurs when I witness someone devalue someone else for their political or philosophical ideas. I feel a strong desire to protect the person who is devalued. My temptation, then, is to protect and defend someone in a way that actually devalues the attacker. For example, I might point out the simple-mindedness of the attacker who arrogantly shames people naively. Now there is a place to expose vice. The problem, however, is that in many contexts of communication exposing vice makes things worse by fueling the problem of polarization. Also, I am being hypocritical if I devalue someone for devaluing someone. How do I get out of that problem? As a first step in answering that question, I find it is helpful for me to redirect my aim by asking myself how I can serve people with insights that matter to *them*. Sometimes when I want to expose someone's bad thinking (on any subject), it is more about my need to feel known and appreciated than about service. Once I recognize this, I can shift into service mode and free myself from wasting time living below the line: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqzYDZAqCI.",

Mental-physical correlations.\n4. The argument from brain death.\n\nCollins also sows seeds of reasons he doubts materialism. Let me say here that I recognize that each of the considerations we discuss invites further inquiry, and so I offer this exchange not as a way to trump materialists, but as an invitation for further inquiry and consideration.\n\nThis conversation introduces you to some of the concepts in the philosophy of mind. For further reading if you want to master many of the basic concepts, theories, and arguments, I recommend Searle's book, Mind: a Brief Introduction (https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Brief-Introduction-Fundamentals-Philosophy/dp/0195157346).",

    "description": "I suggest that even if something can explain itself in SOME sense, there is still a deeper question as to why there is that very circle of explanation. If we say the circle explains itself in some (strange) sense, still, there remains a clear sense in which the question of why it actually exists, rather than not, has not thereby been adequately answered.",

In this interview, Collins shares his latest discoveries on the fine-tuning for science and discoverability. He later gives an interesting argument against following reason to a conclusion that undermines reason itself. He then argues that a mind at the foundation of all things can best explain the origin and value of reason itself. At the end, he offers tips for how to develop one's theory of the world.",

    "description": "See how a reality from nothing creates the Problem of Chaos.\n\nIf you are tempted to reply that we've never observed absolutely nothing, then I must clarify something: when I say \"x comes from nothing,\" I don't mean that there is nothing at all when x comes to be. Rather, I mean that there is no thing that produces x. That is, x appears without any cause (whether deterministic or indeterministic) or any relevant condition. My argument, then, is that if anything can come to be without a cause, then, by the principle of irrelevant differences, we have a problem of chaos. \n\nIf you have other responses or ideas, feel free to post them below! Your ideas are valuable to me.",
