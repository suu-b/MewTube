    "title": "Christianity After The End of History | Prof. Alec Ryrie on Surviving The Age of Hitler",
    "description": "In this episode, I talk to Professor Alec Ryrie, renowned historian of Christianity and author of Protestants, to explore the harrowing intersection of Christianity and Nazi Germany. As we look back at the \"Age of Hitler,\" we ask the difficult questions: How did the church fail, who were the few who resisted, and how does this history shape the way we live out our values today?\n\nProfessor Ryrie provides a masterclass on historical integrity, discussing the \"moral revolution\" of the 20th century and how the legacy of the World Wars continues to influence modern secular and religious thought.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\nThe Rise of \"German Christians\" vs. The Confessing Church.\n\nThe moral crisis of the 1930s and 40s.\n\nHow the \"Age of Hitler\" redefined modern ethics.\n\nLessons for Christians navigating political extremism today.\n\nDonate on Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nDonate on PayPal:  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT  \nMy Links:  https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \n\n-----\nThis content is CAN credentialed, which means you can report instances of harassment, abuse, or other harm on their hotline at (617) 249-4255, or on their website at creatoraccountabilitynetwork.org.",

Instead, Schuringa argues that its enduring power and influence, particularly within elite educational institutions, are deeply rooted in specific social and political forces, demonstrating its role in upholding the status quo and liberal ideology since the post-WWII era.\n\nChristoph's Website: https://christophschuringa.com/ \nBook Link: https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/3018-a-social-history-of-analytic-philosophy\n\nDonate on Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nDonate on PayPal:  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT  \nMy Links:  https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \n\n-----\nThis content is CAN credentialed, which means you can report instances of harassment, abuse, or other harm on their hotline at (617) 249-4255, or on their website at creatoraccountabilitynetwork.org.",

    "description": "Dive deep into the world of the \"anti-woke\" movement as we critically examine the philosophies and rhetoric of Reid Nicewonder, PF Jung, and Peter Boghossian. This video argues that their criticisms of \"wokeness\" are not only deeply flawed but often reveal a pattern of projection, leading to ideologies that can be described as cult-like and harmful.\n\nWe'll explore how these figures, often positioned as \"culture warriors,\" contribute to a divisive narrative, and why their approaches might be more about ideology than genuine intellectual discourse. From the origins of \"Cultural Marxism\" as a far-right scapegoat to the problematic implications of \"luckpilling,\" we dissect the arguments that underpin their worldview.\n\nJoin us as we expose the inconsistencies and dangers within the anti-woke agenda, and understand why their philosophies are, in many ways, a projection of the very issues they claim to fight against.\n\nSources:\n\nPF Jung - Why People like Douglas Murray are the REAL “Woke Right”: https://youtu.be/oO4TGrSh8oo?si=4QrMV0NRF_nPsJBP\n\nEmbrace the Void: Luckpilling: https://www.voidpod.com/podcasts/2024/12/2/luckpilled-chapter-three-politics-of-luck\n\nThree Arrows - How “Cultural Marxism” became the Far Right’s Scapegoat: https://youtu.be/qlrpSpwxgWw?si=G-N00CjWmWcCyqah \n\nCordial Curiosity - How to be Optimistic in our Postmodern World: https://youtu.be/taf-_OZnMxA?si=qLTBmnqBoXvkfaba\n\nReid Nicewonder , Halo 3 Midnight Launch: https://youtu.be/ZVkGtVJVYps?si=3GZemPsUfNQTcwF7\n\nJordan Peterson Analyses Nazi Propaganda: https://youtu.be/_5BcEWptMls?si=kqPgtlBC7oINjdDn \n\nPeter Boghossian CANCELS free speech of Critic: https://youtu.be/V_xA-hYoN_Y?si=CrOoS--85pC7FKdz \n\n#AntiWoke #CultureWar #ReidNicewonder #PFJung #PeterBoghossian #Projection #CultLike #CriticalAnalysis #SocialJustice #Ideology\n----\n\nDonate on Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nDonate on PayPal:  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT  \nMy Links:  https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \n\n-----\nThis content is CAN credentialed, which means you can report instances of harassment, abuse, or other harm on their hotline at (617) 249-4255, or on their website at creatoraccountabilitynetwork.org.",

    "title": "Cognitive Dissonance Champion Trump Apologist: @PineCreekDoug vs. Reality (feat. Digital Gnosis)\"",
    "description": "Doug from Pinecreek performs extraordinary mental gymnastics whilst debating Digital Gnosis about Trump's Ukraine policy. Watch as Doug defends Trump's apparent betrayal of Ukraine, completely misrepresenting the historical context of Russia's multiple invasions and numerous ceasefire violations.\nThe video highlights Doug's stunning inability to comprehend why Zelensky might hesitate to accept a \"peace deal\" that offers Ukraine zero defence guarantees—essentially forcing Ukraine into an extortion arrangement with no international protection. Digital Gnosis methodically dismantles these arguments while Doug twists himself into logical pretzels.\nBut the economic nonsense doesn't stop there! Marvel at Doug's baffling assertion that imports somehow don't count towards consumption in GDP calculations—a claim that would fail any first-year economics course. The grand finale features Doug's impassioned defence of Trump's economically destructive tariff proposals, ignoring mountains of evidence that such policies harm American consumers.\nA masterclass in confirmation bias and logical fallacies, this debate showcases what happens when political loyalty trumps factual reality. Perfect viewing for those interested in critical thinking, international relations, and how not to understand basic economics.\n\n---- \nSupport the channel by becoming a Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nAll of my links can be found here: https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \nOne-off PayPal donations welcome -  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT",

    "description": "In this thought-provoking interview, we delve into the philosophical underpinnings of psychiatry with Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist and Clinical Assistant Professor at Case Western Reserve University specialising in the philosophy of psychiatry. We explore the historical origins of psychiatric practice, examine how concepts of \"normal\" and \"disorder\" are constructed, and investigate the complex interplay between scientific evidence and social values in psychiatric diagnosis. Dr. Aftab shares insights on the bio-psycho-social model, the challenges posed by the replication crisis, and offers a critical perspective on the future of mental health care. Whether you're interested in medicine, philosophy, or the nature of mental distress, this conversation illuminates how psychiatric practice sits at the intersection of scientific inquiry and profound philosophical questions about the human condition.\n\n📝 Follow Dr. Aftab's Substack: https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/\n📚 Read Dr. Aftab's book: \"Conversations in Critical Psychiatry\" (Oxford University Press)\n\n⏱️ Timestamps: \n0:00 Countdown \n0:20 Dr Aftab Intro \n2:01 What is Psychiatry \n7:44 Historical Origins of Psychiatry \n13:28 \"Illness\" and \"Disorder\" in Psychiatry \n16:48 Removal of Homosexuality from the DSM \n30:57 Are Psychiatric conditions systemic failures? \n42:55 The Anti-Psychiatry Movement, Good and Bad\n55:10 Psychiatry and Public Trust \n\n-----\n\n🧠 Support the channel by becoming a Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis\n🔗 All my links in one place: https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis\n💡 One-off donations welcome: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL\n🤝 Join our Discord community: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT\n🎙️ Subscribe for more philosophical conversations on science, society, and consciousness",

    "description": "Join me for a fascinating discussion with Aaron Rabinowitz, host of the Embracing the Void podcast, as we dive deep into his PhD thesis on the Philosophy of Luck. Aaron presents a compelling argument that at their core, all human actions are fundamentally grounded in luck. We explore how this perspective challenges traditional notions of desert and responsibility, making a powerful case for why our justice system should focus on rehabilitation rather than retribution. Don't miss this thought-provoking conversation about free will, moral responsibility, and the role of chance in shaping human behavior.\n\n0:00 Intro \n1:40 Why Philosophyof Luck \n3:20 What is Luck Pilling \n7:00 Main views on Luck \n32:40 The Just World Illusion \n49:30 Political Consequences \n1:07:00 Audience Q&A\n\nAarons Podcast can be found here: https://www.voidpod.com/podcasts \n\n---- \nSupport the channel by becoming a Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nAll of my links can be found here: https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \nOne-off PayPal donations welcome -  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT",

    "description": "Join us as we delve into the 2024 UK General Election and the controversial narratives pushed by popular right-wing podcast, Triggernometry. Despite Nigel Farage and Reform UK's apparent defeat, Triggernometry claims a secret silent majority and positions Reform UK's loss as a hidden victory. In this video, we dissect these revisionist explanations, explore the concept of the 'silent majority,' and analyze whether there’s any truth to the claims that only Reform UK has the real solutions.

    "description": "0:00 Hungary \n1:27 Digital Gnosis tries to Call In\n\nIn this thought-provoking video, we delve into a surprising controversy surrounding philosopher and free speech advocate, Peter Boghossian. Known for his staunch defense of open dialogue and free expression, Boghossian finds himself at the center of a contradiction when he bans a critic from his platform.\n\nThe video examines the incident where Boghossian, who has long championed the importance of free speech and critical discussion, takes a seemingly contradictory stance by silencing a dissenting voice. Through a detailed analysis, we explore the context of the criticism, Boghossian's response, and the broader implications for free speech advocacy.\n\nJoin us as we unpack this complex situation, featuring clips of Boghossian's previous speeches on the importance of dialogue, alongside the moments leading up to and following the ban. We also include perspectives from free speech experts and commentators to provide a well-rounded view of the controversy.\n\nIs this a case of justified moderation, or does it expose a deeper inconsistency in the application of free speech principles? Watch now to form your own opinion on this contentious issue.\n\n🔔 Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more videos exploring critical issues in philosophy, free speech, and public discourse!\n\n---- \nSupport the channel by becoming a Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nAll of my links can be found here: https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \nOne-off PayPal donations welcome -  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT",

    "title": "Rishi Sunak's DEVASTATING Question | Unveiling the Rhetorical Power of 'What is a Woman?'",
    "description": "In a recent Prime Minister's Questions session, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sparked controversy with a remark challenging his opponent's ability to define what constitutes a woman. This incident occurred on a day when the mother of Briana Ghey, a 16-year-old transgender girl who was tragically murdered, was present in Parliament. Justice Yip, in sentencing, noted that Ghey's transgender identity was a factor in the motive for her murder. Ghey's mother's presence underscored the gravity of the social and political issues entwined with her daughter's death, yet Sunak's comment seemed to exploit transgender issues for political gain.\n\nThis video aims to dissect the rhetorical significance of asking \"what is a woman?\" within the context of the trans-rights debate. While setting aside the moral and political implications of Sunak's statement, the focus here is on elucidating the role this question plays rhetorically and how it's not the conclusive argument some believe it to be.\n\nThe video distinguishes between two uses of asking for definitions: legitimate uncertainty and rhetorical debate framing. Legitimate uncertainty involves seeking clarity to understand differing perspectives without resorting to simplistic gotcha moments. On the other hand, rhetorical debate framing often assumes essentialism and prescriptivism, leading to stalemates rather than productive dialogue.\n\nViewers are advised to approach discussions by aiming for clarity rather than attempting to score points. Engaging in dialogue about how words are actually used in everyday language can lead to more fruitful exchanges. Additionally, recognizing that disagreements often stem from differing worldviews rather than incorrect definitions can facilitate progress in discussions.\n\nBy unpacking the linguistic nuances surrounding the question \"what is a woman?\", this video provides insights into navigating the complexities of the trans-rights debate with empathy and understanding.\n\n0:00 Opening Monologue & Sunak \n2:29 Legimate Questions of Definitions \n5:00 Rhetorically Asking for Definitions\n\n\n---- \nSupport the channel by becoming a Patron: https://patreon.com/digitalgnosis \nAll of my links can be found here: https://linktr.ee/digitalgnosis \nOne-off PayPal donations welcome -  https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL \nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/9G7hKW5QMT",

    "description": "In this episode James and Nathan take on the work of Oxford Christian Philosophy Richard Swinburne in his book \"Is There a God?\" \n\nJames' Channel: @JamesFodor \n\nSwinburne's Assumptions offered without justification: \n1. A basic action is one which a person does intentionally just like that and not by doing any other intentional action.\n2. Free agents require regular laws to make choices.\n3. Infinity is simpler than any finite number.\n4. A perfectly free person will inevitably do what he believes to be (overall) the best action and never do what he believes to be an (overall) bad action.\n5. Desires are a limitation or restriction on freedom.\n6. We have an obligation to do favours for those who provide a great benefit to us.\n7. Creating free agents is good.\n8. It is intrinsically good for God to allow us to learn and grow in the world.\n9. Beauty is a good thing, even if no one observes it.\n10. God has a reason to create animals who don’t have free will. \n11. It is good for God to create embodied life?\n12. Every object has some essential properties and some accidental properties.\n13. In discussing the laws of nature, what scientists are discussing are the powers and liabilities of innumerable particular substances.\n\nTimestamps (thanks @svezhiepyatki ) \n\n0:00 Countdown\n0:27 Some housekeeping\n4:45 Nathan's preliminary remarks\n8:04 James' preliminary remarks\n13:40 \"Naturalists can't explain x\"\n15:09 \"Is There A God?\" as a response to J.

    "description": "Greg gained his first graduate degree at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome (1988) before returning to New Zealand, where he completed PhD degrees in both Biblical Studies (1995) and Philosophy (2007).\n\nHe taught for some years in Theology and Religion, as well as in Philosophy. In 2010 he obtained a joint appointment, working across the two Departments.\n\nGreg teaches Phil 229/329 (Philosophy of Religion), as well as Rels 217/317 (Religion, Science, and Magic) and Rels 225/325 (Science, Religion, and Knowledge).\n\nHis research focuses on the interaction between scientific modes of thought and those characteristic of religion. This has given rise to two books, one on the historical Jesus debate and another on the possibility of theistic explanations (explanations that appeal to a divine agent).\n\nGreg has a new book, just published, entitled Galileo and the Conflict between Religion and Science. This offers a new defence of the 'warfare thesis', arguing that religious and scientific communities exhibit very different attitudes to knowledge, so that conflicts between the two are practically inevitable.\n\n---- \nSupport Digital Gnosis by becoming a Patron: https://bit.ly/2sTITYQ\nOne-off donations via PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=Q7SGRS5855UEL\nJoin the Discord server for after show chats: https://discord.gg/qjrUsTa\nWriting        https://nathanormond.wordpress.com\nTwitter        https://twitter.com/nath_ormond\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/nathanormond_96/\nTwitch        https://www.twitch.tv/digitalgnosis\nGood reads: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107765445-nathan-ormond\nAmazon Books Wish List: https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/3AP2WCT13J6H?ref_=wl_share\n\nYou can also donate in crypto-currency:\nDonate in Bitcoin: 39DN9rmq2zmfRFt5XgMZQtjg3RM5xH6dLE\nDonate in Eth: 0x5167332088E4b03f8974F0f71d50f5C2Ec49664C\n-----\nLogo & Design: \nThank you to Rahul Roy (ryrahul666[AT]gmail[DOT]com) for the logo\nNathan Watson (nathanwatson0232[AT]gmail[DOT]com) for the banner art-work. \nFrancois deNysschen francois[AT]prehistoricproductions[DOT]ca for the awesome intro/outtro videos!\n\nAll are available for work at these email addresses!",

    "description": "In this episode Nathan and James take a look at Dr. William Lane Craigs most famous argument for the existence of God - The Kalam Cosmological Argument.\n\n0:00:00 Introduction to the episode\n0:04:16 Overview of the argument\n0:12:59 Why respond to this argument? \n0:25:07 Intro to the Philosophy of Time\n0:34:12 A-Theory in Craigs argument\n1:43:00 Philosophy of Infinity\n2:27:21 Hilberts Hotel\n2:57:48 Arguing from epistemic conceivability to metaphysical possibility\n3:06:54 Dr Alex Malpass discusses his debate with Craig\n4:23:38 Dr Malpass on the Grim Reaper Paradox\n4:44:18 Dr Malpass on an actual infinite for theists\n5:08:01 Dr Malpass on Gods relation to time\n5:13:00 Tenseless theory of time\n5:23:37 Personality and the sociology of apologetics?\n5:39:20 What would make you a theist?\n5:46:45 How the physics of cosmology is misrepresented\n6:20:20 A deep dive into physics with James Fodor!\n7:11:22 Do universes begin to exist like other things?\n7:27:35 Is it likely that the cause is a disembodied mind?\n8:03:34 Closing remarks\n\nQuestions for Craig:\n\n1. Is it the first or second premise of the Kalam that is dependent on the tensed theory of time?\n\n2. How can science support the beginning of the universe if general relativity must be interpreted non-realistically to avoid contradicting presentism?\n\n3. What is present? How can it be that you can bring things into being by referring to them?\n\n4. What does it mean for something to be absurd? What can we infer from something being absurd?\n\n5. Why does the impossibility of subtraction of infinite quantities have to do with actual infinities, when any actual case involves the relative complement of an initial set?\n\n6. What is the number of future events that will occur? How can it not be Aleph-0?\n\n7. Why do you talk about counting down from infinity, which counting involves a starting point and the infinite universe would have no starting point?\n\n8. How is the Grim Reaper paradox not a straightforward logical contradiction?\n\n9. How can you appeal to the BVG and other general relativistic theorems when you believe that time is tensed, and that 4D Minkowski space should not be interpreted realistically?\n\n10. How do you defend your misrepresentation of the scope of the papers you cite about the metastability and entropy concerns about models that avoid the BVG theorem?\n\n11. Why can’t the universe just begin without a cause?\n\n12. If causes are relationships between spatio-temporal events, why would the universe (which is not a spatio-temporal event) need a cause?\n\n13. How do we know that abstract objects and personal minds are the only possible non-material entities that could have created the universe?\n\n14. Why doesn’t an agent’s act of exercising its causal powers require a cause?\n\n15. Why can’t a non-personal, timeless cause bring about a temporal effect?\n\nLinks to James Fodor:\nBlog: https://thegodlesstheist.com/\nPodcast: http://fods12.podbean.com/\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFods12\nJames' Book on Amazon (Unreasonable Faith) is very reasonably priced! https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unreasonable-Faith-William-Overstates-Christianity-ebook/dp/B07DNY8PJF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=unreasonable+faith&qid=1607252869&sr=8-1\n\nLinks to Dr Malpass:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNQ8-4-ydMyDLC21TENHCrw\n\nPapers mentioned in video: \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0110012\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3232\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08878\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5513\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/\n\nVideos Reviewed:\nKalam Overview - \nhttps://youtu.be/zB3nXxXWQd0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CulBuMCLg0\n\nWhy Address this?\nhttps://youtu.be/PLirLSAHAfY\nhttps://youtu.be/Hyu2KsLWreA\n\nTime - \nhttps://youtu.be/5AVclZc9E_Q\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4Wx18K9jUE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4s2AiZP8Vw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF_r_zdDFro\n\nInfinities - \nhttps://youtu.be/pwVs8J5tFhc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ-_Ig5YF-4&t=1634s\n\nMalpass Debate - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWo9qU2dhpQ\n\nThermodynamics-\nhttps://youtu.be/atnk5VBVd-g\n\nCosmology-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ58aloF7Bc\nhttps://youtu.be/OvhxrKF2wEo\n\nCausal Principle- \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxU4ND8HdYg\n\nMind-\nhttps://youtu.be/1SZWInkDIVI\nhttps://youtu.be/pO3mryntXwo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqzqEFw5_1c\nhttps://youtu.be/jZC8EfViQ0M\n\nHumean Objections- \nhttps://youtu.be/O1vM0-dTddw",

Dawkins, rather than actually engaging in an honest discussion simply asserts that you need God for anything... if you're thinking, if you're speaking, if you exist, he offers no arguments for why he thinks this and simply presupposes it. He then rejects any alternative view you offer because he presupposes something different. He works by muting people who disagree with him, \"disagreement\" = \"trolling\", he cannot handle losing so just mutes people and trash talks them and he calls people disgusting names which, he would never do in real life, being a middle aged man permanently glued to discord arguing with 13 year olds... I thought I would have a go playing his weird little game in his Stanford Prison Experiment Discord server.",

    "description": "2015 Reprint of 1957 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. \"Active Listening\", first developed by Rogers and Farson, is a therapeutic technique designed to promote positive change in the client. Active listening is a communication technique used in counselling, training and conflict resolution, which requires the listener to feed back what they hear to the speaker, by way of re-stating or paraphrasing what they have heard in their own words, to confirm what they have heard and moreover, to confirm the understanding of both parties. It continues to have a lasting influence to this day.",
