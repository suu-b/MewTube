    "description": "TIME STAMPS\n0:00-1:40 Intro\n1:40-4:40 Defining Terms\n4:40- 8:40 Steelman Of Argument\n8:55 Objection 1: assumption of the necessity condition\n13:46 Objection 2- assumption that every instance of suffering must serve a morally justifiable role in order to be justified\n16:17 Objection 3- assumption that God lacks overriding reasons to permit suffering\n19:21 Objection 4- assumption that the existence of pro toto (evils that all things considered ought not happen) because they are not necessary for a greater good\n24:48 Objection 5- assumption that a morally perfect God would create a perfect world from the onset \n29:23 Objection 6- failure to disambiguate intrinsic and instrumental value \n33:32 Objection 7- equivocation on the term evil\n41:08- 45.54 summary/conclusion\n\nIf an all-powerful, all-good God exists, why does He allow suffering? This age-old question, often known as “the problem of evil,” has been debated by scholars, skeptics, and believers alike. Today, we’re examining this question from a fresh perspective, challenging the assumptions embedded within traditional arguments against the existence of God due to the presence of evil.\n\nWe’ll break down the core assumptions about necessity, the nature of intrinsic value, and the flexibility within theistic frameworks to allow for instrumental and ultimately defeasible evils. By carefully dissecting these assumptions, I’ll show why the classical theistic view offers a robust and nuanced response to these objections, one that accounts for the possibility of growth, relational dynamics, and even an eschatological vision where all suffering is ultimately redeemed.\n\nJoin me as we uncover why the problem of evil, when examined closely, may not be as insurmountable as it seems.\n\nSupport Our Mission\nAt Exploring Reality, our mission's heartbeat is fueled by individuals like you.

    "description": "In this video, I’m responding to a heartfelt series of reasons someone shared for why they’re no longer a Christian. These kinds of reflections are deeply personal and often touch on issues that many people struggle with—questions about God’s hiddenness, the doctrine of hell, apparent contradictions, and much more.\n\nMy aim here isn’t to offer quick fixes or dismiss the sincerity of these questions. Instead, I want to walk through each concern thoughtfully, showing that Christian thinkers have wrestled with these same issues throughout history and that there are nuanced, substantial answers within the Christian tradition. From understanding the purpose behind divine hiddenness to grappling with biblical ethics and the nature of hell, I hope to shed light on how faith can coexist with deep inquiry.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with similar questions, or if you’re curious about how Christians respond to tough critiques of their faith, I invite you to explore these topics with an open mind. This video isn’t about forcing anyone back into belief; it’s about showing that the Christian faith has depth, resilience, and a rich tradition of engaging with tough questions.\n\n#Deconstruction #FaithJourney #ChristianityExplained #Apologetics #FaithAndDoubt #DivineHiddenness #BiblicalEthics #DoctrineOfHell #ChristianResponses",

    "description": "In this video, we explore a fresh perspective on Genesis 3:16, often viewed as the moment God curses women with painful childbirth. Scholars Christine Curley and Brian Peterson propose a different interpretation: that the verse speaks not to physical pain but to deep emotional grief and relational struggles tied to conception and fertility. By examining the original Hebrew terms, itsabon (sorrow) and herayon (conception), and literary devices within the text, we uncover how Genesis 3:16 may address a broader experience of emotional turmoil in a fallen world. Join us as we examine how this reinterpretation resonates with modern experiences of infertility and relational challenges, revealing a timeless message of shared human grief and struggle.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nAt Exploring Reality, our mission's heartbeat is fueled by individuals like you.

    "description": "In this video, we dive deep into one of the most profound mysteries of Christianity: How Jesus' death on the cross is the ultimate proof of His divinity. Through biblical analysis and historical context, we'll explore the crucifixion as more than just a tragic event—it’s the enthronement of Jesus as King, a cosmic victory over death, and the final fulfillment of divine prophecy.\n\nWe’ll break down how the Gospel of Mark, ancient apocalyptic literature, and the combat myth traditions all point toward Jesus’ kingship being revealed through His death and resurrection. The crucifixion is not defeat—it’s where Jesus conquers death itself, making His claim to divinity undeniable.\n\nJoin me as we explore:\n\n- Why Jesus’ death was essential for proving He is God\n- How His crucifixion was both His defeat and His victory\n- The ancient myths and scriptures that foreshadowed His triumph over death\n- What this means for us today, and how it confirms the truth of Christianity\n\nThis is more than a historical recounting—it’s an exploration of the deep theological implications that affirm Jesus as God. Whether you're a skeptic, a believer, or simply curious, this video will shed new light on the power of the crucifixion.\n___________________________________________________\nAt Exploring Reality, our mission is fueled by individuals like you.

    "description": "Join us for an intellectually stimulating and thought-provoking YouTube live stream as we delve into the recent appearance of renowned philosopher and author, Stephen Meyer, on the widely acclaimed Joe Rogan Podcast. We are thrilled to have esteemed guests Braxton Hunter and Richard Suttles join us for this insightful discussion!\r\n\r\nStephen Meyer is a leading figure in the fields of philosophy and intelligent design, known for his groundbreaking work on the origin of life and the universe. Recently, he graced the Joe Rogan Podcast with his presence, sharing his perspectives on life's most profound questions and the relationship between science and philosophy.\r\n\r\nBraxton - Dr. Braxton Hunter is the president of Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary in Evansville, Indiana. He is the former president of the Conference of Southern Baptist Evangelists. As professor of apologetics , Dr. Hunter is passionate about the defense of the Christian faith in a skeptical world.\r\n\r\nIn addition to conducting evangelistic apologetics events, he has pastored two churches. He has engaged in several live, moderated, academic debates on theological issues and the evidence for the truth of Christianity with such notables as Matt Dillahunty (of the Atheist Experience), and Dan Barker (President of the Freedom From Religion Foundation). \r\n\r\nHe holds a B.A. in expository preaching, an M.A. in Theology, a Ph.D. in Christian Apologetics from Trinity College and Seminary, and a DMin from Luther Rice Seminary, in Lithonia, GA. \r\n\r\nBraxton's YT -    / @braxtonhunter  \r\n\r\nBraxton's website - http://www.braxtonhunter.com/about\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard - The Faithiest Atheist (Richard) works in the counter-terrorism field. He specializes in the cognitive processes people go through when radicalized to the point of dehumanizing other groups. His “ministry” (if you can call it that) is not to de-convert Christians, but for encouraging more understanding between opposing groups. \r\n\r\nHe has one postgraduate degree in cognitive communication and another in international relations. \r\n\r\nYou can find him on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/FaithiestAth...\r\n, and on YouTube at    / @faithiestatheist...  \r\n\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\nExploring Reality relies on people like you to operate.

We are thrilled to have esteemed guests Braxton Hunter and Richard Suttles join us for this insightful discussion!\r\n\r\nStephen Meyer is a leading figure in the fields of philosophy and intelligent design, known for his groundbreaking work on the origin of life and the universe. Recently, he graced the Joe Rogan Podcast with his presence, sharing his perspectives on life's most profound questions and the relationship between science and philosophy.\r\n\r\nBraxton - Dr. Braxton Hunter is the president of Trinity College of the Bible and Theological Seminary in Evansville, Indiana. He is the former president of the Conference of Southern Baptist Evangelists. As professor of apologetics , Dr. Hunter is passionate about the defense of the Christian faith in a skeptical world.\r\n\r\nIn addition to conducting evangelistic apologetics events, he has pastored two churches. He has engaged in several live, moderated, academic debates on theological issues and the evidence for the truth of Christianity with such notables as Matt Dillahunty (of the Atheist Experience), and Dan Barker (President of the Freedom From Religion Foundation). \r\n\r\nHe holds a B.A. in expository preaching, an M.A. in Theology, a Ph.D. in Christian Apologetics from Trinity College and Seminary, and a DMin from Luther Rice Seminary, in Lithonia, GA. \r\n\r\nBraxton's YT - https://www.youtube.com/@BraxtonHunter\r\n\r\nBraxton's website - http://www.braxtonhunter.com/about\r\n\r\nRichard - The Faithiest Atheist (Richard) works in the counter-terrorism field.

    "title": "Decoding Jesus' Prophecy: Why Dating the Gospels After 70 AD is not Necessary!",
    "description": "In this video, we delve into one of the most intriguing prophecies made by Jesus in the New Testament - the prediction of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. While some scholars argue that this prophecy requires us to date the Gospels after the temple's destruction in 70 AD, we explore alternative explanations that suggest this is not necessarily the case. By examining the historical and textual evidence, we'll uncover compelling reasons why the dating of the Gospels is a complex issue that cannot be resolved solely through the interpretation of Jesus' prophecy.

This is one of them. \n\n\nLink to his video: https://youtube.com/shorts/oUnBQefKGaE?feature=share\n\n\n\"Usually even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about predictable eclipses of the un and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense of these topics; and we should prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wise brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obvious untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion.\" -St. Augustine of Hippo, De Genesi ad Litteram I.xix.39\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you're interested in having apologetics in your church, please email me at exploringreality610@gmail.com\n\nThis is a non-profit, donation based endeavor, if you find value in my work please consider becoming a financial supporter so I can do this full time. \n\nDonate links....\n\nParent Ministry: https://forerunnersofamerica.com/donate/\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/exploringreal...\n\n\n#apologetics \n#atheist \n#history",
