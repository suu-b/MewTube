    "description": "If you're doubting your faith, you're in the right place because Truth Snack journeys with doubting Christians toward confident faith.\n\nWe're kicking off Season 2 by talking Natalie, someone I met this summer. We were working at a summer camp and she told me she was raised in a church that taught jewellery, make-up, and sports were all wrong. Our activities at camp that day happened to be... making bracelets, face-painting, and football!\n\nI couldn't help but wonder how Natalie was able to question so much of what she was raised to believe while holding onto faith in Jesus. She calls her process \"disentangling,\" and her minister, Berean Holiness, helps others do the same. Enjoy the conversation!\n\nFind out more about Natalie's work at www.BereanHoliness.com.\nAs always, if you have something to add, please reach out at Matt@TruthSnack.ca\n\n\nSend us a text (https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2102306/open_sms) \n\n\nSupport the show (https://preparedtoanswer.org/donate/doubters-welcome)",

    "description": "How do we make sense of divine destruction in the Bible? What distortions do we bring to the Bible that make it hard to understand? If the Bible is so complicated, why follow Jesus?\n\n\nIn this episode I talk with my friend Jonny who is studying the Old Testament in pursuit of a PhD. In particular, he’s studying stories of divine destruction in the Old Testament— that’s right, he’s chosen to study the uncomfortable stories that can make us question God's goodness.\n\nJonny's perspective was insightful and challenging. I have no doubt this chat some wisdom to offer you on your journey through doubt.

For years as a Bible student and even as a PASTOR I struggled to read the Bible consistently.

    "description": "Like most people, I've been doing a lot of thinking about what it takes to live in a just, free, and peaceful world. A recent, eye-opening experience changed my perspective in a meaningful way!\n\nIn order to keep this video focused and streamlined I was not able to speak at length on my ontological beliefs regarding human rights. I believe that all moral obligations and 'goodness' (whether affirmed by documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or not) find their source in the perfect character of God, can be known through the word of God, and are perfectly displayed by Jesus Christ. While I personally believe that documents like The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms do provide objectively moral principles, the conversation about the moral nature of 'Human Rights' must be ongoing.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the deep philosophical work it takes to think clearly on this topic. It certainly isn't easy.
