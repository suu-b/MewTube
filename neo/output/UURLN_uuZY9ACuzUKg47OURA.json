    "title": "Modal Concepts and Possible Worlds",
    "description": "In this video I explain different modal concepts, such as possible and impossible, necessary and contingent; different types of modality, such logical, metaphysical, and nomological; and the difference between de dicto and de re modality. I also illustrate how these different concepts can be illustrated by using possible worlds.",

The video's content also outlines, implicitly, a number of different accounts that philosophers give when thinking about ordinary objects.\n\nFor more online resources on this check out the articles on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy below:\n\nhttps://www.iep.utm.edu/mat-comp/\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ordinary-objects/",

    "title": "The Knowledge Argument - Mary's Room",
    "description": "In this video I set out the Knowledge Argument against Physicalism about mental phenomena and then outline some responses that physicalists have given to the argument. This argument is also known as 'May in the black-and-white room', 'Mary the super-scientist', or 'Black and White Mary'.\n\nSomething I don't mention in the video, since it's not that important to the argument itself, is that Frank Jackson changed his mind later in life about the argument, and now thinks it's unsuccessful (I'll leave some references below). But Howard Robinson, who I also mentioned in the video, thinks Jackson was wrong to do so (again, see reference below).\n\nIf you want to learn more about the argument in general, then check out these entries on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nhttps://www.iep.utm.edu/know-arg/\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/\n\n\n\nFor Jackson changing his mind:\nJackson, F.

    "title": "The Problems of Evil",
    "description": "In this video I outline some of the different problems of evil which have been given to argue against theism.\n\nBelow are some helpful references which will further elaborate on some of the problems of evil that I outline .\n\nFor the logical problem of evil see J. L. Mackie’s book: The Miracle of Theism. \nMore recently Graham Oppy has given arguments from evil in this form: ‘Arguments from Moral Evil’, International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 56:59-87 (2004)\n\nFor evidential arguments from evil see: W. L. Rowe ‘The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism’, American Philosophical Quarterly 16:335-341 (1979)\n\nFor what I call, probabilistic comparison arguments from evil see: P. Draper ‘Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists’, Nous 23:331-350 (1989)\nM. A. Benton, J. Hawthorne, & Y. Isaacs ‘Evil and Evidence’, Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion 7:1-31 (2016)\n\nRegarding abductive arguments from evil, whilst I know of no one who explicitly gives this form of argument when thinking about the problem of evil, see Oppy’s book: The Best Argument Against God, for more on this type of approach to arguments in Philosophy of Religion more generally.\n\nOn horrendous evils see Marylin McCord Adams’s book: Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God.\n\nFinally, for the modal problem of evil, check out Brian Leftow’s book: God and Necessity, pages 120-131.",

    "title": "How does the Bayesian Bar relate to Bayes Theorem?",
    "description": "In this video I explain how the Bayesian Bar relates to Bayes Theorem. If you haven't already done so, I recommend you first watch the video 'How to Think About Probability Visually - The Bayesian Bar' first, as it will help you to understand this one. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNQeOJoeiW0&t=9s\n\nThis video employs as an example a probabilistic version of the Fine-Tuning argument for Theism. If you want to learn more about this argument, as I don't really discuss it, then have a look at two great papers by John Hawthorne and Yoaav Isaacs:\n\nFine-Tuning Fine-Tuning - \nhttps://www.yoaavisaacs.com/uploads/6/9/2/0/69204575/ms_for_fine-tuning_fine-tuning.pdf\n\nMisapprehensions About the Fine-Tuning Argument - \nhttps://www.yoaavisaacs.com/uploads/6/9/2/0/69204575/misapprehensions_about_fine-tuning-1.doc.pdf",

Unfortunately the software I use to create these videos only had a male dancer that was fit for purpose. Slightly annoying! So if you know the paper well then think of Jim as Jane instead!",

    "title": "How to Think About Probability Visually - The Bayesian Bar",
    "description": "In this video I share with you a useful visual tool that I learned from the philosopher John Hawthorne for thinking about probabilistic reasoning, called the Bayesian Bar. This video provides an introduction to the bar and in another video, linked below, I'll show you how the bar relates to Bayes Theorem.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zlaFnYqGYo\n\nYou might also find it helpful to look at a short article I have written that introduces the Bayesian Bar - \nhttps://www.academia.edu/41820082/Introducing_Bayesianism_Through_The_Bayesian_Bar\n\nAnd here are two video links of John Hawthorne talking about and making use of the Bayesian Bar - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gl_w1yMgCg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItV-gPtxtL0\n\n\nThis is not a video on the problem of evil. But if you want to learn about the way that evil can be thought of as evidence against theism that parallels what I say here, then have a look at the paper 'Evil and Evidence' by Matthew A. Benton, John Hawthorne, & Yoaav Isaacs. You can find a draft of their paper here - https://philpapers.org/archive/BENEAE-5.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3pN7c16gi4o5QKFlxPx1zoZbqU2SttzU0rgAGjZ6uxdTffv1vqxpHCzFw\n\nPaul Draper's work is also another place where you can read about how evil is evidence against theism that mirrors what I say here.",
